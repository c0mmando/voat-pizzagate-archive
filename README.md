## Hosting via GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is an easy way to host static content online. Follow these steps to deploy your archive:

1. **Push Your Repository to GitHub**

   Ensure your repository is available on GitHub under the username `c0mmando` (if you haven't done so already):

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of voat-pizzagate-archive"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/c0mmando/voat-pizzagate-archive.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**

   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Settings**.
   - Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch (e.g., `main`) and choose the folder (typically `/ (root)` if your `index.html` is at the root).
   - Click **Save**.
   - GitHub Pages will provide you with a URL where your site is hosted (typically `https://c0mmando.github.io/voat-pizzagate-archive/`).

3. **Adding a CNAME (Custom Domain)**

   If you wish to use a custom domain:
   
   - Create a file named `CNAME` (with no file extension) in the root of your repository.
   - Add your custom domain (for example, `www.example.com`) on a single line in that file.
   - Commit and push the `CNAME` file:
     
     ```bash
     git add CNAME
     git commit -m "Add CNAME for custom domain"
     git push
     ```
     
   - Configure your DNS settings to point your custom domain to GitHub Pages.  
     For more details, refer to GitHub’s guide on [configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

## Hosting via nginx

To host the archive using nginx on your own server, follow these steps:

1. **Install nginx**

   On Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

   On CentOS/RHEL:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install epel-release
   sudo yum install nginx
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository onto Your Server**

   Use git clone to download the latest version on your server:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   sudo git clone https://github.com/c0mmando/voat-pizzagate-archive.git
   ```

3. **Configure nginx**

   Create a new configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/voat-pizzagate-archive`):

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your_domain_or_ip;

       root /var/www/html/voat-pizzagate-archive;
       index index.html;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `your_domain_or_ip` with your actual domain or server IP.

4. **Enable the Configuration**

   Create a symbolic link to enable the site:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/voat-pizzagate-archive /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

5. **Restart nginx**

   Apply your changes by restarting nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Access Your Archive**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain_or_ip` (or your configured domain) to view the archive.

## Offline Viewing Instructions

If you prefer to view the archive offline (e.g., without a web server), you can do so by simply opening the local files directly in your web browser:

1. **Using a File Explorer:**

   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
   - Open the `index.html` file (by double-clicking or right-clicking and selecting your preferred browser).

2. **From the Command Line:**

   If you're using a local HTTP server (such as Python’s built-in one) for a more seamless navigation experience, you can start one in the repository root:

   For Python 3:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/voat-pizzagate-archive
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

   For Python 2:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/voat-pizzagate-archive
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to navigate the archive as if it were hosted on a web server.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure file permissions allow nginx (or your local HTTP server) to read the archive files.
- Changes to GitHub Pages may take a short while to propagate.
- Before serving the archive publicly, review any legal or privacy considerations regarding its content.
- Change hardcoded metatags and SEO before hosting your own mirror (optional).

This README provides instructions for downloading, cloning, hosting (via GitHub Pages or nginx), and viewing the /v/pizzagate archive offline. If you have any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the respective hosting platform's documentation.
