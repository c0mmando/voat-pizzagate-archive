<p>I want to give everyone the head\'s up, TrineDay Publishing, the same company that published Nick Bryant\'s book about the Franklin Scandal, and published Henry Vinson and Nick Bryants\'  &quot;Confessions of a DC Madam,&quot; will soon be releasing a book by purported Monarch mind control survivor Juliette Engel, MD. <strong>The name of the book is &quot;Sparky- Surviving Sex Magick,&quot; and is scheduled for release in March this year (You can pre-order the book <a href="http://www.trineday.com/paypal_store/product_pages/9781634242950-SPARKY/index.html">here</a>).</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, TrineDay Publishing (run by publisher Kris Millegan out of Eugene OR) has a had a really solid track record publishing some very well-researched and well-reported books regarding the issues of child sex trafficking and pedophilia, including Nick Bryant\'s books, and also Dr. Lori Handrahan\'s <a href="http://www.trineday.com/paypal_store/product_pages/9781634241595-Epidemic/index.html">&quot;Epidemic- America\'s Trade in Child Rape,&quot;</a> about America\'s child pornography and child sexual violence epidemic, which I believe is another well-researched book. </p>
<p>I know that the first-hand accounts of mind control and ritual abuse survivors can often be problematic, in terms of trying to figure out the validity of survivors claims. Obviously this is not meant as any kind of  insult whatsoever to the survivor community, just speaking to the often difficult reality of trying to discern truth when it comes to this kind of topic. However, again TrineDay has had a real solid track record shining some light on child sex trafficking scandals, especially with Nick Bryant\'s &quot;The Franklin Scandal.&quot; In addition, Dr. Engel appears to have an extensive background herself combating child sex trafficking, according to her bio, for 10 years she ran an anti-child trafficking organization in Moscow, Russia called the &quot;Angel Coalition.&quot; So I do think Juliettte Engel\'s story is very much worth reading and researching amongst this community.</p>
<p>Here is the Juliette Engel\'s own bio, on the TrineDay website:</p>
<p>&quot;In the words of the author: <strong>I was born into a family of intelligence operatives and initiated into the CIA\'s newly established Monarch program in 1955 at the age of six.</strong> My childhood was defined by secrets as I struggled to stay alive in an illegal program of mind control and experimentation that had been signed into existence by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles in 1953. Amnesia—traumatic and drug induced—was part of the program of creating multiple identities. As a child, that meant living as different personas as I was moved from place to place, changing schools, making new friends. At age ten, I was selected for Sex Magick because I was tall, smart, and pretty. They were training me to be a sexual spy—a Vril girl, they said. They taught me the art of seduction as well as physics, Ariosophy, cybernetics, and selective genocide. I was considered gifted at remote viewing, having what they called PSI, and was sent to Stanford Research Institute for training.</p>
<p>I studied Russian history at the Hoover Institution with Dr. Alexander Kerensky, the first president of Soviet Russia while attending Palo Alto High School across the street. I was being programmed for Russia. In 1966, at the age of seventeen, I escaped from a camp in Big Sur. My life as a free person began on the first day of university. I had no memories before of my life before then and kept it that way through college, medical school, internship, and residency. My amnesia did not impede my work as a radiologist or mother. Once my children were grown, I sold my medical practice and started a foundation in Russia. For ten years I ran the Angel Coalition in Moscow, an underground railroad that rescued and repatriated child sex-trafficking survivors. In 2012, I attended a border security conference in Imperial Beach on the Mexican border. It was there on the briny wetlands of California that the childhood memories returned in a powerful surge. The chronology of my life and the details of my forgotten past became clear to me. <strong>The more I worked over the following years to research and verify what I remembered, the bigger the story became. —80 American universities, colleges, hospitals, plus 185 private contractors had engaged in 149 separate CIA-funded sub-projects involving mind control experimentation on children like me, including forced administration of mind-altering drugs (particularly LSD), hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, sexual abuse, and torture. I had to write this story.</strong> <strong>So, I began at the beginning when I was six years old on the day my father sold me.</strong> </p>

            Juliette Engel is also a fiction writer.  She went to Russia in 1990 and started Miramed after seeing the conditions under which Russian women were giving birth and having abortions. I don't know how Miramed morphed into an organisation helping trafficked women.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below is Miramed's logo--a heart within a heart.  When I click on the link for its website I'm taken to some articles, the first of which is by Opendemocracy (a George Soros org).

             Just a little analysis of Juliette Engel's Web site should cause one to take notice of the layout and numerous misspellings. These would leave the impression that it was likely put together by a single inexperienced individual using GoDaddy GoCentral Website Builder.
            </p>
            <p>
             This would be why there are five generic sections at the bottom containing descriptions of what the Web site owner should put there (including the phrase
             <em>
              Customers have questions, you have answers
             </em>
             under the
             <em>
              Display their FAQs
             </em>
             section).
            </p>
            <p>
             The MiraMed angle does look worthy of some digging. But I don't know where you are 'clicking on the link for its website', because its website has been offline for quite some time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the last captured snapshot archive of the miramed dot org site before it expired:

            Great data.

            I look forward to reading her book.

           <p>
            For those unfamiliar - and an excellent intro, perhaps - the famous Greenbaum Speech from 1992 (D.C. Hammond) provides a bit of the scope of this nationwide program.
           </p>
           <p>
            For people wishing to see/hear with their own eyes and ears just how these experiences impact victims, the online interviews of Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner (check out his death), and Greg Bucceroni offer up some soul wrenching glimpses into this dark world.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the serious serious, following up with  Cathy O'Brien, Brice Taylor, Fiona Barnett, and - more recently - Anneke Lucas - one will find an unbroken narrative of the most unspeakable, CONSISTENT  and cross reinforcing tales of the most diaboloical nature imaginable.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I am merely an anonymous poster to you all, I can personally vouch for that Repressed Memory phenomena as middle age events sparked an incomplete recovery of serious events that occurred to me decades earlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can only imagine the impact that sustained, purposeful, horrific trauma might cause to these young minds/bodies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please ... please ... be skeptical.
           </p>
           <p>
            The perps behind these monstrosities would like nothing better than for these brave individuals to be ridiculed and dismissed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get that.

            At the same time, I would humbly ask you to not simply 'walk away' as you change computer screens, ponder other pressing items du jour, get on with your life.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is YOUR family that - collectively - is being targeted right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The least you/we/all of us are obligated to do as human beings is to reach out with some time, some ongoing effort to ascertain the validity of these abominations.

            . The "Vril," remote viewing, and child trafficking charity elements make me wonder if this lady is disinfo. I feel like we need to give this an "Unverified" flair until we can look at the support for her claims and possibly corroborate them.

            That would be an excellent research project.
