                  Yes I believe it too but we can hurry it along by prayer. Especially the Rosary 📿 Those that believe please pray it as much as you can preferably every day. Others please pray in your own way. The devil hates when we pray.

            Schofield praised Jimmy Savile after he died. That's disconcerting. He also doubted the victim statements by victims who were attacked by Savile in his dressing room. :-/
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile and Schofield knew each other because they both did children's shows at the BBC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Schofield lied when he said he met Matthew when Matthew when he was was 18.
           </p>
           <p>
            They met the first time (it seems) when Matt was 10, and later were in touch via Twitter when Matthew was 15, and also in rl.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-section">
           </h1>
           <p>
            My take on this story is that he groomed the boy, then got him a job as his runner on the This Morning show, became his *mentor' when Matthew was not sure whether he was gay or not, then started sleeping with him.

            I've seen a picture of Scholfield at the 'lovers' school when he was 10. He was apparently sleeping with him by 15. Don't ask me the sauce. It was on a friends kikebook post.
