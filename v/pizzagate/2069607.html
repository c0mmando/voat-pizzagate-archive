            If Assange gives up his source, it will bring Wikileaks down.
           </p>
           <p>
            And about the pardon, doesn't somebody at least have to be charged with something first? People keep saying Assange committed treason against the US, but he isn't even a US citizen.

            Are Assange, Snowden, Hannity, AJ, KIm, etc all just characters in a soap drama to keep us all in suspense and doing nothing to free ourselves from slavery? I mean, how are all these people still so alive, playing off each other like a bunch of second rate actor clowns.
Am I been ultra cynical and paranoid? Na im just speculating... trouble is many good people are been abused and sacrificed and so on..
And we spend so much of our energy on information and joining the dots and making connections and following leads and so on..
Its cleaver, the whole legal system, the corrupt political and police enforcement etc.. its all structured and designed to ultimately work against us.. and we are forced to try and turn things around from within this corrupted biased system.
Surely nothing short of outright refusal to comply with this corrupt system, a revolution is another way? 
But we've become a planet of keyboard warriors.. so wed better use their tools of control against them.. but they are cunning and willing to murder and do anything to stop us succeeding.. we are much nicer.. its be design.. 
I havnt been active on here for months now as ive needed some time out, living in Peru.. 
But I also remember when Assange, Snowden and Kim dotcom were all together in new zealand doing a live internet stream telling the whole world about the problems with the deep state and corruption, and guess what.. local media in New Zealand went into full attack and damage control mode like a well oiled machine. Watching this happen was disturbing.. it was possible to see how every newspaper and tv station was part of  a larger Public Relations machine that used a coordinated attack and denial face to the public. 
So I can see how Assange and co are very much a threat to the power structure.. sure many say its just all a game.. good guys, bad guys.. Maybe this has always been the case throughout history..

            short answer: no, you haven't just been impatient.
            <br/>
            Is this like when Hannity was driving his ratings by proclaiming he's gonna blow the lid off s rich (even up to hours before the purported groundbreaking show) only for sean to back down and get a well earned vacation for a couple of days?

            Maybe he's being investigated himself over his part in the handling of the Clinton email investigation.

            <strong>
             From the linked article:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Strzok headed the FBI's counterespionage division last year and was one of the top officials overseeing the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information while she was secretary of state. He had previously worked on some of the "most secretive investigations in recent years involving Russian and Chinese espionage," according to the New York Times.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rangappa noted that the DOJ's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened an investigation in January into the FBI's handling of the email probe, including former FBI Director James Comey's decision to announce a new inquiry into her email server 11 days before the election. It is not clear whether Strzok, who supervised elements of the email probe, was caught up in the OIG investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The OIG declined to comment. But their website lists the probe as ongoing."

             right, whole thing is crazy. Looks like he and Laufman covered up Hil's crimes for comey, so with Gowdys call for an investigation, maybe he recused or as you say is being investigated himself.   we should keep eyes on Laufman too, how would we know if he quits?

              I thought I read somewhere that Tillerson said WH was riddled with bugs.  one of Muellers' attorneys  had called the WH to ask for any docs on 9/11 that they might have.  I guess they thought someone was eavesdropping on Oval ofc.  Story was not real clear.  So maybe it was him calling and shit hit the fan?

                I wish I could remember where I read it.  It did not say the attorney's name, but that he was part of Mueller's team.  So maybe could be one that left. But the article definitely said called for any 9/11 docs.  Who knows could be fake news! Never know these days.

            Is this why Mueller's top lawyer quit? What a mind game going on. Hannity should be thrashed if he doesn't produce.

            Edit: Story somewhere that Mueller is losing traction, that DNC and others are losing hope he'll do, or find, anything. Duh.

             It really sounds like the lawyer, Peter Strzok, didn't quit but instead was suddenly reassigned to Human Resources.

            </p>
            <p>
             "A former FBI agent who worked with Strzok on and off over several years in the bureau's counterintelligence division said that Strzok's move to HR means he has now been separated from counterintelligence work altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI sometimes parks agents in the human resources department, the agent explained, when they need to be reassigned quickly away from substantive matters and there's no other place to put them."

             "Strzok headed the FBI's counterespionage division and was one of the top officials overseeing the criminal investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information while she was secretary of state."

              very strange. On the surface it sounds like a total demotion to be moved to HR and you'd think he would just quit but  maybe the FBI is planning to fire a lot of people? Or hire them?

               I wonder whether he's become a witness instead of an investigator--and not necessarily in the Russia investigation.  I'm thinking a Hillary investigation.

                if that is the case, Strzok and David Laufman (DOJ) was the ones who interviewed Clinton just before Comey dropped the investigation, the first time.  So who and where is Laufman?

                 Good question.  The only reason we learned about Strzok's move to HR was because of his position on Mueller's team.  Would the public be informed if Laufman was reassigned too?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another possibility is that Strzok has been turned and is throwing Comey, Laufman, et al. under the bus in the investigation of the FBI's handling of the Hillary email investigation.

                  but would he be reassigned to HR in that case (for turning evidence) ? I would think  that he would be kept where he is to quell speculation. My instinct says that HR is a demotion but not bad enough to fire, or if  they want to keep tabs on him. I bet he's literally in the basement now.

                  I'm starting to confuse myself. Here's what we know:

                  <li>
                   1. He is no longer working with Meuller on Russia Hacking.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   2 HR is a most probably a demotion
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   3. He covered up clinton email crimes for Lynch and Comey
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   4. He is possibly being investigated
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   5  He worked with CIA/DOJ Laufman

                   Or HR is a holding place for a person of interest/witness who can't return to regular FBI counterintelligence duties because he would be working directly with other persons of interest/witnesses.  There are many possibilities.  We need more info.

              The reason was not disclosed.  I think this is going to be big volley.  Media won't cover Awan - "not newsworthy".  DWS will be the first big arrest, I predict.  Then they will fucking notice.

              There seems to be some congruence among the Patriot talking head class.

                Yup.  That is exactly what is going to happen.  FASCIST they will scream from every parapet.  And DWS will be the start.  In order to "head things off at the pass" the Deep State is going to go into race war overdrive.  It's one of the last cards they have to play.  Biowar or nuke when they start to get close to the hive.

              Let's hope the wheels don't come off also at this stage of the game. Things are insane and completely unpredictable.

               Popcorn time is an understatement.  I've pulled back into other, more soothing interests.  I still follow.  But I need to take care of myself and family.  I'm watching what's going on.  Nothing will surprise me at this point.  Call it enjoying myself before we all go up in smoke.
