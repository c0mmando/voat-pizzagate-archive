<p>Over a year ago when the Pizzagate Emails were released by Wikileaks and descended on the public it has taken many twists and turns and transformations. Mainstream news, trying to protect their investors, attempted to malign it from the beginning. It has morphed from the distorted and misrepresented child sex slavery and auction ring out of the basement of an old pizza shop on Connecticut avenue in Washington DC to a panoramic view of the modes of control, subversion and espionage tactics carried out by the rogue &quot;Deep State&quot; on what seems like a daily, weekly and monthly occurrence meant to &quot;scare&quot; us into complacency and accepting the tighter modes of control on our society.</p>
<p>Not only do the following articles by <strong>Yoichi Shimatsu</strong> show that <strong>The Parkland Shooting</strong> is <em>DIRECTLY</em> related to <strong>Pizzagate</strong> through <strong>Debbie Wasserman Shultz</strong> and the <strong>Awan Spy Ring in Congress</strong> for then <strong>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</strong>, it shows the motive for the shooting that is <strong><em>ancillary</em></strong> to the issue of <strong>gun control</strong>, <em>the rise and advancement of high tech tactical weaponry and security specialists in the field of short range domestic combat</em> <strong>against those of you that won\'t give up their guns</strong>. The Parkland shooting, as eloquently illustrated by Yoichi Shimatsu, details the exact <strong>STANDARD PROCEDURE</strong> in these <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2016/01/terrorists-exposed.html">GLADIO STYLE trauma campaigns</a> against the public. It shows that they are not beyond the ruthless measures despots used to control their people like common sheep in the annals of barbaric history, and, it shows that here is a template that they use whenever things get too heated up to <strong>distract from the real issues</strong>. Number one while we have been distracted, there is a joint exercise with the US and Israel called the <a href="http://redefininggod.com/">Juniper Cobra 18 missile defense exercise</a> that starts tomorrow and goes through the month, this could be an awful good pretense, like most drills do, to go live which would spark the beginning of WWIII considering the tensions there as we speak. Secondly,  the <strong>Parkland School</strong> shooting served as a <strong>perfect diversion from the controversy in Congress where 11 seats are up for grabs due to the Awan Spy Ring</strong>. This is also because the shooting happened in <strong>Broward County</strong>, in <strong>Debbie Wasserman Shultz\'s</strong> district.</p>
<p>The <strong>Florida School</strong> false flag aims to get both the pro-gun <strong>and</strong> the anti-gun people <strong>tense and fearful</strong>. (shock;trauma &quot;therapy&quot; -for ALL of us)</p>

The left and the right use the same teams interchangeably, almost as if there was no difference between the two to begin with (LMFAO)</p>
<p>There is a belief that Hillary was instructed to lose the election. <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2018/02/florida-school-false-flag.html">http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2018/02/florida-school-false-flag.html</a></p>

<p><strong>The Deep State</strong>, which includes <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and his friend <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, <em>have no intention of getting rid of guns</em>.They understand that most of you are dysfunctional and cannot be responsible with a weapon and will use it in a domestic or criminal incident, which will give them pretense to use the toys they have been inventing for us, right on up to drones and terminator style robots. They are HOPING  between the gangs and the poverty, starvation and crime, that you will all just begin to kill yourselves while they get to play with their toys, the police and technology. By the time you have spent all of your ammunition the big guns will have arrived.</p>
<p>If you don\'t see the connection between <strong>Pizzagate</strong> and <strong>Yoichi\'s</strong> work on the <strong>Parkland Shooting</strong>, and realize the <strong>GRAVITY and ENORMITY</strong> of these occultists undertaking, you must be completely, totally and hopelessly lost in understanding the goals of the <strong>New World Order</strong>.  THESE ARTICLES ARE A MUST READ</p>
<p><strong>FL Valentine’s Massacre Saves DWS Dems From Awan Probe</strong></p>

<p>The congresswoman from Broward Country, Florida, had this to say in the wake of the school massacre in her district: “We must do something about this senseless epidemic of gun violence and we must do it now.”</p>
<p>Her message is clear: Gun control is the prime issue for the midterm elections in Florida where 11 Democrat-held seats have been up for grabs due to the <strong>Imran Awan spy scandal in the U.S. House of Representatives.</strong> The main sponsor for the Pakistani computer service team that gained real-time to classified files was this same congresswoman from **Broward County, <strong>Debbie Wasserman Schultz</strong>, head of the <strong>Democratic National Committee</strong> at the time of the gunshot murder of <strong>Seth Rich</strong> and mystery death of lawyer <strong>Shawn Lucas</strong>, along with the killing of several other DNC foes.</p>
<p>The modus operandi behind the Parkland school shooting casts further suspicion  onto DWS, heiress of the retirement home of former Murder Inc. bookkeeper and mafia boss Meyer Lansky. <strong>Broward is mob country</strong>, site of the Gulfstream race track and casinos and recruitment ground for Lanksky’s attempt to regain control of his Havana casinos in that ill-fated adventure known as the Bay of Pigs invasion.</p>
<p>Psychiatric Clues to an MK-Ultra-style Operation</p>
<p>The recent history of chief suspect Nikolas Cruz fits the MK-Ultra profile. The recent history of chief suspect Nikolas Cruz fits the MK-Ultra profile. Twice orphaned, a strange pattern indeed, he suffered a personality disorder in youth, reportedly requiring psychiatric care.</p>
<p>&quot;Nikolas Cruz\'s child psychology clinic run by Dr. David Lubin is just 3 blocks down the road from the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Sawgrass Parkway in Sunrise Township, Broward Country. It\'s a small world, after all, inhabited by enterprising young &quot;survivors&quot;, manipulative parents, dirty cops, gun-toting religious fanatics, corrupt politicians, would-be tyrants and so-called crazed killers. It\'s just life and death in a fishbowl.&quot;</p>
<p>Mossad-Chabad-Deep State Behind &quot;Operation Parkland&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/">https://www.henrymakow.com/</a></p>
<p>David Lubin, Ph.D., BCBA-D</p>
<p>Vice President – Clinical Affairs</p>
<p>Dr. Lubin is Co-Founder and Vice President of Clinical Affairs with the Children’s Center for Development and Behavior. With over 25 years of experience in the field of behavior analysis, Dr. Lubin obtained his initial clinical and academic experience in 1980 while attending the University of Florida\'s Behavioral Psychology Program. Dr. Lubin went on to study at Auburn University where he continued his work in clinical applications of behavior analysis while earning Masters of Science and Doctorate degrees. During this time, he also chose an emphasis in the study of sophisticated techniques for facilitation of learning curves, clinical neuropsychology, neuroanatomy and human engineering technology. Dr. Lubin also held positions with Army Intelligence and NASA where he led teams in the design of user-systems and automated training systems. Dr. Lubin is an Adjunct Professor at Florida International University and teaches courses in both experimental and applied behavior analysis. As the lead clinician for Children’s Center for Development and behavior, Dr. Lubin provides daily clinical staff and program supervision, however, he remains a ‘hands-on’ clinician providing first-contact intakes, assessments, program development and intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Another Joker with Red Hair</strong></p>
<p>There is no evidence so far of Nikolas Cruz being anti-Semitic, a white nationalist ideologue or an Antifa activist (although he used the term in one tweet). His hair, however, was dyed red at the time of arrest, just like James Holmes, the “Joker” in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting in Colorado. <a href="http://rense.com/general96/FLvalentine.html">PLEASE GO READ THE REST HERE</a></p>
<p><strong>Florida School Attack Exposes Pedophile Jewish Vigilantes</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rense.com/general96/FLschoolexplodes.html">http://rense.com/general96/FLschoolexplodes.html</a></p>
<p>Something is rotten in Broward besides Debbie Wasserman Schultz, although they are probably linked at a financial level. What I suspect is that Nikolas Cruz’s previous run-ins with the police got him into the radar range of Parkland’s ultra-Orthodox pedophile circle. He being born a Jew made him an ideal target for Bar Mitzvah “training”. His messages indicate hatred of blacks and Hispanics, but curiously not Jews, aligning his racism identically with that of Shomrim.</p>',

          </p>
          <p>
           Dr. Lubin is Co-Founder and Vice President of Clinical Affairs with the Children’s Center for Development and Behavior. With over 25 years of experience in the field of behavior analysis, Dr. Lubin obtained his initial clinical and academic experience in 1980 while attending the University of Florida's Behavioral Psychology Program. Dr. Lubin went on to study at Auburn University where he continued his work in clinical applications of behavior analysis while earning Masters of Science and Doctorate degrees. During this time, he also chose an emphasis in the study of sophisticated techniques for facilitation of learning curves, clinical neuropsychology, neuroanatomy and human engineering technology. Dr. Lubin also held positions with Army Intelligence and NASA where he led teams in the design of user-systems and automated training systems. Dr. Lubin is an Adjunct Professor at Florida International University and teaches courses in both experimental and applied behavior analysis. As the lead clinician for Children’s Center for Development and behavior, Dr. Lubin provides daily clinical staff and program supervision, however, he remains a ‘hands-on’ clinician providing first-contact intakes, assessments, program development and intervention.

            Another Joker with Red Hair
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           There is no evidence so far of Nikolas Cruz being anti-Semitic, a white nationalist ideologue or an Antifa activist (although he used the term in one tweet). His hair, however, was dyed red at the time of arrest, just like James Holmes, the “Joker” in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting in Colorado.

            Florida School Attack Exposes Pedophile Jewish Vigilantes

           Something is rotten in Broward besides Debbie Wasserman Schultz, although they are probably linked at a financial level. What I suspect is that Nikolas Cruz’s previous run-ins with the police got him into the radar range of Parkland’s ultra-Orthodox pedophile circle. He being born a Jew made him an ideal target for Bar Mitzvah “training”. His messages indicate hatred of blacks and Hispanics, but curiously not Jews, aligning his racism identically with that of Shomrim.

            A well-placed British source informed WMR that Rahm Emanuel's father, Benjamin Emanuel, specialized in the terrorist bombings of buses carrying British troops and policemen during the British Mandate in Palestine.   Many of the British policemen killed by Emanuel and his Irgun colleagues between 1947 and 1948 had been transferred to Palestine upon Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947. Irgun saw the increase of British policemen from the Indian subcontinent as a major threat.   DOES Emanuel of connections to DWS?  Idk, but I would not be surprised.  Also could be connected to Kasky since I remember there was a picture of a fast food bag from Chicago with a pedo symbol on it that was posted on his FB or Instagram.

             Good input Carmencita thanks, understanding the tactics of the Israeli's Irgun and their campaign of bombing their own people TO GET ISRAEL ON THE MAP is KEY in understanding the TERRORIST tactics used in ALL FALSE FLAG EVENTS OF TODAY. They are all DIRECT ANTECEDENTS FROM THEM.

              Thank You.  And Thank You! for the Post.  I read almost the entire thing.  Am still working on reading the Yoishi article.  Wait til you check out my post.  It is short but shocking.  I am still dumb founded at the Gall of it All.  Sickos will find it a Riot but I find it rather Dumb since they think we are so stupid that we won't catch on or worse yet, that Kimmel knows we know, and he does not care.  I am going to have to work on it as far as tying it in, not my forte.

             "Wikipedia deleted Benjamin Emanuel's entry in 2008*, shortly after Rahm Emanuel was designated as President Obama's chief of staff. Wikipedia is a favorite device for the perception management goals of Dr. Cass Sunstein, Obama's director of the White House Office of Regulatory Affairs."
Rahm was rewarded for handling Barry by becoming mayor of Chicago, murder capital of U.S.

             BROTHERS EMMANUEL: RAHM, ARI, ZEKE
"When the brothers were 6, 2 and 4, they marched unsupervised around the neighborhood, across streets and beneath underpasses. In family arguments, they were encouraged to curse to make their point. They battled at home (“we shed blood almost every day,” the oldest would later write) and were spanked periodically by a mother whose angry outbursts would lead her to yell “I hate all of you equally.” They were unabashedly compared and contrasted: the grades of the most academic of the three hung on the fridge as a message to the two who weren’t quite as much so."

              Yeah,  I wonder if there is any Real brotherly love between them.  It's all about the money.  Zeke helped write the Affordable Care Act, Ari is a Really Big Hollywood Agent, and Rahm, well you know. I  don't know if it is true or not, but I remember last year that I found he was still working in his field Pediatrics.  Now that's a scary thought after what I posted about his past.  It said he was with Lurie Children's Hospital.  Hard to find that now.

              Yeah I get you. It's not about upvoats it's about dialogue. I guess I'm guilty of the same thing but I do like to add,  contribute and upvoat threads I like.  Sometimes I have a pretty rough around the edges attitude thanks for pulling me back.

            Another fucking "NO HOPER". Just what we need!
           </p>
           <p>
            Is everyone like their neighbor? Even if you engage in swearing, drinking, lying to your significant other, and cheat at cards, would you really condone child abuse and the eating of children?
           </p>
           <p>
            That's what we're dealing with here. Just because someone was drinking from the same trough for professional reasons, doesn't mean they're alike ... and doesn't mean everyone's alike. I hated some of my superiors, so am I like them because I didn't verbally kick them in the balls?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes you do what you do to get by. It in no way condones someone's actions. This is the last chance to make it right. To clean out government of the pedos and Moloch lovers and these NWO pukemeisters. Fuck 'em all. They belong in jail and we don't need another doom and gloomer to come around and argue there's NO HOPE.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is hope. My God tells me there's hope,but political persecution was going on then too. So if everyone's the same, how did that truth get out? And I will give all the believers hope. I read a long, long time ago that the last stage of enlightenment was POLITICAL PARANOIA. Yes, the end times is this. We have to fight our way through that awful depression. Think Lord of the Rings ... think of how you're mentally battered into thinking it doesn't matter if you're doing the right thing. How you'll never win anyway. Yeah, fight through that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't let the man on the white horse ride alone.

             CONSIDER JESUS: He has the last word on protecting children...
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Bible does not specifically say anything about child abuse. There is no record of a single instance in the Bible where a child is being abused. What the Bible does tell us is this: Children have a special place in God’s heart and anyone who harms a child is inviting God’s wrath upon Him. Jesus welcomed little children to His side and said that the kingdom of God belongs to “such as these” (Mark 10:14).
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus had harsh words for anyone who would cause a child to stumble, “But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.” Matthew 18:6, Luke 17:2,   The Bible tells parents to be gentle and loving with their children (Ephesians 6:4; Colossians 3:21). So even though the Bible does not specifically mention child abuse, it is abundantly clear how God feels about the issue."

              What is happening in PedoWood and other places in our country and around the world reminds me so much of Sodom and Gomorrah. Rome also followed in those footsteps. And look what happened to those places. God truly hates perversion in all forms.

               John 1 King James Version (KJV)
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
2 The same was in the beginning with God.
3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

             <p>
              But the Bible is all about second chances. Even hurting a child can and will be forgiven because Our Lord can see straight into someone's heart. Unlike us, He knows who is lying and who is sincerely repentant.

             No hope. Might seem that way. The goal line is just a little bit farther out than most of you anticipated. Did you think we were going to erase thousands of years of a historical plan in just a year or two,  over the computer?

              We've already won. We just don't know it. This is the tribulation, the one spoken about. Everybody is going to be given chance after chance to pick a side.

              Did those scumsucking pedos think that they could erase biblical prophecy by drinking blood and having Kimmel host the Oscars?

               True. We know it subconsciously I guess but sometimes the fog is so thick with pain and misery it's hard to see through it. Once again thanks for the positivity.

                I agree. My foot slipped into despondency. It seems impossible to fight this evil, but we are not alone. This isolation is something that the Cannibal Elite want us to feel. Makes us want to give up, but we will not.

             Romulus and Remus
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Roman mythology, Romulus and Remus are twin brothers, whose story tells the events that led to the founding of the city of Rome and the Roman Kingdom by Romulus. The killing of Remus by his brother, and other tales from their story, have inspired artists throughout the ages. Since ancient times, the image of the twins being suckled by a she-wolf has been a symbol of the city of Rome and the Roman people. Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome around 750 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. Whether the twins' myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development is a subject of ongoing debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing them as a possible threat to his rule, King Amulius ordered them to be killed and they were abandoned on the bank of the Tiber River to die. They were saved by the god Tiberinus, Father of the River and survived with the care of others, at the site of what would eventually become Rome. In the most well-known episode, the twins were suckled by a she-wolf, in a cave now known as the Lupercal.[3] Eventually, they were adopted by Faustulus, a shepherd. They grew up tending flocks, unaware of their true identities. Over time, their natural-born leadership abilities attracted a company of supporters from the community.

Imbolc anticipates spring, although the vernal equinox is seven weeks away. The word Imbolc refers to the pregnant condition of ewes at Midwinter. Their fertility was a good sign to the ancient Celts who depended on sheep for food and clothing... South and east of the British Isles ancient Romans celebrated the Lupercalia in honor of Lupa, the she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus who were considered Rome’s founding twins. Orgiastic rites were performed to honor her in the Grotto of the She-Wolf to insure fertility in the coming year. After these rites, naked youth traveled to neighboring towns to purify them according to Barbara Walker in The Woman’s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets." - 933

            The gods and goddesses of ancient and classical mythology were often twins as were the kings and queens they supposedly incarnated.

            "Often, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born simultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, Fauna-Faunus, Helen-Helenus or Artemis-Apollo, the ’moon and sun’ united in their Mother’s womb." (934)

We're talking about the burgeoning of this technology through the nazis which was between 1930 on or whenever mengele did his barbarism on concentration camp prisoners.  Superfluous.

             During the Holocaust, Josef Mengele, Hitler’s Angel of Death, conducted countless experiments on sets of Jewish twins. From the book, Children of the Flames: Doctor Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of the Holocaust, we found this disturbing account:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Josef Mengele, aka Auschwitz’s ’Angel of Death,’ held a fascination with twins. As Auschwitz’s senior ’physician’ he conducted ’genetic experiments’ on nearly 1500 sets of twins between 1943 and 1944...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Of the 3000 twins who passed through Mengele’s labs, only 200 survived the war. Depending on the type of experiment endured by the twins, they were driven to various labs at Auschwitz or neighboring Birkenau camp. Most received routine blood and x-ray tests, often on a daily basis...
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Mengele’s experiments were both physical and psychological; experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia, transfusions of blood from one twin to another, isolation endurance, reaction to various stimuli, injections with lethal germs, sex change operations, the removal of organs and limbs, incestuous impregnations... Mengele injected chemicals into the eyes of children in an attempt to change their eye color...
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Unfortunately a strict veil of secrecy over the experiments enabled Mengele to do his work more effectively, and ’twins who were subjected to the most gruesome procedures took his secrets to their graves.’ The full extent of his gruesome work will never be known because the records he sent to Dr. Von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute were shipped out ’in two truckloads’ and destroyed by the latter. Any remaining notes Mengele carried with him on his escape to South America and those were never found...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Mengele...also attempted to change the sex of some twins. Female twins were sterilized; males were castrated. What was the point of these ghoulish experiments? No one, either the child-victims, nor the adult witnesses, ever really knew." - 381:70

             Mark Twain wrote,
"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t."
            </p>
            <p>
             In the irrational world of the occult, the realities are indeed more bizarre than fiction. The driving force behind the pornography industry is the vast network of secret societies who conduct their lucrative operations legally through tax-funded intelligence organizations. These clandestine organizations sponsored the sexual revolution which, bankrolled by the CIA’s drug running syndicate, was designed to destroy moral standards and family values, foster anarchy and eventually to eliminate distinctions of gender, as well as good and evil. To comprehend this collective flight from reason, we must project ourselves into the subjective mindset of the occult underground, where right and wrong are what the Luciferian adepts pronounce them to be, where virginity has nothing at all to do with sexual purity, which in fact it rejects, and to comprehend, if at all possible, to what lengths the demonized race of Merovingians, having delusions of divinity, will go to produce a human vessel worthy of incarnation by their androgynous god, Lucifer. Truth — Veritas — is indeed stranger than Fiction.

             Richard H. Allen wrote, in Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, that as the zodiac spread from Babylonia to Greece and Egypt, its symbolism changed. The Hindus knew the Gemini Twins, Castor and Pollux, as the Twin Deities or Dioscouri; in Egypt they became ’Two Sprouting Plants’ pictured as twins who symbolized the sun and moon.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Some of the Jews ascribed [the Gemini Twins] to the tribe of Benjamin,... The Egyptians as Two Sprouting Plants; and Brown reproduces a Euphratean representation of a couple of small, naked, male child-figures, one standing upon its head and the other standing upon the former, feet to feet; the original twins being the sun and moon, when the one is up the other is generally down." (927:223-4)

             The feast of Lupercalia, the Roman counterpart to Imbolc—the day on which Thomas and Irmine Plantard de Saint-Claire made their debut in the French press—was celebrated in honor of Romulus and Remus—the twin gods who founded Rome.

            Money, The Root Of Evil
           </p>
           <p>
            Due to the Pentagon draw-down in Afghanistan and Iraq, defense-sector demand for combat training is in decline, though once the mainstay of revenues for Cubic. The ace in Feldman's hole is the Broward County Sheriff's department with the nation's largest police force, numbering 6,000 employees and a budget of $730 million. The trend of gentrification of South Florida, however, is leading toward an overall decline in violent crime rates in Florida, which is hitting a 50-year low. Miami Vice is not what it used to be, moving upstream into white-collar crime aka business as usual: money-laundering, casinos, escort services, porn and fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore, graphic violence committed in Broward County was necessary to the security sector of the state economy, Cubic in a nutshell, and presto suddenly comes the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School attack, for no convincing reason other than Nikolas Cruz's stepmother's death by cancer (which should have been investigated, had her body not been cremated.) A murderous rampage with no apparent cause is similar to how and why the Sandy Hook elementary school shootings happened exactly when Sen. Joe Lieberman's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was in need of dramatic violence for Congress to authorize spending. These mass murders are all about money and have nothing to do with madness, other than insane greed.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Israeli reservists, and even active Israeli military officers, these maggots are now crawling over every college campus in America to intimidate students and faculty members who are supporting the BDS (boycott, divest, sanctions) movement against the State of Israel for its atrocious human-rights record. Now there's a cause more appropriate for you, David, since you can promote BDS and still carry a concealed weapon while donning a yamulka. You think like a Jew so act like one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Phony Arrest
           </p>
           <p>
            Which raises the question: How is it that Nikolas Cruz was arrested just around the corner from the Chai Center Chabad House in Coral Springs? Rabbi Hershy Bronstein claims that he was monitoring the street after the Parkland shooting when he noticed the suspect walking past. It seems more likely that the born-again Jewish lad was boarding at Chabad, and left some gear there, when the rabbi assured him that fellow Shomrim vigilante member Sheriff Scott Israel would protect him under custody, since no Jew could prosecute another under the mafia-like "mesirah" code of unequal justice for all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other question is: Nikolas Cruz told his hosts, the Sneads, that he was not going to attend school on Valentine's day. He reportedly took an Uber to Parkland, but was it just to deliver a card to the girl he had formerly taken interested in? How did he get past the locked gate? Or was his presence on the school a case of mistaken identity, since at least two other male students were accused of being him? Was he actually at Chai Center Chabad House all that day, maybe waiting for an after-school party with other students?
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem in the quest for justice in Parkland is: Other than one teacher's recollections, nobody else's word is worth a penny in Broward County, home to a bunch of habitual cheats, something like Clinton's Arkansas with alligators and Zika mosquitoes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Civics 101
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the confused Parkland students, get back to hitting the books. Ever since the school boards dropped Civics class, nearly all young people lack the American history lessons required to comprehend why the Founding Fathers were so insistent on the citizenry's right to bear arms. I learned it all about the Declaration and Constitution by second grade back in public school on the wrong side of the tracks in Los Angeles, where we used to give the pledge of allegiance every morning. Our lives didn't matter or amount to anything back then, but the flag, the anthem and country did, since there wasn't much else to believe in.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can recommend, short of a return to traditional education, is for all young people to watch and study "The Last of the Mohicans" to see what happens to ordinary people and local communities when absolutist governments control all the firepower. The other salient point in a serious curriculum is to study the role of the Hessian mercenaries, King George III, and the House of Rothschild in Hesse to understand why a free citizenry and not military contractors should defend the nation. There's no recommended film on that topic out of Hollywood coming soon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now here's something that Parkland kids might be able to comprehend, from the early chapters of Star Wars and not the snowflake sequels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you so naive as to trust the sweet talk of the treacherous Senator Debbie Wasserman Palpatine and her allies, the merchants of death in the advanced weapons industry churning out droids and soon the clones? Can you not see that science fiction is just a figment of our reality?
           </p>
           <p>
            Methinks to the Dark Side that David is being drawn, pulled in by the traction beam of CNN. If you want to be sucked in, like how Anakin Skywalker morphed into Darth Vader, go ahead but remember there's an ultimate price to be paid on the other side, which makes suffering and death noble by comparison. And that's never to know the meaning of love and its social app called honor.

             Great article but so many words.  I hope you don't mind me pointing out you have mis-quoted a phrase wrong, as so many people do with this particular phrase. It is not '
             <em>
              money
             </em>
             is the root of all evil' it is 'the
             <em>
              LOVE
             </em>
             of money is the root of all evil'  -  money is neither good nor bad. It can be used for either depending on the person who has it.  If you love money more than God, then evil can creep in and evil things done to get it or to spend it on. Sorry but this is a pet peeve of mine, when the Bible is misquoted.  Bible quote:-  1 Timothy 6:10
             <em>
              For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs
             </em>

              I totally get your inference and the format may have thrown you off. My laziness a factor in that because I neglected to quote some borrowed materials (however all materials are cited) ,  what you saw there was a paragraph title of yoichis,  and he doesn't seem to make many literary mistakes,  I think he was implicit in his shortening for some reason. Not entirely significant but/and I appreciate your input.

             Hogg-Tied To The Gunfire At Parkland School (Pt 5)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/hogg-tied-to-the-gunfire-at-parkland-school-pt5.html">
             http://www.rense.com/general96/hogg-tied-to-the-gunfire-at-parkland-school-pt5.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence available thus far from the Valentine's day massacre has been mounting against the Hogg family as undercover accomplices and beneficiaries in the clandestine operation that killed 17 students and teachers. David Hogg has zero right to talk about "gun control" when his father works for the most murderous part of the assault-rifle industry, the killer-training program known as Cubic Simulation Systems, a nice name for Murder Inc. Version 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a rookie journalist, David Hogg failed the test with an F-minus for not making the minimal effort required of him. Cowering on the floor is not how the job gets done. In that situation, speaking with a pretty young girl about gun control is also completely out of order, when the task at hand is to figure out how to use a tripod, a light stand or a steel carrying case as a weapon against the shooter. In my past tasks of starting up of two journalism schools, I've lectured incoming j-school students that, especially in war, there's a moment to stop observing and start taking action to save lives. It's unnecessary to kill the assailant, when disabling and capturing him makes for a better story anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, student Hogg has not been following the logic of the journalist's craft, but was doing something else called propaganda, mouthing political correctness that boiled away into nonsense in that situation. If it weren't for all the ridiculous qualms over the means of self-defense, one of the teachers could have easily taken out that gunman, sparing the lives of innocent children.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Where Was The Deputy?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            That line from Bob Marley's "I shot the sheriff" poses a hard question. The most recent blow to the official cover-up just came from the school resource officer (SRO), or head of security, Broward deputy Scot Peterson. After being absent on premises during the intrusion, he was subsequently castigated for failing to enter the 1200 building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not until 12 days afterward did SRO Peterson provide an explanation for his conduct. AP reported: "Peterson's statement said he and a security specialist ran to the scene at first word of the shooting, a report that mistakenly said firecrackers were being set off near one building. He then heard gunshots but believed that those gunshots were originating from outside of the building." Following the rule book from his police training, "he took up a â€˜tactical position' between two nearby buildings while alerting dispatch and initiating a Code Red lockdown of the campus".
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, the capper: "Radio transmissions indicated that there was a gunshot victim in the area of the football field, adding to his belief that the shooting was outdoors." Fair enough, he's deserves a reprieve for giving us some food for thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Key Issues Here Include -
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             - A "security specialist" was visiting Parkland school that day, which confirms the teacher statements about a planned emergency drill, which misled everyone into thinking that blanks were being fired in an evacuation exercise instead of the real deal;
            </li>
            <li>
             - Peterson, the sole deputy assigned to Stoneman Douglas school, was therefore guiding a security expert around campus, which confirms a top school-district administrator's statement that the SRO had been "called away", apparently for official duties;
            </li>
            <li>
             - The fact that the gunshots sounded like small firecrackers was the initial impression of many students and teachers inside the epicenter, Building 1200 (an important detail for ballistics analysis);
            </li>
            <li>
             - The SRO, however, understood the "firecrackers" as being near (outside) a building, indicating that a sniper was, indeed, outdoors picking off anyone who ventured out;
            </li>
            <li>
             - The police radio transmitted a report of a gunshot victim on the football field, which confirms witness accounts of several prone bodies lying outdoors; and
            </li>
            <li>
             - His triggering of a Red Code had several immediate consequences, including 1.) teachers assuming that it signaled the start of the planned emergency drill; 2.) electronically locking all classroom doors that had not been left open; 3.) and then forcing the shooter(s) to set off up to three fire alarms to reopen the doors. The sequence meant that the assailants were well prepped on emergency procedures, indicative of their having inside sources.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Eyewitness Accounts
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Female student witness Z, who escaped the third floor down the west-end staircase, claimed that suspect Cruz walked besides her. When she accused him of being a gunman, his reply was a shocked and confused "Uhh?". Witness Z said "the other gunman" was still firing from the opposite end (east side) of upper floor of Building 1200.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Laser-Aimed Rifle
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Witness T, a female teacher on the 3rd floor near the east end, provided the clearest description of the principle gunman, as described earlier in this series, as being clad in black "full metal gear", including an alloyed steel-plate bulletproof vest, helmet and ski mask. In her statement to national news, she said that the gunman was firing a "barrage of bullets" from "a rifle (the type of which) I had never seen before". In the earliest edition of her interview, the teacher also mentioned seeing the shooter walk past her classroom door with his rifle pointing a red laser beam down the hallway. (This tactic was apparently to mop up the wounded with a head shot, as indicated by the multiple wounds.)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Weapons And Tactics
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now for the hardware. The laser-aimed gun is a key element in the female teacher's account, which at least explains the accuracy of gunfire, which left few students with survivable wounds, other than those scratched by ricochet fragments. The type of gun she had "never before seen" is probably a downsized assault rife with a detachable (by unscrewing) barrel, resembling a rectangular box, like the ones used for a single long rose stem on Valentine's. This type of foreshortened rifle, also a removable butt, is designed for urban warfare inside buildings or constricted areas such as alleys, arcades and between buildings.
           </p>
           <p>
            The popping sound, much like a .22 pistol or balloons bursting, is based on a type of ammunition developed for short-range urban firefights, known as the .300 Blackout (or Whisper) used by special-ops. The shell contains a smaller charge than a standard NATO round (5.56 x 45 mm, or .233 caliber) and the bullet is heavier and slightly wider, since the distance in urban warfare is at much closer-range than in open-field combat. One advantage of less impulse force is a lower noise level inside the echo-chamber environment of a concrete building or other enclosed space, preventing damage to the ear drums (which must be avoided since listening is an important part of detecting enemy movements). The heavier bullet inflicts an even larger exit wound than a NATO round, as seen in the "football size" holes in the bodies at Parkland school.
           </p>
           <p>
            The firing sequence of the "full metal" gunman is proof of hundreds of hours of tactical training and battle experience. The "barrage of bullets" initially downed his quarry,
            <strong>
             followed up with his steady slow steps along the hallway to mop up the dying with a merciful coup de grace through the forehead. Therefore the horrifying screaming of the wounded, as heard by the surviving students, did not last for long.
            </strong>
            He did not continue the pursuit of the fleeing students, presumably because he had achieved his assigned quota of kills, not much different than a bag limit during hunting season.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The plan, therefore, was a controlled count of confirmed dead victims so as not leave a lot of wounded to suffer for the rest of their lives, a professional practice that's part of standard procedure at tactical-training centers operated by defense contractor such as the one in Pompano Beach, which employs Kevin Hogg as an adviser and marketing liaison to the FBI, CIA and police departments. The operational rules make a sense since there's no point wasting money and time on someone who's no chance of living anything resembling a normal life.
            </strong>
            Now David, why don't you just choke on that thought over what Dad does for his living? Instead of blaming Americans who comprehend the situation of lawlessness the nation is facing, jut tell your father that he's a despicable war criminal, even if that takes moral backbone.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Devil Is In The Details
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I have just two questions for the Hoggs and the boss at Cubic: Among your assault weapon toting trainees, which ones did Parkland? Or was the job contracted out to your company reps with Israeli Defense Force (IDF), maybe some Shomrim reservists down at Chabad House?
           </p>
           <p>
            One pattern that's a known is: Americans tend to work as a team, to cover each other, whereas the Israelis are used to swaggering and acting like Uber-mensch (supermen) when they bully the Palestinians and gun them down in cold blood. This Israeli menace gets back to Cubic Simulation Systems, who's recently promoted chairman, Bradley Feldman, has focused on acquiring Israeli military-related high tech to compete in both the U.S. and global security market against his main competitor Thyssen Training of Germany. Sig Sauer rifles are top of the line, while Israeli Galil firearms have a lot of catching up to do.

            The Shomrim chapter in South Florida was founded in Miami by a rabbi in the Coast Guard. Go figure. The USCG is tasked with pursuing and arresting drug traffickers and people smugglers. Of course little Haitian DACA girls are a major commodity in the nightclubs and the escort circuit. As for cocaine, the Orthodox Jewish rabbis of Miami have been fervently converted the “Marrano” community (hidden Jews) of Medellin, Colombia, back to the fold, and sending them on to Israel for further indoctrination. For the next major shipment of coke, dope dealers need to search no further than the local synagogue.

            As detailed in Part 2 of this series, the likeliest suspect behind the raid is the Shomrim ultra-Orthodox Jewish vigilante group, heavily concentrated in Parkland, headquarters of the Lubavitcher movement in Broward and Palm Beach counties (Parkland is on the county line). Not only would they could they obtain insider information on the target site, most of the able-bodied members of Shomrim have trained and served in the IDF ( the Israel Defense Force), which has dispatched innumerable strike teams for house-to-house raids in Gaza, along with major offensives against bunkers, tunnels, missile launchers, mortar pits and rooftops during intense urban warfare since 2006, which flared into all-out air-and-ground battles in 2014. Many Shomrim volunteers have also served with counterinsurgency units of the Shin Beit, the Israeli internal security force assigned to capturing Palestinian political leaders as prisoners for interrogation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The standard gear for anti-Palestinian suppression operations in Gaza is a black helmet, Kevlar vest with armor plate over vital organs, and baklava head gear (ski masks) to avoid identification by security videocams, which can be used in human-rights investigations. As of last week, these same operational tactics have been deployed against American citizens.

            FLASH - The sole video showing ‘suspect' Nikolas de Jesus Cruz, on February 14 taken more than an hour after the Parkland school shooting, was recorded by a security camera of the CHAI CHABAD HOUSE of the Lubavitcher-Shomrim ultraOrthodox Jewish cult on 5761 Coral Ridge Drive (located inside the northwest bend of Sawgrass Parkway - Hwy 869), just minutes before his arrest on the U-shaped Wyndham Lakes Drive, no. 4700,, which has no exit except Coral Ridge Drive. The Chai Chabad title was shown on the clip posted at CNN. This indicates that, as earlier mentioned in this investigative series, that the Jewish-born Cruz was likely recruited by the Shomrim secret society to be a patsy for the commando raid and was brainwashed at Chabad House.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone should be wary when the most powerful men in America exploit the Parkland school massacre to call for gun seizures from the citizenry, especially after this same elite was directly responsible for the deaths by firearms of hundreds of thousands of civilians in their wars from Afghanistan and Iraq to Libya and Syria, along with dozens of other countries. Their national project for disarmament of Americans is exactly why the Founding Fathers, in their prescient wisdom, drafted the Second Amendment to prevent the return of an absolutist tyranny against a defenseless public. This is the hour not to cave into emotional weakness but rather to stand strong at arms, in the common defense of a sovereign people as mandated by the U.S. Constitution.

            In less than a week after the Parkland school attack, George “Clueless” Clooney was the first Hollywood (CA not FL) celebrity to donate a half million dollars to the Go Fund Me account of the March for Our Lives protest movement, which was set up by student hustlers Cameron Kasky and David Hogg. The latter’s father, Kevin Hogg, has a spooky record with the FBI, indicating MFOL is not a charity for wound victims but instead a cold calculated political move for daddy Hogg’s superiors at the FBI, Justice and CIA.

           </p>
           <p>
            The pretty boy of TV soap operas, George Clooney owed his movie-heartthrob career to his father’s collaboration with the CIA and the Jesuit intelligence nexus on their Darfur phony-refugee project in support of heavily armed Chadian guerrillas in a pipeline war against oil-rich Sudan. His dad Nick Clooney is a journalism teacher at American University in D.C. and an active member of the Newseum, both of which are intel linked.
           </p>
           <p>
            His actor son’s lead roles in intelligence-themed movies “Syriana”, “Argo”, “Men Who Stare at Goats” and “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind” leave no doubt about George Clooney’s close connections with the CIA. A swinger (that’s only half of it), he probably had no choice but to cooperate with the Feds’ propaganda machine after disclosure of his longtime friendship with mobster Rick Rizzolo, owner of the Crazy Horse Too stripper club in Las Vegas. Mothers of Parkland, you’re allowing this whore-monger to cozy up to your kids? Another Pied Piper, he’s taking them away for a children’s crusade to help his spook bosses at Langley and the Pentagon. Sorry, Amal, you made a huge mistake falling for a con artist (did you not notice he’s a natural for the role of gambling cheat Danny Ocean?) so go back to the sanity of Beirut, where at least you know who your enemies are.

             The Hogg Factor in A Joint Ops
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The electronic warfare used for the exfiltration phase of Operation Parkland had to be precisely coordinated with the movements of three assailants, and their forward observer, who must have used a different frequency with communications to their headquarters. Not surprising, the former Navy flyer aboard a carrier, Kevin Ralph Hogg is employed at Cubic Simulations Systems in nearby Pompano Beach, which develops programs and graphics for military training and operations. Under DOD contracts, Cubic divides its various ops-planning sections into different regions of the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cubic’s Pompano staff, where the father of Parkland student David Hogg works, focuses on joint-services commando operations such a hostage rescue or strikes on terrorist homes, using cyber tech developed by the IDF cyberwar division. Far from being a victim, David Hogg was one of the forward observers of the joint Israeli-CIA death squad sent to Parkland, ensuring that sufficient numbers of his classmates were killed.

             The bodies weren’t even cold yet before high-school junior Cameron Kasky posted his plea for donations to support the partisan Democrat protest planned for March 24 aka March for Our Lives. This nasty drama student was the one who dissed Sen. Marco Rubio for showing up at a townhall meeting to show his sympathy and hear community opinion. Young Cameron showed zero intention to persuade Rubio but spoke out only to polarize the distraught crowd. I do not appreciate Rubio’s voting record either, but the week of mourning is not the time to play politics. Now that it’s started, Cameron is getting what’s coming to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The art of hustle runs in the Kaskowitz family bloodstream. On the issue of children’s welfare, it should be noted that Cameron’s grandfather and his father Jeffrey A. Kasky, Jr. are attorneys who serve as president and vice president of the profit-making surrogacy program called One World Adoptions.

            <p>
             The rapidity of political polarization out of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school during the mourning period, along with the immediate claim from the sneaks at the Anti-Defamation League about the Jewish-born suspect Nikolas Cruz belonging to a white supremacist group, indicate that the Parkland school shooting was another long-planned false-flag attack, similar to the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school assault in Newtown, Connecticut.
