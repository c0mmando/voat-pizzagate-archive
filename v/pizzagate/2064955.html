            There are 2 parts to the NWO-government and religion. If you know what to look for you can greatly see Trump is involved in the NWO religion. Lots of red flags there! I believe he going to be involved in ushering in the NWO and will fool a large amount of people. They are already doing it by all the fake preachers they had at the inaugural. Most people can't see it and think I'm crazy when I talk, but I see it. It has to do with all the preachers always praying for him. Those are all NWO preachers. Hang on the ride is going to be rough. At this point I don't even trust Voat. You never know who is satanic! It is deeply entrenched.

            Pizzagate  is  not  only  about  pedophilia-it is  primarily  about STATE SANCTIONED ELITE HUMAN  TRAFFICKING  from prostitution to  pedophilia  to satanic ritual sacrifice-to reduce  this  topic to  unorganized pedophilia alone  is a  mistake and also a diversion  from  TPTB-so my  question is to  Trump-where  are  all  the  big  names in politics, Hollyweird, military offenders? This is all street  level arrests

             Trump is one of them. He is always giving the OK devil hand sign. He didn't want to persecute Hillary. I think they are just making him look like the good guy, but really no different. In a way it is a worse kind of deception. A lot of people will be fooled when they usher in their NWO religion.

            I'm not sure that's Trump's doing. Surely it's good that he has said the phrase out loud, and it's good that Ivanka is pushing in that direction but 4 things.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Trump is a teen trafficker (re: his modeling agency) and a child rapist and a man who makes sexualized comments about random 12-year-olds so he has no legs to be a moral police.
            </li>
            <li>
             Raids look suspiciously like "closing shop" on rat lines because there is never a follow-up from the media, or publication of the arrestees names. Americans need to FOIA this and look at court logs. Are these real arrests or re-deployment of FBI pedo-informants.
            </li>
            <li>
             He has used his time to go after MS-13 and revive his anti-other rhetoric. The number of logs on ICE website concerning MS-13 affairs/arrests tends to indicate that this is already a highly policed gang going back a decade.
            </li>
            <li>
             Change of regime may have allowed some precinct to close some cases which had been open for quite a while. That would support the rumor that law enforcement was being managed by State Dept. to "not go after friends" of the administration.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The problem is a white collar / middle class issue. Those are the people who seem to be super well organized (cult) and protected by alphabet agencies under the threath of "national security" (protecting the status quo).

            It seems like he's outside the deep state and allowing police and justice dept to actually do their jobs.  If Obama was telling them to not arrest or the corrupt AG(Lynch) was keeping these cases from going to court then of course that's how the numbers changed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's worrying that they haven't got Hillary, Podesta, Bill and others and I hope those arrests are coming.  If they aren't, you have to wonder which side he's on and which side Sessions is on.

             The opposite of this is actually true.   The 2017 numbers are built on the 2016 operations which built on the 2015 operations etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example California doubled its numbers by expanding its operations to more geographic area. They arrested 500 people by the end of January in a yearly operation which had been planned well before Trump took office.

Nearly 500 arrested in California human trafficking raids

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Almost 500 people were arrested in a crackdown on human trafficking in California, police said on Wednesday, in raids that also led to the rescue of more than 50 victims, including children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police said they had rescued 28 children, some of whom had been reported missing, and also 27 adults who had been coerced into prostitution.
......
             <strong>
              The crackdown was carried out to coincide with the end of Human Trafficking Awareness Month in January, which former President Barack Obama proclaimed in 2014.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Most trafficking arrests are carried out by local law enforcement.  Many of this bigger operations are joint local and federal.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's another multistate operation that has been going on for several years as well that took place in the first few months of this year.

              Don't always agree with you but do here. It was pretty strange tho that the army general (? Need a ref to remember name and rank) was busted for child sexual abuse like 30 years later after the fact.

            Exactly what did Trump do that increased these numbers?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By the second month of Trump’s presidency, police had arrested 1500 criminals nation-wide who are connected with these pedophile rings. This was triple the number of arrests made in the year 2014 under Barack Obama, which amounted to a little over 400.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Because many of the operations that arrested 1,500 criminals have been going on for years and law enforcement has been learning and improving.   Many of operations are timed to the end of January.  January is anti-human trafficking month and has been so for about 4 years now.   So what is the media ignoring and what has Trump done?    Budgetwise the government is not a Trump-signed budget yet.  They are still on the fiscal year that started last year.

            You are now actively pushing disinfo. Of all places a conspiracy board should have NO HEROS, least of all the president and absolutely least of all Trump, about whom you apparently dont know ANYTHING.  It does not get any more elitist than Manhattan developer whose children all marry rich Jews.  In fact delete this post, its embarrassing.

               It's not about heroes, angry little man
There's a Cold War going on right now, if you haven't noticed. It's for control of the USG, and in relation, the world.
Ever since they shot JFK, when LBJ winked during the inauguration, they've had this government held tight.
Obama was just another frontman for the corrupt party in control...
Or should we say, that
               <em>
                used
               </em>
               to be in control.
Because DJT is either controlled opposition or the real fucking deal, and you (and the rest of us) have a decision of faith to make:
Is he part of the old regime? Are the globalists
               <em>
                that good
               </em>
               that we can be manipulated into believing DJT is on our side, yet isn't.   OR
He, and his team, have somehow broken the stranglehold the globalists have on our country.
              </p>
              <p>
               You don't get 100% proof either way, that's why it's a choice of faith. You can be negative and use low emotion and believe he is owned, or you can be positive, use high emotion, and hope that he is truly trying to make America great again (despite you and your sad, angry lefties shouting and crying otherwise).
