<p>But what if the State itself is, in a systemic way, responsible for said crimes?

<p>So, if the State itself is committing crimes, it is the people\'s sovereign and sacred duty to expose it. Those who understand this truth best tend to become journalists. At least, that\'s what drove me to the profession.</p>
<p>Now specifically on this work. First, there is context; institutional child abuse; <strong>IT IS ALREADY A COMMON-KNOLEDGE PROBLEM AS YOU CAN SEE BY <a href="https://archive.is/672B8#selection-693.3-777.28">DOZENS OF CASES</a> THAT ARE PROVEN WITH PEDOPHILES CONVICTED IN CRIMINAL TRIALS</strong>. </p>
<p>Here\'s a very brief summary of the most heinous and high profile cases:
* <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/722037/Max-Spiers-investigated-US-military-paedophile-ring-Presido-suspicious-death">The Presidio affair</a> Where a devil worshiping military man was a prime suspect in a series of pedophile scandals involving the sexual abuse of hundreds of children
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal">Jimmy Saville</a> - systematic child abuse for decades under the noses of the management of the BBC (UK\'s television network system)
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases">Vatican\'s</a> historic involvement in covering-up pedophilia
US legislators\' documented trips on the <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/10/09/the-sex-slave-scandal-that-exposed-pedophile-billionaire-jeffrey-epstein/">&quot;Lolita Express&quot;</a>, 
The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/12188331/Belgian-paedophile-planned-underground-city-of-victims.html">Dutroux</a> where a pedophile in Belgium created underground tunnels to imprison, torture and hold children for sale into trafficking
The Hampstead doubts, where it is alleged by the children who survived that they were subject to satanic abuse.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIXdNQrDaaQ">Hollywood and Washington elite pedophile networks</a>, where children like child star Corey Feldman are literally surrounded by pedophiles their entire career or innocent children of congressmen being openly groped by VP Biden on camera. </p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. The scourge of child rape (aka &quot;pedophilia&quot;) has been featured in the news, movies, documentaries, art work. There have also been many policymakers, prosecutors, investigators and victims denouncing the very phenomenon; see for example British MP John Mann <a href="https://archive.is/7zft7">passionate speech</a> before Parliament on the subject last year, or the extensive report by former undercover Interpol agent (Bannon) called <a href="https://archive.is/HLFN2#selection-449.0-449.91">Suffer the Children: The child sex trade is a global nightmare, but a former Interpol agent</a>. Indeed it is a secret de <a href="https://archive.is/aFs26">Polichinelle</a>. So the only possible disagreement can be on the scale and systemicity of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>To honestly decide whether that\'s what we are seeing in the Podesta emails, please have a look at this <a href="https://archive.is/syEzY">one example</a>. Look at the invitation at the end of the thread. Ms Luzzatto is inviting people (among which are John and Mary Podesta) to a farm in Lovettsville. 
This is what she says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impossible, you say? They couldn\'t possibly be speaking about abusing the children! After all, what step-grandmother would offer three innocent children up for group abuse?</p>
<p>This is how invitee Drew Littman answers the invitation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I\'ve never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you aren\'t aware, Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina\'s 3rd congressional district; in DC he\'s regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed.</p>
<p>Agreed, if that example was the only one, one could dismiss it as baroque misinterpretation. But there\'s more, much more. Let\'s not even get into the <a href="https://archive.is/o/MrsGu/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">handkerchiefs and codewords</a> - even though &quot;<a href="https://archive.is/A85HT">cheese pizza</a>&quot; is a known euphemism for &quot;child porn&quot; (and there are abundant examples in the Podesta emails where that term is used in very strange and out-of-context manners).</p>
<p>How about the fact that John and Tony Podesta are old friends of Jeffery Epstein, Dennis Hastert and Clement Freud, three convicted child molesters? Who has so many child rapists as friends? <a href="https://archive.is/8F945">Who stays friends with child rapists </a>after they\'re exposed and convicted?</p>
<p>How about the Katy Grannan <a href="https://archive.is/vddrO">photos plastered around the Podestas\' mansion</a>, depicting naked teenagers?</p>
<p>How about Tony Podesta writing he\'s &quot;<a href="https://archive.is/48Dap">very good and a little wired</a>&quot; from being seated next to &quot;the kids&quot; on an airplane?</p>
<p>How about the underground vault on the Podestas\' property which admittedly allows them to watch &quot;<a href="https://archive.is/BZIIw">very complicated video pieces</a>&quot; that for him are &quot;a form of additction&quot; for the &quot;brave and passionate&quot; art collector.</p>
<p>If you are feeling ill-at-ease, that reaction is honorable. And the worse thing is you haven\'t yet seen much. But for more, you\'ll have to look for it. Indeed one might be breaking statutory laws by linking to some of the clues Internet sleuths have found in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>For example, did you know James Alefantis, listed 49th &quot;most influential&quot; person in DC by GQ, chef and White House regular, boyfriend of David Brock, owner of Comet Ping Pong, had an Instagram account filled with references to and depictions of child abuse and torture? Indeed it\'s not just the <a href="https://archive.is/2hriE">frescoes</a> in his restaurant or the &quot;<a href="https://archive.is/GQuXt">artists</a>&quot; he hosts there; it\'s not even the fact his menu and the logos of three other iconic businesses next door feature <a href="https://archive.is/gKR2v">FBI-recognized pedophilia symbols</a>. No, this is about his own posts, pictures, comments and friends on social media. Again, you\'ll have to look it up for yourself. It is hardly ambiguous. Indeed it is Alefantis who puts the pizza in #Pizzagate.</p>
<p>If that surprises you, did you know Arun Rao was caught &quot;liking&quot; several of Alefantis\' creepiest toddler Instagram posts? Again, that could be dismissed - only there\'s all this context, and the fact Mr Rao is a Assistant US attorney, and charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse.
And if you\'re still not distinguishing the pattern, did you know that Laura Silsby (Gayler), the woman <a href="https://archive.is/jIlEV">caught</a> trying to <a href="https://archive.is/NdmLd">smuggle</a> thirty-three children out of Haiti (a country where the <a href="https://archive.is/CbrGg">Clinton Foundation isn\'t without controversy</a>), whose release from jail became a <a href="https://archive.is/KSORQ">personal matter for Ms Clinton</a>, thereafter <a href="https://archive.is/xFplZ">became</a> an associate of MyStateUSA, which changed its name to AlertSense, and which is the one <a href="http://azbroadcasters.org/wp-content/uploads/AMBERAlertpressreleaseFINAL11-15-06.pdf">providing</a> the technology to issue Amber Alerts?</p>
<p>Enough already. If anything I have proven the legitimacy of the following question:</p>
<p><strong>Is there a systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC, as we already <a href="https://archive.is/B1cpw">suspect there is one in Hollywood</a>?</strong></p>
<p>This looks like a systemic problem indeed. Childhood disappearances <a href="https://archive.is/LE0HH">outnumber cancer deaths</a> in the United States by one third.
Therefore, given the sheer amount of leaked emails, and the suspected phenomenon\'s scale and repartition, it is likely the data dumps (Podesta and other Wikileaks, Guccifer 1/2, DNCLeaks, etc.) provide some clue to the problem. Therefore, they should be investigated thoroughly under than particular lens, and suspicions need to be corroborated with other (and previously) known facts.</p>

           <a href="https://archive.is/2hriE">
            frescoes
           </a>
           in his restaurant or the "
           <a href="https://archive.is/GQuXt">
            artists
           </a>
           " he hosts there; it's not even the fact his menu and the logos of three other iconic businesses next door feature
           <a href="https://archive.is/gKR2v">
            FBI-recognized pedophilia symbols
           </a>
           . No, this is about his own posts, pictures, comments and friends on social media. Again, you'll have to look it up for yourself. It is hardly ambiguous. Indeed it is Alefantis who puts the pizza in #Pizzagate.
          </p>
          <p>
           If that surprises you, did you know Arun Rao was caught "liking" several of Alefantis' creepiest toddler Instagram posts? Again, that could be dismissed - only there's all this context, and the fact Mr Rao is a Assistant US attorney, and charged with prosecuting child pornography and abuse.
And if you're still not distinguishing the pattern, did you know that Laura Silsby (Gayler), the woman

          </p>
          <p>
           Enough already. If anything I have proven the legitimacy of the following question:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Is there a systemic pedophilia problem in Washington DC, as we already
            <a href="https://archive.is/B1cpw">
             suspect there is one in Hollywood
            </a>
            ?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           This looks like a systemic problem indeed. Childhood disappearances
           <a href="https://archive.is/LE0HH">
            outnumber cancer deaths
           </a>
           in the United States by one third.
Therefore, given the sheer amount of leaked emails, and the suspected phenomenon's scale and repartition, it is likely the data dumps (Podesta and other Wikileaks, Guccifer 1/2, DNCLeaks, etc.) provide some clue to the problem. Therefore, they should be investigated thoroughly under than particular lens, and suspicions need to be corroborated with other (and previously) known facts.

            There are not "abundant examples" of the term "cheese pizza" being used in the Podesta emails. There are, in fact, zero examples of the term "cheese pizza" being used in the Podesta emails.
