            Well, I do know some people are investigating the shell companies surrounding the Clintons. That's a good start. Some of them are for-profit, and other non-profit. With the non-profit there's at least a bit of trail in regards to some of the money, and we may be able to determine a portion of their money-laundering scheme.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pay-for-play is one of the big aspects of the CF that people need to look into, and may very well tie back into PG. Need to correlate payments to the foundation to events that happened in the weeks surrounding it. There was much activity in regards to the Arab Spring at the time. Of particular importance is the Syrian Civil War, as this was a Clinton/CIA operation - and the Free Syrian Army our mercenaries. An article posted here earlier today claimed that the FSA was harvesting child organs, which may actually be funding some of the operation. That's worth investigating, but could be disinfo.

            More needs to come out about their Haiti operations in general.

            I'm sure I'm missing something.

             When you said harvesting organs, did they say what was done to the children before or after?
            </p>
            <p>
             Harvesting organs after finishing their pizza, maybe? I imagine they're not going around collecting the bodies of recently bombed and shot children so... they're probably the same kids from the general trafficking. I wonder if there's a schedule for which slices are about to be portioned out...
            </p>
            <p>
             So like... what if there is an order for organs, and the rest is free to be consumed? Kill rooms... chopping them up... blah blah blah... just make sure you send off the parts that were requested. They gotta be fresh, right?

              Haven't looked into the allegations just yet.. this just posted within the last day. Syrian children harvested for organs in Turkey and Syria- around 18,000 of them.

               More on it... You remember when ISIS was taking over whatever dust hole and stealing the girls? And then there was an uprising against them.. an unusual one... didn't happen often where everyone was getting involved for some reason.

                Well, "never let a crisis go to waste" is the term they use, if I'm not mistaken. I doubt most members of the US Military would go along quietly with shooting kids then harvesting their organs, however.

                ISIS sure does seem to be dealing in child sex slaves quite a bit. So does the Free Syrian Army. ISIS is, as proven in Clinton's emails, funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Free Syrian Army is funded by the US through the CIA. Both are probably supplying the black market with organs. Both are creating quite a maelstrom of carnage in the region.

                CIA usually handles drug and gun running. I wouldn't be surprised if they were facilitating child trafficking and organ trafficking either. Oftentimes they use this money to pay for their operations, as otherwise they would have to tell congress what they're doing all day. Can't have that going public.

                The two primary objectives in Syria are to get the oil pipeline into Europe run through Syria, then into Turkey. The other is to get Syria (as well as the countries in North Africa) under the heel of the IMF and petrodollar.

                 Because terrorists will of course do that. They fund them, they're already terrorists anyway so what do they care... it's a front.

                 And it's not that the military is complacent directly. They just keep accepting the money to create the scenarios that these people suffer under.

                  Pretty much.

                  It can also be inferred that Clinton was, as head of the State Department, taking money through the Clinton Foundation from these foreign countries and persons for various perks in relation to the Arab Spring. We know, for instance a European arms dealer donated to her, and was supplying weapons for the Syrian rebels. Saudis and Qatar gave Clinton $25 mill and $1 mill respectively. Probably to overlook ISIS, as well as to ensure that Salafist friendly regimes were set up across the region as they were overthrowing people. Morocco probably gave her money so they wouldn't be overthrown (protection money).

                 <p>
                  So, yes - we need to take a look at all the donations she received, and try to connect the dots as to what she was giving in the deal. That's what the Clintons do - they profit from the fog of war. Some of this may very well link back to PG.
