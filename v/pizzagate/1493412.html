            Looks like he was manipulating the family court judicial system to create a prostitution enterprise and ended up investigating himself!!.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The woman, who remains unnamed, went to Dunnings for advice with a custody suit she was having with the father of her child. Dunnings allegedly took her to lunch and said he would help her if she had sex with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Dunnings, III noted that he was aware that [the woman] was struggling financially, and said that he had a proposition for her,” the document state. “He was seeking a sexual relationship with her, and that he would pay her money in return.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Dunnings brother, Steven Dunnings, has also been charged with using prostitution services. Both Stuart and Steven Dunnings have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stuart Dunnings, a father of three, has been the county prosecutor since January 1997.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a press release, Attorney General Bill Schuette condemned Dunnings, saying, “I have worked with Stuart Dunnings while I have served as Attorney General. I am saddened that an elected official who holds a special trust from voters and is the chief prosecutor in our capital city would allegedly engage in conduct causing felony and misdemeanor charges to be filed.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Human trafficking is a crime that puts people, in this case young women, into situations where their lives are endangered and where they are manipulated and brutalized.”
            </p>
