             About Ria Pratt Kim Noble
            </p>
            <p>
             Ria has DID and is one of Kim Noble's personalities. From the age of 14 years old Ria has spent 20 years in and out of hospital until she made contact with Dr Valerie Sinason and Dr Rob Hale at the Tavistock and Portman Clinics. 10 years ago she began therapy and was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (formally multiple personality disorder). D.I.D is a creative way to cope with unbearable pain. The main personality splits into several parts each having an amnesic barrier between them. It is a conventional disorder but Ria has had extensive tests over 2 years by leading psychology professor at UCL, John Morton , who has established there is no memory between the personalities and that she represents the British gold standard over genuine Dissociation. With no formal art training, Ria and 12 of her personalities (alters) became interested in painting in 2004 after spending a short time with an art therapist. These 12 artists each have their own distinctive style, colour and themes, ranging from solitary desert scenes, to sea scenes to abstracts, collages and paintings with traumatic content. Many are unaware that they share a body with other artists. Ria's works takes you into the nightmare world of child abuse, depicted through the childs eyes, hence the bright colours. Many people can't face the truth of abuse and turn away, the use of very bright colours also makes the painting noticeable making the viewer look and see what happens, it is hard to miss. The patchy, ghost like figures floating above are depicting dissociation. When the pain gets too much the child looks down on themselves, believing that it isn't happening to them and watching from above. Trauma can cause out of body experience, dissociation. The works of other alters can be seen under Kim Noble, Bonny Noble, Golden Dawn, Judy Ash, Patricia King, and M.J.

            Elon Musk may also be a creep (transhumanism, Grimes) but his recollection of Epstein's house revealed that Epstein is a collector of "weird art", which is saying something if Musk thinks it's weird. Is it art as weird as Tony Podesta's collection? EXACTLY WHICH WEIRD ART HAS EPSTEIN COLLECTED?
           </p>
           <p>
            Musk: “I don’t recall introducing Epstein to anyone, as I don’t know the guy well enough to do so, Epstein is obviously a creep and Zuckerberg is not a friend of mine. Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing. We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.”

           <p>
            Is there a compendium of all the specific and confirmed art world connections of Pizzagate? If not, let's make this thread such a thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, we have the pieces in Tony Podesta's collection that we know about:
           </p>
           <p>
            · BILJAN DJURDJEVIC's paintings of murdered children. (Tony Podesta owns at least two, prominently featured, given their own corner, with chairs facing them. He may also collect Djurdjevic's paintings of living children being tortured/raped, but if so he was only willing to show off those other two to the press. Still, what kind of psychotic cunt would invite his houseguests -- including his guests' kids! -- to sit down and enjoy staring at the corpses of children?)
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              KATY GRANNAN's photos of naked teenagers. (Tony Podesta has several hung together in his house. Again, what kind of depraved fuck would proudly hang photos of naked teenagers around the house?)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              ANNA GASKELL's photo of a menacing adult hand squeezing the abdomen of what appears to be a young child in diapers. (Tony Podesta was so happy with this one he gave it a place of honor in his staircase. Again: What kind of demented asshole does that? Also note: Gaskell herself is implicated in the deadly drama of Theresa Duncan &amp; Jeremy Blake.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              LOUISE BOURGEOIS's "Arch of Hysteria", a golden decapitated dead body suspended from the ceiling. (Tony Podesta's prize possession. May or may not be related to a Jeffrey Dahmer victim. Regardless, it's a decapitated dead body. Sure as hell doesn't look like the 1890-whatever study Bourgeois supposedly based it on.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Painting [not sure of artist or title, something like Having a Friend Over for Dinner] of two cannibals beginning to eat a dead man spread out on a table. (Loaned by Tony Podesta to his brother John, who hung it in Hillary Clinton's headquarters. Also note: John chose to buy a vacation condo 50 feet from where the Donner Party ate each other.)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I'm assuming I've missed a few.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will add more as needed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the social connections:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              MARINA ABRAMOVIC's emailed invitation to Tony and John Podesta to attend a "Spirit Cooking dinner" at her place. (Abramovic also being responsible for art involving pentagrams, bloody goat's heads, mock cannibalism, etc.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              MoMA chairman LEON BLACK's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. (His name is in Epstein's black book, he named Epstein director of his family foundation, he's been observed socializing with Epstein twice since Epstein was convicted.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              LEAH KLEMAN, art dealer who sold Epstein art. (WHICH ART?)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            More names:

             For sure. Seymour for some time was Victoria’s Secret hottest model. She may have  had contact with Wexner. Limited has license to breeze their products through customs without scrutiny. I’m sure Wexner has bought and sold tons of “art”.

            I often use the flippant analogy of Mr. Corleone.  Mr. Corleone ostensibly runs a small pizza parlour and a small Italian restaurant.  Yet with the income from these businesses, he's able to live in a $4.2 million mansion, bankroll B movies and maintain an exclusive museum which is not open to the public and is accessible by invitation only.  He also is listed in the top 50 most influential people in the nation's capital and has a lot of heavy political and media connections.  Is it possible that Mr. Corleone is in the Mafia?  He certainly warrants a closer look!

            There are probably hundreds of articles in the archives about the links between Satanic Art and the Global Pedophile/Snuff ring. Message me if you have any questions, I've probably read about two hundred books tracking down the history of this stuff.

            The crazy thing is that virtually EVERY artist Tony Podesta featured in his home has disproportionate connections to Luciferianism, intelligence, missing children's agencies and even MK Ultra. More work can be done on Tony Podestas contributions to Italian art foundations.

            The banana taped to a wall was bought by billionaire Billy Cox, the Bancroft heir who sold Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal to News Corp in 2007. The Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan is the same guy who made the anti-Trump gold toilet which was stolen from Blenheim Palace. The banana purchase could easily be a payoff from the proceeds of the theft of the toilet or insurance fraud of same. No proof though.

             The Bancrofts are a family of publicly reclusive Boston socialites who inherited The Wall Street Journal from Clarence W. Barron, who as a publisher built up the reputation of that newspaper.[1] Upon Barron's death in 1928, control of the company passed to his stepdaughters Jane and Martha, children of his wife, Jessie Waldron. Barron's son-in-law and Jane's husband, Harvard-educated lawyer Hugh Bancroft (1879-1933), ran the company and the paper for the next five years. Suffering from depression, Bancroft committed suicide in 1933 at the age of 54. The family members maintained ownership of the company through ensuing generations, though management was placed in the hands of capable professionals, like Journal editor Bernard Kilgore.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             A notable family member of the following generation was
             <strong>
              Mary Bancroft
             </strong>
             (1903-1997), Hugh Bancroft's only daughter by his first marriage to Mary Agnes Cogan (1879-1903).
             <strong>
              She worked for U.S. intelligence in Switzerland during World War II.
             </strong>
             [3][4] She wrote novels and a memoir, Autobiography of a Spy,[5] before dying in 1997 at age ninety-three. She was survived by six grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jane Bancroft's daughter Jessie Bancroft Cox was another prominent member of the second generation. Her husband, son, and grandson — William C. Cox,
             <strong>
              Bill Cox Jr
             </strong>
             ., and Billy Cox III, respectively — were "the only Bancrofts to have actually worked at Dow Jones since Hugh Bancroft's suicide."

               Mary Bancroft recalled that the emotionally dead Dulles’s favorite word was “useful.” People were only good to him if they were useful. His daughter Joan told Talbot that her father was “clearly not interested in us.” A grinning Dulles once told Mary that his feigned bonhomie, his avuncular demeanor, and trusting attitude toward people were an act. He said, “I like to watch the little mice sniffing at the cheese just before they venture into the little trap. I like to see their expressions when it snaps shut, breaking their little necks.”

               ..Ruth Paine was the Dallas housewife who had befriended Marina Oswald and taken her—and Lee Harvey on weekends—to live with her. She was the key witness for the Warren Commission. It was at her home where incriminating evidence against Oswald was found. The Paine’s connection to the CIA, Dulles’s network, and other CIA operations, confirmed by excellent researchers in great detail, escapes him, although he does note their connection to Mary Bancroft, Dulles’s former mistress. Of the Paines he writes, “In their immaculate innocence, the Paines played right into the hands of those who were manipulating Oswald.” I’m afraid Talbot is the innocent here. The Paines are very important figures in the assassination and seeing them clearly would add to his powerful thesis. Perhaps he was tired at this point in his pursuit of the satanic Dulles.
