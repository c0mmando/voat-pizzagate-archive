            You people amaze me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here again we have someone A) admitting that he’s a pedophile and B) we have SEVERAL YEARS of discussions on Wikipedia and elsewhere confirming he is, as well as C) several years of other incidents, such as serving 16 months in prison for threatening to assassinate President Bush and/or Obama in 2008, suggesting this guy has a long established history of being crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            And there’s ZERO OUTRAGE from you. Instead, you immediately assume the CIA is doing this to make Republicans look bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though 1) the guy is a LIBERTARIAN running as an INDEPENDENT. NO CREDIBLE SOURCE EVER SAID HE’S A REPUBLICAN. Why would the CIA spend over a decade setting up a guy to look like a Republican, and not have him call himself a Republican? That makes absolutely no sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus 2) This guy is in a minor election in Charlottesville and no one nationally is going to notice or remember. 3) If they do notice, they’re going to think this is just one isolated lunatic. 4) The CIA and FBI are full of ex-military, law enforcement, gun carrying, pro-America REPUBLICANS. 5) Before Trump, there is zero history of the CIA or FBI ever trying to make Republicans look bad. 6) There is however evidence suggesting the CIA worked against JFK (a Democrat), because he was WEAK ON USING THE MILITARY in their opinion. 7) Besides, this guy is a 37 year old white male accountant from southwestern Virginia. How do you think he’s going to vote? Statistically, he most likely voted for Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to mention, if Nasal Ant Horn is someone named Nathan Larson? That's a rather common name. I myself happen to know at least one other person in the Virginia area named that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And hey, if the CIA was running a false flag operation, trying to establish Nathan Larson as a pedophile Republican, and were trying to secretly infiltrate conservative message boards,  would they use Nathan Larson's real name, thus ruining his reputation for life? Would they use an anagram of that name as the username on the conservative message board? Would they use the same username across multiple other user boards, including non-Chan video gaming boards? That seems too idiotic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus there are plenty of actual extreme Republicans running for and holding office today. The CIA has no need to make up fake Republicans. There are at least as many Republicans being tainted with pedophilia, sexual improprieties or other scandals as compared to Democrats, if not more. If you really cared about pedophilia and misconduct with children and others, you would focus equally on both parties. But you don’t.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that the FBI and the law enforcement officers in it are extremely against pedophilia. We know this from their numerous arrests and prosecutions of pedophiles. How many law enforcement officers do you know that are for defending and hiding pedophiles? The FBI people who work on child pornography cases say those are among the most emotionally draining for them. Having to look at, catalog and describe pictures of children being sexually assaulted is difficult for them. But they do it anyways, because they hate child sexual abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you believe this guy is a false flag? Because 1) you want to believe it, because you’re right wingers who fear and hate liberals. Also 2) because “Anonymous” on one of the Chan boards said so. Even though we KNOW from discussions on the Chan boards that the right wingers there make up fake news stories and memes as false flags.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything you disagree with is immediately dismissed as being a CIA operation. Without even a shred of evidence. Just a hunch. None of those allegations are even proven. Now what is more likely — that the CIA has spent years making something up (including paying Nathan to make many many Wikipedia edits about Lolita), or “Anonymous” on the Chan sites is? What is more likely — that the CIA is trying to make Republicans look bad (using an Independent Libertarian), or that paranoid right-wing conspiracy theorists on Chan are mistakenly linking a pedophile to the CIA? We know who this pedophile is and what his comment history is, do we know this about “Anonymous”?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is “Anonymous” on Chan essentially defending a pedophile? Saying he isn’t a pedophile, when he ADMITTED he’s a pedophile? Would someone working for the CIA admit to being a pedophile, using his real name? And serve 18 months in prison for his job? Isn’t this reprehensible that one of your own, a Chan right wing conspiracy theorist, would divert blame and attention away from an admitted pedophile and towards the US CIA for partisan reasons? Some of these people very clearly value Republican Party politicians more than they value America, or truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s amazing that you seem to think you’re on a quest for truth and evidence. There are very clearly so many fallacies and biases here, especially confirmation bias, that there is little to nothing resembling objective truth or real evidence on this board. Occam’s razor is NEVER used to determine the most probable explanation, in favor of very improbable explanations (grand goverrnment-wide and global conspiracies extending to Hollywood).
           </p>
           <p>
            The specific kinds of leaps of “evidence” made on this board are not methods used as evidence by actual investigators of truth (like law enforcement, scientists, doctors, or experts in any field). "Evidence" like anagrams, signs and symbols of things that sane people would say are entirely unconnected. The use of Urban Dictionary to find unrelated sexual and other terms. Pulling in unrelated tweets by celebrities like Roseanne, Barbra Streisand, etc. Assuming that tweets by Hillary against child abuse are FOR child abuse. The feeling that there are hidden connections throughout the universe, hidden in words. These things all strongly resemble schizophrenia or similar.
           </p>
           <p>
            And where’s my evidence? Here it comes. The users Leucosticte and Nasal Ant Horn are clearly two different people. If you copy and paste known writing samples from both into any of the various Language Style Matching or independent language analysis web sites out there, the analysis engine shows the language style used is statistically different and unlikely to come from a single person.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can even see this yourself below, just by looking. Leucosticte has a worse grasp of writing correctly. He uses rambling run-on sentences over half the time, and misuses commas. Nasal Ant Horn on the other hand frequently uses “quotation marks,” especially to show sarcasm or doubt. His sentences are shorter, properly formed, thought out, more clear, more easily read. The subject matter and terms discussed by the two usernames are also different.
           </p>

            LEUCOSTICTE: "I'm not too familiar with the norms around here. Sometimes policy can say one thing, and practice can be quite another. Are one-sided polemics considered okay for inclusion? I figure, someone can create another book with polemics from the opposing viewpoint, so in that way, balance between different arguments can be achieved.
           </p>
           <p>
            On some Wikimedia wikis, the topic of adult-child sexual relationships is so touchy that even advocating that this type of content be included could be considered grounds for banning the user. I don't see any such policy here, but I'm not in a mood to get banned, so I thought I'd ask first. Also, even if the reaction wouldn't be a ban, I don't like to create content that's just going to be deleted."

            NASAL ANT HORN:  "Someone sent Spartaz an email which he sent to ArbCom. Thats exactly what he should have done. But you decided to start a thread with hyperbolic references to "security risks" and your position in the military. I'm not targeting you, just responding to your silly comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no threat, implied or otherwise. Please stop with the hysterics. And I've got nothing to do with this subject or this deletion discussion. I was just responding to the thread.

            For fuck's sake, Steven, your userpage links to your website. You can't link to your website where you identify yourself and then complain about some alleged doxing. If you are concerned that there is a "security risk" because you are a "military member", don't link to your website. Better yet, stop being involved with GamerGate and "incel" before your commanding officer figures out what type of folks you hang out with on the internet and decides that youare the security risk.

            Oh my, what a mess. OSMOND PHILLIPS gives us a longwinded proof that photo is a genuine image of Virgil Earp. Sadly, he has flubbed even the most basic research, the image in question was nottaken by William Latour, but by one of his sons. Judging from the mounting used, it is likely later than 1905, it may be Virgil Earp, but it most probably isn't."

             That's a lot to read, but you lost me when you asked questions that a tiny bit of logic answers. For example: why would the CIA spend 10 years...." Who said they had to? Maybe he just did this himself and if the CIA is even involved they said hey look at this useful idiot with a perfect backstory of 10 years we can use. If you're not able to make that logical of a deduction why should I continue to read the rest?

              I think you know that saying "I disagree with the first thing you said, so why should I bother reading the rest?" is pretty silly.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you'd read further, you might have realized that absurd assumption was not mine. That sentence was me responding to the 4+ comments (~20%) saying this guy was only
              <em>
               pretending
              </em>
              to be right wing and a pedophile. I was saying that relies on absurd assumptions, and you apparently agree with me on that.
             </p>
             <p>
              None of the scenarios here make any sense to me. The scenario that seems most likely is that this guy really is a Libertarian and pedophile. And that MAYBE the left MIGHT link him to the alt-right. But the latter isn't a conspiracy. And so what? I suppose it's your right to try to second guess what the left might or might not say, but it seems like a waste of time. Especially as there's not much you can do or need to do.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be fair, this Larson guy does use terms he likely got from reading alt-right message boards. BUT, most sane people will realize his pedophilia is an anomaly that is not linked to the right wing beliefs that he or others have. If anyone tried to link his pedophilia to the right wing, it would not stick.

               Okay sorry for being confused. Was the statement about the FBI caring about stopping pedophilia yours? Hard to tell what was a quote. I agree there are a lot of legit FBI officers, but there are crooked ones as well. There is an internal struggle I believe there.

             He has a traceable history going back over 10 years, spent 16 months in prison in 2008, and he says he's a Libertarian running as an Independent. If the CIA wanted to make Republicans or the alt-right look bad, why would they spend 10 years doing it and never once use the terms Republican or alt-right?

              they will use him to smear the alt right and conservatives. that is what i predict. idk why you think they wouldnt. as if the persons history matters at all. the avg person wont care as long as he is presented as alt right or white nationalist.

              and he doesnt have to have been their pawn the entire time or technically even now. his impact will be the same.

              <p>
               Except he and the the CIA never identified him as alt right, only as an Independent and a Libertarian. Whut?

               Is the CIA trying to make Libertarians look bad? Or Independents? Why would they do so? Are you aware the CIA is predominately Republican and always supports the pro-military candidate?

            Isn't that what we've said the goal was?

           <p>
            He's only helping normalize these perv/nuts. He seems an extremist right now, but then in a couple of years, a ''nicer'' version with a toned down attitude will run and it'll be like, ''Oh, he's a pedophile, but pro globalization and women's rights so he's not that bad.''
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, he is that bad, but there's a whole LGBT community out there. First phase is in place, and they want to screw kids and have Singer pool parties. Yeah, remember how they only wanted the right to marry? No, that's not all they wanted because now PedoWood is using hormone blockers on THREE-YEAR-OLDS!

            We've got to get back to morality. I don't care if a woman loves a woman or a man has sex with another adult man, but what's happening is disgraceful and harmful. It's part of a vanguard ... just like Raniere's nickname.

            Nathan Larson, a 37-year-old accountant from Charlottesville, Virginia, is running for Congress as an independent candidate in his native state. He is also a pedophile, as he admitted to HuffPost on Thursday, who has bragged in website posts about raping his late ex-wife.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a phone call, Larson confirmed that he created the now-defunct websites suiped.org and incelocalypse.today ― chat rooms that served as gathering places for pedophiles and violence-minded misogynists like himself. HuffPost contacted Larson after confirming that his campaign website shared an IP address with these forums, among others. His sites were terminated by their domain host on Tuesday
