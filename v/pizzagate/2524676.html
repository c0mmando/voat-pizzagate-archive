<p>Danielle D. Roberts, a 36-year-old family doctor, has been identified in multiple  media accounts as a leader of Nxivm, a controversial self-help group. Some female members were brainwashed by founder Keith Raniere, branded with his initials and coerced into having sex with him, authorities say. </p>
<p>Records show Roberts has worked in recent years at St. Mary\'s, Columbia St. Mary\'s Ozaukee in Mequon and Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Hospital.</p>
<p>Caryn Kaufman, a spokeswoman for Ascension Wisconsin, said Roberts was never employed directly by St. Mary\'s but worked for a staffing agency that provided temporary workers for the hospital. Ascension owns St. Mary\'s and its affiliates. </p>
<p>“As soon as we learned of her alleged behavior in New York, we immediately notified the placement agency and revoked approval of Danielle Roberts for any future assignments at any of our sites of care,&quot; Kaufman said</p>
<p>Ascension officials, however, did not say when Roberts began filling in at St. Mary\'s or when she was dropped. They also did not disclose how many hours a month she put in at the three facilities.</p>
<p>Roberts\' resumé says she began working in Wisconsin six years ago. She first received a temporary medical license here in January 2013 and a standard one three months later. Her Wisconsin credentials expired in February. She is still licensed in New York. </p>
<p>A May 2016 posting on an internal St. Mary\'s message board listed Roberts as one of seven doctors and other health care officials who &quot;have joined the Medical or Allied Health staff at one or more (Columbia St. Mary\'s) facility.&quot;</p>
<p>Dorsey said Roberts told him that she worked at St. Mary\'s one week a month. </p>
<p>During one of their conversations, Dorsey said, the doctor talked up an &quot;amazing guy&quot; who was leading some New York seminars. He took her card and later got a text from Roberts.</p>
<p>But what struck Dorsey the most, he said, was the doctor\'s &quot;disheveled appearance&quot; and the fact that she seemed to be operating in &quot;some kind of a haze.&quot; On his final day in the hospital, he searched her name online, finding out about her ties to Raniere and the allegations that she branded his followers.</p>
<p>He said he then filed a complaint on St. Mary\'s website, linking to a news story on the sex cult and Roberts. In response, he got a note thanking him for the information and vowing to follow up. The note had a request for confidentiality. He has heard nothing since.</p>

<p>Not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but <a href="https://voat.co/user/fogdryer">@fogdryer</a> has been working on Milwaukee and Racine Wi Hospitals and The Catholic Church</p>
<p>I know a lot of the Catholic Hospitals in this area have been taken over by Ascension</p>
<p>hopefully <a href="https://voat.co/user/fogdryer">@fogdryer</a> will have something more on this </p>
<p>Medical helicopter crash kills 3 in Wisconsin</p>
<p>Skies were clear with calm winds and good visibility at the time of the crash, with temperatures near 32 degrees, according to ABC News meteorologists. </p>
<p>In a joint statement, Air Methods and Ascension Wisconsin said it is &quot;deeply saddened and mourning the loss of three teammates who were aboard the air medical helicopter that went down in Hazelhurst, Wisconsin, on April 26</p>

            Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, NXIVM, Epstein trial part 2 coming up... that’s not small potatoes. Watergate took a looong time for a result, meanwhile the war raged and JFK’s murder was ignored. Take heart friends, the results of our determination are starting to blossom.

             Weinstein, and Lauer have nothing to do with child traficking and child murder. Stop mixing unrelated things in. Spacey is a creep for sure.This site is about the systematic rape torture and murder of children, done by the establishment. Weinsteon and Lauer have zero to do with that. Some in here are mixing them in, and saying that their exposure proves Trump is exposing PG. This is intentional nonsense.

              I disagree. I think that Weinstein’s situation is a result of pizzagate, although likely some form of appeasement. His spirit cooking and the rumors of child trafficking are enough for me to give nominal attention to the more solid reports. I would hate to see a flood of every accusation and “metoo” belch get posted here, so I totally get your point.

            'But what struck Dorsey the most, he said, was the doctor's "disheveled appearance" and the fact that she seemed to be operating in "some kind of a haze."' Sounds like substance abuse or mental health issues, on top of being in a cult.

             Smart and sensible people can get sucked into scams and cults. The scammer usually offers love, acceptance, encouragement, enlightenment, hope, or promises of a brighter future. At the outset, the scammer and his or her group often seem nice and reasonable. It's often all positive at first. Once the victim trusts the scammer, the brainwashing, control, and abuse start, little by little. The victim thinks they're dealing with a good person who cares about them and has a lot to offer them if they can stick it out, so when things start seeming weird, they often give them the benefit of the doubt. As they invest more time, energy, and money, they become more reluctant to acknowledge they've been scammed. Like a gambler, they keep investing more and more, hoping all their time and effort will eventually pay off. By the time they realize it's an abusive situation that will never yield any kind of positive outcome, they're often trapped or feel trapped, drained of energy, money, resources, self-esteem, and outside support.

              I suppose you're right. That would really suck. I have a relative who actually shelled out money to do one of those silly-ass hot coal walks. But she also gave herself diverticulitis and pancreatitis trying to do a 40-day juice fast, so...Darwin Award winner.

             It lends credence to the idea that elite families raise ‘em different. Did you read the detail about elite moms putting clothespins on babies’ fingers to make ‘em cry? Then they leave them in the crib until the crying stops altogether. Training them early to snuff out hope, empathy, expectations of love, etc. Don’t worry, we are just as alien to them as they are to us, IMO.

               I think it was in a larger book that I was reading about MKUltra and ritual abuse. The first chapter was about ritual abuse in historical/anthropological contexts.

               I don’t think it was one of these, though. The book I’m thinking of was 3-400 pages.

               Lloyd This report has been developed from information provided from sources. For their protection, they are unnamed. It is up to the reader to judge whether the information presented is factual or not.]
              </p>
              <p>
               Former TV actress Allison Mack recently founded a 
women’s group called DOS [Dominant Over Submissive] where women are branded with a cauterizing iron to form a scar spelling K-R-A-M — the initials of Keith Raniere and Miss Mack.
              </p>
              <p>
               The mark is burned into the women’s skin similarly to how the hide of an animal is branded with a hot iron. The branding is performed without anesthesia by Dr. Danielle Roberts MD.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the human skin is more fragile than a bull’s rawhide, great care is taken by Dr. Roberts to ensure safety. As a licensed medical doctor, she knows how to prevent tools from cutting too deep, burning too hot, or burning too long.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because of the intense pain, four naked women are employed to hold the branded woman – who is also naked – in place.
              </p>
              <p>
               The naked women are exposed to some health risks since, during branding, it is possible for diseases to be transmitted through the air, from the skin, when the skin is burning.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because it is not uncommon for an infection to develop around a branded wound, Dr. Roberts has made herself available to consult with the women offering advice on how to reduce blistering.
              </p>
              <p>
               The branding can feel and respond like a large scab with significant itching. Dr. Roberts advises women to keep their scars clean by using antibacterial solutions or soaps often.
              </p>
              <p>
               DOS members are thankful for Dr. Robert’s aid. Branding is not nearly as popular as tattooing, and it is hard to find any doctor willing to brand humans since their medical license may be at risk in the event of a complaint or accident.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. Roberts attendance makes the entire branding process possible and without her it might be impossible to offer the assurances necessary for the women, Miss Mack or Mr. Raniere to risk the dangerous and painful procedure.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ultimately, branding is seen by Miss Mack as an act of submission by the woman being branded to her and Mr. Raniere.
              </p>
              <p>
               While it is painful, Mr. Raniere teaches that the pain the women feel should be equated to love and understood as the kind that builds character and discipline in a woman.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr. Raniere teaches that love is pain.
              </p>
              <p>
               “True love is physically painful,” Mr. Raniere teaches.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. Roberts has written of Mr. Raniere’s teachings for women as “something profound… something bigger than yourself.”

                Love is pain. Tom Petty's daughter was mumbling about that. Typical occult mind fudging. Love is not pain. Love is love, those that love pain or love giving pain have a fetish. Fetish is ok if both are willing. Sex slaves are not willing. They are enslaved, choices taken away, forced to service strangers. These people are grotesque and should be exterminated.

                I have never enjoyed thinking about hurting people.  But these people are another story entirely.  Let's show them a little of their "True Love".   So he thinks it is equated to love?  I think it shows their submission to being drugged and brainwashed by a Perverted Svengali.  He is only a Ruse.  He is running it all for others.  Others that are profiting by other's pain.  Let's not even think about what is being done with those children learning how to not speak the language of their parents.  This is all so very sick.  Thank God we are exposing Rainbow Cultural Garden as well.
