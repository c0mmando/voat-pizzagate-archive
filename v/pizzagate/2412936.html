            Here's a recent incident "Cops searching for girl, 16, who used a dating website to lure five victims to a Bronx apartment where they were jumped and robbed by three men".
           </p>
           <p>
            In this case a 16-year old used a dating website to lure men 19-37. The article does say her age was listed as 20 on the website.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm assuming she revealed her real age or even pretended to be younger. The way this would work then, the victims wouldn't go to the cops, because they are meeting an underage girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your case could possibly be similar, they figured they could rob you and you would be embarrassed to go to the cops, didn't want your folks to know, etc.

               haha at the time I thought so to myself! Looking back now I'm like oh god lmao. I'm glad I didn't ether, I always had good sense in looking twice at the world. It's how I discovered Pizzagate, not just debunking it some conspiracy without looking into it first.

            It's good that you're positing this but why in all of the intervening years didn't you go to the police and report her? Think of all of the kids she probably molested (or killed) - she could have been a front for people who abduct kids.

             I was 14 and at the time and nervous around girls. I had lied about having sex I was a virgin and excited talking to her. I just was too nervous to meet her even though we actually spoke on the phone as well a few times. Someone was speaking to me all those times. I wanted to meet her but the thought that she was fake was in the back of my head. I just ignored her when she began asking to hang more and getting upset and didn't think anything of it. She called a few times over the next two years and even had long deleted voicemails from a long busted cell phone. I went on with my life and got into college eventually where I am now 7 years later I just never told anyone but my best friend and my brother now who said I was an idiot for almost making my mom drop me off at some random woman's house and I agree. Like I said being here the last year made me open my eyes to alot of things of this world.

            I worked with this one serial killer who mined his victims' address books. Sometimes he'd find new victims that way; the other use was to spread a false story about where the victim went. Oh, this guy offered her a job in New York, she went hiking, he saw her get in the car with a bushy haired guy; three actual examples from his case.

             @gamepwn
            </a>
            , thanks for this post! It's good to raise awareness about how trafficking gangs might use Social Media sites to lure kids in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since you said you have still proof of communication with this 'lady', would you please add links to screenshots of these? Please make sure to black out anything that might doxx you, though, like your name, phone number, home address, email etc. Thanks!
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I'd like to ask you to add some links to older threads to e.g. Twitter actually storing every DM, and nude pics, even of kids and teenagers! You could also add links to examples where trafficking gangs used FB or other social media sites to lure in kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might want to combine this with adding a sentence or two with the hypothesis that social media sites like Twitter might have been set up by the elites in the first place to, among other purposes, collect nude pics of kids.
           </p>

            This way the post would adhere to Rule 1.

              , if you edit this Rule 1 relevance material ^^^ into your post, I will change your flair to "Potential Lead" and we won't have to take it down. Maybe some folks on this board will give Miss Kira a free Voat colonoscopy. ;-)  Reply to this comment when you've done it.

               No, the ellipsis (three dots) means something was omitted in your sentence. This is traditional and common practice. To me the most important thing is you were soliciting "nude pics, even of kids and teenagers!" You even put 'even' and an exclamation point, as if this is an exciting thing. Very sketchy.
              </p>
              <p>
               In cases like this where your edit destroys the evidence of what I quoted it would have been more honorable to leave it intact and added an "Edit:" comment explaining further.

               That's it sadly, all of our conversations after were over text. At the time I had my cell number on my FB under about and she started texting and we started having calls after that. I wish I still had those texts but there from my old old old phone. I wish I had the damn address she sent me three times telling me to come to.

             There's about 19 mutual friends she has on there all guys. We're all older now and I didn't really know any of these people I just went to High School with them and saw many of them around/had a class or two. I knew two of them as sorta friends she started talking to, I can ask them.

              Might be interesting, I don't think it would expose you to danger to talk to them. You could offer up how it went with you and ask what she was all about.

            OP, you mentioned she gave you her address when you refused to disclose where you were? Do you still have the address? Did you ever do any research on the location? You can find many ppl here that have skills in digging to identify this person. I believe your gut was spot-on. Too many children are taken by highly organized groups that infiltrate communities. They have a network of connections so sophisticated that victims can be swiped in broad daylight; clues, trails gone &amp; the child is never heard from again. 
I encourage you to share your story &amp; insight. Many ppl are so clueless as to the evils lurking everywhere. You are wise beyond your years!

             "You are wise beyond your years." I'll second this. I applaud your strength to listen to your gut instinct. It sounds like a huge temptation for a 14 year old in today's society. (I'm not trying to put down other victims who do comply, in any way.)

             Jesus I hope not. Like I said she's not added anymore on my friends list but two years of randomly trying to get me to talk to her once I stopped including calling my phone often. I had alot of personal and intimate conversations with "her" on the phone. I haven't heard anything since 2013.

              I wouldn't worry about anything further, especially after 5 years. From what you've written it seems your not giving up your address was a sticking point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Usually these sorts of Internet scams can even be international. However in this case her giving a local address and wanting yours implies she actually is local. In that case, since this person definitely broke the law sending you porn and soliciting child porn from you, this is something you could report to local authorities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally I wouldn't harp on the sex trafficking angle too much to authorities. It's possible, worth mentioning, but indeed 'anything could be possible' as far as her real intentions.

                apparently spoke to the texting person.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fortunately you can detect a lot of phishing schemes by bad, obviously non-native English syntax.

                This case has me intrigued actually. We've determined it's not the girl in the photos. Sometimes it's not even a girl, but OP spoke to a woman. Often they are not really local, just want photos, try to get you sign up with some site, or some other kind of scam, but providing a local address and wanting OP's address suggests they are local. I guess it's possible it's just actually an older woman preying on young boys. But if OP went to the provided address wouldn't he at once realize this is not the same woman?

            Besides possibly being a trafficker, she could be a serial pedophile stalker.  You could have ended up dead and possibly ended up in a Snuff Film or died by SRA.  The fact that she was after you for so long, points to her possibly having a sexual attraction to teens and you.  The fact that she is adding your friends on FB is scary as well.  Do your friends have pics of their sisters or brothers on their FB?  She is a Serious Threat.  I would think about making sure your friends are warned about her.  I am genuinely Scared for you. You should make sure they block her.  Have you blocked her?  If not you immediately should and report her to the FBI.

              She is trouble.  It is so obvious and the less you have to do with her the better.  If you can't inform the others, at least block her before she has contact with one of your friends and gets your location.  These people are very tricky they know how to get around people to get information.  This should be staring you right in the face.  You know how we all talk about how things are hiding in plain sight?  Well this is one of those times.

              I know.  I know, what you mean.  But if anything happens he has recourse.  Otherwise, like I said there is reason to protect himself and others by notifying them.  She is def not just looking for a date.

             Some of them do, many of them are still added. I'm from Florida and notice many of them added are also from Florida. I never told anyone but my friend but to see all those people still added it creepy. No I havent, I just deleted her from friends list but the coversations and the photos I sitll have. I still have messeges of her repeatingly trying to get my adress or get me to come to hers.

              She needs to be reported.  You or others may still be in danger.  As far as her trying to come on to you, that's not strange in any way, but her persistence is icky, really.  She is older now too so is she still going after 14 yr olds as well?  She surely can tell you have not deleted or blocked her.  You are sending her the wrong message.

               Yes. Usually these trap sites ask for nude pics of teenagers (which is bad enough), but trying to lure someone to a specific address is even more disconcerting.

                The fact that she is friending his friends is sick.  Really sick and she won't let go of him.  This is obvious to me.

                I'm ashamed to say I sent a few nudes myself (didn't show my face) when she asked. I really thought I was talking to this beautiful woman like an idiot. I remember keeping my cell phone away from my parents and brothers. I was in contact with "her" for a year.

                 , no worries! There are literally thousands of teenagers who do the same, and how should they know? Five years ago, at least as far as I recall, nobody talked about this stuff (trafficking gangs demanding pictures of underage boys/girls).
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'd say be prould that even at that young age your gut feeling was really working well, when it came to meeting 'her'. You did great!

            Maybe a ped, or maybe it was a real chick. I'd say the clincher for me would be what did she look like? If it was a pedo or kidnapper then the scam would have been to send pics of an unrealisticly hot looking girl.. If she was kinda average and normal then it was probably a real girl.

             That's her in the FB there, real woman on the phone I would talk to and message. She sent me quite a few pictures of herself nude and stuff. She would call my cell all the time. However I just don't know why I guess my senses came to me and I never went and ended up ignoring it. I remember having regret thinking I missed my chance to be with a older woman but after everything with Pizzagate It's been on my mind. She ended up getting angry I wouldn't come or give me an address to come to me.

              Oh I didn't see the link before. Yeah after looking for just a few seconds I would put everything I've got on it that's not the girl behind the fb page, and if it is she is running a scam to rob you or some shit. I'd say you were smart not to go round there for sure.

               Also it's suspicious that her only web presence seems to be Facebook. (To check, search with full name in quotes "Kira Angela James". Perhaps 'she' doesn't always use her full name, I still couldn't find any "Kira James" in Maryland.)

               Was she still attending Coppin State University back in 2011? I looked it up, it's 'historically black', from pictures I found mostly black.

               I'm not sure what kind of scam this was. A female friend of mine got tricked by some guy on FB. She was getting all sorts of romantic feelings. In the end, he pestered her for cash, he was stuck in some foreign country.
