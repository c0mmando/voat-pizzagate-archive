            Unfortunately victims of this kind of abuse often develop Stockholm syndrome and turn into the next generation of abusers.
Good luck with that.

            Once a paedophile, always a paedophile. The notion of a "change of heart" is absurd. It's an illness, an incurable disease. These people must be put down or put away. Before they succumb yet again to their addiction and eventually harm our children.

             I know there is no way of reversing a pedosadist but I was thinking of people who were blackmailed in against their will. As in, "You have seen too much, now cooperate or else I will kill your whole family." Yeah I know there's no way to tell the difference.

            An important message is "WE WILL LISTEN" and "WE WILL BELIEVE YOUR STORY". So many of them dont come forward because people call them insane. But there needs to be a way of them being anonymous yet verified. Maybe they could contact one of the reputable mods and tee up an anonymous AMA.

            Sadly law enforcement and the legal system are already infiltrated and contaminated.  I agree that there would also be a planned disinformation campaign with false claims.  I don't know how you'd structure this amnesty situation you envisage.  You'd have to come up with something new.

            A Christmas miracle! Jesus was very clear about the children needing to be put first, and I can think of no better application of that necessity than now.  I actually feel that Christmas represents the better world, we could have all the time, if not for these plagues, that are becoming more defined, and easier to see now. If not Christmas; New year's? and every New year's after that. Was kind of an empty celebration otherwise. What is the use of any New years resolutions, while the main one, to all of us, remains unaddressed? Let us do what we can, to make sure children are safe, and then we can have new year to celebrate. The vast majority of us, want a better world, and would have it, if not for these unbecoming elements.

            This is an interesting idea but would need extremely well thought out plans. Mainly for the protection and safety of the victims. I definitely wouldn't do it before Inauguration Day!  Like others have said, you would want experts ready to help with therapy etc, and I would assume a safe place for victims to stay if needed. This idea would possibly even require an official 501c3.
Is there not already non-profits out there like this?

            This is a great idea, and further provide linkage through credible witness/victim. However, just as in the boystown Nebraska deal where nothing ever came to fruition because there are too many parties responsible and too many willing hitmen they could call to save their collective asses, we need people in law enforcement that we can trust that haven't already been tainted or are in some way already affiliated. It's like a virus, usually once the psychotic split (dissociative) has occured, that core personality that once was prominent becomes transient and they begin to create other characters to justify the split and these characters become the prominent ones and it is these characters which enjoy the act of pedophilia in order to be in accordance with the activity such as in prison sex when the victim becomes the flamboyantly 'gay' character to cope with being that. In other words, once an adult diddles a child repeatedly, most often the child grows up to be a pedophile. It's sick. These people are sick. Fuck.

            Yes! I think an important element should be forgiveness if they knew of or helped cover up these crimes in the past.

            For example, it's very possible Obama started his presidency with good intentions, but got threatened and indoctrinated into going with the program. Could be why his hair turned grey. This investigation only gave us a glimpse behind the scenes, we still don't know the whole picture and who the ring-leaders are. Is our goal to get hate boners and attack everyone partially involved, or to actually end the atrocity?

            If anyone in Washington has just a smidgen of a moral compass, they'd be happy to use a day they can come forward and confess their sins. And we need to consider that some people that look guilty as hell could be victims of bigger forces.

             Attempting to tie the Obamas to this investigation, without (and even with) rock-solid documentation, is risk of losing potential support from ordinary, left-/socialist-leaning people. I'm basing this on my own tiny experience. Approx 10% of my FB friends simply believed BHO was finally going to level their playing field with the "evil 1%." And they STILL believe he would have, if he had not been thwarted at every turn by the "evil right." The ping-pong CPP/White House pic comparison on the NYT article will be one tool these ordinary people use to discredit anything that ties the O family to this investigation, and to equate pizzagate with right-wing conspiracy. Much of their denial and backlash would be in self-defense, due to their eight-years of gushing over the Os. Interestingly, these friends are not even remotely close to that level of enthusiasm in defending HRC, and I have no doubt that's due to the Wikileaks docs.

             Like fbianon said, I bet all the big players are involved at some level, including Obama. That's how they have been able to keep it in secret so well. That's why there is so insane amount of pedophiles among the elite and key roles. They all have some dark secret. They all can be blackmailed.

             I thought come forward day was just about victims. I now see it is about those who are embroiled in this, and even those who want to stop committing these crimes. I am glad you brought that up. i think it is an often overlooked aspect. As terrible as this crime is, the most ideal thing, is for those doing it, to have a change of heart. If it is the fear of punishment that stops them, they should know, that legally, they will be lot better off, if they come clean, than if they get caught, and if they can do anything, to help children who are still in danger, that has to be a big incentive for clemency, I would think. People often do have misgivings about wrong things they do, and there needs to be a realistic goal, of encouraging them to listen to their heart, and do the right thing. I hope come forward day, would be aimed at all people ,who have any information, and all people who have had anything happen to them that they have not reported, for fear of it not being pursued, as well as all those, who want to come clean.  If the priority is the safety of children, then something needs to be done, to assure people that they can speak up about this.

              Your point is valid because the criminal connection of loyalty between these people is so profoundly strong on account of paedophilia placing a perpetrator beyond all society's redemption. And because they are so desperate not to be revealed they will do all kinds of other depravity to avoid being outed
It makes me sick to my stomach but offering some kind of forgiveness may be one way to reveal and stop this.
FUCK! what am I even saying? Forgiveness? When we wouldn't consider forgiving less nefarious crimes? This whole thing is so profoundly fucked up.

               hey you just gave me an idea. Was thinking today. if we make a non sex offender register, we could narrow down the threats to children, in some significant ways. I got the idea, from the Reina Michaelson case. She would interview children at schools and they would come forwards. she found out heaps, by simply going and doing logical things. she had a stipulation in her organisation, that all members had to do a background check for sex crimes, and crimes against children...  Done right, a polygraph, would be an excellent way, for people to show the truth amongst us all. People would volunteer, and I think relish the opportunity to do one, and show, by just a few simple questions. "I have not trafficked children, inappropriately touched them, or killed them, and I do not have not intention to."  I do not know exactly how it works, but it could be huge success. and it has the same sensibility of any quarantine. The main complaint in not stopping this, is not knowing, but it can all be known. Also body language experts are almost as good as polygraphs, and in combination, would be over a hundred percent accurate this simple test should be standard for all positions of responsibility already.

               it is paradoxical thing, but the only thing better than catching a pedophile, is for one,  to stop what they are doing. There should be a greater incentive to do the right thing in all cases, especially this one. One simple case i can think of, is if they have children and let them go, they should be eligible for some kind of clemency, as opposed to covering the crime up, and doing even worse things, which should be de-incentived. I was watching man on fire the other day, just the ending. It reminds me, that I, and most people would do anything they could, even trade their life, for a child's. i hope there is some exploration of this angle, in come forward day.   I also think polygraph day might be a good idea, to hold, if come forward day does not work.

            Nice idea but the government would spam the day with shills and fakes to discredit and call into question anybody that comes forward. Also, it would lead to a lot of fakes accusing enemies of your government. How could you distinguish the lies from truth? And how could you sift through thousands upon thousands of victims and whistleblowers?

             Ideally we'd want to get some high profile people to talk. That'd raise some eyebrows no matter how many shills are spammed.

            It would be a risk, but safety in numbers right?! And if enough came forward, I don't think 'they' would be able to co-ordinate a mass "heart attack/suicide" cover up.

            This is a great idea, can we 'meme' it? We should collab with the mods, as well. I also have extension of a FB group with 6k&gt; members.

            This is a good idea. We need to coordinate with The_Donald, 4chan, and every other group that would help. Everyone upvote this thread to the Top. We need to set a date.

            Indeed, good idea.

            I feel like we're gonna gain more traction soon, possibly after some time of stalling.

            Several things have to be managed, over time, some of which is difficult to do while staying anonymous:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Create a crowdfunding campaign for the investigation of Pizzagate, distribution of info (ads? books, booklets) and organizational infrastructure.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            A project such as helping all the victims/perpetrators to step forward demands a wikileaks-esque type of platform.
