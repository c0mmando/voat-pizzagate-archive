<p>By the Eighties, John Zielinski was a well-known author and photographer. His work had appeared in Life Magazine, The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune and countless other publications. But in a devastating 1984 contract dispute, he lost $50,000 and his professional credibility. Â“This was the opening shot - turning me back into an investigative reporter.Â”</p>
<p>Today Zielinski is the most blacklisted author in the history of Iowa. For 25 years he has dedicated his life to exposing human traffickers, pedophiles, drug dealers and Satanists. But as he says, Â“They donÂ’t kill you unless you become effective.Â” The film traces the rise and fall of a true American original who has sacrificed everything in his quest for justice. Filmmakers Chase Thompson and Ryan Walker tell the story without voice over, using 47 years of source material, new interviews and music by Mark Speckman.</p>

            Please see professor Tom Philipot's documentary on Youtube, "Boys for Sale." It was filmed by an award winning news station in Atlanta before the media changed sides.

            Professor Philipot was suicided.
