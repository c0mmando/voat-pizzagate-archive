            Here's an excerpt of a news article (linked at end) that involves the U.K. Soccer team. It's from august  22, 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            "In a separate email exchange, Mr. Band sought Ms. Abedin’s help in obtaining a visa for a member of a U.K. soccer league at the request of Casey Wasserman, president of the Wasserman Foundation, which donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.
“I doubt we can do anything, but maybe we can help with an interview,” Ms. Abedin wrote. “I’ll ask.” She wrote again: “I got this now, makes me nervous to get involved but I’ll ask.”
Mr. Band responded: “Then don’t.”
A spokeswoman for Mr. Wasserman said the forwarded email request never resulted in a visa. Mr. Band declined to comment on Monday.
The new emails were also notable because they discussed an interaction between a Clinton Foundation donor and Mrs. Clinton. Past email exchanges have depicted foundation officials seeking access to State Department officials, but not the secretary of state herself.
While Mrs. Clinton is no longer involved with the foundation, her husband and daughter, Chelsea, continue to attend the organization’s events. The Clinton Foundation said both would stop raising money for the organization and turn over operations to independent parties if Mrs. Clinton were elected. 
While at the State Department, Ms. Abedin received a special designation from the agency that allowed her to work there while also doing outside work. During that period, she held two other positions, at the Clinton Foundation and at Teneo, a consulting firm founded by Mr. Band.
Mr. Band was a chief adviser in helping the former president launch the Clinton Foundation after leaving the White House.
Earlier this month, Judicial Watch released a separate batch of emails showing Mr. Band seeking help from top aides to Mrs. Clinton to set up a meeting between a State Department official and a top donor to the Clinton Foundation, Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury. In that email exchange, Mr. Band employed similar language, calling Mr. Chagoury a “key guy there and to us.”
