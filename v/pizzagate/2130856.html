            Thanks for Bringing This To Light.  The children have a right to have there case solved, if they bungled this case, then they need to say it.  But I believe with today's forensics it is possible to finally bring this case to justice. Upvoat4U and the Children.

            WOW.  Did they mess this up.  Who knows if the guy in jail now had anything to do with it.  First the Gremlin was instrumental then they let Busch out of jail?  How odd.  I still think Bush had something to do with it because evidently he abused Gunnels.  Who killed Busch?  Did he really commit suicide, do we have proof?  Did someone kill him to shut him up?  The guy that is now in jail whose car they found a hair in that does not match, that is another Wild Goose Chase?  IDK, I think they dropped the ball at the very beginning and now are under the gun to solve this case, but why do they not want to release evidence.  Either they are covering this whole case to protect someone or they are afraid it will be discovered that they bungled the whole case. Either way This Is A Sacrilege.  Those Children and Families Need Closure.  NOW.

             Carmentina, you ROCK.  I have a lot to say to what you said.  for now I will say this... look into North Fox Island, MI.  NOT SUPER FAR FROM RACINE, WI, I have noticed........  not sure if that's relevant, but when I realized it, a light-bulb went on in my head.

                  Nobody's piling on :)  I am always looking at 2 or 3 posts at the same time.  There are not enough hrs in a day.    Do not miss the North Fox Tie in though.  I have to research it myself.  It is all so confusing.  That was their plan.  To connect things in such a confusing and crazy manner and then others because they could not help themselves with their sick pleasures joined in and created more confusion.  This makes it almost impossible to reach the end.  We need a crew to research certain posts, especially ones that connect.

                   so some rich guy named frances shelden, from ann arbor, bought north fox island, MI, and started to use it for his sick pedo purposes.  He had kids brought up there (I think from St. Paul's Mission) and the kids were sexually abused and exploited for child pornography.  There is thought to be a big link between north fox island and the Oakland county child killer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As frances Sheldon was super rich and powerful, they did NOT want that connection known.  one of the suspected killer, Christopher busch, was the son of a powerful GM executive, so they did not want talk of that either.  I believe he was "suicided".  His body was found in odd circumstances (didn't appear he could have shot himself.) bloody ligatures were found in his bedroom, yet they never investigated them.   it's like Busch was swept under the rug as well as his connections to north fox island.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Frances Shelden changed his named Frances Torey and is thought to have moved to the Netherlands and thought to be dead at the time.

              My thought was at one point it might be a cover up for someone in the Bush Brewing Co.   A relative maybe.  EDIT:  This may be part of a ring again.  There are many or them.  Some very large others run by small time hoods.

               I've been researching the North Fox Island/Francis Shelden CP ring for over a week now and have so much to post I've been trying to figure out where to start, or which angle to present first.  This is ongoing research since my recent posts, when I had just found out about the North Fox Island CP ring.

               While my current focus is not on the Oakland County Child Killings directly (though I've posted some articles about that already), what I have discovered has blown me away several times over in regards to the pedo movement, etc. CP distribution...
              </p>
              <p>
               In the meantime, I've posted the other topics, to demonstrate some proven cases of widespread, interconnected pedo rings from the 70s, 80s as a backdrop to and a result of the ongoing pedo rights movement.

               I hope to post something tonight.

                Have to leave house, but giving this a look again and I think you are right that a lot of these cases are interconnected or as I sometimes call them intertwined like a long old Grape Vine on a fence (that could be the Italian Mafia Plan when you think about it).  Intertwining it so much so that it is almost impossible to untangle.  Your posts are always great and I will be digging into this and will make notes.

                Has anyone checked the obvious?  Is Busch related to the Beer Family  and is Lambourgini  (being he worked on cars)  connected to the Auto Family.  Could be they were helping run this for the elite pedos and partaking themselves as well.  You know like the alcoholic that worked at the bar.

                 The guy's name is Ted Lamborgine, I believe.  I remember looking into whether Christopher Busch was related to the family that started the Busch's grocery store, but I did not find any evidence of that.  His father was a GM exective, though

                  Yikes.  Was his father still alive, which meant he either allowed the suicide of his son or he had no choice.  This stuff is sick all around.

I also remember reading that frances shelden had connections to an upper class private kids school called Cranbrook.

                I am waiting for your post.  They are always a learning experience.  Thanks for the heads up.  This stuff is so interconnected I don't know where it all ends.   I will look for it and read the threads.
