            This is how corrupt the media is! First, they complain about fake news, but when a girl in Haiti is suicided, they don't even bother investigating to find out what happened! Who does that leave to investigate? Exactly!

             Well, I revealed the Monica story on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">
              /r/The_Donald
             </a>
             Wednesday morning (Nov 16th), the same day that Hillary Clinton decided to come out of her post-election hiding and give that press event without makeup at some children's fund raising event (coincidence? I think not). Also beginning the middle of that week is when the media started pushing very hard against "fake news" and NY Times came out with its "fact check" article of Comet. In my opinion, Monica Petersen tipped the scale. Her death and prior research is one of the most critical pieces in this puzzle.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was the main thread:
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/">
              https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dbdz9/i_found_a_smoking_gun_monica_petersen_found_dead/
             </a>
             but earlier posts were made Wednesday morning before I found the direct connection to her investigating Hillary and finding evidence against her and the foundation.

            DynCorp was caught trafficking women and children out of Bosnia under Bill Clinton. The scandal was known as "DynCorp A-Go-Go.  DynCorp was caught again in Afghanistan, scandal knows as 'The Dancing Boys of Afghanistan. Recently, Obama gave them ANOTHER CONTRACT! This is the best we have? Connect the dots, I've been doing it for years!

            Author, ‘Shadow Force: Private Security Contractors in Iraq’
           </p>
           <p>
            For an example of how just one transgression can lead to endless bad publicity consider the movie titled The Whistleblower that was released earlier this year. To summarize the plot, in Bosnia in 1999, Kathryn Bolkovac, a U.S. policewoman served as a U.N. peacekeeper. Her post was with the International Police Task Force which was arranged by DynCorp Aerospace. She was assigned to run the IPTF office that investigates sex trafficking, domestic abuse and sexual assault. She ultimately alleges that peacekeepers, U.N. workers and international police are visiting brothels and facilitating sex trafficking by forging documents and aiding the illegal transport of woman into Bosnia. DynCorp responds by firing Bolkovac, who returns to the U.S. and files a wrongful termination case. She wins the suit but says she’s still blacklisted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Put bluntly, DynCorp was involved in a sex slavery scandal in Bosnia in 1999, with its employees accused of rape and the buying and selling of girls as young as 12. Dyncorp, hired to perform police duties for the UN and aircraft maintenance for the US Army, were implicated in prostituting the children, whereas the company’s Bosnia site supervisor filmed himself raping two women. A number of employees were transferred out of the country, but with no legal consequences for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was one of two cases involving DynCorp and sexual scandal in Bosnia. The other, involved air plane mechanic Ben Johnston who sued DynCorp, alleging he was sacked because he had uncovered evidence that Dyncorp employees were involved in ‘sexual slavery.
           </p>
           <p>
            The negative impact of just those two cases cannot be overstated. Indeed, search online for “dyncorp AND sex scandal” as I just did and you get nearly nine thousand hits. DynCorp spent many years trying to move past the bad publicity resulting from these cases. And indeed, one can look forward to more on the subject when Ms. Bolkovac’s book on the incident is released this coming January.
           </p>
           <p>
            One could also note that, in a much less noticed case, in October 2004 it was revealed that DynCorp contract workers operating at Tolemaida Air Base in Colombia distributed a video in which they could be observed sexually violating underage girls from the town of Melgar. This video was even sold on the main streets of Bogotá. Nonetheless, the Lawyers’ Collective of Colombia has not learned of any criminal investigation undertaken in relation to these acts involving minors. According to follow-up work carried out by the Lawyers’ Collective it was discovered that one of the minors involved in the videos committed suicide some time after the publication of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, courtesy of Wikileaks, DynCorp can look forward to a new round of ridicule and denunciations.
