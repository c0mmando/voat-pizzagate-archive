            There isn't a tunnel vision in Alefantis, only in the MSM. And pizzagate is not about hunting down pedophiles or molesters, it's about exposing the government-run system that facilities their activities.

            I feel like this post does nothing to aid in our search. A bit concern troll-ish. I get your point, and can agree on some level...but I think you should have thought about this post a bit more before you submitted with this title.

             I posted mostly out of frustration, and it is a bit concern-trollish. I'm also not much of a writer these days, so I just kinda typed it out and hit "fuck it".
