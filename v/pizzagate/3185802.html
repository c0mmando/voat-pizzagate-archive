<p>Corman disregarded the safety of her children and allowed him to continue living under the same roof.

             I know. The part of this I find most disturbing is that she knowingly put her children at risk by forcing (and they had no option) them to live with a paedophile.

               White as can be, and smart enough to see that you're just a shill using racism to delegitimize the good cause. We've been through this before. Keep shilling, I'll keep voting your stanky butt down. It's all good.

            Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I think. It’s like a train wreck—even though I’m totally disgusted, I read every word. I’m going to try to

            However, as Maddie Corman will tell you herself, this is not her husband’s story or her children’s, for that matter. This is the story of how Ms. Corman fights to keep her family together while confronting a personal tsunami. How does a person weather such a storm? At first there are questions from well-meaning friends and curious onlookers: “Did you know?” “Did he ever touch any young girls?” “What are your thoughts on porn?” Then people weigh in with a barrage of comments: “I would divorce him.” “Don’t divorce him.” “My husband died, but that’s much better than what you are going through.” There is public scrutiny, and professional and social repercussions. Finally, there is Ms. Corman’s fear that her best friend and life partner of almost twenty years will face jail time.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHAT? Yeah, God forbid he has to face jail time.  Porn?  Do people even realize what that is and then showing it to a Child?  They are trying to take away from the attention on her husband and him living with their Children.  They are making her the main subject Not Him.  In other words, Letting Him Off the Hook.  Sick Sick Sick. But this is how Pedowood operates.

             Yes, this is NOT adult porn where there is a modicum of consent between adults (albeit mostly damaged).  Children they must be drugged to be raped to do these things on camera for their 'audience' of criminals.. And that's not taking into account that most of these children are procured by  abduction and/or trafficking. Did she give a moment's thoughts to the children? No.
