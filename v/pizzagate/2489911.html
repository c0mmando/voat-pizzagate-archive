<p>Here is where they seek to research on minorities who they claim are at a greater risk of Alzheimer\'s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alz.org/advocacy/federal-priorities.asp#law">https://www.alz.org/advocacy/federal-priorities.asp#law</a>
&quot;NAPA includes requirements to:
Coordinate Alzheimer\'s disease research and services across all federal agencies.
Accelerate the development of treatments that would prevent, halt, or reverse the course of Alzheimer\'s disease.
Improve early diagnosis and coordination of care and treatment of Alzheimer\'s disease.</p>
<p>Improve outcomes for ethnic and racial minority populations that are at higher risk for Alzheimer\'s disease.
Coordinate with international bodies to fight Alzheimer\'s globally.&quot;</p>
<p>Are the fake front groups shilling for pHARMa involved in Pizzagate, you might ask? Well, that couldn\'t be. It isn\'t like Brooke Shields the former CP star stood up on stage with Senator Robert Menendez to promote the drugging of mothers all across the country so that people would think all mothers are mentally ill or anything. It isn\'t like the state wants to mentally screen everyone in the country so that CPS can take more children away and sell them to new parents for profit or anything like that. It\'s not like the people who sell antidepressants want everyone who\'s ever had a diagnosis of PPD or depression to lose their gun rights?</p>
<p>Given the connections being made by George Webb between the Awans and the rat lines and the opiod quarter weight drugs being brought in I think it is at least worth looking into whether anyone in the Alzheimer\'s foundation who could have put this logo design out there has any connections to the existing criminals in the network. </p>
<p>I can\'t help but think of all the people working in hospices and nursing homes who are drugging the hell out of the elderly for profit and hastening their deaths. I am also thinking of the connections between certain members of Congress who are on the payroll of the pharmaceutical companies who were recently charged with crimes and then coincidentally saw those trials up and go away through some stroke of extreme luck.</p>
<p>And I can\'t help but wonder if any of those elderly people might be donating their organs or other tissues. Not to say that I think those organs are particularly as valuable as a child or a young adult\'s might be, but perhaps someone else knows.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is nothing, or perhaps the people who made this logo had no idea it looked like a spiral boy lover logo. Or perhaps the people running the Alzheimer\'s foundations may have done so intentionally to network with others in their community of donors with money. </p>
<p>I don\'t know, but what I do know is that the elderly have been the victims of psychiatric drugging for a very long time. I also know that the &quot;dementia drugs&quot; that they give out and the polypharmacy that most &quot;elder care&quot; physicians prescribe for those alzheimer patients will quickly cause things like actually stopping you from being able to breathe, stroke, seizure, diabetes, delirium, and heart attack. </p>
<p>I also know that the people who stand to profit from the pharmaceutical company include the members of Congress who have passed a grouping of laws to protect doctors, psychiatrists, and the pharmaceutical industry. For example, a doctor cannot be sued for &quot;malpractice&quot; if his practices are standard of care. And other doctors are the ones setting the standard of care, which includes polypharmacy. The pharmaceutical company can\'t be sued if they put the side effects on the drug label. And the doctor can\'t be sued for the product you took that caused your death so nobody can be sued when you die. Hey, I know that there are certain disinfo agents who want everyone to think that antidepressants were the cause of the Florida school shooting simply because of all those who committed suicide because of antidepressants. Well that\'s fine and dandy, but that doesn\'t mean that black ops agents did not stage a fake school shooting. </p>

            This logo, in my opinion, is not exclusive to pedo abducting child cults, but IT IS absolutely related to children that have been abducted and forced into bad activity. This logo is exclusive to the SAME network that uses exploited children. If that makes any sense....

            No one ever talks about the rampant sexual abuse against the elderly, that goes on. :( I worked with them... taking care of elderly people in their homes... and it was both one of the most rewarding jobs, because I got to give them the love and care that their families couldn't be bothered to provide them... and also the most heartbreaking job, because I saw and heard about the horrors that the elderly have had to endure within the corrupt care-system. In my eyes... child protective services AND elderly care services are both full of abuse... the sexual and violent kind. So very sad.

The international trade in human organs is on the increase fuelled by growing demand as well as unscrupulous traffickers. The rising trend has prompted a serious reappraisal of current legislation, while WHO has called for more protection for the most vulnerable people who might be tempted to sell a kidney for as little as US$ 1000.

             According to the World Health Organization, the going price for the seller/Donor of a kidney is around $5,000. The broker who purchases the kidney from the Donor/seller then goes on to sell it to wealthy transplant patients for an average price between $100,000 to $200,000.

             I think you are somewhat correct and this is why&gt;&gt;&gt; Its a big club, and we aint in it. The "club' operates in a manner that, although some facets of the club might not be "directly" involved in abducting and training MK kids, the rest of the club utilizes and uses MK kids. It is a tangled web and we MK kids are disposable.

            Great post. I didn't thought that you would add such details to different possibilities. Sure it can be coincidence.
But people who have difficulties in remembering recent events would certainly be a gold mine for nazi MK Ultra psycho docs right?

             And I can't help but wonder if any of those elderly people might be donating their organs or other tissues. Not to say that I think those organs are particularly as valuable as a child or a young adult's might be, but perhaps someone else knows.

            You might be on to something there. Read this article about donating bodies for research. Warning though, its really disturbing.

             Check out Kevin and Avonte's Law!  This is a way of tracking missing alzheimer patients just like Amber Alert tracking the kids.   Also they have an acronym of MAAP  MAP? for Adults?  Idk this looks really fishy.  I think you are on to something here.

              I noticed that... I wish someone could explain what exactly they do with those networks and who besides Silsby and Podesta would have cause to want to control it. Did you know that it's nearly impossible to get a Silver Alert issued for certain elderly folks? /the amount of proof required is really ridiculous
