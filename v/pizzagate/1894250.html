            The way the Hill-Bots are acting has a parallel in European History which I guess no one takes anymore otherwise they'd have figured this out themselves. But here goes:
           </p>
           <p>
            The way Adolph Hitler came to power and maintained his control right up to the very end was to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie">
             The Big Lie
            </a>
            . It had many variations one of the best examples was "If you tell a lie and repeat it enough people will eventually believe it."
           </p>
           <p>
            Back then one example of The Big Lie was to lie about whether Jews were being taken to concentration camps. Goebbels kept repeating there were no concentration camps. They did have these work camp thingy's but that's just to help the war effort by keeping people near where they work. He came up with countless excuses. That's what "Arbeit Macht Frei" was all about. It means "Work for your freedom". Sounds healthy doesn't it? Like you might even want to go there for a month in the summer to help out the war effort and maybe lose a little weight while you're at it.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1945 during the Summer the truth came out and the German population finally found out. Patton and other generals would take the entire population of towns around the Concentration Camps and make them walk through them puking the entire time as they hadn't gotten used to the stench of death let alone the depravity of killing millions like that in cold blood. The German population simply couldn't believe it. They couldn't believe they could have been lied to so egregiously. But they were and not only were they lied to whenever Goebbels felt they were starting to get wise to the truth he'd fire up some new even more sinister lie and the bigger it got the easier it was to believe. He created an entire alternate reality and people took it hook, line and sinker.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is exactly what's going to happen with the Hill-Bots. When the truth comes out they will literally go into shock. They won't be able to accept this 70 something glass ceiling breaker could be so evil. We've all had 6 months to adjust to the depravity that's been exposed. Imagine what it will be like when around 50,000,000 Hil-Bots wake up all at the same time. It's going to get sketchy for a while.

             Patton touring camps does nothing to prove how many were killed you fucking retard.  Do you really think its even possible to gas 6m people in a couple years?  You are a total embarrassment.

             <p>
              That's a Straw Man. I don't care how many Jews were killed. It's a number over 100,000 is all I know. That's good enough for me.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem isn't me though. The problem is YOU. Why would you use such an obvious Straw Man in polite conversation? That's pretty sketchy and makes me think you're a shill. After all if I'm just moderately insane and have weekend privileges outside of the asylum you are some Hanibal Lector psychopath kept in solitary confinement and have to be transported when outside of it using a freight dolly, about 100 feet of cargo strapping and a mask that looks like something

                 but.. he has a point. if there were massive propaganda and psyops about the Nazi holocaust, as many believe there was and is, then this has to be acknowledged. the culture/policy of demonising/criminalising dissenters and skeptics as 'anti-semites' is very suspect to begin with imo.

                  I agree. After learning all we know now much of the past 100 years of History will need to be re-written including what the actual Holocaust number is.

                  Does it really matter though if it's 2 million instead of 6? Maybe it was 500,000 Jews only. I don't know the number, I'm just making a point. The U.S. lost around 400,000 soldiers in WWII. If the number of Jews killed was 500,000 let's say for arguments sake, I'm by no means saying I think so, but 500,000 Jews is 100,000 more than American soldiers and that's a fuck load of human beings.

                  smearing an entire class of people as evil no matter what. That's fucking insane and you know it. That kind of thinking is what Fascists do. They brand an entire group as untouchable and then they can use them as scapegoats for any number of things.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The most recent example I can think of is how people think all Muslims are evil because of the violence in the Qu'ran. That's bull shit. The Deep State did 9/11 in the hope of creating a new class of people to use a scapegoats to justify war. That's clearly insane and wrong.

                   come on, now. I sincerely don't mean to insult you, but your thinking on this subject is extremely establishment-friendly. i'm not a bigot. I have no hatred toward the jewish ethnicity or religion. I loved Seinfeld. but come on. if you apply the same rational skepticism and suspicion toward this as you do for pizzagate, 9/11, muslim bogeymen, etc. then you should smell something fishy too. when I mentioned the laws criminalising critics, that was meant as a highlight of a huge red flag that should tune your suspicions immediately.

                   edit: let me put it to you another way: when we call the Vatican and catholic church child molesters, are we calling all 1.285 billion roman catholics child-fuckers?

                    I'd never use that term. I also wouldn't call Muslims a bunch of terrorists nor Islam synonymous with terrorism. I wouldn't use those terms because they're self defeating for one. And you don't have to look that far back in European History to see Christian rulers like Charlemagne did just as much if not more killing in the name of religion.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You might remember Muhammad beheaded 800 Jews in Medina who opposed him. Well just a short time later Charlemagne beheaded 4500 pagans from what is present day Denmark and Western Germany. 4500 &gt; 800 every day of the week.

                    Big picture is when you generalize you sound like a bigot even if you're not one. That's like shooting yourself in the foot. You lose before the race even starts. Just sayin'.

                     the generalising is unnecessarily done on your part. my best friend is catholic, but that won't stop me from calling the Vatican a bunch of child-rapist cover-uppers. from just that, it would then be very unreasonable of someone to take my statement to mean i'm denigrating 1.3 billion catholics.. do you get me?

                   Also naive for thinking the number could be six million. Even the most ignorant hillbilly schoolchild can recite the Magic Number 6 million. Does that not strike you as suspiciously convenient for jews.

                    I'm glad you said that because I'll now formally say it. That 6 million number is too high. I strongly suspect that number was on the high side on purpose to grab people's attention and make it stand out more so people took notice. It worked.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But the flip side of that is whatever the correct number is it will still be shocking. Even at 500,000 Jews murdered it will be shocking. The actual number is irrelevant in the bigger scheme of things.

                     Its orders of magnitude fewer than say Russians murdered by jewish gulag operators.  Jews see russia as the last Christian holdout, thats why they are so intent on NATO war.

                     We had concentration camps in the US for potential collaborators too, remember? Thats what places like auschwitz were primarily for i imagine, forced labor.  Germans are world famous for efficiency, i doubt they would settle on "relocate, delouse (WTF for if theyll soon be dead?) , gas, then somehow cremate millions of bodies, hopefully finish around 1980

                      If by Jewish gulag operators you mean Joseph Stalin then I agree. But Stalin abandoned religion early in his life as did millions of his fellow Communists. Stalin was a Communist. Full Stop.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The way you're saying it "jewish gulag operators" were the problem here and not Joseph Stalin who sent them there. That's dishonest and is exactly why I'm bothered by your arguments. They're only half correct the other half being your own little "spin". That's bull shit for lack of a better word.

                      I don't know how old you are but I'm guessing you're a kid. You won't get anywhere if you're dishonest. And if you're anything like me when I was young I was dishonest because I was lying to myself. After all

Naftaly Aronovich Frenkel Russian: Нафталий Аронович Френкель; (1883 in Haifa – 1960 in Moscow) was a Jewish Russian businessman and member of the Soviet secret police. Frenkel is best known for his role in the organisation of work in the Gulag, starting from the forced labor camp of the Solovetsky Islands, which is recognised as one of the earliest sites of the Gulag.

                        He was just like Stalin. He was a Jew who abandoned his religion. There's no debate here. Stalin didn't allow any form of religion in the Soviet Union.
