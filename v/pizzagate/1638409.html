On Facebook there is a game called Gold Fish Casino, where you can play slot machine games that have been ported over from the real slot machines. There is a game in particular called &quot;Eye of Horus&quot; and one of the symbols in the game is the boy lover symbol, the spiraled triangle. I can\'t seem to find any ties to Egyptian hieroglyphics that has that symbol, but I haven\'t researched too much on it. If it was as common as the Eye of Horus or the Ankh, it would make sense to put it in the game, so I\'m guessing at least one of the people who worked on the game (artist, programmer, producer) might know what this symbol means in terms of pedophilia. Maybe this triangle does have ties to Egyptian Hieroglyphics, but maybe is tied more with ritualistic stuff? Who knows. </p>
<p>Along with that, there is a National Pizza Day sale in the game to buy their in game currency. The game does a lot of themed sales for just about everything under the sun, I\'m sure they look up each week on the calendar to find something they can associate to do sales, but it is still pizza related and is associated with the pedophile symbol. The company that created the game is SG Interactive; I looked through the their list of games and Eye of Horus isn\'t listed on there. Since they port many slot machine games, it\'s hard to say who originally created the game since they just take the assets from the actual slot and then fit it into a format like Flash to run on Facebook. Overall, this symbol in the game seems like a shout out to the pedophiles if anything. Here is a link to screen shots of the game with the symbol (it\'s yellow) and the pizza day sale. </p>

            Interesting. I always liked spiral designs; but that was based off of Japanese stories and such. I am fairly certain I have seen a similar hyroglyph before. I have access to some images with pictures, so I'll pour through them. Thanks for your work, my grandma plays these stupid slot games on her tablet. I'll be looking at those, too.

            Another mobile game called golf clash has a lot of these symbols on the clubs and the names of the equipment seems cryptic as well. I might be paranoid by all that's gone on, but idk..

            Nice find. Very interested to know if that symbol actually does have roots in ancient Egypt, and what it may have meant back then
           </p>
           <p>
            Although, the fact they put a pizza day sale on a game so irrelevant to pizza, makes me think a clever pedo developer threw that symbol in there for shits n gigs.

             I have been trying to make this point for a while now.

             I was obsessed with king tut since I was a child. I just looked through a book called "the Treasures of Tutankhamun" which was published in 1976 to be sold at museums where the exhibition of artifacts.
