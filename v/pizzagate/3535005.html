<p><em>Excerpt:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An actress has told how a notorious sex cult leader burned his initial into her crotch as she lay naked and blindfolded on a table.</p>
<p>Sarah Edmondson first heard about the NXIVM cult from film maker, Mark Vicente, and when she joined she hoped she would win better roles because it had several Hollywood members.</p>
<p>Keith Raniere decided Sarah was his property and branded her with a scorching hot iron, causing her to &quot;screech in pain&quot; due to the &quot;fire on her skin&quot;.</p>
<p>After a decade in NXIVM where she helped recruit more followers than any other members she broke free from its spell.</p>
<p>This summer Raniere was found guilty of racketeering, sex trafficking, forced labour conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy and Sarah helped expose him and bring him to justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good reminder that while we have not only the Epstein situation unfolding, NXIVM is still bubbling away in the background and brings so many extra names to the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have we been able to make any connections (6 degrees or less, so to speak) between NXIVM and Epstein (or the UK Royals, for example) yet?</strong></p>
<p><em>Question open to readers, will add appropriate links here if and as they\'re found by myself or others.</em></p>
