She is married to Jeffery Lemerond. Lemerond worked for Carlyle Group and SAB Capital. SAB being the initials to Skull and Bones. Hoffman also regularly attacks SRA victims. Also involved in Welch Life Sciences Fund and Candens Capital. Seems to be connected to republican side of pizzagate. </p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           The connections Gabe Hoffman has to Caryle Group and Skull and Bones come from his employee Nichole. She is married to Jeffery Lemerond. Lemerond worked for Carlyle Group and SAB Capital. SAB being the initials to Skull and Bones. Hoffman also regularly attacks SRA victims. Also involved in Welch Life Sciences Fund and Candens Capital. Seems to be connected to republican side of pizzagate.

           Any symbolism behind the blue and white horizontal stripes on Heather’s pjs here? Similar stripes are on Epstein Island.

           One of his cast mates on Dick Van Dyke show was close with Al Capone. First met him at age 11.

           Rose Marie was one of the original child stars. Partner of Morey Amsterdam on the Dick Van Dyke Show (created by Carl Reiner).

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
