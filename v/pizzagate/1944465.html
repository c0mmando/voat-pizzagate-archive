<hr />
<p>In this final installment, the following points are reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Since 2012, intelligence agencies have been using &quot;Crowdsourcing&quot; to do their work for them, but it wasn\'t until Jason, George, Dave, Defango and the Mossad that people were asked to share their work for free. MIT offers $40K rewards to the winner of a crowdsourced puzzle, for example..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Mossad is renowned for getting a lot done without spending much money. One way they do this is by calling upon civilians to help them. Most often those civilians are unaware, and just think they are helping out another Jewish person, for example by offering a free stay to friends visiting Israel. It is their custom to say yes when another Jewish person is in need, and a favor is asked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The players in this &quot;Webb Op&quot; (for lack of better term) likely do not know the big picture, of even that they are working for Mossad, as is likely the case with Defango. [In case it\'s relevant, know that Defango has stated he wanted to work for the NSA.]  Also discussed is Defango\'s participation in solving complex puzzles is, and its relation to the new way intelligence agencies are finding  talent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The discovery of the Sweigarts being brothers, and their part as actors in the play is covered. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;big tell&quot; that gave the whole thing away was when Dave went out of his way to bring attention to this discovery, which was made by 2 YouTubers on the same day: the maker of these Case Studies, and Defango. Dave didn\'t mention the former, but made a big deal out of, indeed promoting, Defango. This was the downfall of the entire operation... </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From @ AlignToTruth in the comment section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought this whole psy-op drama was spelled out by Dave in videos uploaded in late May. I equated to the &quot;Screw Tape Letters&quot; written by C.S. Lewis in 1941. Dave and George were born into a psy-op drama through the bloodline of their father, George. If you think about it, George and Dave fit the profile of the main characters in this drama series. As you can see it\'s an exploitation of a highly dysfunctional family. Mental Illness is not a toy or subject line to drag around on YT community channels. The great manipulation is INTELLIGENCE which involves a broader audience aka NETWORK or in YT jargon &quot;crowd sourcing&quot; by unsuspecting, gullible player\'s working towards a greater good. Lock down INTELLIGENCE and control the masses. Cloud sourcing data to compartmentalize consumer resources into predictive profiles such as George Webb Sweigert. He\'s a target by his own fanciful grandiose delusions of grandeur. ✌🙏🍀 (My thoughts/opinions are condensed. MOSSAD is a bird I never met.) Cheers﻿</p>

             You are a fan of Webb, though, and don't have a neutral take on this. I can't imagine something more important than finding out what is behind this operation.

              I've been neutral on George since day one. He could be a trick or he could have good intentions. I don't know what to think. I watch once in a while for the inside baseball that could be real or not. But dude, you are a great researcher that should be spending your time on better things like finding the videos of the elite doing rituals that are supposedly out there. George is small potatoes and if he's a fraud then he's a fraud. If you were to expose him, then what would be the next thing you work on? Do that.

                I've submitted stuff but they got deleted by the mods or exiled to pizzagatewhatever so I gave up and deleted it all. Nothing was as ever as significant as your top ones, just pointing out pedo signs in pop culture. I usually keep my findings to the comments. If I knew what I was doing I would try to climb goliath though.

            You KNOW that the CIA is involved in this too. "Former CIA" and bullshitter extraordinaire Robert David Steele has publicly endorsed Webb, and they are working together on their joint venture, The UNRIG Campaign. Webb's dumbassed supporters contributed $9K to that bullshit.

             Yes I have to support you and agree 100% on RDSteele. He's becoming very dark with his recent posts. His reaction to Kathy Griffin was extreme and he seemed to be turning into a dark avenger, rather than a knight. I am no fan of Griffin, so it wasn't that he was condemning her stupid beheading thing which is in keeping with all the symbolism (beheading). It was his sort of enjoyment of the dark rage he was channeling that personally creeped me out a bit. I thought to myself, 'this guy is playing me'. That was my literal thought. Somehow I suddenly saw him very differently. And the Webb stuff is just sad.

             Have you called the FBI and New Jersey State Police yet about the WorldCorp video you posted last night?
            </p>
            <p>
             You seemed really upset that children were being harmed. I found it odd you were unwilling to report that fact to Law Enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kind of made you look like a shill. And then we find out today the video used some sketchy graphics copied off the internet and passed off as real:

              that way we can start selling the rats as radioactive fuel. so we don't ever have to mine uranium again.. we can just get free electrciity from the radioactive rats!!!!

             In this video, he notes that Mossad is pretty much just trying out players, if one fails, they've already got someone else lined up. He notes that Alex Jones is really not working for them anymore, and that the Webb Op is now trying to entice Wikileaks and Assange to join them. If Assange says yes, the case against his legitimacy becomes stronger. Jason and Trish are in London now, to try and talk with Assange, who is back in the Embassy.. according to this case study.

              I wouldn't be bad mouthing Mossad. I'm not Jewish nor a shill. I'm just a poor person. But Mossad could screw you 6 ways to Sunday. These are "The Jews!(tm)" after all. They grew up in a pretty tough neighborhood. They're all bad asses over there.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're on thin ice, just my opinion. Mossad doesn't like Nazis.

            Everyone feel free to ignore known shill  V____Z. She's a graduate of the Hillary Clinton School of Bull Shit. She's learned to accuse her target of the exact offense SHE is guilty of.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this case she's the shill but wants you to think it's actually George Webb who's shilling. You've seen this movie before from Hillary Clinton. She once famously said never let a good crisis go to waste. Well voila you get voat pizzagate shills accusing targetted individuals of being shills.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only offense George Webb has made is questioning Andrew McCabe of the FBI. Andrew McCabe is a professional Deep State slow-walker. He and James Comey were the first and last line of defense to squash any investigation of the Deep State. Their most egregious crime to date appears to be covering up Hillary &amp; Co's "Radioactive Ratline" making money bypassing the heavy regulation within the Uranium processing industry. Don't take my word for it. The fraud was first uncovered in

             "Clinton Cash"
            </a>
            . You may recall Bill and Hillary's Uranium deals played a staring role in that devastating documentary that helped defeat Hillary last fall. It appears part of that Radioactive Ratline involved using container ships to move radioactive waste:

            George Webb's finally had enough and is suing the FBI:

           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps V____Z could explain why a shill would sue their employer for $100,000,000. Something seems a little henky. It's actually kind of proof George is NOT a shill but whatevs.
           </p>
           <p>
            And as always the real victims are poor people. In this case any poor person unfortunate enough to live near the Savannah River radioactive waste dump and/or the ship breaking yards of India and Bangladesh(East Pakistan). And for the record as a yoot I spent a lot of time on that river. It's a beautiful area. The Savannah runs next to Augusta Georgia where they play the Masters Golf Tournament every year. Maybe that explains my deep seated hatred of rich people. I'll have to do more with

A Charity Audit can't pierce the veil of a Limited Partnership, it has to take their word for it. If we've learned anything it's never take Hillary's "word for it".

              </strong>
              Israel supports the ISIS ratline (75% of Israeli line is from the ratline i believe) But i don't believe they are involved, etc. My big focus is to get all the emails, not to shame Israel. The emails are the key to the investigation IMO.

             Just like i said before, All of his "research" is carefully constructed to divert attention from AIPAC / Israel's involvement in the corrupt US government, and in organ, women and child trafficking

            <p>
             Anyone with half a brain can figure out the Awan Brothers were employed by Mossad through AIPAC.. they were really patsies working on gathering info for the state of Israel, of course neither George or the zionist Gayson are going to mention this.

              Israel helped create ISIS. I agree. I've said this for the past 9 months. You don't even understand what I've said all along do you.

                    And I said that's right when he was investigating brownstone ops he knew he would never be involved with a child or a dude so he went to this dominatrix brownstone where he allowed himself to be tied up in Dominatrix styles as a "sort of sex slave" though I am sure he did not mind it was voluntary and they taught h the back room ways they set traps for their prey.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That is what he meant. He is not scarred from this and explained after why he had chosen to test it out a little. That is it. He has discussed this at length and said that would in fact be their last arrow at him by releasing some video of him with a Dominatricks tied up in very uncomfortable position getting some whipping of some type. Anyone who has been investigation this corrupt government but can't handle a grown man tied up by a dominatrix should not be researching.

                Fucking Nazi you are a stinky piece of💩 All you have done here is spread disinformation.  AIPAC has reason to want the US help against OBAMA sponsored terrorism.

                <p>
                 In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic jihad.
And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist's home that's been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.

             Until people WAKE UP and know what exactly Zionists are and that Mossad is NOT Jews, this evil will continue. Do your research and understand the difference between Zionists/Mossad and REAL Jews

             <p>
              What do they do with that energy? they build radioactive ratlines, so they can create one gigantic radiocative rat nest as the source of power for their interdimensional spaceship, so the "creatures of another dimension" can return to their dimension, LOL LOL

              "Zionists" are really Jesuits. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta are the ones who run the CFR and started the UN. They also run the banking system, not the "Jews".

                 I'm not trying to convince anyone. It's everyone's own responsibility to educate themselves versus believing the horseshit shoved down our throats thru centuries of "anti-semistim" that Zionists shield themselves with.

                  David Rockefeller was the guy behind 9/11. Yes he hired Mossad demolition experts. But it was David Rockefeller and George H.W. Bush who planned the whole thing. Those are both hard core W.A.S.P.s.

                   I was involved with the failure analysis of the towers, I saw the evidence, did the engineering analysis and the towers were brought down by planes filled with jet fuel.  The real crimes are associated to the stegnography tools supplied by G Bush's admin for their communications.  These tools are still used by pedophiles and terrorists against the states.

                    Not WTC 7. That's a different animal all together. So the following is applying to WTC 7 only where no Jet Fuel was involved and there were only minor fires on only a few floors.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    WTC 7 was built like a brick shit house. More steel was used than necessary due to its use as a command center during a disaster. Furthermore steel wouldn't fail in the manner it did within WTC 7 on 9/11. Steel is steel because it's insanely strong and resists force by bending long before it will snaps. A steel structure collapsing under load would display a visible loading and then snapping and loading then snapping etc etc.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A good analogy for steel resisting a load is on a steel container ship. The steel is loaded/unloaded constantly. Here what that looks like:

                     https://youtu.be/PmlTk_3NN_g?t=69
                    </a>
                    WTC 7 collapsing would reflect this loading/unloading behavior. It would be very noticeable to the naked eye as extended pauses between each floor collapsing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It's impossible for steel to collapse at exactly the same speed of steel within a controlled demolition.

                     My capacity for the study was conducted at the university, and other sister universities, where I got my M.S. in Materials Engineering, since I have been in biomedical.  The two towers, when built has asbestos lined supports up to the ~62 floor, the change in laws prevented the rest of the towers from being protected.  The thermal energy needed to raise the entire mass of 10 floors of the WTC in NYC above their Austenizing temp was only equivalent to 180 gal of jet fuel.  For BP Jet A-1 there is 43.15 MJ/kg energy with a density at 15 °C is 804 kg/m3.  Assuming ~100 m^3 for the freshly fueled jets we see a total of ~4,250,000,000 BTU.  This was sufficient to lead to the catastrophic failure of the 2 main towers.

                     I understand you position on WTC 7.  This was odd and the missing gold and the fact that the tenets were mainly Bank Salomon Smith Barney (now CTI), but there were also offices of the CIA, the Department of Defence, utility company ConEd, and the Internal Revenue Service.

                     WTC 7 collapsed at 5.21pm.  This was long after the airplane hits and can be attributed to the materials burning in the building.
                     <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/01/article-2056088-0E9F97E000000578-360_634x419.jpg">

                     is a picture of the serious fire in the WTC 7 on a lower floor.  This could lead to a similar failure to a controlled demolition as the steel reaches temps over 1800F and becomes very 'plastic'.

                     Don't get me wrong in saying this, I still believe that there was foul play at hand.  I attribute most of my anger to the cryptic tools (stegnography) used by the Saudi's who attacked our country.  John Podesta was involved in making this 'legal' through the Millennium Copyright Law where they classify this method (stegnography) as watermarking and then are able to send crypto messages without violating the law.   THIS IS BAD because this is also a key tool for PEDOS.

                     <p>
                      I specifically asked we not deal with WTC 1 and 2 for this very reason. Your research doesn't apply here because you dealt with a steel structure hit by a massive airplane travelling at 500+ knots containing a full load of Jet Fuel. We're talking an ungodly about of energy that could cloud the issue.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So now WTC 7. I'm not sure why you included a picture of a fire on a floor of WTC 7 when I admitted there were fires on some of the floors. Forgive me but you're down 2 strikes already.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So that leaves just one argument: "This could lead to a similar failure to a controlled demolition as the steel reaches temps over 1800F and becomes very 'plastic'."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      1) Yes steel will become more malleable when heated to the temperature Jet Fuel burns at. But no Jet Fuel hit WTC 7 and "plastic" is the wrong word. Steel that's been heated like that still maintains a large portion of its strength. There have been many studies proving this and quite frankly that's why steel is steel. The temperatures required to make it are insanely high as in approaching the surface temperature of the Sun. I think steel melts at like 1/2 the Sun's surface temperature. And remember the fires inside WTC 7 were office fires hardly the inferno going on in WTC 1 and 2.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      2) Fire only explains the collapse of the floors with fires on them. All other floors were at 100% strength. For them to fail would require the same loading/unloading I mentioned earlier. As WTC 7 collapsed we should have seen distinct pauses as the steel on each floor is loaded to failure and then snaps. We don't see anything like that. All we see is EXACTLY the behavior seen in a building demolition like
                      <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/73/49/90/73499048c7cadecfd9df26efd717ad50.gif">
                       this.
                      </a>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The only conclusion possible for WTC 7 is a controlled demolition. There are no other explanations. And the NIST report reflects this. Their computer models didn't use standard parameters for steel's strength, elasticity etc. The NIST model reproduced something vaguely resembling the collapse with the assumption the steel was more like a piece of lumber. And worse if you look at the video of the NIST model collapsing it doesn't collapse symmetrically. Even NISTs own model can't reproduce the collapse.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      WTC 7 was a controlled demolition. That means 9/11 was an inside job as tragic as that is to accept. But accept it we must. And once you accept it was an inside job you can explain the rational for 9/11 by reading up on an infamous propaganda technique behind it called

                       "Steel that's been heated like that still maintains a large portion of its strength. There have been many studies proving this and quite frankly that's why steel is steel." 
FYI I don't think you "speak math" when you say thins like "I think steel melts at like 1/2 the Sun's surface temperature"  when the sun surface is 9500F and steel melts at 2500F. Furthermore, structural steel easily PLASTICLY DEFORMS at ~1200F.

                        Plasticity is a relative term. I just means bends. You're right about the temperature at which steel bends, I didn't know the exact temperatures. But that doesn't matter you can't address my argument with steel plasticly deforms at ~1200F. You provided no number regarding HOW MUCH PLASTICITY. Get it?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You created what's called a Straw Man. You couldn't argue the point so you attacked the fact I got the wrong temperature and then put in the word "plasticly" which is meaningless without numbers proving HOW MUCH it bends.

                       <p>
                        You shouldn't say that given the Straw Man you built and the fact you didn't address the 2nd issue. Remember I brought up TWO arguments, you only addressed the first. The second argument is the speed with which the steel failed doesn't reflect the time required to load up the steel to failure.

                       <p>
                        Unless you provide  empirical numbers about steel plasticity and what temperature you lose 1). And if you don't address 2) in your response to this this comment you'll lose that as well.

                         , I hear your response clearly and find it fair as the thermophysical properties of metals, mechanics of materials and interdependent dynamics during failure are complex and not trivial.   Before I provide a detailed response I would like to assure my interpretation of the questions are sufficient.  Please respond to this comment :)
                        </p>

                         1) What are the empirical values associated to the plastic deformation of structural steel and at what temperature will catastrophic failure of the fire damaged floors manifest as it was observed during the collapse the WTC buildings in 2001.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         2) The failure of the heat damaged floors explained by the degradation of the steel's strength during the time and temperature dependent doesn't sufficiently resolve the failure mode observed when the WTC buildings fell.  Are there system dynamics that can explain why the buildings appeared to be 'demolished' with explosives, especially the floors that were not damaged by fire.  Furthermore, why weren't distinct pauses as the steel on each floor was loaded to failure and to what extent does strain rate affect the failure modes of beams, bolts, welds and joints?

                           Impulse dynamics and catastrophic rupture are key pieces to the question at hand.  The high strain rates and shear impulse seen in the floors not damaged by the fire (diesel generators on lower floors)  when the damaged floors buckled and gave way.  Here is video that shows some key aspects on the integrity of WTC7 and why it fell.

                           Abstract
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           With the world focused on terrorism propagated by poor security and businesses
suffering from huge economic losses due to computer crime, information security has
become a top focus of IT departments. Corporations have begun to heavily implement
strategies to secure their workplaces and the information associated with their business.
Security tradeshows have sprung up around the globe and organizations are spending
significant portions of their budget on training and outsourcing.
Yet, despite this revival in information security there are still entire fields of security that
remain virtually unknown. Of these, steganography provides not only an exemplary tool
for protection of intellectual property and a medium of private communication but also a
serious risk to the security of an organization. Amazingly, a simple search of online
stores for steganography books and courses finds this subject to be almost unheard of.
Further research for steganographic focused vendors shows there is a serious lack of
strategy and defensive solutions for the corporate world.
This paper is intended to explore the legitimate and malicious uses of steganography and
the lack of defensive strategies to counter steganographic techniques. To adequately
understand the subject material, the paper provides background information on the
history of steganography, an overview of different types of steganography and popular
steganographic tools.

                           “Steganography is the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the existence of
the communication’ (Johnson). According to nameless “U.S. officials and experts” and “U.S.
and foreign officials,” terrorist groups are “hiding maps and photographs of terrorist targets and
posting instructions for terrorist activities on sports chat rooms, pornographic bulletin boards and
other Web sites” (Schneier). Three years ago, FBI Director Louis Freeh tried to convince
government authorities that terrorists were using encryption and steganography to support their
organizations. Freeh urged legislators to enact stricter Internet usage laws, emphasizing that
ignoring the issue would not only cause harm to the United States, but that it would make the
fight against terrorism extremely difficult (McCullagh). Today, terrorist organizations such as
Hamas, Hezbollah, al Qaeda, and others, are employing advanced steganography techniques to
pass sensitive communications across the Internet, undetected. In the wake of several highly
coordinated and deadly terrorist attacks, the United States government, and indeed, the world, is
hastening to discover viable methods for the detection and prevention of this electronic
subterfuge, in the hope that denying criminal networks (the use of the Internet as a
communications medium) will render them incapable of mounting another attack that could cost
more lives.

                             The constructs I present are based on the physics of materials and dynamic loading mechanisms, things I know well.  Take it or leave it, my intentions here are not to argue with people like you whom I come to respect.  I will admit that I may be mistaken with my analysis of WTC 7 yet find my judgment based on key details and my fundamental understanding of failures analysis, materials, dynamics, and structures.   With that said, your Ad hominem abusive fallacy:

                    They were willing participants but just the hired help. The real kernel of pure evil came from David Rockefeller and George H.W. Bush. Those were the two dyed in the wool American Aristocrats that made everything possible. Go see a move called The Good Sheppard. It'll help explain most of 9/11.

              Absolutely amazing. I don't see how he connects Lee Stranahan to Russia though. He says Russia may have hired Mossad in this case. But what would be their motive? And is his claim that Webb and Jason were brought together by Stranahan based on the fact that Webb met with him, and Jason entered the scene shortly after? Or is there more? Because that's not a very strong case.

               The Chabad Movement is the potential connection. The Mossad "allegedly" use Chabad Houses all over the world as their base of operations. I used the word allegedly but there is enough credible  evidence to suggest this is true.

               's Neo-Nazi efforts.  It is nearly comical.  The 'evidence' they present and link is baseless and refutable.
              </p>
              <p>
               for example:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The "big tell" that gave the whole thing away was when Dave went out of his way to bring attention to this discovery

              <p>
               All George Webb had to say Is "UN Generals" and David Deleted his video you note and apologized.
