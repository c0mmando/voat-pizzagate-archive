<p>Does anyone know if Fort Riley is mentioned further in Nick Bryant\'s or John Decamp\'s books about the Franklin Scandal? Or in the documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;?  Or any other damning info on Ft. Riley related to Child sexual abuse/pornography/trafficking?</p>
<p>**This is related to PG as this deals with organized, often elite, child sexual abuse rings **involving molestation and rape, child pornography, and child sex trafficking.  This post is a piece of the puzzle in trying to expose organized child sexual abuse on army bases, as we know this occurred in the past at Presidio and other army bases.</p>

           Does anyone know if Fort Riley is mentioned further in Nick Bryant's or John Decamp's books about the Franklin Scandal? Or in the documentary "Conspiracy of Silence"?  Or any other damning info on Ft. Riley related to Child sexual abuse/pornography/trafficking?
          </p>
          <p>
           **This is related to PG as this deals with organized, often elite, child sexual abuse rings **involving molestation and rape, child pornography, and child sex trafficking.  This post is a piece of the puzzle in trying to expose organized child sexual abuse on army bases, as we know this occurred in the past at Presidio and other army bases.

            This May 2017 Fort Riley article title: "Dynamic childcare duo puts kids above themselves" --- interestingly is meant to inspire "trust" but has nothing to do with the article.

            Two preschool teachers are jokingly referred to as
            <strong>
             "partners-in-crime"
            </strong>
            with no supporting context for the joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            The classroom number 136 is mentioned four times needlessly.  (Which seems like a number the Cabal would like but I don't know.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the teacher misspoke but children should not be commended for putting
            <strong>
             "all"
            </strong>
            their trust in a teacher.  And trust is gone on about regarding the teachers, reminding me of the CPP manager interview.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “I trust her,” Johnson said of Toombs. “I know I can count on (Toombs), I know I can.”  Johnson said this
             <strong>
              deep trust
             </strong>
             she and Toombs share carries over the kids in their classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
             “For (the child) to trust us and go on the bus with us and go to the pumpkin patch and not be scared anymore, that made us feel good because (the child) put
             <strong>
              all her trust
             </strong>
             into us,” Toombs said.
             <strong>
              “That was good for the child.”
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            The pumpkin (Halloween = highest Satanic holiday week) reference might be innocent.   But yesterday (in July) while researching Jamaica's IC ties, this Halloween-ish ad unnerved me and I screen captured it:
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4317/35390229184_58822a383c_o.png">
             CIA/MK Ultra cell World Vision ad shows a child wearing Halloween-striped orange and black tights/leggings.
            </a>
            (And uses NLProgramming -- a command to give, followed by a vague term, hope, designed to confuse the reader with nonsense, forcing them to think of how that might make sense in their own life. In other words, donating "hope" to World Vision, blindly.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, back to potential Halloween references thrown out "innocently," the leggings just don't look "right" to me knowing many children are said to be sacrificed around Halloween, sadly particularly those who who might not be looked for.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not accusing these teachers or the journalist of anything, but parents need to beware and go with their gut instincts.

            Nice work on this well-documented submission!  I plan to spend some time going through all of the articles you have linked to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I just wanted to say aloud that I really appreciate everyone on the Pizzagate subverse for the collective dedication to this important cause.  It is a tangled, sick web and I've personally gone through many stages of the grief process throughout my journey after discovering how rampant this is, the historical collusion which is world-wide and the many links to deep, dark places.  This investigative work is not for the faint of heart.  For the sake of the children, please keep on uncovering the myriad of connections and moving forward with this important work, friends.

             Great comment! I would add that witnessing the "collective dedication" of pizzagaters as you so deftly put it has time and again made me proud to be part of this community and proud of my country, even in the midst of this disgusting and shameful corruption. The evil has inspired a great burgeoning of good, and it's a wonder to behold.

            Makes sense. Gave them the Joe and Frank treatment for the two cities closest to the base, Manhattan and Junction City.

            One of the phone numbers listed goes to an elementary school and another goes to a radiology clinic. What's notable about the many radiology hits people are getting, is that there was a Senate committee meeting in 1997 where testimony from people who'd been tortured via radiology thru the MKUltra program, which in turn ties to much of the sexual abuses at army bases.

            great compilation. For all those arrests, you got to imagine that there are so many more cases at Ft Riley unreported.

             Totally. Thanks. With all the shills, I anticipated comments mocking this. Yeah, a shocking percentage of cases are never reported. Children and adults, too. Lots of threats.
