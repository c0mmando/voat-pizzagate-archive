            Was he transporting them for his own use or someone else's? Oh, now that I re read it, sounds like for his own personal use. What if he was told, if you get caught you tell them it was for your own use and here's some child porn to make you look even more guilty. Which state line was he crossing would be interesting to know. Maybe they'll get some info out of him, but someone up the chain of command will probably stop it from surfacing.

            At least one less transporter for them to use. If we take away all their wheels, they may have to start moving the kids on  their own. Or hire someone they haven't trained and sufficiently scared into subservience yet. Mistakes will start to happen, their walls will crumble.
