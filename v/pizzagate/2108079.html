<p>Backstory: I love Browning\'s poems, and years ago, I wanted to understand one called Porphyria\'s Lover. I looked into it, and found the disease in the poem, porphyria, or the Royal Disease, has a huge incidence among Ashkenazi Jews, as do a <em>huge</em> number of other <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x3JqCFB.png">genetic disorders</a>. The historic cure for porphyria was <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/born-to-the-purple-the-st/">drinking blood</a>. From there, I found this disease called Tay-Sachs which only affects them, and there is no cure, but thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>Years after finding that, I read a novel that had a character with Tay-Sachs, who was taken from her family to be with people who cured her with blood, and it was written in a way that I have come to associate with hidden meaning - not to mention the link between porphyria, blood drinking, and Tay-Sachs - so I looked in earnest in to Tay-Sachs, and it turns out that there <em>is</em> a cure, only to be found in Israel, and the kids who are diagnosed with the disease are taken from their families to Israel to get treatment. It\'s hard as hell to find what that treatment is, but.... <a href="https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/chasing-a-cure-for-tay-sachs/article_1c2aaaff-aa4d-55f8-8584-99e5111d5805.html">It\'s blood</a>, and marrow. It has been cured with a transfusion of pure umbilical blood, a full replacement of all blood within the child, though historically, it was done through, again, <em>bibens sanguinum</em> (which is the Hebrew translation of the word <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DkDFec14veQC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=bibens+sanguinum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XKt7cBYKUp&amp;sig=JeE-UgMfKO-vP_yBJEM5ZurW2Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN55vA5IjWAhXox4MKHQpLCPUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bibens%20sanguinum&amp;f=true">&quot;Damascus&quot;</a>, because it was where Cain slayed Abel), or literally, drinking blood, done every so often. This has been a <a href="https://archive.org/details/EustaceMullins-TheCurseOfCanaanADemonologyOfHistory1987">theme</a> since Canaanites came into existence.</p>
<p>Ok so, yeah, I\'m a crazy person, right? I have to be making this up, and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vp3crcQ.jpg">no one else in history</a> might have stumbled upon this imagined trail of bread crumbs. Turns out that the time in which Jews migrated to Europe, there also happened to arise the mythos of vampirism. You can escape a vampire if you drop a coin on the ground. Bram Stoker\'s Dracula was a Jew. Elizabeth Bathory was a Jew. Motzah balls, traditional ones served at passover, call for the blood of gentile children, and it is a well-kept secret that this practice continues in <a href="https://youtu.be/b98ch_Pyi-Y">some circles today</a>. Hemophilia (love of blood) is a typically Ashkenazi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030906102702/http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org:80/what/ashkenazi/factor.asp">disease</a> (Factor XI deficiency).</p>
<p>I should say that I don\'t think all Ashkenazi are literally vampires, but that the <em>myth</em> of vampirism arose from them. Speaking of, look at Marina Abramovic, the Spirit Cooking lady. She\'s fucking <em>70</em>. She is quite obviously a Jew, but her wikipedia page has been scrubbed of any mention of her heritage, though it still lists it in <a href="https://voat.co/v/politics/1389732">search engines</a></p>
<p>From there, I found out about &quot;blood libel&quot; and that Ashkenazi Jews have been responsible for the Jews expulsion from <a href="https://i.imgur.com/COeg4Q7.png">350+</a> nations over the past few hundred years. 100+ of those were for <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4XApL7z.png">blood rituals</a> involving the murder of gentile male Christian children under the age of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DdYf4Wp.jpg">7</a> (NSFL)................................. Here\'s a <em>very</em> suppressed <a href="https://8ch.net/zundel/res/1460.html">book</a>, written by a Rabbi, chronicling the history of Jewish blood ritual. </p>
<p>If the Ashkenazi don\'t interbreed with the races around them, their DNA breaks down within 3 generations, as if there were no &quot;glue&quot; to hold them together, but also, it seems to me, in a symbolic sense, that there <em>is no growth, no evolution</em>, no <strong>negentropy</strong>. It seems they are always dying, never growing.</p>
<p>The kicker is that these Jews, the evil ones who engage in this practice, are not even Jews, and it has been proven. You won\'t find anything but the typical apologetics that occur when an individual or group accidentally expose them, but the popular genetics website 23andme <a href="http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/381367/why-did-23andme-tell-ashkenazi-jews-they-could-be-descended-from-khazars/">concluded the link</a> between the Ashkenazi and the Khazars, who are Caucasian Babylonian Talmudic practitioners who infiltrated and took over Judaism. This renders their claim to Israel moot, and proves that the Jews who appear white are Jews in name only. Those same Jews are the ones who <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FyXSecJ.jpg">infiltrate positions of power</a> in order to pervert them. </p>
<p>Just..         .................................................................................................................................................................................................................  I know what it sounds like, but I think that there might be people without the inborn life-giving spirit of God, who must then steal it from others, and who use God\'s &quot;chosen&quot; people to hide behind (I know many <em>very</em> good Jews).. The bible speaks of Satan and his host being cast to earth in the form of man, during which time they mated with man and created the Nephilim, or <a href="http://murderbymedia.org/2015/08/19/the-golem-the-jewish-anti-race/">&quot;golems&quot;</a> as some call them. Many Rabbis say this <a href="https://youtu.be/ZVq_fWwuR-8">themselves</a>. (&lt;---- WATCH THAT)</p>
<p>So yeah ok just typing that out makes me feel bad, but I got here from a love of Browning\'s poetry, and I did not want to believe this at all. I just sat down and did my research, and it\'s by no means complete, but here are the threads I\'m trying to tie together.

            I think you've misread a source here.

           <blockquote>

             It has been cured with a transfusion of pure umbilical blood, a full replacement of all blood within the child, though historically, it was done through, again, bibens sanguinum (which is the Hebrew translation of the word "Damascus", because it was where Cain slayed Abel), or literally, drinking blood, done every so often.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Okay, so what I see are some widely scattered Christian sources -- Orthodox Byzantines, Anglo-Saxons, and Italians -- each seizing on the very rough etymology that "dam" = "blood" and "shaqa" = drink, thus Damascus means "drinking blood" in Hebrew. But what I don't see are any Hebrew scholars saying that, and for fairly good reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Damascus is something like 5,000 years old, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The earliest written reference to the name is in Egyptian hieroglyphics in 1500 BC, as "dimasq". There is a huge scholarly literature on this. Those wanting the short version can look at
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus">
             the intro-level Wikipedia article
            </a>
            , or at
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_names_of_Asian_cities_in_different_languages#Damascus">
             this other Wikipedia article listing all the different languages with names for Damascus
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, the name for Damascus was established hundreds of years before the Exodus or the establishment of ancient Israel. The Hebrew pronunciation is dahm-MEH-sehk, which is just their way of adopting the foreign place name. The various Old Testament scholars from the 6th, 11th, or 15th centuries who thought it had something to do with blood drinking were, well, rationalizing in the absence of solid archeological data.
           </p>
           <p>
            This doesn't mean that I don't find Marina Abramovic and her blood rituals incredibly creepy. I think there really are elites sacrificing children and drinking their blood. But this argument needs to be way stronger before it can withstand criticism by anyone not already sold on PG. I'm not an Old Testament scholar, just a guy who retains random facts from history. I knew that Damascus got its name very early on, and so do lots of other people.

             It was named as such for the rampant Jewish sacrifices which ruled their temples and society at large until the coming of Christ. I'm sure you can understand why I value histories over wikipedia, in today's world.

              Okay, I don't disagree that ancient Israel engaged in human sacrifice. The story of Jephthah, among others, proves that they did.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it still doesn't make sense for them to name a foreign city, one that ancient Israel never controlled, for blood drinking. The Egyptians called it "dimasq" centuries before Israel was even founded, because that was what the inhabitants called it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Old Testament scholars you cited wanted to see a deeper meaning in the name. They wanted to see God's hand behind it. So they suggested that Cain murdered Abel there, before there even was a city, and that while the local inhabitants who arrived later thought they were coming up with their own name, they were drawn to the name Damascus because it had this secret Hebrew meaning.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem with that is that not even most Christians will go along with that reasoning. It's a medieval heresy, something that got dropped long ago from mainstream theology.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think it is reasonable and appropriate to look again at the blood libel, and see if possibly something important got missed. But if you put this kind of detail into something meant for normies, you will lose them. I don't see the necessity of doing this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can you see what I mean?

               Oh, come now. It's only etymology, on sound footing, no different than any other place named for a historical event. I think that that word's history would be the last thing that a person might take issue with in reading all of this. lol

               Are you Jewish, by chance? I only ask because you seem very familiar with a realm of things that I myself found to be exceptionally occulted, and I cannot imagine that one would come to such a defensive position of such information without an invested interest in it.  I mean no offense in asking, but only to say that I am 1/4 Jewish, myself, and I know that all this hiding is going to bring nothing but pain, so it is good to bring light to those of our heritage who commit atrocities.

                Let me give you an analogy. Suppose you meet a man named Pilchuck. You remark that Pilchuck originates from a Chinook Indian term meaning 'red water' or 'red creek' (which it does) and that the existence of people named Pilchuck proves that there were Satanists hiding among the Chinook Indians who carried out human sacrifices (which is nothing but an arbitrary assertion on your part).
               </p>
               <p>
                Damascus wasn't named for blood drinking. It isn't a clue. It doesn't lead anywhere.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, I've had my say. Thanks for being polite.

            I'd say the real nasty elements of Caanites went to Khzaria and taught them all this Satanic stuff. Russia cracked down on Khzaria -&gt; they fake convert to jew -&gt; infiltrate -&gt; rest is history. One of my sources (let's nick name him "White Dragon") refers to them as the Khzarian Mafia.

            I had come to the conclusion that the Blood Libel.......is real many months ago.  Crazy world but that is the reason the Jews get in trouble everywhere they go.  The Satanist who ride them like a tick....the Satanist are riding the Jews and the Jews are riding Humanity.

             I am 1/4 Jewish, yes. Secularly raised, my grandmother was 1/2 Misrahi Jew. I offer you this information in the trust that all men are not ravenously undiscerning beasts bent on blood and genocide; that there are those who simply wish to find and excise the cancer that infects our world; that some men want to save children more than want to see death. You are welcome.

             -- this the most important and hardest inherit truth to navigate. It's a complex tangled web, and it'll be a great challenge for all sides of humanity to overcome. The most immediate problem is the geopolitical one.

             I have never been religious but I think I read that either Jesus or the book of Enoch or Revelations that said beware the Jews who are not Jews.....it is amazing.  I have come to the conclusion that this shit is for real.  Either the Prophecies are legit or the Jews who are not Jews are following the Prophecies as a kind of playbook because THEY believe it.  They are talking about Lucifer.  Bringing in the AntiChrist.

             Imagine being a normal dude.  46 years old and not taking anything too seriously.....then waking up and figuring out a Satanic Cult is in control of the whole damn world and has been for at least the last 100 years and they are putting in the final brinks in the wall.....
            </p>
            <p>
             This is what is going on.

             One good thing...if we can just wake people up....we have DNA now....we can isolate them or eliminate them totally if if comes to that.  DNA will reveal all their connections.  It will show that our leaders around the world who we think are unrelated are really a extended family.

            I guess I don't understand why greater specificity is a bad thing.. I'm open to the idea, and I don't mean to disregard, but I don't see how that would be better, in all honesty.
