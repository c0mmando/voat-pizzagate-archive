I could have gone with Kamala Harris ... or Monster &quot;Can\'t Sing&quot; Gaga, but there were these pics of Skeletor, and I thought, oh, why not choose Angelina! For what she did to Shiloh, she should have a permanent membership in this club. Yup, skank! You\'re a Hall of Famer! So let\'s see why she\'s earned that title! </p>
<p>Let\'s begin with this fantastic article on pizzagate that includes a chapter-and-verse explanation on Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington and the discovery of a black book. It also contained a blurb or two on Whorelina that got my wheels spinning:  
</p>

<p>The rumors have been going around for a long time with people saying her split with her father, Jon Voight, is due to him having molested her.</p>
<p>Others believe she has had an incestuous relationship with her brother thanks to a kiss she gave him when she won an award in 2000.</p>
<p>Several years back, some X rated bondage pictures of Angelina surfaced she seems to have taken before her meteoric rise to fame in tinseltown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bondage pictures of the Mother of the Year?  I chanced clicking the link. After all, I had just eaten, but for you, you awesome members of Voat, what the hell? Plus I had to strengthen the gag reflex to get ready for that Killary tape that is set to drop. </p>

<p>I’d like to give Angelina Jolie the ol’ in out in out real savage. I bet alot of Yahoodie hollywood producers would like to give her the ol in out as well. Old man Rothschild likes his MK-Ultra whores submissive. His favorite time of year is winter solstice. That’s when Strauss Khan likes to come over to Rothschilds mansion for an orgy with his droogs.</p>
<p>Just thinking of an orgy is making me sick. Ahh! I think I’m gonna be sick. Bog help me.</p>

<p>After seeing the fucked up mess that the media hypes as saintly because .... because ... yeah, because why? Oh, because the Cannibal Elite tell them to! That\'s why! So after see these pics, I went on ... dumpster diving with impunity! Take that, Skippy! The next dive took me to a naked Jolie cuddling a horse?!!!! Is this precoitus? </p>

<p>Looking at the picture you can deduce Ms. Jolie has had experience with bestiality. To me it’s not a great revelation that Angelina Jolie is a whore. Hollywood is built on whores. The average tabloid reader that sees the United Nations psy ops thinks she is a saint. This is what is intended to further the one world agenda. The rainbow family she has created is all carefully contrived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well said! But let\'s return to that first link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both Vicky Cornell and Courtney Love are good friends with known satanist, Linda Ramone.</p>
<p>Both Love and Ramone attended Chris Cornell’s funeral.</p>
<p>Linda Ramone is good friends with performance artists and known satanic worshipper Marina Abramovic.</p>
<p>In this video report, explains how Marina is a suspected high priestess in the Illuminati, responsible
for bringing in new members to the satanic cult. In the wikileaks emails, her name is tied to John Podesta when she invites him to a spirit cooking party.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZdRNSuA5Xk&amp;t=26s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZdRNSuA5Xk&amp;t=26s</a></p>
<p>In 2013, both Angelina Jolie and Marina Abramovic appear in a documentary together that depicts their travel in the Balkans. Are you starting to connect the dots?</p>
<p>Other rumored big name celebs involved in the satanic pedophile cult is: Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro, Ashton Kutcher, Tom Delonge, Will Ferrell, John Cusack, Jack Black &amp; Jennifer Aniston’s husband Justin Theroux, to name only a few of the suspected satanic pedophile monsters.</p>
<p>Just after Chris Cornell was found dead in room #1136, both Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt were seen at the big Glastonbury rock show together.</p>
<p>Next, Brad Pitt was filmed with Cornell’s kids at Disneyland, despite the fact that just months before
he was put under investigation by his estranged wife, actress Angelina Jolie, by way of CPS for possible child endangerment… verbally and physically abusing one of his sons while on a commercial plane ride.</p>
<p>Angelina Jolie herself believed to be deeply into the occult has a tattoo that says “Wild at heart but kept in cages”.</p>
<p>TMD learned from a source that back when she was in high school, Angie Voight, as she was known back then was into the occult and satan in her early twenties before making it big in Hollywood.</p>
<p>“She had candles lit throughout her room with big black curtains and she collected knives. A lot of them. One time she accidentally stabbed me with one of them,” claimed the source. </p>
<p>Angelina could not fight off becoming an MK Ultra programmed operative for the illuminati it seems.</p>
<p>A horrifying alleged account of Angelina’s past was shared online last year:</p>
<p>“When Angelina was 6 years old her mother, Bill Day and her father allegedly ran pedophile parties. They had this kid delivered to them, he was about 15 years old at the time. They drugged him from day one, used him as Angelina’s servant and Marcheline’s boy toy. The kid ended up being tortured and programmed by Voight’s friend George Bush Sr. and a few of his CIA men. The kid broke the programming one day and tried to save Angie and her mother from them but unfortunately for him Angie’s mother was part of the problem. They ended up trying to frame him for sex with Angie which they forced him to do, all to cover up the elitists pedophile ring. The kid ended up having his life destroyed, he almost got some justice with a 10 mil settlement but his family and friends drugged him and had him sign over the money, he tried to kill his mother and sister who both are/were evil whores that were part of this group of scum bags. Voight and his mother split 10 million he was supposed to receive in a settlement. They ended up getting cops, FBI, CIA and judges all paid off to cover up what was done to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm ... have we done a dig on Bill Day? Maybe we should. But he boy in question was Randal Turner. Here is an in-depth article on what allegedly transpired. He claims he was turned into a slave of Angelina\'s through the use of drugs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@VCBestor/breaking-witness-to-drug-controlled-hollywood-slaves-58f599f0e1fa">https://medium.com/@VCBestor/breaking-witness-to-drug-controlled-hollywood-slaves-58f599f0e1fa</a></p>
<p>Emboldened by the flood of victims now speaking out about Hollywood, a new eyewitness just came forward to confirm some of Randal Turner’s shocking memories of being a slave to Angelina Jolie when they were children.</p>
<p>How did it all come about? Needing money, Randy Turner’s mom sold the boy in 1980 to Angelina Jolie’s parents to serve as the small girl’s bodyguard, nanny and playmate. Her movie-star dad Jon Voight provided mind-control drugs to enslave Randy, the survivor recalls. Voight’s ex-wife Marcheline and her partner, producer Bill Day, also used the drugs to train fifteen-year old Randy to obey tiny Angie Jolie.</p>
<p>Randy’s psyche was intentionally splintered using trauma-based mind control. He says Bill Day also gave the drugs to Jolie.</p>
<p>Corroborating some of Randy’s allegations, the latest eyewitness is closely related to a household name and has “other family members who remember and can validate a lot.” But it’s not only life-threatening to testify about the high-level human trafficking industry, it’s emotionally brutal: “What I and my family remember is crazy as hell. I don’t want to be this person….. I’d rather deny everything and just claim to be insane.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In closing, I\'d like to squeeze in one more whore ... MONSTER GAGA ... and return to the topic of vomiting mentioned at the start of this post. Why? Because it seems something that MONSTER GAGA is quite fond of.  Here is the monstrous whore that everyone says is just so nicey nicey being thrown up on! Yes, just like the girl next door! No wonder people admire this POS! Look at all the zombies watching this PERFORMANCE?!!!! Is that what they think it is? Whatever!  Starts around 3:40.</p>
<p>Enjoy! </p>

            Well the story is a little off as far as Angie's age when they drugged me and framed me to get some of my settlement money it's basically close enough I guess. There is a lot more to the story that you can't fit into a simple Blog like this and many of those in Hollywood were/are victims of mind control. Most of the women who are successful in Hollywood made it there by sleeping with somebody and to become a A lister they make incriminating videos of you with under age kids then keep them to hold over you and control the money. I changed all that in the mid 2000s after exposing what was going on but then they used Angie to drug me and program me then frame me for sex crimes again, She played good until they had me where they wanted me and drugged me up with the help of Tom Cruise. I was also the guy he cut the oxygen off on during a flight from LA to his house in Colorado so I could visit Katie who I helped when she started her career. I can tell how much you loath all these people but remember at one time they weren't as evil as they have become and Angie was trained to be ruthless like Trump's father trained him to be. I've knew Trump since 1980-81 and i could tell you stories about him that would shock you more than Angie and these other Hollywood celebs.

             I guess it's a case of becoming more and more depraved. Power and control does that.

              I have a lot of memories I am still working on piecing together, my story is so outragious it's hard for people to fathom it being true but I have proof of many of the events I was used for.

            Bellas Dad claims to be descendant to Zahir's father and grandfather had both served as the multazim. I stopped research right there. As I have said many times before, Courtney contracted El Duce, Mentors (band) - Wikipedia. Kurt Cobain would have been 51 years old, yesterday, maybe, and still be in this Satanic cult.

             Several stories have been floated amongst the fake news outlets about faked sexual videos. Of course, the technology was allegedly used by the Russians
             <em>
              cough cough
             </em>
             to produce embarrassing tapes to blackmail key politicians. Now we Voaters are onto this. There was always the rumor that a Killary sex tape was found on Weiner's computer. Soooo, we Voates are not slow. It means the news stories were meant to explain the dumping of this video on the web and discredit it as fake.
            </p>
            <p>
             I contend that there isn't another body double in the world with those cankles, but we'll see ... even though most of us will be turned off sex probably for forever.

             I've seen this before but I don't remember the end!  When she says she tried something with her snake and had to kill it, and the girl says CUT and the film ends.  Jesus.

            I've told people for years, the more that a celebrity tries to put up an image that they are a "good person," it becomes more and more likely that they are trying to use philanthropy to cover up their truly evil deeds. The people who have the biggest "charities" are probably the biggest scumbags of them all. Look at the Clintons/Bill Gates. They "give" tons of money, and then end up doing really fucked up shit with their "initiatives" and "projects" with overseas populations, like when a vaccine given out by Gates' foundation injured and killed tons of African children. Don't trust anyone who goes out of their way to portray a "loving, caring" public image.

               Hmm, they even bothered to put him in a red sweater, lol. Usually he wears dark colours. In a way it's funny when you've all the background knowledge we have now, it's quite entertaining to watch this. (Ok, only for a couple of minutes...., lol.)

             In terms of Jolie, I had not heard or seen some of these things. I didn't realize how lucky I was, but thought I'd share for those in the dark as I was.

              Oh yes, so much about AJ is out there. Such a beautiful women and as a child, very strikingl too. A pedo's absolute dream, like Brooke Shields. No doubt both parents were getting high and pimping her put. Jon Voight was in so many of those 70s 80s testosterone films I wonder if he was lending her to some of his co-stars.

               You know, if she wasn't so malevolent, I would almost feel sorry for her. But I can't because she's become as great a monster as the ones who created her.

               Love how people consider these celebs and their families to be "distinguished," when in reality these people are no different than a meth head at a laundromat, itching and scratching and desperately waiting for their next high. The people you consider to be "high class" are high, all right. High as fuck, because they're a bunch of Heroin, Coke, and Adrenochrome junkies. Then they get to stand up on pedestals and preach their moral wisdom onto the masses, and the worst part is that the normies just believe every word of it.

                PStomp, did you read this story about a British aristocrat (family worth billions - they invented the carton 'Tetrapak') who was so high on crack and meth, he forgot that his wife overdosed and died and just sealed up one of the doors in his 100 room mansion to stop the smell. WHAT in the FKING FUCK! Of course, he just gets called a silly boy and everyone just rolls their eyes....

                 The foulest, most disgusting, drug-addled pieces of shit always seem to make it into the highest positions of power imaginable. It is sickening how these "people" actually dictate our lives in one way or another.

             Thank you, derram, for the Marina Abramovic and Lady Gaga videos. Shocking doesn't even begin to describe their sheer depravity. America's pop culture is even worse than I'd thought -- and I consider myself well informed. :(
