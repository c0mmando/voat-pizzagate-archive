<p>There seems to be little information on the internet about OTTO but I did find this article: <a href="http://archive.is/QCoAb">http://archive.is/QCoAb</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is remote and sparsely populated country, even today. And, wouldn\'t you know, ICE Station Ottocoincidentally happens to be located just after mile marker 33. Why mile 33? Well, in the world of strange, space-time and mind-bending forces, realities, events, factions, plots, conspiracies and technologies of all stripes and improbable persuasions, the number 33 pops up time and again. That\'s just the way it is, for whatever reason. More than that I cannot tell you. </p>
<p>There are fewer antennas now than there were in 1989, but the appearance is practically identical in all other respects. The whited out area of the faded sign out front conceals the name of Sandia National Laboratory on the southeast outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico. And, yes, it is my highly educated observation that ICE Station Otto is a part of the secret electromagnetic research that the USA military-industrial-espionage complex has been carrying on for at least the last 100 years, and probably longer.  ..</p>
<p>I worked out the exact latitude-longitude coordinates of the installation and sent them to Bruce Cathie (now deceased), the pioneering New Zealand researcher into the shadowy, global electromagnetic grid network that has been set up in recent decades by the alphabet soup agencies of the world\'s major governments. He did respond to me and verified that the ICE Station Otto facility fits extremely precisely into the grid network that his research had discovered, and not only does it fit, but it fits with an exceptional accuracy of several decimal points. If you physically visit the place, you can verify this for yourself, by driving in from Moriarty, and as you crest the hill and descend towards ICE Station Otto you will see that New Mexico Rte. 41 was originally built so that it physically, slightly deviates and curves around ICE Station Otto. The ICE station takes precedence. The road was displaced, not the ICE station. The antennas have been extremely precisely positioned. </p>
<p>VAL COMM in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the outfit that answers the telephone for ICE Station Otto. If you want to know more, ask VAL COMM. I did. They have their name out front and presumably know something about it. For the record, I telephoned them in 1989 and inquired about ICE Station Otto. The only response was, &quot;Do you have a need to know?&quot; Of course, this is a clear signal that ICE Station Otto is, to at least some degree, a secret project, a black project, a classified project, etc., since &quot;need to know&quot; is the operative mechanism for preserving secrecy in compartmentalized operations of the military-industrial-espionage complex. Only those with a &quot;need to know&quot; are permitted to &quot;know&quot; about a given project\'s operational parameters. So I said that, yes, I did have a &quot;need to know.&quot; And then I was given a dog and pony show explanation about how the Sandia National Laboratory is running an experiment in using the ionized trails of meteors to reflect radio waves as a secure communications mode, or some such hokum. </p>
<p>The ICE Station Otto installation, and its stealthy, shadowy connection with the USA military-industrial-espionage complex (i.e., the USA Department of Energy - Sandia National Laboratory) are clearly an integral part of the eerily shimmering, overhead control grid  ..</p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This week, SFR explores the world of farm subsidies in Santa Fe County—the vast majority of which end up with the King family (ex-Gov. Bruce, current Attorney General Gary, state Rep. Rhonda, PRC Chairman David, etc.)
            </p>
            <h1 id="md-the-patriarch">
             The Patriarch
            </h1>
            <p>
             In 1918, Mollie and William King left Texas and homesteaded on 160 acres of farmland in Stanley, N.M. They had four children and began building what would someday be among the largest corn and alfalfa operations in Santa Fe County.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Holdings - Taken together, the King family's four Santa Fe County properties account for the bulk of the farm subsidies coming into Santa Fe County—not to mention what they get for their holdings in neighboring Torrance County. Here's the breakdown for farm subsidies received in the past 15 years, 1995-2009:
            </p>
            <p>
             King Brothers: $1,227,567
            </p>
            <p>
             King Farms: $912,689
            </p>
            <p>
             Pine Canyon Ranch: $649,988
            </p>
            <p>
             King Land &amp; Cattle: $372,405
            </p>
            <p>
             TOTAL: $2,125,277
            </p>
            <p>
             Not all that money comes in the form of direct payments. In the case of Pine Canyon Ranch, which is currently
            </p>
            <p>
             advertised as a future subdivision, most federal subsidies have been for conservation reserve programs. But the rest of the roughly $45,000 King brothers and heirs received last year from the feds went almost exclusively to direct payments for commodity crops— "the most egregious" kind of subsidy, according to Environmental Working Group adviser Don Carr.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Three Brothers William's three sons— Sam King, Sr, former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King (who passed away last November) and Don L. King —share ownership of King Brothers, the top-ranked farm subsidy beneficiary in the county. Note: Since these are 2009 numbers, they may not accurately reflect ownership shares since former Gov. King's death
            </p>

            <p>
             According to the family members SFR spoke with, Bill and Sam L. King handle most of the family farming operations. The Environmental Working Group, which publishes an annual database of federal farm subsidy payments, cautions users not to equate ownership shares with actual payouts.
            </p>
            <p>
             All King holdings receive subsidies from both Santa Fe and Torrance Counties, but primarily from Santa Fe, so (particularly with King Land &amp; Cattle) Torrance County shares likely mean very little in the way of actual subsidy payments, which is why SFR is using percentages.

            , any thoughts about how this might be connected to Epstein? Are there any connections between Sandia Labs and our favorite pedo billionaire? How long has the research facility been there, compared to Epstein's ownership of the ranch?

            <p>
             I'm looking further into the connections but to give you a short and dirty answer... the history of the King family and their estate holdings in NM ties in with the development of a number of military sites within that region.. so the connections to Sandia Labs pre-dates Epstein but seems to be deeply connected with the King family.  I have some data on that and will present it at some point..

             For now, a couple of posts/threads show links between Epstein, Sandia and NXIVM.. Read :

             Sandia Base history.  Is Zoro Ranch.....Z Division?
            </p>
            <p>
             "Atomic Bomb engineering was carried out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos.[4] Z Division was conceived as an ordnance design, testing, and assembly arm. However, space was at a premium at Los Alamos. Additionally, members of Z Division needed to work closely with the military. Groves also decided as part of an effort to retain personnel to focus the laboratory more on weapons development by relocating various weapons production and assembly activities away from Los Alamos. Thus, the decision was taken to move Z Division to the old Oxnard Field. Already at the close of the war, the engineering group of Z Division had begun consolidating weapons assembly functions there. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. By 1946, the site was being referred to as "Sandia Base" after the nearby Sandia Mountains."  MORE:

            I know a crazy old physics dude who's heavy into harmonics &amp; electromagnetic tech, I should totally ask him about this as he's a big conspiracy believer, my Dad might even have her books. Can't believe how old Otto Airfield is &amp; I've never heard it before. Already just looking at Epstein's properties brings up echoes of almost every major running conspiracy theory in the last few decades, if you want to separate them by category; tech, QFT, military, political, entertainment, medical/pharma, brainwashing, occultism, paedophilia, mass murder.

            Otto Intermediate Field was one of the nationwide network of Intermediate Fields
           </p>
           <p>
            established by the Commerce Department in the 1930s along commercial airways between major cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The date of establishment of Otto Intermediate Field has not been determined.
           </p>
           <p>
            The earliest reference which has been located of Otto Intermediate Field was its listing as an airfield &amp; radio facility in the September 1931 Commerce Department Airway Bulletin #1 (according to Steve Owen).
           </p>
           <p>
            The earliest depiction which has been located of Otto Intermediate Field was on the March 1932 Albuquerque Sectional Chart, which labeled it as Landing Field 73A.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 1945 AAF Airfield Directory (courtesy of Scott Murdock) described Otto Intermediate Field as a 153 acre L-shaped property having 3 sand &amp; sod landing strips, the longest being the 4,100' northeast/southwest strip. The field was said to not have any hangars, to be owned by private interests, and operated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...Steve Owen reported, “The 1930s Otto airway station house was shut down as of 1962 and eventually moved to the new Moriarty Airport, as was the Otto beacon tower. Meanwhile, the Otto FSS building &amp; 'delta' antenna towers remained at the old site &amp; became a private enterprise, ('ICE': Ionosphere Communications Experiments).”
            </p>
            <p>
             The site of Otto Intermediate Field is located northeast of the intersection of Route 41 &amp; County Road 6A.

             Ice Station Zebra: Plot Summary
            </p>
            <p>
             "A British doctor, Carpenter, arrives at the dock in Scotland where a nuclear submarine, the USS Dolphin, is preparing to sail. He has orders from the US Fleet commander that he is to be conveyed to Ice Station Zebra, a British research base in the Arctic.
            </p>
            <p>
             The station has sent an SOS: an accident has left many of the scientists dead or injured. Without food or heat the survivors will die within days. Dolphin can travel under the icecap, look for a patch of ice near the base thin enough to break through and rescue the scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dolphin travels to the Arctic and breaks through the ice, first a hundred miles from the base, and second only five miles away. Carpenter and four of the submarine’s crew walk through the blizzard to the base."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Dolphin breaks through the ice and rescues the scientists. Carpenter inspects the base. He discovers the fire was deliberate, and that three of the men were murdered before it started. He explains to the Captain that Soviet agents had infiltrated the base because it had clandestine missile warning equipment. "
            </p>
            <p>
             "Carpenter[blackout] gets the scientists together and reveals he is an MI6 agent and knows who the murderer is.[/blackout]
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason for the murders and the sabotage was [blackout]that vital spy satellite film had landed near Ice Station Zebra. The Soviet agents were ordered to retrieve the film and killed the three scientists when they became suspicious. They sabotaged Dolphin to try and give the Soviets time to retrieve them and the film.[/blackout]
            </p>
            <p>
             Carpenter[blackout] tricks the Soviet agents into confessing and then arrests them.[/blackout]"

             Great research! I've been saying that there was more to Zorro Ranch than sex slaves. It is huge!

             ICE sounds like HAARP. HAARP was based on work of Nicola Tesla. President Trump's uncle had access to Tesla's papers after he died.

             Authorities arrest fugitive New Mexico priest in child sex assault case

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Court documents show 80-year-old Arthur J. Perrault was arrested Thursday in New York, and has been charged with criminal aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact in assaults that federal authorities say happened at Kirtland Airforce Base and Santa Fe National Cemetery.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Perrault, who served in New Mexico under the Archdiocese of Santa Fe from 1973 to 1992, is charged in a seven-count indictment with engaging in acts constituting aggravated sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12. The indictment alleges Perrault repeatedly sexually abused the minor victim in 1991 and 1992 while on federally-protected land

            <p>
             The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) is a USAF Named Unit, assigned to the Air Force Materiel Command at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             The origin of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center began during the post-World War II following the Manhattan Project, which was designed by the United States Army from the outset to be a temporary organization to produce a nuclear weapon. With the end of the war, the establishment of the "Z Division" at Sandia Base and later the Sandia National Laboratory led to the creation of a United States Army Air Forces organization to coordinate military activities with the civilian research organization in 1946. On September 18, 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, separating the Army Air Forces from the Army by creating the independent United States Air Force. The newly-formed Air Force began assuming activities with nuclear research laboratories as the Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union was rising.

             In 1953, Dulles, speaking before a national meeting of Princeton alumni, distinguished two fronts in the then-current "battle for men's minds": a "first front" of mass indoctrination through censorship and propaganda, and a "second front" of individual "brainwashing" and "brain changing." Before an audience of fellow Ivy Leaguers, Dulles skipped the usual pieties about democracy. The same year, Dulles approved the CIA's notorious MKULTRA project, and exempted it from normal CIA financial controls. A partial list of aggressive promoters of this new technology includes
