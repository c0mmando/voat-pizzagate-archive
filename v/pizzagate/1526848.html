Sorry about that, we aren\'t all computer whizzes you know, some of us are nearly over the hill, but regarding this topic matter, very willing to learn.
Now that I can do these things, here are some links I have archived.  The first is the Google search I ran <a href="http://archive.is/ot7PY">http://archive.is/ot7PY</a> for baby pizza clothing.  This next link is one page of the 1,980 products available on cafepress. <a href="http://archive.is/Lm882">http://archive.is/Lm882</a> Some of these items are just... I have no words.  \'Slice pizza not babies\' being one of them.  Two more cafepress pages here <a href="http://archive.is/pBJH6">http://archive.is/pBJH6</a> and here <a href="http://archive.is/DBxI6">http://archive.is/DBxI6</a> .  Spreadshirt  and Redbubble also have loads listed.  I also found this book on Amazon called Pizza Party Book <a href="https://archive.is/iZRbf">https://archive.is/iZRbf</a> the comments section is interesting.
Relevance to pizzagate sub I believe in that it shows how embedded the darkness goes and a wider net of searching might be at hand to get a more damning picture. Lots of those clothes are probably innocent, but the fact that a possible code has been found relating to this food group and given some of the symbology on these, just makes me shudder.  For some reason I couldn\'t archive some pages it just kept crashing and so I took screen shots instead.  I don\'t know how to present those here so if you could help an ole timer out and let me know how, I can do that too.
Another one of interest is an artist that was shared through an art group on twitter by an artist called Kazuhiro Hori art, this collection is called stolen childhood, beauty nightmares.  I\'m always very careful with art because as an artist myself I often paint things in my life including traumas I have experienced (thankfully nothing like what is going on with pizzagate, but we all have our traumas) so be mindful when dealing with art as they may be expressing what happened to them, rather than what they are doing to someone else. <a href="https://archive.is/i3k1E">https://archive.is/i3k1E</a>

            I  can so appreciate you not knowing how to archive and have pics go to Sli.mg. I work off my iPad and have hard time. Also, I save threads here but I have no idea where to find them or catalog them to repost in a new post. Maybe somebody will have mercy on us!

             Thank you for your response fellow newbie. (Dressage2).  Its been a learning curve for sure but its something I have to do.  This is global, organised and long standing crime.  It knows no borders or rules and it needs wrenching out of humanity like the cancer it is.
