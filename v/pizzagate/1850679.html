             The two, Ali Hussein Ali and Ibrahim Mukhtar Abasheikh, are believed to be business associates who recently started a human smuggling company by the name Absheikh firm registered with the registrar of companies.

             ...arrested Monday in the coastal town of Malindi.
Somali-born Ali Hussein Ali is accused of being recruited by the Islamic State group after he left Kenya in 2010 and “deployed” back to the country in November, Kinoti said. He also is accused of facilitating the transfer of money to the Islamic State in Libya, concealing its purpose by transferring it through several countries.
Ali allegedly is part of the Magafe human smuggling network in Africa that also engages in the kidnapping for ransom of immigrants going via Libya toward Europe, Kinoti said. Ransom money is channeled through informal money transfers to finance the Islamic State, he said. Ali is accused of overseeing the extortion of at least 10 families of Kenyans kidnapped in Libya with ransoms demanded of up to $7,000, Kinoti said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two other suspects, Kenyans Ibrahim Abasheikh Mukhtar and Abdi Mohamed Yusuf, are accused of housing Islamic State recruits and driving them through borders. Mukhtar owns several houses on Kenya’s coast, Kinoti said, and Yusuf is a long-distance driver.

             Kenya has been trying to stop the recruitment of its youth by extremist groups, notably al-Shabab in neighbouring Somalia. Some recruits have carried out some of the deadliest attacks in Kenya’s history, like the Garissa University attack in April 2015 that killed 148 people. The Somalia-based al-Shabab claimed responsibility for that attack, calling it retribution for Kenya’s sending troops to fight the militants.
Hundreds of Kenyan youth have joined al-Shabab, making them its largest contingent of foreign fighters.

Gold and copper mines in Zambia and South Sudan, extensive investments in real estate and transport in Kenya, Sudan and Lebanon are part of what the Akasha empire allegedly includes.

               Baktash and Ibrahim will be tried alongside the world’s most wanted drug lords, among them Mexican Joaquín Guzmán, alias El Chapo, who was extradited to the US to stand trial for drug trafficking charges.
The Akasha brothers and Guzman were indicted on charges of conspiring to import tonnes of heroin, marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine into the United States from Kenya and Mexico respectively.
Prosecutors believe the cartel may have been the biggest supplier of cocaine to the New York City area for a decade or longer.

                The Times is a reputable source.https://www.reddit.com/r/HillaryForPrison/comments/5nlfnn/wikileaks_mexican_drug_kingpin_el_chapo_donated/  Others were scrubbed (although not that reputable).  We know the Pakistanis are sending drugs in Mangoes.  They are all doing it for the CIA and the Cabal.  They are doing it for money and trying to kill our people.  The CF is a rogue org.  and we know it.  Please check out link.  I could not get it to appear.

                 The big picture of the Globalist push by CF/Soros/Marxist Communist Mafia is ugly and involves depravity and evil that most people can't wrap their minds around...and who can blame them really.  Tough learning curve for brain washed cult members who think they were helping the world by joining up with the likes of Clinton and the Open Borders scam of the century.

                  I just tried to explain some of it to someone and they said "Obama"?  I said yes, and they could not believe it.  I said  just think about it for a while, I did too.  It is an evil well oiled organization I said, still could not believe it.  I said, I have been at this longer than 5 months.  Take it one at a time.  I hate to talk about it to people, to have to tell them their world is not what they thought it to be.  I hate to be the one to burst their bubble.

                   I know what you mean, when people finally 'get it'...they don't know if they want to thank you or just get angry at the messenger.  It's because that anger happens more suddenly for them and has no where to go, smaller red pills are easier I suppose, but that isn't always effective and runs the risk of desensitization setting in. So there's a balance of some sort, depending on the person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   People need to be told what it is that they can do, and the answer may be different for each person in their capacity and temperament.  But the exposure has to continue, relentlessly in places like VOAT, where people can lurk or use info and disseminate it..etc.  My hope is to see a day soon where some of the brainwashed masses of young activists turn on their masters.  They've been taught well to network and organize already, so when they get truly red pilled...watch out.

              "...Investigations that followed unearthed that Isis in Syria had established an international terror network with agents in Kenya, Uganda, Libya, Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia, Niger, Algeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Egypt. 
The network relied on a human trafficking ring called the “Magafe network” for the transportation of recruits.

              Security agencies are now collaborating with their counterparts in other countries to better understand the terrorism organisation and other organised crime outfits involved in conventional crimes such as human trafficking, human organ harvesting, abduction and ransoms.
Investigations have so far established 10 routes used by the Magafe network to transport terror recruits from Kenya to Syria and Libya by sea, air or road...."

            The International Criminal Court is considering whether to investigate migrant-related crimes in Libya, which has become a "marketplace" for human trafficking, the chief prosecutor said on Monday.
"Fatou Bensouda told the UN Security Council that her office was collecting evidence of crimes allegedly committed against migrants attempting to transit through Libya.
Thousands of vulnerable migrants, including women and children, are being held in detention centres across Libya where "crimes, including killings, rapes and torture, are alleged to be commonplace," she said."
