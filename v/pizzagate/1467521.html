            My account at this time is less than an hour old, and I'm gonna disagree with you. So at first glance, you should ban me, right? Well, I'm coming from Reddit. In fact, I have the same username over there, and that's all I have to verify that I'm not shilling, because I was all over
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange">
             /r/WhereIsAssange
            </a>
            and others, while over there. I've lurked Voat for a while and just decided to make my account.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want shills gone too, but possibly putting a limitation on newcomers isn't the best answer, I don't think. Especially when Reddit is banning subs left and right, effectively sending them all here.
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Conspiracy">
             /r/Conspiracy
            </a>
            may be on the chopping block soon, and they've got almost half a MILLION subscribers. Wouldn't you like that kind of help and publicity on a genuinely better site like Voat? I genuinely would, and cutting them out before they can get in won't help the cause. Everyone just needs to do good research (like we usually do) before calling, "shill."

            Dont worry too much about it they would just pop up a new account in seconds. Remember these guys operate on a budget and when the budget is gone so are they. As someone who followed T_D and was engaged here pre-eddit, you see this flare up every few weeks when they get a fresh injection of cash. Let them spend their time and money shilling for their peado friends, its really fing obvious.

            No, don't censor.  Let them stand out like the sore thumbs they are and make complete fools of themselves.  Let that get people motivated to take action against it.  We already know they're not capable of disrupting well enough to derail things, hence why the Reddit admins had to be roped in with

             The mod situation
            </a>
            .  We're doing what we can with what we have.  Most of us have to sacrifice our ability to vet leads and posts in favor of forcing the users to explain their link.
           </p>
           <p>
            Proving or disproving that things are worth looking into is beyond the ability of mods as far as removals go.  The flairs are going to have to help, and the users are going to have to help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Find a shit topic that seems to go nowhere and distract from the real investigation?  HOP ON THAT MOTHERFUCKER and if enough of you ping it with links/sources/etc. pointing out WHY it's shit,
            <em>
             hopefully
            </em>
            a mod will have the ability to flag it as a false lead and put that subject in the sticky or sidebar.  There are hundreds of you guys, and some of you are probably better at destroying bad leads than finding good ones - please do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have a good idea of how to write new rules to help filter, please let us know.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for fuck's sake, if someone complains about what we're removing, and a mod hasn't removed it and directed them to the
            <em>
             concern
            </em>
            post on the right, find the post in question and shame that motherfucker if the deletion is good.  We're not God-Mods from where you came from, we're janitors who are

            I normally just wish harm on really stupid people, but I hope your entire family gets culturally enriched.  Not a single ounce of substance to what you're saying, and the accusations are a fucking spit in the face to the mods like me who now uses his Voat leisure time to help facilitate this investigation.

            Idunno.  Yesterday my experience was that when I pointed out the excellent article that is now stickied to a mod - kingkong, and doubtless many others did to, it became stickied.  That is helping, so not every mod obviously is as you say.    On the other hand, an obvious shill we've all identified Totesgoates tried to block it by calling my post spam.
           </p>
           <p>
            We just noticed on another thread about traffic cams an obvious negative shill posted and immediately got around 40 upvotes, so there are that many puppets at least it seems.

            Only the people who deny Pizzagate. Concern trolls and CTR guys will be too grey imo, and then we have a censorship problem on our hands. Basically, do whatever the fuck you want mods. I will move if I don't like it.

              is a real SuperPac dedicated to removing bad publicity of the Clintons during her 2016 candidacy. Many think they continue to work for her and her associates, however, I think most people just use it as an easy way to say, "government/private shills trying to cover up embarrassing/illegal activities of the elite."

             How the fuck are the shill's fake accounts downvoating? This is just hilarious. More censorship = more Streisand. Bring it.

               I haven't got enough upvotes to even contact the Mods privately to ask them about the weird CCP activity I have been noticing.

               Today, my account has upvoted something (nothing to do with me) and I have collectively got 21 points. What is going on here?
