            UPDATE: Within the last hour, Google has dramatically restricted access to coverage of this story. Up to about an hour ago, whether I did a normal search or a "News" search I got an enormous number of results, including versions of this story in European and other international languages. I just checked back to find that I'm now being given a mere handful of results. For some reason, this story is now being suppressed by Google. The timing could be due to the fact that Lasner and Goldstein have arrived at their destination (San Francisco) and presumably started exercising some sort of pressure on Google to have the results cut back drastically.

             The pair have a boy named Amos. He must be very small, because Goldstein was holding him in his arms when he berated Trump. Picture of Goldstein with toddler posted here:

            Relevance in question???: I think this guy should be investigated for possible links to Pizzagate. His bio is a real red flag to me. He's part of a system that allows wealthy gay men to have easy, legal access to young boys. That system may be threatened by a Trump presidency or may simply be perceived as threatened by Trump. Why would you behave this way unless you had a guilty conscience? It's not as if the election was held yesterday, either. It's been well over a month. Enough time for any normal person to cool down. Clearly, Goldstein is not 'normal' but has a great deal invested in this change. A little too much, I'd say.
