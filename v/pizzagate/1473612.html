            True, also torture videos mixed with pictures of infants. Another point is that they invite middle school bands to play concerts at night.

            This wasn't meant as an ultimate compilation or anything, just a comment without any research, just what I remembered, because I was angry with Colbert. I could make this much more convincing and effective. Also, sourced. I'm thinking about doing one of those orientation posts where you find all relevant information. I'm never happy with the ones being posted.

            But this would be a lot of work and the Trump campaign told us not to go crazy just yet. So I don't know, I'll think about it. Thank you for constructive criticism.

            Polanski is a good one because he is still getting away with it for over 40 years. If you start to list all the Hollywood "self chosen", the list will be endless.

            No this is all very good. Trump will expose. All of those censors will resign in shame. Broadcasting licences will be revoked. The more defend and suppress the better. This is at least how I see the situation. Imagine Trump with a 90% favorability rating and no mainstream media opposition, it will be glorious.

            This is great. My only critique is to change the "democratic party" to "US government," because one of the sources of cognitive dissonance is that it's an anti-Clinton witch hunt, we all know this has nothing to do with party lines. But this is great!

            Oops, the man you call "Leon Brittan" is Cyril Smith (aka "Big Cyril" - the fattest MP the UK ever had) ,  from the liberal party from Rochdale  Uk. He also was a pedo and abused boys. Simon Danczuk wrote a book about him ("smile for the camera" - interesting to read).  Died  in 2010.
 Leon Brittan also was a pedo, but unfortunately died in 2015...!

            <p>
             there is a video on youtube that has the entire "stand up routine" and in its entire context - although there is innuendo its still a strong assumption to say the jokes are "pedo humor" - the video on youtube is something about "Whats REALLY going on at comet ping pong: They EAT the children" - it makes a Very compelling argument for that being the case, however its all speculation so i would caution against citing anything from that until it can be verified from an 'official source' like FBI documents or something...

              My meager contribution. Good to share with the average person. Citations, avoids occult and speculation, focuses solely on "Is this place family friendly as advertised?" Anyone is welcome to steal it, spread it, post it, etc.

              Honestly can't find it either right now. There's a wikileaks where Podesta tells someone (prop alefantis) to thank Oliver Miller (owner pong) for his hospitality. Hope I'm not wrong about this. It's out there somewhere I'll find it.

              Already did 3 times. They're shadowbanning specific posts now. I put one up without any mention of names or locations, was still shadowbanned. Don't know if this is an algorithm or per admin.(did use the words pizza and ping pong) I noticed because in my overview it didn't show the post title above my comment, which I've never seen before. They could technically do that after the post received a few upvotes, you propably wouldn't even notice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, not sure about this one; I think they made a personal message I sent  invisible.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is something the fucking Stasi would do. I think if Trump doesn't expose everything, that reddit is over. Voat should upgrade server anyways. There's going to be a migration.

            You put Polanski as a pedo? Yeah, let's make enemies among the left-wing liberals, because we have enough supporters.

           <p>
            If you don't recall, because that happened almost 40 years ago: Polanski was charged with statutory rape. His victim
            <strong>
             wasn't pre-pubescent
            </strong>
            . Moreover, there were

             many

            other examples for the film industry.

             Polanski is not only a pedophile. I remember when this story broke 40 years ago and there is a lot more to it than that. He is still on the lam, and he is involved the Tate-Manson scam. check out Miles Mathis papers and other credible sources.
