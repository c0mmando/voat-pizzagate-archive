Those of you familiar with this case will recall that this paedo-communist piece of filth was convicted of 3 counts of 2nd degree sexual abuse of a minor, yet outrageously escaped jail time after he was given 5 years probation by Washington County Circuit Judge Janelle Wipper and Multnomah County Circuit Judge Jerry Hodson in contravention of sentencing guidelines which recommend a (paltry imo) custodial sentence of 2 - 2 1/2 years (I personally consider this part of the Cultural Marxist left\'s agenda to normalise paedophilia by treating child sexual abuse cases which do actually come before the courts as minor offences; consider also James Gunn\'s CP peddler friend Huston Huddleston who escaped with time served despite being in possession of over 600 indecent images of children).  It seems the paedophile vermin was filmed taking part in a protest against ICE (men and women striving to put an end to child sex trafficking) at which children were also present, which therefore meant that he was violating the terms of his probation, specifically the one which prohibits him from having any contact with minors.  Do not expect this child molesting communist scum to go jail, however.  While that is an option, the most lenient punishment which the judge could issue is a verbal reprimand, and that\'s what I fully expect to happen.</p>

            Thanks for the update. This is an important case to follow. It seems pedo normalization plans have been shifted into high gear. We must expose it at every turn. He might have done this deliberately to generate a lawsuit defending his right to protest publicly. THEY ALWAYS HAVE AN ANGLE.

             How smart of you to think of that.  Yes, they are quite tricky.  While Twitter Filth is being exposed they are fighting to spread pedophilia as fast as they can.  YES, we too have to shift into a higher gear.
