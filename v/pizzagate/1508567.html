<p>Lyrics By:
Travis Dominguez</p>
<p>They got a room that you don’t see 
not if you’re playing ping pong
 its not for you and me
 its for that cooked spirit  demon juice ravioli 
theyre fucking with little kids
 aint nothing holy here
 its a special kind of hell 
same as it ever was
 a horrible smell
 this ain’t a comet in the sky and 
this ain’t taco bell
JOhn, tony, marina, hill 
the gangs all here
but they got their masks on 
cuz they got something to fear
theyre pimping up front with slices and beer
but whats really going on 
perk your ears up and hear 
Repeat 2xs :ll
Well the devil\'s in the back
He devil\'s in the dollars 
The devil\'s in the dark
and The devil\'s in the parlor</p>
<p>Call em up
they got pizzas and pies
hot dogs from chicago
special rooms you can die
they got tunnels so the slime can travel safe
so you can get your besta pie
some walnut sauce on your plate
if james aint in he’s on delivery
special slices to obama
not for you and me
one thing good lord 
oh no don’t yo bring your kids
cuz there serving up susie jake bobby and its
a chicken lover kinda party 
what? yo don’t know?
hats off to the Good
i just thought you should know that 
the demons in the dungeon 
dont have wings and horns
he’s got some politician friends
and some kiddie porn
so before you bring your paddle 
thinking its time to play
just oreder it from home
and try to keep your kids safe cut</p>',
