<p><strong>Summon the son of ex-Black Rod to child sex abuse probe, MP demands after Mail on Sunday revealed his links to VIPs and rent boys</strong></p>
<p>&quot;A Tory MP has called for Roddam Twiss to appear before Alexis Jay\'s inquiry
Sir Frank Twiss, his father, was Black Rod, the Queen\'s envoy in the Lords
Call came after two retired policemen said they had been banned from investigating Mr Twiss in the 1970s&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The head of the investigation into historic child sexual abuse is under pressure to summon the son of a former Black Rod as part of its inquiry into a suspected Westminster paedophile ring.</p>
<p>A Tory MP has called for Roddam Twiss to appear before Alexis Jay\'s inquiry following The Mail on Sunday\'s disclosures last week about his links to VIPs and rent boys. The call came after two retired policemen told this newspaper that they had been banned from investigating Mr Twiss in the 1970s, at a time when his father, Sir Frank Twiss, was Black Rod, the Queen\'s envoy in the Lords.</p>
<p>The police were acting on reports that Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, a prolific child-sex abuser, had been seen taking a rent boy to Mr Twiss\'s London home. Their inquiries were halted when they told superiors that Mr Twiss could be involved in a wider racket supplying rent boys to VIPs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with the MoS last week, Mr Twiss, who was jailed in 1967 for assaulting boys, bragged of his access at the time to Parliament. He was also a frequent visitor to Dolphin Square, a nearby residential estate used by politicians, which he called \'a den of iniquity\'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen has written to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is investigating organisations that failed to protect children from sexual abuse, to ask for Mr Twiss to be compelled to give evidence to its \'Westminster strand\'.&quot;</p>
