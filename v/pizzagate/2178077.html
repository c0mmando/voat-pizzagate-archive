            Don't know about Bean ....
but have often suggested that Hill/Bill and like Obama seem to have been long
involved with CIA -- likely from childhood -- and possibly via MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            In case of Clintons and Rodhams, possibly also involves Mafia.

             There must have been some interesting scenarios on Air Force 1.  I wonder what was  on their Entertainment Shelf.  When I think that Kindergartners are being taught this, it makes me  sick.  We are really mixing these kids up and messing with their heads.

            Another Ed Buck. Uses, abuses and discards. His ex Kiah Lawson's face book page 2013 shows a shining face at the White House, starry eyed accompanied by his older , much older, wealthy friend Bean. Then things go downhill, criminal charges start piling up, now Lawson has a lengthy criminal record and a meth habit. And Bean walks around unscathed:
           </p>
           <p>
            "case was dismissed after the alleged victim failed to show for the trial and Bean offered him $225,000 to civilly settle the case, according to the Lane County District Attorney's Office."
Bean "wants very much to put this episode behind him, recapture his sense of safety and focus on his work as an active member of the Portland and national LGBT community."
"statement thanked police and prosecutors for "pursuing and convicting Lawson and his gang for their crimes against Terry."Â 
Lawson is a victim as much as the missing 15 y.o. now in Calif. or the boy in Washington County in 2013 whose mother offered to testify that it was Bean as well as Lawson involved with her son.

            And Bean's buddy, Samuel Adams gay former (2009-2013)mayor of Portland,OR swims in the same pedophile pool:
           </p>
           <p>
            Portland, Oregon's just-inducted openly gay mayor, Sam Adams, 44, has confessed to having had a sexual relationship with teenage former staffer Beau Breedlove in 2005.Â  Adams was a county commissioner at the time. Although Adams and Breedlove met when the teen was 17 years old, Adams maintains that he and Breedlove did not have sex until Breedlove was 18.Â  Adams apologized to the local press today:

             Yes his ex-Kia Lawson was just 27 years old at the time of the child Rae with Terry Bean age 66....
            </p>
            <p>
             They both were charged in the rape/sodomy of this boy in what the grand jury deemed was considered "ping-ponging" their terms. Look it up in urban dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kia was 40 years younger than Terry Bean....and they met "years" ago..... what are the odds Kia was not a young victim groomed by Terry Bean....extremely high.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kia was used and thrown aside as soon as he spoke truth to investigators. He is probably dead by now....don't know. I know he broke back into Terry Bean house he shared at one time and took valuable evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you were the President of the US and your 66 year old buddy who was top donor to 2012 campaign and you were aware he is a porn producer....involved in "gay manifesto" brings over a 27 year old boyfriend to the Whitehouse...What would any decent person do or ask? If you are President why would you have this guy over frequently, riding on Airforce One, hanging out with your wife, around your children.....
            </p>
            <p>
             To top it off he is indicted for child rape and you still have him over and have him co-author legislation on Transgender rights to force society to allow grown naked men into women's locker rooms, showers, bathrooms with little girls if they decided they were actually female inside. The President then forced this into public schools via common core demanding teachers read to kindergarteners books like "Jack wears a dress" and discuss gender as a fluid decision that little boys or girls are what they choose and could change their minds. Having transsexual men come into kindergarten classrooms and read these books dressed as women (their desired gender) The teachers were then forced to stop calling children boy or girl him or her but call students gender neutral pronouns. All children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children were traumatized their are stories all over the Internet of parent conferences at schools of horror stories where 5 year olds had nightmares that they would wake up one day and they would be a boy or girl of opposite sex. 5 year olds do not have the cognitive or reasoning skills to understand this and are easily brainwashed.
            </p>
            <p>
             This included adding into sex education for 6th graders directions on anal sex, strapping on dildos if they choose to be male and want to have anal sex....
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes there are pictures of 6th grade teachers strapping on dildos in class to teach students.
            </p>
            <p>
             There have been numerous sexual assaults in bathrooms, locker rooms etc by pedophiles who used this law to dress as women or claim they were transsexual enter restrooms and sexually assault children.
            </p>
            <p>
             That was not the first time a gay porn producer or last was at the Whitehouse....check the records the night James Alefantis stayed overnight at the Whitehouse according to their own records he stayed with a famous porn producer as well.

              The world's elite like Bill Gates want to educate (indoctrinate) your children at the same time they are exploiting and controlling the world's resources all in the name of what's good for humanity as interpreted by them.
Case in point: World Resources Institute, a climate change mover and shaker whose board of directors all have ties to JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Madeleine Albright,National Security Council, Council of Foreign Affairs,etc. . Climate change is their mantra for taking over. They are not altruistic, they are doing this for their financial coffers.

            We live in a country in which the evil fucks have every intention of not only making it illegal for you to complain about your child being sodomized and mind programmed, but also to make it mandatory and if you resist having your child "enhanced" you will be held guilty of child abuse.

            Here is the "gay manifesto" as mentioned below. Terry Bean was one of the founding members in San Francisco in the 60's. This is not an accusation against any LGBTQ people.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are/were activists intent on transforming society by force. Read the words carefully and understand their mission and tactics from the beginning.

            There is a follow up book called "After the ball" where Saul Alinsky tactics are discussed and employed to force society to accept homosexual men first then man-boy live and pedophelia as natural. They planned it from the beginning and this guy Terry Bean is their hero.

             Also look up HARRY HAY, another NAMBLA supporting chickenhawk who was a "founder of Gay Rights."
            </p>
            <p>
             Guys...I truly, truly don't want to be homophobic, but we have to stop acting like there's no connection between the LGBT Political Movement and Pedophilia. There is a huge connection. So many of the founders of "Gay Rights" are turning out to be huge pedos. The "Gay Manifesto" will turn your stomach and make you want to punch someone in the face. And pretty soon its going to be illegal to say anything bad about child rapists, because "they have feelings too."

             Gotta love how when you bring this up to normies, they immediately scream in your face "JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS AN ASSOCIATE WHO RAPES CHILDREN DOESN'T MEAN THAT PERSON RAPES CHLDREN TOO!!!" People are just SO quick to defend these absolute scumbags. It turns my fucking stomach to think of all the people who literally were weeping with joy at seeing Barry "Ping Pong" Obama become President.

             That did not stop Obama from having him over to the Whitehouse, aboard Airforce One, hanging out with Michelle, helping author the transgender bathroom bill and legislation that Obama signed into law and began forcing into public schools through common core. Even now being taught to kindergardeners.
            </p>
            <p>
             He signed through Executive Order in violation of the constitution making the law not law at all then forced it into schools.
            </p>
            <p>
             Forced it into the military having his Secretary of Defense Ashe Carter spending the last year studying transgender in the military then signing them into military code with taxpayers paying the bill of sexual reassignment surgery.
            </p>

             While Obama was involved in military action dropping bombs in 7 countries with millions dying. Obamacare was failing Veterans were dying in VA hospitals for lack of care, suicides skyrocketed amongst veterans, the migrant crisis took over the world. Terrorism was striking all over Europe where they are now literally police States.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Obama had his Defense Secretary working on transgenders in the military and making sure they would get the hormones and sex reassignment surgery necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those unaware the leading hospital on Sex Reassignment surgery John Hopkins stopped doing these surgeries years ago as leading doctors and scientists concluded gender dysmorphia  was a condition that needed treatment and was a reaction to trauma. The long term studies proved the suicide rates after sex reassignment were as high if not higher after surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doctors were finally coming to terms understanding many of these struggles were trauma related.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obama stepped in against medical science using pedophile child rapists as his policy makers.
            </p>
            <p>
             How many physicians, psychologists, etc. will go on record as experts...None unless secretly employed by US government involved in experiments such as MK Ultra.

             In Russia and other slavic countries the word homosexual is never used (I should know, I am from former USSR) the used is Pederast - man-boy love. It is well known that man-boy love is a huge part of homosexual culture.

              Here is America there is a huge push to make people believe there is NO connection between Pedophilia and Homosexuality. But there is. There always has been.  A lot, a LOT, of older gay men want to fuck young boys. Its sad but true. We need to go back to just calling them perverts.

              They try to differentiate between homosexual and pedophile but if it's acceptable to break one society norm, how much easier is it to go on and break another?
