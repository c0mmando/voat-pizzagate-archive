<p><strong>Judge delays Jefferey Epstein trial - Won\'t allow X-rated evidence</strong></p>
<p>Published: December 1, 2017</p>
<hr />
<p>What promised to be a salacious trial probing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual relationships with underage girls won’t get underway next week as planned.</p>
<p>Citing the many unanswered legal questions that still swirl around the 8-year-old civil lawsuit pitting attorney Bradley Edwards against the 64-year-old Palm Beach convicted sex offender, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Donald Hafele agreed to delay the trial until March.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Under the circumstances of this unusual and relatively complex case, the court finds that there are simply too many significant, lengthy motions that are pending and need to be heard prior to December 5, 2017, the date that the trial was originally scheduled to commence,” Hafele wrote in an order, granting a motion from Epstein’s new defense team to delay the trial until next year.</p>
<hr />
<p>During a hearing Wednesday, Hafele made it clear that he doesn’t want the trial to become X-rated. When it comes to “graphic, sexual questions, the likelihood is that I will not allow them into evidence,” Hafele said.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that his efforts to sanitize the trial will be difficult given that the allegations against Epstein involve lawsuits Edwards filed on behalf of three of dozens of teenage girls who claim they were paid to give the billionaire money manager sexually-charged massages at his Palm Beach mansion.</p>
<hr />
<p>Further, Hafele said, it is likely jurors will be told about a controversial non-prosecution agreement Epstein negotiated with federal prosecutors. In 2008, he agreed to plead guilty to two state charges — soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution — and served roughly 13 months of an 18-month sentence. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue allegations that he had abused dozens of other teenage girls, instead allowing them to file civil lawsuits against Epstein.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still, Hafele warned Edwards’ attorney, Jack Scarola, that he will limit what evidence can be used against Epstein, who now spends most of his time on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. “I don’t want this to turn into whether Jeffrey Epstein is a serial child molester,” Hafele said.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scarola agreed he would refrain from describing Epstein as “a billionaire pedophile” or “a convicted child molester.” He said he does intend to call Virginia Roberts Giuffre to testify. In a civil lawsuit, she claimed Epstein turned her into a sex slave at age 15 when she was working at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, years before Donald Trump became president. Epstein flew her around the globe in his private jet filled with various celebrities, including Britain’s Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton, she later claimed in a separate lawsuit.</p>
<p>While Trump, Prince Andrew and Clinton are also on Scarola’s witness list, he has said it is doubtful he will call the three powerful men to testify.</p>
<hr />
<p>Epstein’s new defense team, attorneys Scott Link and Kara Rockenbach, urged Hafele to limit the evidence to Epstein’s relationship with three teenage girls Edwards represented. Epstein paid $5.5 million to settle the lawsuits Edwards filed on behalf of the women, identified in court papers only as L.M., E.W. and Jane Doe, according to revelations Scarola made as part of the lawsuit. Epstein settled other lawsuits with nearly two dozen other women; those amounts remain confidential.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hafele said evidence about Epstein’s exploitation of other young women is relevant because it helps explain why Edwards and Epstein are still locked in a legal battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>The lawsuit began in 2009 when Epstein sued Edwards, who worked for Fort Lauderdale attorney Scott Rothstein. Rothstein, now disbarred, is serving a 50-year prison sentence in connection with a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme in which he sold phony settlements to investors. Epstein claimed Edwards “ginned up” the lawsuits he filed on behalf of the three women to fuel Rothstein’s far-flung scam.</p>
<hr />
<p>Epstein ultimately dropped the lawsuit against Edwards. Edwards then filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit against Epstein, claiming Epstein sued him to punish him for representing the women. Scarola said Epstein was also angry at Edwards for filing a lawsuit in federal court, seeking to throw out the non-prosecution agreement.</p>
<hr />
<p>While criminal charges are typically not mentioned in civil lawsuits, this case is different, Hafele said. “If not at the heart, (they) are certainly at the center of the entire case,” he said of the deal Epstein cut with federal and state prosecutors.</p>
<hr />
<p>Before the trial begins, Hafele will have to decide many thorny questions about what evidence will be presented to the jury. In addition, Epstein’s lawyers have asked Hafele to sanction Scarola for revealing how much Epstein paid Edwards’ three clients. The settlement was supposed to be confidential.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scarola counters that he was legally obligated to make the settlements public because of questions Epstein’s lawyers asked during the litigation.</p>

            I'm not jumping to negative conclusions here at all, but, what's the go with this? If this has been resolved here I'd love the help in verifying it for myself. I was going to use search but figure it'll take way to long to sift through the bullshit.

              As previously mentioned, our investigation of The Malicious Prosecution of David Johnson gave us reasonable suspicion that Judge Hafele might be a case-fixer.
             </strong>
             We shall elaborate our reasoning in detail in our next article, and entertain the notion that perhaps the judge was simply deceived by a master of deception, purportedly a member of the legal mafia, an ex-con who managed to get his conviction transformed into a virtual acquittal as if it never existed. For now we shall attend to the Internet gossip about Judge Hafele, which is very limited but for a burst of chatter in 2009—we would expect to find a lot more if he were a corrupt or incompetent judge.....

            This is a huge demonstration of what is wrong with our justice system. Judges decide what evidence can be shown to the jury. Lawyers decide what jurors are chosen. Hands are tied before justice even starts.

            Long stretch of beach in Alabama, not sure how I could figure that one out. I guess I need an Alabama peckerwood at my side. Hey, I just remembered, I got one or two. Nice posts, and 22's are not just a deterrent.

            Look over in the right hand sidebar at the "O" and that is your subverse owner sitting on the internet all day false flagging this subverse. This subverse is being held hostage. These board owners need to be cleaned out and let the subverse elect it's own mods and owners. Who is really who on that list?

              I'd pass a law that says if you go home with a man you don't trust you can't charge him for rape, period.
             </p>
             <p>
              That would cause women to use better judgement you see: the same self-preservation we expect from RODENTS!

             <p>
              There should be more RAPE CULTURE I said facetiously, meaning back in the day the woman played hard to get and the man chased her up the stairs ITS A LITTLE DANCE WE DO IN ANGLO CULTURE TO PRESERVE HER DIGNITY!
             </p>
             <p>
              Youre ok with our women being whores and lying about rape when they regret it.
That's why you're a cuck faggot useless piece of shit and I'm not.

             There is a District Court Judge that lives in Gulf Shores, Alabama. He flies to Adamsville, Alabama once a week in his own plane to hold court. Those guys have a hell of a pension plan. :) He owns some condominiums in Gulf Shores on a "public servants" paycheck.

               I am trying to keep a positive attitude, but if I had to be really honest, I fear you are correct.  I hope to God we are both wrong.  This Judge is already speaking DoubleSpeak.

             "Hafele made it clear that he doesn’t want the trial to become X-rated. When it comes to “graphic, sexual questions, the likelihood is that I will not allow them into evidence,” Hafele said.
            </p>
            <p>
             But he acknowledged that his efforts to sanitize the trial will be difficult given that the allegations against Epstein involve lawsuits Edwards filed on behalf of three of dozens of teenage girls who claim they were paid to give the billionaire money manager sexually-charged massages at his Palm Beach mansion."
            </p>
            <p>
             It says it all right there, that's not keeping it factual or objective at all when you're trying to "sanitize" or cover up the true reality of something. This judge isn't being impartial.... Don't they take some kind of oath to always remain objective? Yadda yadda.

               Wait, is your objection due to more than one person hating things that you like? Are you so autistic (read: a paid shill) as to not know that the jews are the reason for your entire sub? No one in their right mind doesn’t hate faggots. Faggots are the second largest child raping group in the world. Do you know a goddamn thing about this topic?

                You proved I was right. You were Equineluvr. That's why you both disappeared at the same time and then finally you came back under new alts. What are the chances? Brock probably needed to get rid of one of the most popular shills here because it was causing problems. That's why Equineluvr is no longer in service. You came back and you're a mixture of the 2. You toned it down a little so you aren't booted again. But you are still a CUNT!

                  I didn't know you meant THAT one. That's because you were afraid you would be booted so you acted nicer. I told you ways to prove it and you didn't. What is your point you little faggot bitch? Yeah you Muslims like a woman to have no confidence and you treat them like animals. How many goats have you fucked already? If you aren't Muslim then deny it. Tell me you aren't Muslim. Do you love Allah? Mohammad? Yes or no?!

                    Muhammad fucked a 6 or 7 year old you sick pervert. What do you have to say? No, I do not like Allah. Not at all. My God is a God of peace. Why don't you just answer the question? Do you worship Allah? The Arabic God? Do you love Jesus, the son of God? Type it out. I love Allah or I don't love Allah!

                     Obviously God doesn't need to impregnate a woman to send prophets you dumb bitch so that's obviously made up to match other mythology.

                     Do you even understand that you women have singlehandedly doomed the entire white race, which created every single object you encounter?  FOR SHEER VANITY?

                    <p>
                     You can't even comprehend it -- just like the fact that Jews have alienated every community they've ever inhabited through usury, degeneracy, anti-Christian behavior, and of course human sacrifice.

                        That's your problem Donkey. You lump everybody into groups. We've talked about this before. I'm also pro-Life. I'm not a feminist. I'm a conservative. Every single person has grown up in different environments. It's dumb of you to judge everyone based on your stupid labels. As for Muslims, you act just like the stereotypical Muslim man. You've represented Muslims very well here. Thank you.

                             Do you understand that the short childish sentences you write show that you have low verbal abilities and probably an extremely low IQ? You don't even have your NATIVE TONGUE at your disposal.

                              I use comma's all the time. Do you pay attention? I've seen you say the same thing to several other people so find some new insults. Did you know that your long ramblings don't even make sense most of the time? Long sentences that don't make sense are a waste.

                               Thanks for showing why women's testimony isn't worth as much as a man's, which is backed up by recollection studies.  Women will suppress and distort traumatic events they witnessed -- not unlike a small child.

                               Because you just lied yet again.  No one else on this entire board is as stupid as you are, so no one writes like you.  So I can't have said that to anyone and you made it up because you're a fucking cunt liar who needs to have a really bad slip in the shower.

                                 Thanks to me every person here knows the Jews are the lifeblood of Pizzagate and that it would never have happened without them.  You waste away in a Jewish colony called California eating kike fast food and watching your kids grow up with tranny story time at the local library.

                          I bet you think that front one was pretty huh? I know about your other side and how you like to be bent over like the little bitch you are. I shouldn't contradict a man? You may have a little shriveled up noodle. But, you are no man Donkey. I know you would never talk like this in person because you would be laid flat. Your hateful ass needs to go live in the Middle East where you belong. You don't deserve to be in America and you definitely do not deserve to VOTE!

                      Donkey and votescam (voAtscam) have the same goal. Destroy American women. Donkey does it outright and voAtscam does it by attacking "patriarchy" to instigate a gender war and turn American women into 3rd wave feminists men hating SJWs.

                       For example if you ascribe an evil intention to me and characterize it like a faggot ("destroying women") all I have to do is point out that you're calling all your forefathers who treated women as they should be EVIL TOO!

                       Child rapists too if age of consent laws are any indication AND I THINK THEY ARE in which case Muhammad was 1200 years before them, so they must be REAL DISGUSTING PEDOS RIGHT?

                       Stupid twat.  American women have already destroyed the country.  I don't think they have the right to abrogate a legacy millions of Americans have died for.  You probably don't either but are too much of a pussy to ever do anything about it.  Fucking PUSSY

               Magic Johnsons surname is white.  There goes the argument that names mean anything, which no 4yo would suggest XDDDD

              <p>
               You realize Germany was where most Jews lived?  Ashkenaz is the Hebrew name for Germany.  At one point Jews were forced to adopt German names in hopes they would stop being so predatory to their fellow "countrymen."
