            it does make sense. that's what I thought it could be but I just never noticed it before. how do you know it's the meta tag and not img tag? something in the source code of the page? I don't know enough about the inner workings of SEO.

              Try a reverse image search.  In chrome you can right click on a picture and see where it appears and the text attached to image is determined by a logorithim based on searches or page references.
             </p>
             <p>
              This can be accurate or inaccurate.

              I just clicked on a picture of Trump at a ribbon cutting ceremony with his kids and the text was
Best guess for this image: trump not in suit
             </p>
             <p>
              And Trump is wearing a suit.   Another one which was from the Opening of Trump Soho was correctly captioned on the page I was on, but the reverse image search suggested Trump and Mafia.

            When I entered those search terms in Duck Duck Go, predictive search came up with the words for me. Seems there are loads of torrents out there and movie files with those exact words. I didn't click on any of them. NO IDEA how that description could be attached to the image from DailyMail unless it has something to do with Google's algorithms.

            Sounds like MKUltra to me.  They develop multiple personalities to deal with the abuse and the other personalities don't know what happens when the other takes over.

            I was abused when I was in 2nd grade, didn't realize it until I was in my early 20's. I remembered it happening, just never connected the dots that it was abuse. Just thought it was a part of my childhood. It's crazy how our brains work to save us from ourselves sometimes.

             I wonder how many of us researchers were abused. I believe I was by older boys in the neighborhood when I was about six...

              A lot of people, particularly on retarddit, try to derail the conversation about PG making it political or a "baseless conspiracy." But the fact is, pedophilia is rampant. I'd say most people either have been, or know someone, who has been sexually abused as a child. And now we are realizing we arent 1) alone 2) crazy 3) complacent anymore. But more than that, we don't stand for it happening to others, not without justice. We are fighting for others but we are also fighting for ourselves.

              This isn't some occupy wall street bullshit with dread-locked protesters and a faceless enemy corporations, these are kids going missing and every day we put pressure on, the chance of a child being hurt is lessened. That's something to rally around.

            from personal experience it is not unusual for the victim to completely suppress the incident [i had a teacher attempt to molest me and a friend] i totally suppresed the details for about 15 years and i consider myself in touch and astute! it wasnt until i had seen a show on pbs about women who had suppressed their molestations and was then talking about it in the office  the next day with a few others and then this other woman coming forward about what happened to her repeatedly with her step brother that THEN i remembered what happened to me and nothing acttually happened because me and my friend managed to escape.......it really blows your mind to realize just how deep these waters run and where they hide til you can actually cope as an adult.....

             that's true, some kind of defense mechanism of our brain (which I believe is exactly what MKULTRA plays with) but doesn't it usually loses effectiveness when the abuse is repeated over a long period of time? The older you get? She was (iirc) a teenager when it happened. I just remembered that case because of how weird/atypical the case was at the time and with the army father i just wanted to revisit the article to make sure it isn't related to anything we have here.
