            It was definitely staged. People need to do more research on the leaders of this event. The leader of Unite the Right was an Occupy Wallstreet organizer and an Obama supporter. Terry McAuliffe is a well known Clinton operative and he told the police to stand down. Antifa members were also bussed in. This is the deep state playing pawns against each other to start a civil war. They can't pull a JFK on Trump because of modern tech so they have to overthrow him another way. The Russian narrative was totally exposed so now it is plan b.

            I hope I do this right. This is a link to Reuters news interview with Heather Heyer's coworker, via voice of America page.
Highlights include:
"She wanted to send a clear message to the KKK and neonazis"
"Purple was her favorite color" -odd...and precise
"Strongly opposed to President Trump" 
"Thought it unfair that she, as a white woman, enjoyed liberties that he, as a black man could not"
"Caught Heather weeping after reading anti Muslim comments online"
SERIOUSLY, the ODDEST and most blatant, leftist, and in-your-face article yet

            Anyone that knows anything about the Klan and Nazis could take one look at video and stills from Charlottesville and tell in 30 seconds that they were not the real thing.  Paid actors, 100%.  Maybe with some local morons thrown in for good measure, as they thought it was real.

            Tiki torches,  Really?  That looks exactly like the stupid shit the left would conjure up.  The photos in the google image search are ordered to look like a Hollywood movie storyboard.

            The "organizer" was an Obama supporter.  I've never heard of anyone in my life making a nearly overnight political swing from Occupy Wall Street to White Power.  It doesn't happen.

            The irony is that the Nazis are leftists playing Nazis never realizing they are using Nazi tactics.

             Hi,  the whole point of why Richard Spencer coined the term Alt-Right was to appeal to a new generation and to people like him who are college educated.  Some of these groups are old school and a lot are American Nazis 2.0.  This was a collection of different groups, some of them quite new.

            Obama is member of Fabian Society. The following article was written at the beginning of his presidency.
Disturbingly accurate and frightening to realize these events and violence &amp; brainwashing was planned in advance.
Pay attention to the "obama had $700 million in equity.

            denying pizzagate or participating in any type of race protest that denies pizzagate, is a denial of the truths of race involved in pizzagate, which makes any denier, an obvious racist, whether private or  even a reporter on mainstream media, anyone who denies PIZZAGATE is an abhorrent racist . cnn is full of pizzagate denying racists, buzzfeed too!!!! nothing but abhorrent racists!!!!!!!

              Check out Google images and several of the videos.
Many, many discrepancies are clearly seen, most prominently the existence/non-existance of the black pick up (Toyota Tundra) on the right of the Challenger.
Several videos show the Challenger racing towards the crowd, while others show the same car approaching very slowly.
The black guy in tan shorts, white tee shirt, red sneakers is seen airborne behind the Challenger in the most popular picture.
This same guy can be seen in pictures and videos sitting atop the passenger side hood of the Tundra as the Challenger is backing away from the scene.
This is indisputable, visual proof that this was a staged event.

             This is right. The organizers (like Jason Kessler) may have been shills but there really is a lot of support just for preserving Confederate monuments. The real history of the Civil War has never been taught by our public education system, simply because the feds won.
            </p>
            <p>
             Short version:
            </p>
            <p>
             Before Civil War: "These United States are..."
            </p>
            <p>
             After Civil War: "
             <strong>
              The
             </strong>
             United States
             <strong>
              is
             </strong>
             ..."
            </p>
            <p>
             You see what happened there? This is what they have always wanted us to forget, among many other uncomfortable facts about this period. This is the big change
             <strong>
              even in the legal language
             </strong>
             that accompanied the Civil War. Exactly what Brussels is trying to do to Europe with the EU. Same exact shit.

              It is crazy how polarizing this issue is.  The northerns have always been taught that the south was racist &amp; wanted slavery - and to an extent that is true, but they do not see the big picture that the war was about states rights... Lincoln only abolished slavery as a way to punish the south - he didn't give a shit about blacks &amp; their human rights.  They could have just let the south secede, but they needed all that tax money &amp; the south is where the food was grown.

               It was even about a lot more than states' rights and slavery if you go even deeper into it, but the conflict gets murkier the further into the past you go. The Yankees were mostly descended from religious nuts like Puritans and Quakers who were either super liberal or super conservative for their day, while the Southern states were founded by more common British people, albeit typically the poor, criminals and debtors. Virginia was literally founded as a business with the sole aim of making profit, but it ended up making the colonists themselves very rich by comparison to other colonies as well. We kept very old Celtic, Scottish and Germanic traditions alive like the Puritans did not, because they were in effect proto-Marxists who sought to erase all culture that didn't meet their ideological criteria. The ancient common law traditions, combined with Renaissance and Enlightenment thought, formed the basis of our Constitution and entire federal system of government, which has been a light to the world. This all came out of the South, not the North.

            Wow you are completely oblivious to the existence of men who only want to defend you.  The violence was ensured by local govt inaction and Soros bussed people in, both are expected always.  Its called Unite the Right cuz it was supposed to be a coming together between alt right and lite, proposed months ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            The attack and probably swastikas were faked but its a real movement that will always exist when the native sons of a country are experiencing displacement.

              It started out as a movement to save the white race &amp; culture (not about ending other cultures or races, not about hating others, not about violence).  And the name "alt right" was started by the media to make us look bad - and now we are all being lumped in together with white supremacists.  This is what they wanted, the MSM, Soros, etc.  They wanted a way to stop our movement and they did that by co-opting the movement and forcing the actual racists into it to make us all look bad.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think this is similar to what happened with BLM, I think it really did start with honest, concerned black people that were worried about blacks dying (at the hands of cops, gang violence, etc), but now Soros (et. al.) have completely taken over the movement and it is just a violent black supremacist movement now.  And that is what they are doing to the white nationalists.

              Nobody can even define what the "alt-right" is, as Trump pointed out today. Those identifying it with "neo-Nazis" are just buying into the bullshit media narrative that they are trying to sell you. They are trying to paint us ALL as Nazis and "alt right," except for the neo-con kiss-asses.

               The Alt Right was an astroturfed movement from beginning.  Another carefully contrived and convoluted psy-op, years in the making to coincide with the presidential campaign and cause a nationwide conflagration.  It was born out of obscurity, has numerous 'cults of personality' spewing its dogma and is achieving its MO to fracture the public and instigate tribal warfare.  Rebel Media, Red Ice Tv, Peterson, Milo, Molyneux, Dice, Seaman, Breitbart etc etc...are all part of its weaponisation and WERE being favourably promoted on YouTube until the sea change recently.

               And who's at the head of this abominable serpent?  The Sabbatean Frankists and their Luciferian ideology backed by millions of sayanim and crypto’s.
