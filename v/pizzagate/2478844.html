<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> From Rochdale, to Rotheram, to Telford, to the Church of England, to the Roman Catholic Church, to Dolphin Square, to many school, the reports of widespread pedophilia in the UK continue to be published on a regular basis.

<p>Yet another story from Telford, 1st April 2018 : <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5567223/Prosecutors-told-13-year-old-Telford-grooming-victims-family-prosecute.html">Prosecutors told 13-year-old Telford grooming victim\'s family they couldn\'t prosecute because she had consented to sex</a>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors told a Telford grooming victim\'s father they couldn\'t prosecute the alleged abuser because the <strong>13-year-old had consented to have sex with the man</strong>, according to uncovered documents. </p>
<p>Last Monday, it was announced that the <strong>National Independent Inquiry into Child Exploitation</strong> would talk to grooming victims as part of its \'Truth Project\'. </p>
<p>A CPS spokesperson said the case didn\'t meet the evidence test and a separate review confirmed the decision not to prosecute.
In early March, it was revealed a pair of whistle-blowers, who raised fears over the Telford child sex abuse scandal which affected up to <strong>1,000 girls</strong>, were both punished and silenced.</p>

<p><strong>13 is BELOW the age of consent in the UK. SO WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON????</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, &quot;The Hunt for Britain\'s Sex Gangs&quot; (2011), police were told that men in Telford would &quot;ejaculate and then urinate in children\'s mouths&quot;. There were also allegations of &quot;gang-rape by queues of men while girls were held hostage for hours, sometimes days—all the while being forced to listen to the screams of girls in other rooms with other men&quot;. </p>

<p>Making a joint statement, they said: “We first called for an independent inquiry at a full council meeting in September 2016.
&quot;This was followed by a letter to the Home Secretary Amber Rudd, during early October 2016, in which we repeated this call.</p>
<p>“The IICSA has made it explicitly clear that it is a matter for Telford &amp; Wrekin Council to decide on whether it wishes to undertake an independent inquiry.</p>

<p><strong>Even more than the gangs perpetrating these crimes, I hold the government, police and justice systems responsible for this unacceptable situation in the UK.</strong></p>
<p>Despite the media trying to paint this issues along the lines of race, child abuse is systemic as this recent article about the Church of England demonstrates: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/23/child-abuse-inquiry-collusion-and-cover-up-rife-among-c0e-clergy">Child abuse inquiry: \'collusion and cover-up\' rife among C of E clergy</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse has heard a “catalogue of lamentable failures” by the Church of England over the past three weeks, including cover-up, conspiracy and the burning of documents, its presiding panel was told. </p>
<p>Although the inquiry had focused on abuse in Chichester, perpetrators existed in every diocese, he said. “These offenders are everywhere.” </p>

<p>Michael Gove is facing fresh questions about his alleged intervention in a sexual abuse investigation at a Catholic school after further evidence emerged that appears to link him to the inquiry. </p>
<p>Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg, the MP’s mother, was the school governor with responsibility for child protection at Downside for some of this period. Her role, mentioned in evidence at the IICSA inquiry, is recorded in a July 2009 Downside school pamphlet on child protection and a subsequent  Downside school parents handbook for 2010-2011</p>

            Somewhere I read that the number of young British women with mental health problems has increased - no wonder, considering what many survivors went through. I wonder how they cope.

            It's a Bloody Bleeping Insult alright.  They are not failing them because they are not capable. They are failing them because that is the plan.  They want to turn the country into a Pedophile's Dream.   They want to make people think this is normal and in the meantime their children will be turned into pedophiles as well after they are raped so many times there is no other outcome.  This is their idea of a Perfect World.  THIS and THEY must be stopped at ALL COSTS.

              Yeah, what a joke.  They are setting up a meeting and a council on a project to help the abused and the project link does not work.  Meetings, Councils, Projects.  But still there is an Epidemic of Systemic Child Rape.  Go figure.

              Yes, and thank you.  If you look at the side you will see two more cases one being of a porn addict

              that received only 12 months for a sentence          and then a Drug Lord that got 33 years.  Now I agree that Drug Lord should receive 33 yrs.  BUT   that  porn addict certainly should have gotten a much stiffer sentence, possibly 10 yrs. at least AND he only has to be on the sex offender list for 7 years.  This guy could not understand the seriousness of his crime either, as it says.  Also it says in the article that they played some of the film back to him in court as he sat there and retched.  WHAT?  Played it back to him?  So he get his jollies one more time?  This is what is wrong with their system.  They are doing it all wrong.  The laws that have been passed are there to protect the pedos not the children.  That is because there are too many pedophile lawmakers in office.  No wonder it does not work. I also have a feeling that most of their programs are stalled or lead nowhere or do not work for an obvious reason.
