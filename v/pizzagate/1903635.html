<p>Back in the first link,  look at the sole comment defending Comet Pizza in a lengthy diatribe (that very few people will actually see judging from the view-count of this particular video.) </p>
<p>Some notes: </p>
<pre><code>-claims to have seen video over a 100 times!?  (1,650 minutes or 27.5 hrs) of this video that\'s nothing but inane babble?   Seems more like an exaggeration that kids/teenagers make.

<p>Cupcake according to Urban Dictionary: </p>
<p>cupcakeunknown
-A Cute Adorable Grl(or guy whatever).Who You Could Just Eat Up. &gt;.&lt; </p>
<p>-A CupCake Is A Muffin W/Frosting. Which Makes It Better.
-Hey Did U See That Girl. 
-No Was She Cute? 
-She Was A CupCake.</p>
<h1>cute#muffin#girl#guy#frosting</h1>
<p>Maybe 14 refers to her age?  
</p>
<p>Her grammar/spelling is that of a young girl.</p>

<p>And what is that around her neck above her cleavage that she\'s doing her best to enhance?  A Monarch butterfly. 
Maybe someone with better resolution can see what is stamped on the corner of her face by her eye?  And also,  can anyone make out anything familiar in the background?  Maybe IN Comet Ping Pong?

<p>I feel that this is Pizza-related since it deals directly with Comet Ping Pong.  But in a more macro sense,  I feel that Monarch sex kitten programming is essential to the blackmail required to keep pizzagate quiet.</p>',

            Might be nothing to it. But then again might be something ro it. Either way, your theory is completely plausible. Nice work
