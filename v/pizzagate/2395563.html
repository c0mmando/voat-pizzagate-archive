<p>Excerpts:</p>
<p><em>(By the way, there is a section in which HRC and WJC are mentioned, at the bottom of page 30, but unfortunately pages 31-32 are missing from this scanned book.)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many of the sources for this book want to remain unknown for their own safety.  I prefer to let the reader decide about this work on his own without providing my sources and endangering my sources.  (page 2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who are not familiar with my previous writings, may not understand how Ritual Sites, Underground Installations, Trauma-based Mind Control and witchcraft go together.  Permit me to give the bigger picture so that the interrelationship to these will be apparent.  (2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Illuminati work with, &amp; through other groups.  Freemasonry and the Oddfellows are two examples of occult organizations which the Illuminati controls and uses.  All the intelligence groups are also controlled and used by the Illuminati. All of these groups carry out trauma-based mind control. They work together. They have also worked together at building numerous underground facilities around the country.  (2)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Power Structures</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>...I have had ex-Satanists show me the secret signals that are set up to show people how to get to buildings used by Satanists.   Some houses are painted special colors. Certain items and numbers are used as signals to show the route.  Ritual sites in the country are also marked with secret direction symbols and signs. (4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are at least severaI thousand Wicca covens in the United States.  However, in addition to Wicca covens there are various types of Satanic covens, O.T.O. temples…and many other groups such as New Age who also practice witchcraft.  <strong>Secretly many of the various groups have contact with the llluminati hierarchy</strong>...And <strong>many of the Wicca Leaders are taking orders from the Illuminati on what they are to do on about a weekly basis.</strong>  (6)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the witchcraft in the U.S. has come from England.  (6)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h1>Ritual Sites</h1>
<p><strong>Funeral Homes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One <strong>prized location for traditional secret Satanism are mortuaries aka funeral homes...numerous funeral directors are also Masons</strong> (9) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>...it has been verified that bodies are being shipped across state lines and also loaned out from mortuaries for Satanic rituals. Even more startling than this, certain mortuaries are actually replacing dead bodies with replicas prior to burial, and selling the unembalmed bodies. The reports about Funeral home collaboration with various evil groups comes from a variety of independent sources.</strong>   (9)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It is said, and I cannot verify this, that children are kidnapped by the elite (intelligence agencies and other groups under the Illuminati or working with their approval) and taken to Florida, where they are then sold internationally for experiments or for other purposes.</strong>    (9)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a secret Templar settlement dating back prior to Columbus hidden by the Masons in Arcadia* National Park.  (10)</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Reported Occult Ritual Sites in the United States (and Canada)</h1>
<p><strong>California</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disneyland has been a favorite ritual and programming site for the Illuminati <strong>in its off hours,</strong> and <strong>many of Disney’s staff are into the occult.</strong> (11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FEMA has <strong>a secret base near [Bohemian] Grove.</strong> (11)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Golden Gate National Recreation Area, CA -- <strong>Army bases are favorite places for Satanists to try to recruit men into covens.</strong> (12)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Illinois</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chicago -- <strong>The extensive tunnel system built under Chicago and no longer in public use, are used by Satanists.</strong>  (18)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indiana</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Several sources from Indiana have mentioned how rampant Satanism and Witchcraft are in Indiana.</strong>  Many of the churches are used as fronts. (18)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a local sheriff is elected, (and many of these elections are shady and get in some shady characters) he will be contacted by the Satanic cult and warned that he can either lose his life or cooperate...When a ritual is to be performed the sheriff is called on the telephone, and the hint to look the other way is made.  The call might sound like “Hello Sheriff, we have a party planned on the farm tonight, and we will get a little wild.  Don’t be alarmed. We take care of everything.  We will provide our own security.”   If the local sheriff wants to stay alive he will turn a blind eye to such type of things.  Sometimes certain policemen are brought into the scheme of things, then the Satanists will coordinate the time of the rituals with the timing of the shifts of these policemen.</strong>  (18)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Louisiana</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chatham -- Edward Wayne Cox’s coven...<strong>has a “ceramic shop” which is a cover for the drying of body parts from sacrificed people…he is connected to the Illuminati elite and is totally protected by the legal system…The parts of the body which are not cannibalized in frequent rituals are processed and sold throughout the world for other cults…Cox was involved with the CIA and has been part of the Monarch program done by the Illuminati and the CIA.</strong>  (44) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Atakapa I have been told were the only cannibalistic tribe of Indians in North America at the time...[as opposed to &quot;ritual cannibalism&quot;]...The Atakapa Indians, when faced with the power of the Catholic church around 1800, mixed with the incoming Catholics. <strong>The Atakapas who were into witchcraft and cannibalism were accepted into the Catholic church as priests. They quietly continued to practice their occultism, which has evolved into much of the hard core generational Satanism in the state.</strong>  (20)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Maryland</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bethesda -- <strong>They have Satanic rituals in some of the government buildings in secret.</strong> (21)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nevada</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Las Vegas – <strong>...estimated that 600 human victims are killed in Satanic rituals in Las Vegas every year.</strong>  (23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New York</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hamptons on Long Island is where the rich live and have houses available for ritual.</strong>  (23)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oklahoma</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Satanic hierarchy has interbred important European bloodlines with Indian occult bloodlines – for instance, so that there are Rothschild descendants with Cherokee blood. Other hierarchy bloodlines are also in the state.  (26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Seminole County and Garvin County I believe are places where some of the <strong>Satanic section houses are located.  These section houses are placed in remote areas in the country where no one will or even can visit...Certain women serve as breeders, and most of the child sacrifices come from the section houses themselves. Children growing up in such environments are totally removed from a normal life and grow up under the worst type of abuse...Police in these areas are infiltrated with Satanists...Some of the members of the section houses work in towns, and have very respectable positions as lawyers, doctors, etc.</strong>  (26)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oregon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portland -- <strong>The Illuminati controls Portland\'s City government via a club called City Club. Instructions to the club from the Illuminati in London have been sent via couriers</strong> (27-28)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virginia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Richmond -- <strong>Human sacrifices are regularly performed [by the Illuminati.]</strong>  (33)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Washington state</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tacoma – A house belonging to Dr. and Rose Wilson (who has ties to Nazism) is used for Satanic rituals.  Rose gets instructions from the Rockefellers.  Dr. Wilson was ritually killed.  The house has a second basement.  A small room is used to put children in during rituals.  (35)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quebec, Que. – <strong>The Catholic church in Quebec is a major player in the acquisition of children for satanic programming and sacrifice.</strong> (36)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Some Major Mind-Control Programming Sites</h1>
<p><strong>Lampe, Missouri:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is an <strong>R&amp;R center for the CIA where they can have any sexual perversion or drug they want…</strong> (40)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>McClellan Air Force Base, California:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very bad child and adult porn</strong> using Monarch victims is distributed through this base as well as the other bases listed in this list.  (40)</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The Bend area has an extremely strong hierarchy element.  Many rich people have gone there...Bend, OR has several suburbs which are concentration points for where Illuminati members live. (26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From Bend the Illuminati orders have been verbally transmitted to key centers.</strong> (26)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another ritual site close to Bend was the Lava Tubes /Skeleton Cave...Apparently about 100 Illuminati men gathered there in their tuxedos in their mercedes and rolls royces for a meeting.  (26)</p>

               When a local sheriff is elected, (and many of these elections are shady and get in some shady characters) he will be contacted by the Satanic cult and warned that he can either lose his life or cooperate...When a ritual is to be performed the sheriff is called on the telephone, and the hint to look the other way is made.  The call might sound like “Hello Sheriff, we have a party planned on the farm tonight, and we will get a little wild.  Don’t be alarmed. We take care of everything.  We will provide our own security.”   If the local sheriff wants to stay alive he will turn a blind eye to such type of things.  Sometimes certain policemen are brought into the scheme of things, then the Satanists will coordinate the time of the rituals with the timing of the shifts of these policemen.

            Thats too bad if true. Fritz did some great work. I hope its not true. Do you have any links on this or is it just some rumors you have seen floating around?

             By the way, I probably know less about Fritz Springmeier and his work than most anyone on Voat/pizzagate -- I just thought there was some interesting information in the "Ezekiel" book that I wanted to share --
