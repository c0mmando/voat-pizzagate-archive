<p>Human trafficking, and especially sex trafficking, is not only susceptible to alluring and sensational narratives, it also plays into the celebrity-as-rescuer ideal that receives considerable attention from the media, the public, and policy-makers. While some celebrities develop enough expertise to speak with authority on the topic, many others are neither knowledgeable nor accurate in their efforts to champion antitrafficking causes. Prominent policy-makers allow celebrity activists to influence their opinions and even consult with them for advice regarding public policies. Emblematic of larger, fundamental problems with the dominant discourse, funding allocations, and legislation in current antitrafficking initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, celebrity activism is not significantly advancing the eradication of human trafficking and may even be doing harm by diverting attention from aspects of the problem and solution that sorely require attention.</p>

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Human trafficking, and especially sex trafficking, is not only susceptible to alluring and sensational narratives, it also plays into the celebrity-as-rescuer ideal that receives considerable attention from the media, the public, and policy-makers. While some celebrities develop enough expertise to speak with authority on the topic, many others are neither knowledgeable nor accurate in their efforts to champion antitrafficking causes. Prominent policy-makers allow celebrity activists to influence their opinions and even consult with them for advice regarding public policies. Emblematic of larger, fundamental problems with the dominant discourse, funding allocations, and legislation in current antitrafficking initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, celebrity activism is not significantly advancing the eradication of human trafficking and may even be doing harm by diverting attention from aspects of the problem and solution that sorely require attention.

            Well it is all very sad.  They have all been brainwashed I am sure and raped.  It is a shame.  Lives ruined and wasted and now they are doing the same to others.

            I think Woody and Mia are both really screwed up.  I think he is a pedo and she is a child of a big former actress.  She had Ronan with Sinatra who was MK Ultra.  Very strange goings on with that whole situation.  She was in Rosemary's Baby and that film was as strange as their life imo.

            Well, I can't help thinking that Madonna is a piece of work.  There was a picture of her in that other post where she looked like one of the Rothschilds.   There is something very off about her. As far as her charity, there is probably something if you dig.  These people usually have something very dark in their past and or present. The same with John McCain Found.  How surprised we were to see that.  I think she is as screwed up as Jolie.  Well, not maybe, Jolie is pretty messed up.
