   The google preview omitted this page of David Brock's book, but I realized I owned it -- he notes his mom became very panicked when it became public knowledge he was adopted. Weird?

            David Brock expose dated February 2, 2012. Coworkers describe him
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He had more security than a Third World dictator
            </p>
            <p>
             Extensive interviews with a number of Brock’s current and former colleagues at Media Matters, as well as with leaders from across the spectrum of Democratic politics, reveal an organization roiled by its leader’s volatile and erratic behavior and struggles with mental illness, and an office where Brock’s executive assistant carried a handgun to public events [illegally] in order to defend his boss from unseen threats.
            </p>
            <p>
             The intensity of the 2008 campaign, say those who knew Brock at the time, seemed to exacerbate his bouts of what appeared to be mania
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2002, the Drudge Report reported that Brock had “suffered a breakdown” the year before and was treated in the psychiatric ward of Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
             During a 2008 meeting of the left-wing umbrella group Democracy Alliance outside San Diego, Brock’s unusual behavior drew considerable attention. According to a fellow attendee, “David completely lost his shit. He started getting incredibly aggressive. He alienated important people in the progressive movement, like John Podesta [of the Center for American Progress] and Anna Burger [of the Service Employees International Union]. Lots of drama. There were a lot of conversations about David’s mental health.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Two years later, at another Democracy Alliance meeting shortly after the 2010 election, Brock behaved in a way one prominent liberal who was there described as “erratic, unstable and disturbing.” Brock’s aggression, this person said, was “hard to ignore and noticed by a number of people,” generating “quite a bit of concern” about his condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             He’d get manic, very reckless and grandiose. You’d see this level of self-confidence in him that would spiral.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Friends say Brock, who has publicly admitted drug use in the past, was working obsessively and staying out late with compatriots. “They’d close [local bars] and party till six in the morning,” said one.
            </p>
            <p>
             A number of people in Brock’s orbit believe he was regularly using illegal drugs, including cocaine. “It’s not like he was trying to keep it a secret,” says a female friend of Brock’s.

            It could be nothing, but I have to wonder, considering all the elements, if he could be a product of trafficking himself?

             I've wondered the same thing, so many in this ring are young gay males, what happened to that reporter that people thought was Johnny Gosh, he seems to have dropped off the face of earth, while never given a DNA test. Just way to much weirdness
