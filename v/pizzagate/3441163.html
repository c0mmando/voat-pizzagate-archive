<p>Method of changing a person\'s behavior </p>
<p>Abstract</p>
<p>A method of conditioning a person\'s unconscious mind in order to effect a desired change in the person\'s behavior which does not require the services of a trained therapist. Instead the person to be treated views a program of video pictures appearing on a screen. The program as viewed by the person\'s unconscious mind acts to condition the person\'s thought patterns in a manner which alters that person\'s behavior in a positive way.</p>
