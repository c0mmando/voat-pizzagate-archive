            Please don't forget about Marc Almond. He was inducted into the Church of Satan by fellow musician and friend Boyd Rice. The orginal tainted love video was all about peadophillia, the best of soft cell album cover was masonic. The name Soft Cell has meanings of its own, then Marc Almond gets knighted by the Queen for all his good deeds...... Work it out.....

            This piece of filth was given a job by the BBC (Buggering British Children) after his release from prison, appearing in a documentary about Genesis (the world's only publicly funded paedophile ring takes care of its nonces!).  Prior to that, the then BBC Director General Mark Thompson (the same Mark Thompson who covered for Jimmy Savile after his death, pulling an expose of Savile's litany of crimes so that a glowing tribute to the demonic filth might air in its stead, the same Mark Thompson who went on to become CEO of the degenerate New York Times which, with Thompson at the helm "debunked" Pizzagate without any kind of investigation and has published at least three articles attempting to normalise/defend paedophilia/paedophiles) personally wrote to King to apologise for producers editing him out of old BBC programmes and to assure him it would never happen again.

                 Tubbs was the blackish guy, and was only bewildered by the car he could not put the bug in. He also failed in doing so. Phil was a surprisingly good actor/conman.

            I remember seeing a video a while back...someone was getting a tribute or something so there were several entertainers paying homage to someone &amp; Phil Collins was one of many on it but, Phil made a Jimmy Saville comment I thought, and gave a little wink?
Sorry, I don't remember anymore than that.

                 Hollywood people say lots of things, music industry is run by the same types. Just look at how known satanists that have turned on Wienstien in the meetoo thing. I like to hold out hope for those that get into this mess, but the only way to believe them is when they hire lawyers and start naming names. They might be more believable when they are dead of suspicious suicide also. That would be the not so smart alternative. If they killed them after they sang, then at least they sang. They must realize there are few options.

            The Genesis link is quite suggestive. Peter Gabriel's work is full of Illuminati-style symbolism, e.g. the video for 'Big Time'.

            In all honesty I know nothing about Genesis because of my impeccable taste (

              wink
             </em>

            ) but the music industry does seem to have gone tits up recently, what with Avicii and Lostprophets and Chester Bennington. It's certainly worth paying attention to.
