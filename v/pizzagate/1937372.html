            In_Umbris, Thank you for your very civil comment. If only all posters had your tact and sensibility when raising concerns. It will be a pleasure to respond.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this world, the number of people who are inclined to put everything they have on the line in order to combat the satanic evil at the top of the world’s power structure
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            are independently wealthy enough to self finance any endeavor to counter this evil, is exceedingly small. And even if those so inclined were independently wealthy and could finance their own battlefront, why would we be disappointed if they still chose to look for ways to finance the endeavor? Why would we impose such a handicap on the good side as to suggest the only people who qualify to help prosecute this war must do so exclusively with their own time and money? Why should it be impermissible for good hearted people who have a few dollars to spare but not the time, to instead give someone like a Craig Sawyer a few dollars to help him act on their behalf?
           </p>
           <p>
            The history of the world has at times been written by mercenaries, who had no real interest in who won the war, as long as it was the side that was paying them. If mercenaries could turn the tide in this particular war against satanic pedophiles running the world (which is the most important war raging at the moment) why on God’s good green earth would we turn down the opportunity to hire some?
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said that, I don’t think Sawyer is remotely attempting to position himself as a false mercenary (as some say) in this particular war, i.e., someone who will feign to battle satanic pedophiles just for profit. My intuition tells me he loathes these demons and wants to do something about them, but is simultaneously faced with the reality of his current financial situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look, he can earn a living any one of a million different ways, or he can earn a living fighting demons. Why would anyone begrudge him or anyone else in his unique position the opportunity to earn enough to allow him to wage war against those demons? There is profound irony that there are perhaps 10 000 actors or people in the media of roughly the same stature as Sawyer who are earning a living
            <strong>
             not
            </strong>
            fighting pedophiles and would never remotely consider doing so, and yet there is no outcry whatsoever about them. In so far as not seeing tangible results as of yet, I would presume it will take some time for him to build and execute a battle plan. It just can’t be done in days or weeks like some imagine. Nothing of such magnitude can. I am willing to accord him the benefit of doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea that we’re only going to trust people on the front line of this war is if they never ask or even hint for funding and must support themselves independently (in the event they're not wealthy) can only be described as shorted sighted. It’s major a tactical error. Were I walking headlong into the enemy and had to choose one party to march beside me, I’d take one Craig Sawyer (or someone like him) receiving a stipend over ten thousand keyboard clickers clicking in unison that no one is allowed to earn a dollar fighting pedophiles, and if they try, they’re sure gonna fix ‘em good and who believe they’re saving some kid in a dungeon somewhere if only they can keep a few more dollars out of Craig Sawyer’s war chest.  In_Umbris, I don’t think your very well worded concerns fit into the category of people I just described. Here I am speaking to a different audience altogether.

             No you wouldn't. Because the mention of your "death" would paint you as a mentally unstable conspiracy theorist. I think that is what's coming next, "regular people" being suicided by the Deep State. You have to imagine they have a "List of Repeat Offenders" as far as people who won't shut up online about PedoGate.

            Also why is the media so afraid to cover it, and then try to destroy those that do......if there is nothing to the story then cover it and, prove it false or true, don't hide it......they have no problem covering the no story Russian conspiracy.

            We HEAR that "THEY" kill people...
           </p>
           <p>
            But there is no actual EVIDENCE that people die.
           </p>
           <p>
            They call it fear porn. And THEY have been scaring us all our lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just the IDEA that people die exposing this stuff is enough to scare almost everyone.

            Do not be fooled.

             I always tell my friends this. The whole "don't talk about ___ or you might get whacked" is just a psy-op. They can't off everyone, there are too many of us and not enough of them to take us all on, even with hired muscle.

             That's why I get so irritated with videos with titles like "Ex-Marine" or "Ex-Navy SEAL" because I'm always thinking "These are the kinds of guys who could actually form underground Black Ops teams and take these people out, they have the skills, yet they choose not to." If I were a hardened veteran with fighting and intelligence gathering skills, these pedos would be in trouble.

             AJ gave 10k and pledged he would put up a 100k in total. So nothing false there.  Why wouldn't he ask his country for help he is a vet? Lots of vets ask for money, food, shelter, its a very sad reality. Our government standards and opportunities post deployment are not up to par. He may be a mason but some people draw the line when it comes to children. Show me where he hasn't.   22 soldiers die a day who needed help, &amp; it fell on deaf ears, if I would've seen his request I would've opened my wallet like I always do. You should stick to loving horses it seems like you dislike just about everything else.

The idea that you're just some good hearted person greatly interested in the well being of innocent children who posts here at Voat day in and day out merely to protect all of us dainty flowers from those who would lead pg researchers astray is a bit like calling the movie Dumb &amp; Dumber an Oscar worthy drama about the intellectual pursuits of two unrecognized geniuses.

              He gets paid regardless of how effective it is. Seems like a pretty lucrative job when you are a degenerate piece of shit with no morals or productive skills.
