<p><a href="http://dcist.com/2012/12/three_stars_heavy_breathing.php">Here</a> is a link to an article, that I believe should raise some eyebrows. </p>
<p>It seems pretty normal for the most part, except one thing. </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, does this make DIY spaces more difficult or does it just depend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the best shows we’ve played have been in basements but other times it’s been like a living nightmare. Like, you get to the person’s house and it’s like, two kids on the sofa. And they’re like, “Hey, we can fix you some food.” That happens a lot. But it’s still fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would a band that has been &quot;touring&quot; since 1999 [according to their websites &quot;diary&quot;]., including Europe in 2002, commit to doing small events, at a private home, for two children? Especially given the type of music they play and the genre of &quot;art&quot; they like to display and joke about. 
Lets not forget, they said:</p>
