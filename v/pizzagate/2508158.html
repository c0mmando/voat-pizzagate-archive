             Sandusky cover-up: Why is Kenneth Frazier leading the investigation at Penn State?

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            'Merck and Penn State have something else in common: Their failure to act creates substantial civil liability, and it is here that Frazierâ€™s experience at Merck may be most useful to Penn State. '
           </p>
           <p>
            ' Those interested in learning the full and complete truth about what happened at Penn State have the right to be concerned that the cover-up of the cover-up has begun. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'As at Merck, so at Penn State: People looked the other way when they stumbled upon something they preferred not to see. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'There are parallels between the situations at Merck and Penn State. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'At Penn State, they were protecting a football program that brings in $70 million per year, confers prestige on the university and supports jobs with important titles and big paychecks. '
