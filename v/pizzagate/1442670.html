            " A
few weeks ago the Wall Street Journal printed a letter from him which
noted that when Lanny Davis vetted the Reno nomination for Attorney
General in 1993, Thompson gave Davis “information, which could be
corroborated by multiple sources wholly independent of me, that Reno was
unfit to practice law, let alone serve as this country’s top cop.”
Thompson went on to delineate the old claims of Reno’s aggressive
lesbian lifestyle, use of calls girls, drunk driving stops, and capped
it off by claiming she was being blackmailed, by both Florida organized
crime, and by her boss, Bill Clinton."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Reno, according to Thompson, had had multiple drunk driving incidents
and engaged in some embarrassing sexual escapades. Thompson says Carmen
“Crystal” Kazim claims to have been a call girl providing sexual
services to Reno. Thompson also quotes John Gigliotti (from Pat
Robertson’s security detail) who says Michael Eppinger, an alleged
organized crime figure in Miami supposedly has a video of Reno at a sex
orgy he (Eppinger) arranged. Eppinger also apparently has ties to the
Clinton Administration, having had VIP status at Clinton’s Summit of the
Americas."

             "Sixteen years ago, then-attorney general Janet Reno rejected for a third time a recommendation to appoint a special counsel to investigate Gore's campaign fundraising activities in 1996."
"Like last month’s recommendation by FBI Director James Comey not to pursue criminal charges related to Clinton’s handling of classified information on a private email server while secretary of State, Reno’s decision infuriated Republicans and followed the general election campaign to its historically disputed end."
"LaBella was among those whose calls for an independent counsel to investigate possible fundraising abuses by Gore and then-President Clinton was rejected by Reno, as Gore was prepping for a White House run."
"LaBella said he met with Reno at least once, or sometimes twice a week, to update the attorney general on the progress of his unit's investigations. Although Reno overruled LaBella's 1998 recommendation and similar guidance from his successor, Robert Conrad, in 2000, the former Justice official said the attorney general never sought to discourage the unit's investigations.
             <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/08/28/clinton-emails-justice-department-gore-reno/89351954/">

             </a>
             "She always said, 'Leave no stone unturned,' " LaBella said. "She never put pressure on us.''"
"I realize that politics will be hurled around my head,'' Reno said shortly after making the 2000 decision to reject a special counsel for Gore. "I just sit there and duck as it comes and continue to look at the evidence and the law and make the best judgment I can."

"On the 23rd of June, 1993, the body of Paul Wilcher was discovered in his Washington DC apartment. "
"Paul Wilcher was an acquaintance of mine. He was not a perfect person; he made mistakes like anyone else but he was also, at times, a man of unusual energy and altruism. A seminary student who considered becoming a priest, he later became an attorney is his efforts to accomplish some good in this world.
             </p>
             <p>
              Overall, I fell he was a good man. He didn't deserve to die.
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally, I don't believe he died of natural causes. "

             J Edgar Hoover was in charge of child porn and used to lure and fuck children. FBI under HOOVER collected largest PORN CHILD SNUFF MURDER library on earth, and these videos became inhouse loan entertainment for all law enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under RENO the video tapes went viral and people in house at cop-shop would get drunk watch children be raped and murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reno was in charge of Child porn and used it to show at office party's with FBI buddy's with beer &amp; drugs, at FBI AG HQ.
            </p>
            <p>
             50+ years folks and not a fucking thing has change, while good people rot in their prisons for 1% of what RENO/Hoover did daily.

              "Michael Sawyer recalls a chance meeting with Reno on the Shenandoah Staircase, a popular Class II-III run not far from Washington, D.C. “We saw the NOC van and black suburbans at the bridges,” he recalls in a Facebook post. “We caught up with them at Bull Falls and [the NOC instructor] asked for assistance. Before long we had two or three wet Secret Service officers with wet Uzis.” Sawyer says the Attorney General and her sister did not swim.

              “We started talking with her and she found out I was an attorney. She asked me ‘where do you practice?’ I replied, “Usually on the ‘Doah or the Potomac, but I don’t get to paddle much because I work a lot,” Sawyer writes"

              You sound nuts, and by association, are making us all sound nuts.  Can you please cite sources or (at the very least) circumstantial evidence?  If someone who doesn't know about Pizzagate comes here and reads your comment, they'll think we're all tinfoil hat nutjobs.

             "In an interview with ConservativeNews.com, Thompson named
one call girl he spoke to named Crystal Kazim, who claimed
to have received money for sex from Reno at Renos home.
Thompson said these services were confirmed to him by Ms.
Kazims escort provider Jay Goldstein, brother of Screw
magazine publisher Al Goldstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thompson passed both of these names on to the FBI before
Renos appointment to Justice, and the allegations are likely
in her FBI file now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thompson told ConservativeNews.com he shared the details of
his concerns with Clinton aide Lanny Davis, who was respon-
sible for examining Reno before the nomination.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thompson says his law school buddy Sam Jones, a law partner
with Clinton confidante Bruce Lindsey, also warned the
Clintons of Renos problems. But Thompson now says he is
convinced the administration wanted a "dirty cop" for their
attorney general.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thompson, who says Reno is a "predatory lesbian" with a
penchant for "aggressive sex," also claims that organized
crime is in possession of videotapes of Reno. He told Con-
servativeNews.com that several associates of Miamis premiere
call girl operation told him they have "video of Reno in a
sex orgy.""

              Funny and more cannibalism
             </p>
             <p>
              "Janet Reno Launches Probe to Investigate "Ate My Balls" Websites
Janet Reno looks into Ball Eating Web sites Washingtion, DC-- At a press conference today, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed concern over a new type of web site and its implications. "The Department of Justice has been following this trend for some time now. After a preliminary review, we decided to pursue this further."
"
              <strong>
               These viscious acts of cannibalism can no longer be ignored.
              </strong>
              "
             </p>
             <p>
              The phenomennon of "Ate My Balls" sites began about a year ago in a college dorm. Initially, Mr T. was accused of consuming testicles.
             </p>
             <p>
              But now there are hundreds of web sites accusing everyone from Monica Lewinsky to the Biker Mice from Mars of eating balls. Given the barbaric topic of these sites, the legal system would take notice sooner or later.
             </p>
             <p>
              "If any of these accusations are true, these crimes will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," the Attorney General promised. She continued, "Canibalism in any form is still illegal in the United States, certain parts of Pennsylvania notwithstanding."

               "She is idealistic, yet, clinging to a philosophy that worked for her at the small Dade County, Fla., prosecutor's office; she micromanages an agency with 100,000 employees, which critics say distracts her from providing vision or broad leadership.
              </p>
              <p>
               She is highly principled. But as Attorney General, she has muffled some of her long-held political principles, like opposition to the death penalty, to support the Clinton Administration's more conservative crime-fighting program.
              </p>
              <p>
               She is, then, loyal. But in her current post, her loyalty yields neither influence nor access within the President's inner circle. Third choice for the job, she has no personal relationship with the President. She said she never dines or socializes with him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Asked when they last got together, Ms. Reno cited a recent White House meeting on hate crimes, in which they were together on a dais before hundreds of people."
"By focusing on details, several former and current officials said, Ms. Reno ended up too reliant on her deputies. The former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, they said, protected Ms. Reno by acting as a roving trouble-shooter, keeping the department running while Ms. Reno focused on her issues.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ms. Gorelick's departure in March left Ms. Reno without a trusted associate to supervise critical operations like the campaign finance investigation, which were left to drift. It was not until September that Ms. Reno replaced a career lawyer in charge of the campaign finance investigation with Charles LaBella, a senior prosecutor from San Diego."
"Ms. Reno has said campaign finance issues must be cut into specifics to apply her dictum of ''following the evidence and the law.''"

                "Thompson was the Republican nominee in 1988 for the office of Dade County
State Attorney, when he first raised this issue publicly. He was running for
what was the most powerful political office in all of south  Florida and
called a press conference attended by 21 media entities, charging Reno with
refusing to prosecute the child pornography case because the principals
involved had threatened to expose her lesbianism, if she proceeded. Thompson
bluntly and publicly called it "blackmail" and stated that the citizenry
cannot afford to have any public officials hiding embarrassing situations
because of the susceptibility to those political enemies "who would play the
extortion card."" 
"Liberal Circuit Court Judge Dick Feder (also the chairman of the Florida ACLU)
was persuaded by Reno’s child porno supporters to attempt to dispose of
Thompson and get his license to practice law lifted by having him declared
mentally incompetent because of "his obsession with pornography." Apparently,
Thompson’s only "obsession" was his effective opposition to it."
"Jack Thompson may be the only "officially certified sane" attorney in the
united States. He later collected $20,000 in damages from the Florida Bar
Association, the only such legal victory in the history of any of the state
associations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thompson first stumbled across the checkered past of Janet Reno in 1986, when
he became the court-appointed attorney for Ileana Fuster - a defendant in a
child pornography case in which Janet Reno was the State Prosecutor. He soon
learned that Frank and Ileana Fuster had, indeed, molested and exposed dozens
of small children to hard-core porn at the Country Walk Day Care Center."
"The record shows that Janet Reno
actually has the worst record in Florida history of bringing sexual abuse
cases to trial.
               </p>
               <p>
                Not only did Reno eventually back off the Fuster case and refuse to prosecute,
but she apparently leaped at the opportunity to cavort with a new playmate -
this time with the jailed defendant, Ileana Fuster, according to eyewitnesses."

                 "When witnesses told Thompson that Reno had held the hand of Fuster during a
deposition, he became a little suspect. Later he learned that Janet Reno
carried on a lesbian affair with the defendant in the jail cell. While Fuster
was stripped naked on a "suicide watch," Reno visited her alone more than 30
times. Even if there had been no hanky-panky involved (although prison guards
did witness that playful activity and also attested to the fact that Reno
signed Fuster out of jail and took her to dinner), such a private visit by a
prosecutor to a defendant in a criminal case, without opposing counsel
present, is highly unethical and constitutes grounds for dismissal of the
case and even disbarment of the offender.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Miami Police Chief Ken Harms had knowledge of this and other outrageous and
criminal behavior, and he was prepared to tell the Senate Judiciary Committee
investigating Reno’s background, prior to her appointment in 1993, that
"Janet Reno is not qualified to be even an Assistant State Attorney, let
alone the [Chief] State Attorney in Florida or Attorney General of the United
States." He was never called to testify."
"Reno a Public Drunk Jack Thompson goes further and publicly accuses Janet
Reno of suppressing at least five DUI arrests of her own in her home county.
One female cop stopped Reno’s car after it was seen weaving down the road.
The officer was shocked to see that the driver was none other than the icon
of the court, Janet Reno, with her shoes removed, stockings torn, and vomited
food stains covering the front of her dress. According to Thompson, the
officer now regrets having driven Reno home instead of placing her under
arrest and taking her to jail.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A Fort Lauderdale police officer found Janet Reno with an underage girl in
the back seat of a car at the Galleria Mall. He, also, was never called to
testify at the Senate hearings. In yet another unrelated case, Miami
businessman Michael Thomas names Reno as "the other man" in the Thomas
divorce case. His wife had previously moved out of their home and into the
home of Reno to pursue a lesbian relationship. Mob call girl Crystal Kazim
has given testimony that on numerous occasions she was Reno’s paid lover."

                    "Marlow noted that Fund commemorated the passing of former Attorney General Janet Reno at 78 on Monday morning, after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease, with a tweet that said, “She had her problems, but she was a paragon of virtue compared to Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.”"
"“Janet Reno was a liberal attorney general and certainly pursued those causes,” Fund elaborated. “However, there was a statute in the 1990s that required her, when there was a clear conflict of interest, to appoint the special prosecutor. She appointed six or seven in the first term of the Clinton administration. She did her duty. Despite the fact the White House was very upset with her and didn’t want to appoint her to a second term, they had to because it would have looked as if it was almost obstruction of justice to remove the attorney general that was appointing all these special prosecutors.”"

                     "In January 1993, Clinton's nomination of corporate lawyer Zoë Baird for the position came under attack after it became known that she and her husband had broken the law by employing two illegal aliens from Peru as a nanny and chauffeur for their young child. They had also failed to pay Social Security taxes for the workers until shortly before the disclosures. While the Clinton administration thought the matter was relatively unimportant, the news elicited a firestorm of public opinion, most of it against Baird. Within eight days, her nomination lost political support in the U.S. Congress and was withdrawn.""
"revelations that caused two of President Bill Clinton's choices for United States Attorney General to become derailed."
" The Clinton administration then said that the hiring practices for household help would be examined for all of the more than thousand presidential appointments under consideration, causing the whole process to slow down significantly. Determined to choose a woman for the Attorney General post, Clinton finally selected state prosecutor Janet Reno, who was confirmed and served through all eight years of the administration."
"the Attorney General was in charge of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)"
"Clinton now publicly stated that he had been informed of Baird's hiring of the illegal aliens after discussing the position with her but before actually nominating her.[10][29] He had not halted the process to gain all information but rather had erred by going through with the nomination in order to meet a self-imposed Christmas deadline for naming his cabinet.[29] On January 23, Anna Quindlen used the term "Nannygate" in her syndicated column[30] and it soon gained wide-scale use.[19]

                    <p>
                     While Lillian and Victor Cordero had done their jobs well (before hiring them, Baird had made several attempts to employ U.S. citizens, but none had worked out),[7] on January 22 the INS said it sought to question them and very likely deport them.[12][31] The couple had previously separated and were about to be divorced.[32] Lillian Cordero agreed to leave the country and return to Peru, under a 30-day "voluntary departure" program.[32] Victor Cordero first went into hiding, hoping to stay in the country; his lawyer said he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and that, "He doesn't understand why he's being singled out."[12][31] But by January 29, he too had voluntarily left the U.S. for Peru.[32] Neither of them ever appeared in the media.[33] Although illegal domestics were rarely deported unless they had been involved in crimes,[12] the INS maintained that the couple were treated no differently than any other illegal aliens who were brought to their attention"

                      The Wood near-nomination-playboy bunny
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      On February 4, 1993, the Clinton White House made it known via deliberate background statements to several major newspapers that 49-year-old United States federal judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York would be his new choice for Attorney General.[34][35] However, no official announcement or nomination was being made, pending the completion of background checks and to gauge reaction to the pick.[34][36] White House officials indicated that First Lady Hillary Clinton had insisted that the position still be filled by a woman.[34] Wood, who was prominent in New York social circles,[37] was married to Time magazine writer Michael Kramer and the couple had a six-year-old son.[34]
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      However, later that day, investigations by the office of the White House Counsel and the FBI background check were completed, and Clinton and the White House learned that she had employed an illegal immigrant to look after her son, even though she had done it when it was still legal to do so.[38] The immigrant, from Trinidad, had been hired in March 1986, several months before enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made hiring of illegal aliens unlawful.[38][39] The nanny obtained legal status in December 1987, and overall worked for Wood for seven years.[38]

                     <p>
                      Clinton decided the nomination could not go forward, and the next day, February 5, Wood publicly withdrew herself from consideration.[35][38]
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The case was different from the Baird one in that Wood had not broken immigration law and had paid Social Security taxes for the person.[4][40] Nevertheless, the White House feared reaction from Congress and the public, as well as that from radio and television talk shows, in the apparent, if not actual, repetition of the Baird controversy, and asked Wood to withdraw.[38][40][41] A further burden was the disclosure that while she was a student in London, Wood had trained for five days as a Playboy bunny.[38] The White House was annoyed with Wood, because they said that when they had initially asked her if she had a "Zoë Baird problem," she had responded in the negatory.[38] Allies of Wood gave a starkly different account and said that she had been fully forthcoming about the details of her dealings with the immigrant.[40] According to a Gallup Poll, 65 percent of the American public did not think Wood should have been forced down.

                       "On February 11, 1993, Janet Reno was nominated for the post.[45] Clinton had known of her since her days with the groundbreaking Miami Drug Court, where as state attorney she had worked with public defender and Clinton brother-in-law Hugh Rodham,[46] but otherwise although qualified for the job had no federal experience and was relatively obscure"
""Public service was her life.""
"Reno remained Attorney General through both of Clinton's terms as president. Wood remained a federal judge. While the ramifications of Nannygate persisted, Baird herself quickly returned to public obscurity.[49] Clinton subsequently appointed Baird to the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and in his 2004 memoir reiterated that the fault for the failed nomination had been his, not hers.[50] Baird hired an American citizen to be her next nanny."

                       <p>
                        Dear Mr. Schippers:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I was very much impressed by Mr. Tracy and Mr. Wacks, whom you personally dispatched to meet with me here in Miami to talk about the above two individuals. I was just as impressed with your wonderful efforts the other evening at the conclusion of Judge Starr's testimony. I wish you were the I.C.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Having said that, I must confess puzzlement. I was told by Mr. Tracy and Mr. Wacks, after spending 3.5 hours with them, that they could hardly wait to talk to a Mr. John Gigliotti, who has evidence of Janet Reno's compromising ties to organized crime. Mr. Gigliotti, despite a follow-up call to Mr. Tracy yesterday, has yet to be contacted.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If your staff is trying to establish a factual basis for folding fundraising irregularities into the impeachment inquiry, then why are leads not being pursued? Janet Reno will never name an I.C. on fundraising because Clinton has information with which he can extort her on this or any other matter. This "firewall at Justice" has been at the heart of Clinton's impeachable behavior since he took the oath of office.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Further, if you folks are going to interrogate Lindsey next week, then why in the world would my testimony not be taken about his witness tampering over the past decade? Of course what I have to give is hearsay. So what? It clearly falls within an exception: an admission against interest by Sam Jones. And I have corroborating witnesses to what Sam said about Lindsey's tampering, none of whom has been called, by the way.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I took time to help you all. I was told I did help you all. Now there is some sort of disconnect between what I know you now know and what you are doing with what you know. You are a man who wants to do his job. That is clear. What, then, is going on?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I have the sense that the problem is not on the staff but elsewhere. I have said I will swear to what I know, as to both Reno and Lindsey. PLEASE LET ME DO SO.

                         "Hyde's Investigators Looking Into Reno
Jon Perdue Exclusive to GeorgiaPolitics.com 11-22-98
The following appeared on NewsMax.com Saturday:
"Hyde Looking for Dirt on Reno
INSIDE COVER also learned that two of Hyde's top investigators flew down to Miami last week to snoop on Reno's past. Investigators were particularly interested in Reno's associations with known organized crime figures."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         After reading this I contacted Miami attorney Jack Thompson, who has run against Reno in Miami and subsequently provided information on her contacts with organized crime in Miami, among other more tawdry undertakings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It was David Shippers who called Jack Thompson to set up the meeting in Miami.
The investigators went to Miami the next day and debriefed Jack for three and one-half hours about: a) Bruce Lindsey's obstruction of justice and b) Janet Reno's ongoing blackmail problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Jack originally gave the story to Chris Ruddy at NewsMax, who is working on the Reno blackmail problem, which, continue to conform to Jack's two year-old public musings about her extortability. This was recently underscored by the Justice Department's pronouncement at the end of last week that she likely will not name an IC on fundraising as to either Gore or Clinton.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Jack Thompson sent the following letter FBI Director Louis Freeh:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         John B. Thompson
Attorney
Coral Gables, Florida 33146
August 13, 1998
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The Honorable Louis Free
Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C.
VIA FAX
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Re: Attorney General Janet Reno's Blackmail Problem
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Dear Director Freeh:
Monday, August 10, 1998, The Wall Street Journal published my letter responding to a guest column written by Lanny Davis about why Janet Reno should not seek an independent counsel on fund raising.
My published words point out that when Lanny Davis called me to "vet" Reno's A.G. nomination, "I gave Davis information, which could be corroborated by multiple sources wholly independent of me, that Reno was unfit to practice law, let alone serve as this country's top cop."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The Wall Street Journal would not have printed these incendiary words if its editors (including Micah Morrision, with whom I have spoken about this) did not already know from their own sources what I know: Reno uses call girls for sex and has a string of drunk driving incidents, which can be substantiated by following leads provided to the FBI field personnel who not surprisingly did a phony background check while William Sessions was FBI Director. You know full well why Sessions did not want to ruffle this Administration's feathers: job maintenance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         One of the most fruitful of these leads is provided by a Crystal Kazim, who is an organized crime call girl who provided sex for money to Reno on a regular basis. She says so. Private investigator John Gigliotti at [phone number] can convince you that this is the case. Additionally, six police officers who pulled Reno over for drunk driving were never contacted by the FBI. You know as well as I do why thorough background checks are supposed to be done on would-be Cabinet officials: to see if their character is sturdy enough to do the job, undeterred by either a character infirmity or by extortion and the hands of those willing to expose that infirmity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Janet Reno, I state to you categorically, hereby putting my law license on the line, has been blackmailed in the past because of her substance abuse and criminal sexual exploits, and she can be blackmailed now by a President who is known to use "dirt" on people to deter them. This explains why she will never appoint an independent counsel to investigating fund-raising irregularities by the President or Vice President.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I respectfully recommend that you should immediately have your FBI agents follow the leads that prove Reno's blackmailability, and you should report your findings to the appropriate Congressional oversight committees. I will state under oath all you need to find the truth. As FBI Director, you have a duty to ferret out this truth.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                          "Whatever the commission does, Ms. Reno should accept the auditors' finding -- and those of Mr. Freeh and Mr. La Bella -- that this issue must be decided by someone not beholden to Mr. Clinton and his inner circle. This is more than a technical issue. The law says that unregulated soft money can only go to certain party-building activities like voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. If Ms. Reno and the Federal Election Commission look the other way while candidates circumvent the law, the parties will simply step up their shakedowns of corporations, unions and rich donors to finance election
campaigns. "

                           "Symptomatic of the dangerous consequences of viewing drug use as a national security threat was the comment by Attorney General Janet Reno on the occasion of a 1994 technoogy transfer agreement between the Pentagon and the Jusice department. Reno challenged the military to "turn your skills that served us so well in the Cold War to helping us with the war we're now fighting daily in the streets of our towns and cities across the nation." The point that seemed to elude Reno and others who advoocate the militarization of the crusade against illegal drugs is that there is a vast difference between having the military confront enemy armed forces and using similar tactics against american civilians."

            The Reno Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to reinterpret the federal child pornography statute in a way that will result in legalizing a substantial amount of child pornography, encouraging further criminal child exploitation.

             After skimming over the badly written article, I'd say all they did was limiting the definition of cp to what actually contains visible sex acts. Which helps protect not cp producers, but parents with children making harmless holiday movies, and such. Though some 'artists' will obviously exploit according loopholes, too. As long as children don't get harmed, I don't mind a way to identify perverts, so they can be kept out of jobs involving children...
