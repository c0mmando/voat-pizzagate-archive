            It is not a matter of shoehorning this into Pizzagate. It is important to see that a nation's leaders can be under the malign influence of a cult, and particularly important to see that MSM don't want us to see that.

            I am not denying the links and the influence of Choi on Park since the latter's mother was killed in a botched assasination (ritual killing?) attempt.

            Neither am I saying that she was not mind-controlled from a young age.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I am saying is that without reasoned

            When was it exposed to the South Koreans about this?  Some speculated the WikiLeaks Insurance files, but that would mean the public found out after Oct 17 or so.

            It's good to hear from an alleged native Korean on this matter. With all do respect though, can you really account for what your entire country was protesting for on that month? It seems corrupt media misdirection is just as much of a problem over there as it is here. What makes you think that Korean-CNN would announce that a huge contributing reason for the mass-protests are leaked documents proving their president has occult ties, summons demons. You're highly undermining what having this as written factual evidence can do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Believe me, if there was solid proof such as an e-mail, where Hillary Clinton claimed to be in regular contact with spirits you can bet there would be similar protests in America. And you can bet that CNN would undermine the cause of those protests, claiming it was due to something entirely different.

             Agree totally, and it's time to recall that Hillary had mediums in the White House, said I think to have communicated with Eleanor Roosevelt. We dismissed it as New Age silliness at the time. Who's to say she's not swayed by spiritual delusions and people who manipulate her through them?

            Although the impeached President had links to the cult you mention there is no proof that the Korean people were marching because they were accusing Pres. Park Geun-hye of  'Satanic Beliefs'.
