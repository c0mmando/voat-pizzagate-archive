            I was looking into Justin Trudeau making pizza at a place called Stoney's
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1441138">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1441138

            .  Although I found nothing related, and nothing that follows is either,
            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.8978969,-70.9504554,3a,75y,205.2h,79.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sis22ExTQwV3XAyYI6omGOQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1">
             this place
            </a>
            popped up in my search.  Stay with me, because I think I found a connection to pizza shops and tombstone shops.  I know...  Hear me out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The building itself I personally find creepy being a house with a side door, plus it's physical location and surrounding businesses being a tombstone shop and a Burger King feels low-end.  The reviews are interesting to read and not positive.  It looks like there's an eye and writing I can't make out on the sign by the side door
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/LbPdb">
             here
            </a>
            The tombstone place next door kept bugging me too, and then something clicked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember a creepy pizza place that I loved as a kid, which is actually still open.  Fun House Pizza.
            <a href="http://www.funhousepizza.com/raytown.html">
             Just look at their webpage
            </a>
            It has physical rides (not shown) like a helicopter and horse, arcade, and I remember the back room being for adults only.  Seems like they're branding themselves more a Chuck E. Cheese vibe nowadays (although I'm not sure that's better)
            <a href="https://youtu.be/7pxSLNIqiFE">
             Their commercial
            </a>
            just bugs me for some reason, but I can't figure it out.

             Sweet six-sided star sign too...

           </p>
           <p>
            Getting back to Stoney's, notice it's right next to a tombstone shop.  Fun House Raytown is too.  Maybe coincidence.  That's what led to

            , to Nestle, to the weird pizza for kids without parents around PSA.  Thanks Nestle.  Weirdos.  That's where that rabbit hole ended, but I couldn't shake the weird connection with tombstone shops and freemasonry to pizza.  Read on if you'd like that fucked up connection.

            The only lead I had to connect the monument/tombstone places to freemasonry was this Frederick Barnicoat person.  Maybe here?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FREDERICK BARNICOAT, a skillful 
granite sculptor of Quincy, was born 
in Penryn, Cornwall, England, April 
7, 1857, son of Thomas P. and Emma (Cur- 
dew) Barnicoat. The father, also a native of 
Penryn, was there for many years a contracting 
mason, having a large business and employ- 
ing man)' men. His wife, Emma, likewise a 
native of Penryn, bore him nine children. 
These are: Elizabeth, the wife of James 
Coles, of Leeds, Yorkshire, England; Emma, 
the wife of James Hogg, also of Leeds; Mary 
Hannah, the wife of Henry VVorsdell, of 
Quincy, Mass. ; Charlotte, a school teacher in 
Birmingham, England; John, of Providence, 
R. I.; Edwin, of Mylor r Cornwall, England; 
Frederick, the subject of this sketch; S. 
Henry, of Quincy, Mass. ; and Charles, of 
Providence, R.I. 
Frederick Barnicoat was educated, and 
learned the trade of a granite cutter in 
Penryn, England, living there until twenty- 
four years old. Emigrating then to America, 
he settled in Westerly, R.I. Here he fol- 
lowed his trade for five years, and subse- 
quently in Boston for six months. After com- 
ing to Quincy in 1886, he had been employed 
as a carver and statue cutter for two years, 
when he started in business for himself, 
being the only person in the city making a 
specialty of statue cutting. Since then, by re- 
markably artistic work, he has achieved a 
wide reputation, and now receives orders from 
all parts of the Union. He has done much 
work for soldiers' monuments. In the last 
year he cut and shipped thirty-three figures, 
employing as assistants about twenty-two men. 
He takes great interest in anything connected 
with the development of the granite industry, 
and is one of the directors of the T. W. 
Smith &amp; Co. Granite Turning Company. 
Mr. Barnicoat is a member of the Sons of 
St. George. He married Mary M. I. awry, 
who was born in l'enryn, England, daughter of 
Alexander Lawry. They have seven children 
living; namely, Charles, Gertrude, Stanley, 
Nelson, Minnie, Emma, and Frederick, Jr

            There has been controversy over whether a memorial statue he created was memorializing Union or Confederate soldiers
