<p>Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>SK – Sean Koo (appears elsewhere on flight logs)</p>
<p>Looking at all the logs, I believe this is Sara Kellen Vickers</p>
<p>Steven Pinker- Prof.in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University</p>
<p>Nina &amp; Tim Zagat – Zagat Restaurant &amp; Business Reviews</p>

<p>Katinka Matson -President of Brockman, Inc. and Co-Founder of Edge</p>
<p>Cindy Lopez – Minor(F) Mystery Minor posing w/ Clinton in hat</p>
<p>Kelly Bovino – The Story Project (Helping Runaways/ Actress /Model) Epstein Sex Slave</p>
<p>Richard Cook – At the time was Disney Chairman</p>
<p>Looks like all of them dabble with something that involves children, by way of thought processes, academia and Media.</p>
<p>On February 23, 2002 Epstein’s Jet flew out of Monterey, CA (MRY) for Van Nuys, CA (VNY) just outside Los Angeles. According to our source Silicon Valley entertainment was on the menu after they dropped off the Zagats.</p>
<p>The flight logs show that Jefferey Epstein, SK (Sean Koo?) Kelly Bovino, Nina &amp; Tim Zagat along with 6 unnamed passengers were on board.</p>
<p>According to our exclusive source who was 14 at the time the 6 unnamed passengers are listed below. Our source said she was waiting for the “guests to arrive” and told us other’s came with a Sony Pictures jet too for the “party”.</p>
<p>Cindy Lopez – Minor Female on flight manifests since 1996 Steven</p>
<p>Sarah Kellen – Epstein’s assistant</p>

<p>Nathan Myhrvold -FormeMicrosoft Executive</p>
<p>The unknown girl in the picture with Bill Clinton is none other than Cindy Lopez. She is identified by John Brockman on his own personal blog where we have retrieved all photos he has.</p>

<p>I\'ve looked at pics of Cindy and Rachel, hard for me to tell which it is, but it sure looks like Cindy</p>

<p>Who tried to block the unsealing?</p>
<p>Who doesn’t want this open and in the public eye? Royal Family? Yes but this topic is a “Tuesday” for the Royals. They can get away with anything in their countries because they are royalty. Below are the people who have been enjoying the company of Epstein and the “perks” and the have the MOST to lose.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley</p>
<p>Could it be that MacKenzie Bezos was shocked to see who Jeff was hanging with? Maybe found evidence? Could Google have increased their censorship to avoid dissemination of photos of their executives with sex slaves like Kelly Bovino &amp; Eric Schmidt?</p>
<p>Incredibly, we were able to find more photos of these young girls online but on underground porn sites.</p>
<p>Haley Robson is found on one site that is not XXX too much so click with caution</p>
<p>They did a great job deleting evidence but the back end of the internet is the best place to go – the fringes of the net house EVERYTHING. Including pages that have been deleted, emails, blogs, pictures, notes and videos.</p>

<p>THE EDGE &quot;BILLIONAIRES\' DINNER&quot; 2008</p>
<p>Event Date:[ 2.25.02 ]</p>
<p>Location: Indian Summer Restaurant,</p>
<p>Monterey, CA United States</p>
<p>What preternatural power can prompt Rupert Murdoch, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Richard Dawkins, Neil Simon, Art Buchwald, Frank Gehry and Quincy Jones to sit for hours in a hot room contemplating the nano-sized split ends on gecko toes? ...</p>
<p>Where else but at TED would Mr. Katzenberg, standing Armani-deep in sawdust with Spirit, his stallion and the namesake of his new animated film, be upstaged by Rex, a biologically inspired robot with springy legs and gecko-like feet capable of navigating the outer reaches of the Amazon — specifically, the leg of the Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos, a longtime Tedster?</p>
<p>can get deep. Very deep. Steven Pinker, the eminent cognitive psychologist, found himself deep in conversation with the singer Naomi Judd about the role of the amygdala, the part of the brain that colors memory with emotion; something, he aptly noted, &quot;that would not happen at the meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society.&quot;</p>

<p>Judd?</p>

<p>It happened here one night last week over chicken and polenta at the annual private dinner, given by the New York literary agent John Brockman, formerly called the Millionaires\' and Billionaires\' Dinner after the rich techies who traditionally flocked to TED. There were still a few members of that endangered species scattered about, among them Nathan Myhrvold, the retired Microsoft chief technology officer, who gave an electrifying discourse at the 1997 TED about dinosaur sex. .....</p>
