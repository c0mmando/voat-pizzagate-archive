<p>On February 23, 2002 Epstein’s Jet flew out of Monterey, CA (MRY) for Van Nuys, CA (VNY) just outside Los Angeles. According to our source Silicon Valley entertainment was on the menu after they dropped off the Zagats.</p>

<p>THE EDGE &quot;BILLIONAIRES\' DINNER&quot; 2008</p>
<p>Event Date:[ 2.25.02 ]</p>
<p>Location: Indian Summer Restaurant,</p>
<p>Monterey, CA United States</p>
<p>What preternatural power can prompt Rupert Murdoch, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Richard Dawkins, Neil Simon, Art Buchwald, Frank Gehry and Quincy Jones to sit for hours in a hot room contemplating the nano-sized split ends on gecko toes? ...</p>
<p>Where else but at TED would Mr. Katzenberg, standing Armani-deep in sawdust with Spirit, his stallion and the namesake of his new animated film, be upstaged by Rex, a biologically inspired robot with springy legs and gecko-like feet capable of navigating the outer reaches of the Amazon — specifically, the leg of the Amazon.com founder, Jeff Bezos, a longtime Tedster?</p>
<p>can get deep. Very deep. Steven Pinker, the eminent cognitive psychologist, found himself deep in conversation with the singer Naomi Judd about the role of the amygdala, the part of the brain that colors memory with emotion; something, he aptly noted, &quot;that would not happen at the meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judd?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happened here one night last week over chicken and polenta at the annual private dinner, given by the New York literary agent John Brockman, formerly called the Millionaires\' and Billionaires\' Dinner after the rich techies who traditionally flocked to TED. There were still a few members of that endangered species scattered about, among them Nathan Myhrvold, the retired Microsoft chief technology officer, who gave an electrifying discourse at the 1997 TED about dinosaur sex. .....</p>
