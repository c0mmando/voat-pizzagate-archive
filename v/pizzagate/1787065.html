</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental thesis of Pizzagate is that pedophilia, sex trafficking, and other crimes against children are endemic to the power structure in Washington and internationally, both on the left and the right sides of the political spectrum. Given that basic theory, it’s getting harder and harder to relegate Pizzagate to being nothing more but confirmation bias and clustering illusion gone awry. With each discovery, there is a new rebuke to the misconception that Pizzagate is based primarily on thematically-disturbing artwork and logos that allegedly resemble pedophile symbols.</p>
<p>As I noted in Pizzagate Part Deux, the body of independent research collectively known as “Pizzagate” is facing ongoing challenges. From widespread ridicule as “fake news,” a gunman incident at Comet Ping Pong, and a dilution of quality research due to the fact that anyone with a web connection can contribute, <strong>it has become harder than ever for strong research to find a foothold through all the noise.</strong></p>
<p>But remarkably, the more serious and discerning contributors have still managed to make strange findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discovery of WorkinOnMahNightCheese IG account</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instagram account werkinonmahnightcheese belongs to Jeff Smith, a contractor who works with Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis. Smith rose to notoriety amongst Pizzagate researchers after it was discovered that he commented “#killroom” on an Alefantis Instagram post of a walk-in freezer.</p>
<p>An Instagram friend of Smith’s also commented “#killroom” on an image from the wekinonmahnightcheese account, on an image of a room in his art studio in a PA retail center called The Pajama Factory. No one is quite sure what the killroom hashtag means, but as you might imagine, some of the theories are macabre. [Smith also calls one of his friends &quot;my favorite pedo&quot;.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>However, as we’ll demonstrate below, Pizzagate is based on far more than just unsavory Instagram posts and allegedly strange logos. While these have certainly piqued researchers’ interest, the strangest things that have been uncovered continue to go quite a bit deeper.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>James Alefantis owns 12 properties in the DC area. But he is a lowly pizza man. The article details a strange series of real estate deals involving a house he and David Brock owned together. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has raised eyebrows among some that the house is potentially being bought and sold as a way to launder money, as the selling history appears to fit an overall pattern that points toward this as a possibility. The political connections of the listing agent when Alefantis purchased the home only add further cause for question. The fact that we live in a political landscape where the CIA hires real estate agents causes one to have to regard Washington, D.C. as a kind of alternate reality where all kinds of questions that seem absurd elsewhere suddenly become reasonable to ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alefantis, Silsby &amp; the CIA</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aaccused child trafficker Laura Silsby and organization Friends of the Orphans are both connected with accused CIA agent Mary Sue Conaway, and James Alefantis himself. Given the network being uncovered, his designation as one of Washington D.C.’s 50 most influential people begins making more and more sense even as new questions emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epstein. DynCorp &amp; the State Department</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, convicted billionaire pedophile, owns a variety of aircraft, and one of them — a Bell Long Ranger 206L3 helicopter — shared its tail number with a OV-10D Bronco registered to the U.S. State Department. This Bronco was subcontrated to Dyncorp for “counter-insurgency” and “counter-narcotics” operations. For those who don’t know, Dyncorp is a private military contractor often hired by the U.S. for everything from renditions and weapon transfers to rescues after natural disasters.</p>
<p>It also so happens that Dyncorp employees were accused of owning and trafficking child sex slaves in Bosnia in the late 1990s; a scandal big enough that a Hollywood film called The Whistleblower was released, based on the story. Epstein, known from his court cases to have had a predilection for teenage sex slaves trafficked from Eastern Europe, shared this tail number on his helicopter during the same period when both he and Dyncorp employees were trafficking pre-teen and teen girls from the Balkan region...</p>
<p>..In another row, Dyncorp employees paid teenage boys to perform strip shows in Afghanistan. Authorities later tried to “quash” the accusations and ensure the story was contained. Described as an “error in judgement” by Hillary Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills, one must wonder if there is something to this disturbing pattern at Dyncorp and what, if anything, Epstein has to do with all of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terry Bean: Democratic Bundler with Multiple Sex Crime Allegations</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bean] faced allegations that he had sex with a minor, and hid a camera in his bedroom smoke detector to surrpetiously record sex with over a dozen individuals. The minor was a 15-year old boy he and his boyfriend solicited on gay hookup app Grindr and had sex with at a hotel.
Aside being a gay rights activist [Not a judgement, just stating facts,] and porn producer, Bean was a major bundler, or “super fundraiser,” for Obama — a position also held by Tony Podesta. A bundler is someone who solitics, collects, and consolidates donations for political candidates. They’re a critical tool for candiates to finance their campaigns, and according to NPR, “rank high in the power structure of American politics.”
...when it came time to go to court, Bean’s alleged teenage victim “disappeared,” his attorney later issuing a statement that he had chosen not to testify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Abedin Family, a Terrorist Fundraiser, &amp;…a Pizza Joint All Share Same Address </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Institute of Mulsim Minority Affairs - publication managed by Huma Abedin\'s mother and brother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muslim World League, an organization credited with promoting Saudi Arabia’s brand of extremist Wahabbi Islam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Icco Italian Pizzeria</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m sure there is a potentially logical explanation for this address being shared by these three entities. After all, Icco is clearly a real, functioning pizza restaurant. In addition to all of this, of course, Abedin’s ex-husband Anthony Weiner is facing child pornography charges, adding even more fuel to Pizzagate researchers’ fire. So the question is, at what point to the coincidences and connections with people involved with pedophilia and child trafficking become significant enough to warrant closer scrutiny as a systemic issue? john-tony-podesta-saudi-arabia-agent</p>
<p>Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised by a Saudi connection — after all, Tony Podesta, brother of Clinton insider John Podesta, is listed as an official foreign agent for the Saudi government, and John Podesta obtained thousands in Saudi cash in support of the 2016 Clinton campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FURTHER CONCLUSIONS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a final note on Pizzagate, at least until I post further research. Early on, there was much talk that figureheads in the Pizzagate and “alternative news” community would be sued for slander, libel, and/or defamation by James Alefantis, John Podesta, and possibly others for their role in spreading the “fake news” hoax that Pizzagate is accused of representing. Former Huffington Post columnist David Seaman comes to mind as a potentially easy target for such lawsuits. However, I predicted in November 2016 that there would be no lawsuits whatsoever arising from the Pizzagate allegations.</p>
<p>Podesta hasn’t made any statement at all on the content of the Wikileaks email releases or any other aspect of Pizzagate. And Alefantis, when asked, has said correctly that a lawsuit would probably be arduous, and unlikely to solve his problem now that the conspiracy theory has taken on a life of its own.</p>
<p>I propose an entirely different reason for the lack of legal action: <strong>I believe there is at least some truth to the allegations, and that those involved have enough skeletons in the closet to be totally unwilling to face the depositions, summonses, and other scrutiny that a legal action would bring. That’s why I believed from early on that no lawsuit would ever be filed against anyone for conducting, promoting, or spreading Pizzagate-related research</strong>. We’ll see if my prediction stands the test of time.</p>

So the question is, at what point to the coincidences and connections with people involved with pedophilia and child trafficking become significant enough to warrant closer scrutiny as a systemic issue? john-tony-podesta-saudi-arabia-agent

           <p>
            Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised by a Saudi connection — after all, Tony Podesta, brother of Clinton insider John Podesta, is listed as an official foreign agent for the Saudi government, and John Podesta obtained thousands in Saudi cash in support of the 2016 Clinton campaign.

           FURTHER CONCLUSIONS
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            I have a final note on Pizzagate, at least until I post further research. Early on, there was much talk that figureheads in the Pizzagate and “alternative news” community would be sued for slander, libel, and/or defamation by James Alefantis, John Podesta, and possibly others for their role in spreading the “fake news” hoax that Pizzagate is accused of representing. Former Huffington Post columnist David Seaman comes to mind as a potentially easy target for such lawsuits. However, I predicted in November 2016 that there would be no lawsuits whatsoever arising from the Pizzagate allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta hasn’t made any statement at all on the content of the Wikileaks email releases or any other aspect of Pizzagate. And Alefantis, when asked, has said correctly that a lawsuit would probably be arduous, and unlikely to solve his problem now that the conspiracy theory has taken on a life of its own.
           </p>
           <p>
            I propose an entirely different reason for the lack of legal action:
            <strong>
             I believe there is at least some truth to the allegations, and that those involved have enough skeletons in the closet to be totally unwilling to face the depositions, summonses, and other scrutiny that a legal action would bring. That’s why I believed from early on that no lawsuit would ever be filed against anyone for conducting, promoting, or spreading Pizzagate-related research
            </strong>
            . We’ll see if my prediction stands the test of time.
