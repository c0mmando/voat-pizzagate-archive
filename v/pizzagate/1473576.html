<p>The guy on the right is Michael Quinn, a rugby player who was all over Australian news papers in May this year for getting caught paying a sex trafficker $250 to have sex with an 8 year old boy. It ended up being DHS that he had been talking to and he was caught. </p>
<p>While reading over the article, i noticed something interesting.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3614616/Accused-paedophile-Michael-John-Quinn-active-dating-sites-left-Australia.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3614616/Accused-paedophile-Michael-John-Quinn-active-dating-sites-left-Australia.html</a></p>
<p>&quot; Quinn allegedly told agents he was travelling to Los Angeles and wanted to \'<strong>meet up with a dad who shares his young ones</strong>\'&quot;</p>
<p>The photo that jimmycomett uploaded here is 97 weeks old, plus about a month since that screenshot was taken, so around 100 weeks. that means, that this is at the very minimum the second time Michael Quinn has done this in the US.</p>
<p>So that photo was 100 weeks old, and he was caught about 20 weeks ago. So AFTER he\'s been involved in circles with James Alefantis he uses online channels to find a target by saying that he wanted to &quot;meet up with a dad who shares his young ones&quot;. THIS IS CLEARLY A METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION HE KNOW\'S EXISTS!</p>',
