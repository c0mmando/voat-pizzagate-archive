            Hi dtneslo. I think you're onto something. It's highly irresponsible for Seaman to make claims like this with no evidence. I can only think of one reason he would do so, therefore I am giving him (not you) a disinfo flair.

            It was in the thread a couple of days ago (the one about a Q thread being banned on reddit) where
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/banusaur">
             @banusaur
            </a>
            said this: "4 months ago a bunch of pizzagate researchers were KILLED (users rebelskum, quantokitty, drainingswamps) and many more were silenced. The smartest and most impactful people were all TAKEN OUT." There were some follow-up queries - and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/think">
             @think
            </a>
            commented that users shouldn't be intimidated - but banusaur didn't elaborate, as far as I could make out.

              @rebelskum

             who said he contacted him and he's just taking some personal time off from this stuff. That's allegedly why he's gone dark on all his accounts for 3 months. I still haven't heard from

             himself though. Also, his pizzagate.wiki site is owned by someone else now.

             I think a ton of people want to copy you on things, (like poster above) but forget to put the hyphen after your name.

              , thanks for the ping - I'm afraid there isn't a solution - some guy called 'think' (without the hyphen) gets about half of my pings... :-(

              Tried to sign up for 'think' as well a while ago, but somebody else already did before me.

             Yeah, Seaman has a tendency toward hysteria. I wouldn't trust anything he says. He got on here once to mame a post, didn't bother to read any of the submission requirements, made a bunch of unsourced claims and got deleted. Shitstorm ensued. I reached out to explain how to post, and he had a bitchy little tantrum about the cyst on his hand making it impossible to repost. Total drama queen. I think Falcon actually rewrote the post for him and posted it. The guy never does his own research and never gives credit to others. He thinks he's a celebrity. Unimpressive, in my opinion.

             To be fair, if u had bought btc or eth when he started pushing it.. you'd be fairly well off right now.

              Thats not the point. I don't need crypto to make money or be well off. I have better ways to make money.

            This rumor has been going around for several months and to my knowledge it has never been verified. I think it started because a couple of regular posters stopped posting and people wondered where they were. If it is any more serious than that I am unaware of it. Researchers from here have in fact been harassed in real life though.
