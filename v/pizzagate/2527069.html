<p>Welcome to the Chozo show. In my last video I highlighted 6 researchers who went dark and were last seen investigating pizzagate. In that video we confirmed that the user FLYNNL1VE5 was indeed alive, albeit in custody of the Oregon State Police.</p>
<p>That finding gave us proof of life for one out of the six, but the other five researchers were MIA. Including the prolific researcher RebelSkum, who has been uncharacteristically silent on every single one of his many social media accounts for over 5 months. </p>
<p>I know many of us prayed Rebelskum would be alive and protected and I have some Glorious news! Our prayers were answered! He is Alive and Safe!</p>
<p>RebelSkum\'s biggest contributions to the pizzagate investigation were </p>
<p>a free book, The Case Against DynCorp,
<a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/720268">https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/720268</a>
a free documentary, The Devil of Little St. James,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WH406_rMIY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=183">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WH406_rMIY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=183</a>

the pizzagate wiki he maintained with his own time and resources (which was also free to join and contribute) and hundreds of posts freely available to this day.
<a href="http://archive.is/ruHl6">http://archive.is/ruHl6</a></p>
<p>He is still lurking around on reddit as RebelliousSkoundrel. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelliousSkoundrel">https://www.reddit.com/user/RebelliousSkoundrel</a></p>
<p>HALLELEUJA! A live one! Ryan Zimmerman, arguably the single-most impactful pizzagate researcher was indeed, most definitely, safe! </p>
<p>Was Rebelskum ‘Threatened’ by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino?</p>
<p>Mr. Michael Aquino was a \'Military Intelligence Officer\' and Satanist from back in the day.
<a href="https://archive.fo/7WEkM">https://archive.fo/7WEkM</a></p>
<p>In the end, the Lt. Col. was not the primary reason Rebelskum went dark. Surely, it does not help when difficulties are compounded with legal liabilities as a researcher, but ultimately, Rebelskum had to put his pro-bono research on hold due to family. </p>
<p>Hearing that Rebelskum was alright was the best news we could have gotten. It literally answered my prayers. I hope we continue to get good news as we look into the other four users mentioned
QUANTOKITTY, DRAININGSWAMPS, BIRTHDAYSUIT11, and IDELIVERPIZZA.</p>
<p>I will continue to look into some new things we’re learned about these users in future updates. </p>

             You embarrass yourself every time you touch a keyboard. Everything I do is to find the pedos and out them. Are you for or against that mission AWS? Do you believe all pedophiles should be hung and disposed of

            <p>
             1) AWS does NOT support the huntiing down of pedophiles and exposing them for any purpose

             It was indirect. He was talking about "defamation" regarding pizzagate.wiki without realizing he was speaking to the founder. Naturally, RebelSkum felt threatened.

              Our enemies way is to indirectly threaten users. I have gotten a few of those threats on my original account, they pm you with shit like "Dont spend too much time on the internet, go have some family time, family is important" and shit like that. I got spooked once and deleted that account. They keep profiles of users so their threats seem real, most recent indirect threat was an unrelated comment talking about his funny boss who said he will blow up the restourant and blame it on the cheff. I work with food but not in a restourant, they dont have a full profile on me.

               Never get spooked by these losers. Even if they send some goon to your house to stalk you - just go out and talk to the guy. Follow him to his house and ask if you can stay for dinner. They're not gonna just shoot you or your family in the street for everybody to see. The whole point of gangstalking is to get in your head and hopefully make you so scared you kill yourself or something. Using fear as a weapon only works if you let it. This vid has some good tips on it:

              I wasn't wondering if it was something like that.   So by threatened, do you mean threaten to take legal action against someone he felt defaming him?  Because that's another category all together.   Pizzagate has been filled with defamation.

               You embarrass yourself every time you touch a keyboard. Everything I do is to find the pedos and out them. Are you for or against that mission AWS? Do you believe all pedophiles should be hung and disposed of

                I can't say I know terribly much about him.  I heard he broke from the Church of Satan when he found out that LaVey didn't actually think Satan is real.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I only read about the Presidio daycare thing the other day.
               </p>
               <p>
                Seems like it started with dozen and dozens of accusations which got whittled down to 10 by the time of the trial, then all those charges got dropped because of no specifics.  The last charge got dropped because the parents pulled their kid out.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm a big proponent of the adversarial process.  Anyone can look guilty if you one hear the prosecutor.   I know I've believed stuff until I heard the other side.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's very little documentation on this case, but it seems possible, it was a very, very weak case that fell apart like many of the daycare cases in those years of panic.  Except in this case the judge shut it down early.  That's speculation, but there must be some reason Acquino never ever faced charges and the guy who had all of those charges dismissed.  Some support for this speculation is a bunch of the charges didn't actually detail the crime that took place.....it was about specific incidents, it was generally charges and the judge called them out on that.
               </p>
               <p>
                The one thing that seems to argue against this is that at least the initial kid seemed upset on the day of the incident.  Most of these false cases were based on something ambiguous at first and then rumors and gossip flying around before the adults start asking pointed questions to the kids and the adults not believing the children at first, so the kids begin tailoring they stories to what the adults want to hear and this happening months later.
               </p>
               <p>
                A lot of initial journalism in a case like this can be wrong.  The accurate reporting of false allegations, etc.  Look how long the McMartin case took.   They did the same thing they sent a letter out to all the parents.....this is almost assuredly how they ended up with their dozens of accusations at first.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I wish there was more details available about the Presidio case.

               me: creates unhidden, identical alts when one gets downvote-brigaded, doesn't hide or change style, gets called shill for having alts.

                Magoo. That would be fitting - I am not the sharpest of people. Can you be more specific with examples of how they 'write exactly the same way about exactly the same stupid shit'? I reviewed both accounts and wasn't able to find anything that stood out to me as particularly incriminating. Must be my Magoo eyes.

                   god knows why she switched.  I called out the pernicious female influence on here when there was only a handful; now theres seemingly dozens, especially following the Q shit since women are gullible by nature.  it is legitimately an impediment to the investigation.
