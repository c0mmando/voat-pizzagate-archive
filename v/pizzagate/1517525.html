            The paedophile information exchange or P.I.E..This group of child molesters were pushing for the age of consent to be lowered.Once the gay marriage debate ends and they push through their legislations that protect their hobby,,,,,They then turn to lower the age of consent claiming that young boys or girls can give consent.
