Be warned, for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. For me, I was a fan of her work when I was a kid. 1/1/2018 was the day Pizzagate became PERSONAL.</p>

<p>This chapter focuses on a further explanation as to how no one heard any gunfire, and more on the Bronfman connections to previous information in other chapters. Including Edgar Bronfman’s connection to the Russian Collusion Hoax.</p>
<p>The links below came up as the result of a conversation with an army vet regarding Judith’s death, more specifically how the hell does someone die in evening time by gunshot yet no one heard any gunfire.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsonic_ammunition">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsonic_ammunition</a> Sub Sonic rounds use a heavier bullet to slow down the projectile to speeds less than the speed of sound. This removes the sonic crack that happens when a gun discharges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ammunition/subsonic/">https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ammunition/subsonic/</a> Sub Sonic Rounds exist for pistols. </p>
<p><a href="https://ebrammo.com/subsonic-information">https://ebrammo.com/subsonic-information</a> Sub Sonic Rounds were originally for military/law enforcement covert ops. SSR + silencer is about as loud as a BB gun.</p>

<p>Bronfman Jr. also owns Accel Partners, another company that partially funded Crowd Strike. BOTH Endeavor and Accel have been involved in investment schemes with the Clinton Foundation since 2009. Both Bronfman Jr and Chelsa Clinton are on Board of Directors of IAC, who have a lot of power in online space, especially dating sites. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.thestudiotour.com/wp/studios/universal-studios-hollywood/backlot/current-backlot-sets/falls-lake/">http://www.thestudiotour.com/wp/studios/universal-studios-hollywood/backlot/current-backlot-sets/falls-lake/</a> The Falls Lake section in the backlot was first used for Jaws The Revenge. During my trip/infiltration, the signs at the line for the tram put a lot of emphasis on that fact. This was something I recalled after the fact.</p>
<p>It is HIGHLY likely that said backlot was a crime scene in the Judith Barsi case. Jaws the Revenge being the first film to use the Falls Lake section means that Judith was likely the very first victim to be raped on this site.</p>
<p>Construction for the new tram sections started around mid 2019. I find it very odd to put so much emphasis on one of the worst movies ever made (and one that killed the entire franchise). Is this a possible sick memento of Pedowood’s crime or even a form of taunting those looking into Judith’s death?</p>
<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/9bss.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/9bss.jpg</a> Lastly, a meme pointing out the pedo symbol placed at Judith’s grave. Look at the wings. Appears to be a combination of the “butterfly” symbol and the “girl lover” symbol. The wings form a heart within a heart.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           The links below came up as the result of a conversation with an army vet regarding Judith’s death, more specifically how the hell does someone die in evening time by gunshot yet no one heard any gunfire.

           </a>
           Sub Sonic rounds use a heavier bullet to slow down the projectile to speeds less than the speed of sound. This removes the sonic crack that happens when a gun discharges.

           Sub Sonic Rounds were originally for military/law enforcement covert ops. SSR + silencer is about as loud as a BB gun.

           Edgar Bronfman Jr is the owner of Endeavor Investor Network. EIN owns General Atlantic, who are major investors of CROWDSTRIKE, the server company directly linked to the “muh Russians hoax”. He is also a member of Hillary Clinton for President AND Friends of Hillary.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bronfman Jr. also owns Accel Partners, another company that partially funded Crowd Strike. BOTH Endeavor and Accel have been involved in investment schemes with the Clinton Foundation since 2009. Both Bronfman Jr and Chelsa Clinton are on Board of Directors of IAC, who have a lot of power in online space, especially dating sites.

           </a>
           The Falls Lake section in the backlot was first used for Jaws The Revenge. During my trip/infiltration, the signs at the line for the tram put a lot of emphasis on that fact. This was something I recalled after the fact.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is HIGHLY likely that said backlot was a crime scene in the Judith Barsi case. Jaws the Revenge being the first film to use the Falls Lake section means that Judith was likely the very first victim to be raped on this site.
          </p>
          <p>
           Construction for the new tram sections started around mid 2019. I find it very odd to put so much emphasis on one of the worst movies ever made (and one that killed the entire franchise). Is this a possible sick memento of Pedowood’s crime or even a form of taunting those looking into Judith’s death?
          </p>

           Lastly, a meme pointing out the pedo symbol placed at Judith’s grave. Look at the wings. Appears to be a combination of the “butterfly” symbol and the “girl lover” symbol. The wings form a heart within a heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.

            The brazen act of planting the pedo symbol is a very perverted slap in the face to Judith’s memory and her courage to never give in. Burned at the stake like Joan of Arc.They must meet their fate.TY for your tireless efforts to bring justice for them both. RIP Judith RIP  Heather
