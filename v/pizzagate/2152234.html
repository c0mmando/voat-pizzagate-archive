The witch hypnotizes all the children to come to their deaths to be murdered and eaten, all seduced by a sweet lullaby. Something gave me dark vibes watching this now. Anyone else feel the same?</p>

<p>Come little children, I\'ll take thee away,
Into a land of enchantment.
Come little children, The time\'s come to play,
Here in my garden of shadows.</p>
<p>Follow sweet children, I\'ll show thee the way,
Through all the pain and the sorrows.
Weep not poor children, For life is this way,
Murdering beauty and passions.</p>
<p>Hush now dear children, It must be this way,
To weary of life and deceptions.
Rest now my children, For soon we\'ll away,
Into the calm and the quiet.</p>
<p>Come little children, I\'ll take thee away,
Into a land of enchantment.
Come little children, The time\'s come to play,
Here in my garden of shadows.</p>
<p>Garden of Mystery
Come little children, I\'ll take thee away,
Into a land of enchantment.
Come little children, the time\'s come to play,
Here in my garden of magic.</p>
<p>Come little children, the time\'s drawing near,
Halloween night is waning.
Come little children, ride with me tonight,
It\'s not a night for abstaining.</p>
<p>Come little children, now follow me home,
Not a one of you need worry.
Come little children, the time\'s come to roam,
Come follow me now please hurry.</p>
<p>Come little children, there\'s magic to see,
Here in my garden of mystery.
Come little children, in to my abode,
Tomorrow you all will be history</p>',
