<p>&quot;For this presentation, Cuenca Dance Mob will feature twenty enthusiastic seventh graders....they will be dressed in snappy outfits including <strong>&quot;chicken heads&quot;</strong> because their song and dance presentations will include <strong>&quot;Soy Una Pizza,&quot;</strong> &quot;The Hand Jive,&quot; &quot;The Chicken-Dance,&quot; and &quot;La Macarena&quot;</p>
<p>While none of this is proof. Nacarri uses pizzagate codewords (Pizza and Chicken). So I checked if Ecuador has a known sex trafficking problem. </p>
<p>They do:</p>

<p>In Ecuador, the most common form of human trafficking involves women and girls forced into sex work, with indigenous women and children and migrants especially targeted.</p>
<p>Traffickers prey on poor indigenous families and their children by offering false promises of opportunities to study or good jobs, often as domestic workers or farm laborers.</p>
<p>Authorities arrested 56 suspected traffickers and carried out 52 anti-trafficking operations in 2016, up from 10 in 2015, according to the U.S. State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report</p>

<p>mainly children...</p>
<p>specialized task forces for urban brothels in Cuenca</p>
<p>Police removed 33 children </p>
</blockquote>
<p>An Catholic Torture-Pedophilia scandal/coverup in Cuenca is another clue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Cabrera is implicated in two abuse cases that became public in spring 2018. As Cuenca archbishop (2009-2015), he took no action against César Cordero Moscoso, a prominent priest reported for child sexual abuse to civil authorities in 2010 and to the church in 2010 and 2011. </p>
<p>In his current position, as archbishop of Guayaquil (2015-present), he chose not to notify the public about another powerful priest’s alleged torture and sexual abuse of at least ten teenagers, although the archdiocese had received warnings about the priest in 2003 and definitive allegations in 2013...</p>
<p>In the wake of Palacios’ April 2018 news conference, current Cuenca archbishop Marcos Pérez Caicedo said he would open a preliminary investigation of Cordero. He made no mention of the victim’s reports to the church years earlier.</p>
<p>On May 17, 2018, the chair of the Cuenca child protection board resigned following criticism of the board’s failure to investigate or take precautionary measures in response to Palacios’ 2010 complaint.</p>
<p>In the week of May 6, 2018, an investigative journalism initiative called GK published a 10,000-word article exposing the alleged torture and sexual abuse of at least ten boys by Father Luis Fernando Intriago, a priest of the Guayaquil archdiocese and a longtime spiritual advisor to the disgraced Peru-based Catholic cult, Sodalitium Vitae, or Sodality of Christian Life....his second and final appeal is still pending, meaning that as of May 2018, Intriago is still a priest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Jeffrey Epstein was recruiting underage girls from Ecuador...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One lawsuit, still pending in New York, alleges that Epstein used an international modeling agency to recruit girls as young as 13 from Europe, Ecuador and Brazil. The girls lived in a New York building owned by Epstein, who paid for their visas, according to the sworn statement of Maritza Vasquez, the one-time bookkeeper for Mc2, the modeling agency.</p>
