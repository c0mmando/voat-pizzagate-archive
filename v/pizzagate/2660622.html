<p>TAOS, N.M. — Law enforcement officers searching a rural northern New Mexico compound for a missing 3-year-old boy didn\'t locate him but found 11 other children in filthy conditions and hardly any food, a sheriff said Saturday.</p>
<p>The children ranging in age from 1 to 15 were removed from the compound in the small community of Amalia, New Mexico, and turned over to state child-welfare workers, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said.</p>
<p>Two men were arrested during the search while two women at the compound were initially detained before being released pending further investigation, Hogrefe said.</p>
<p>Two men were arrested during the search while two women at the compound were initially detained before being released pending further investigation, Hogrefe said.</p>
<p>One of the men, 39-year-old Siraj Wahhaj, was jailed on a Georgia warrant alleging child abduction while the other man, identified only as Lucas Morten, was arrested on suspicion of harboring a fugitive, Hogrefe said.</p>
<p>Amalia is 145 miles (233 kilometers) northeast of Albuquerque and in an isolated high-desert area near the New Mexico-Colorado border.</p>
<p>Hogrefe said authorities had conducted surveillance of the compound while looking for the missing boy before he decided Thursday to get a search warrant immediately after a Georgia investigator forwarded a message in which someone at the compound reportedly told another person that people at the compound were starving and needed water.</p>
<p>Hogrefe said the search did not turn up the missing boy, identified by the sheriff as AG Wahhaj, but that investigators had reason to believe the boy had been at the compound fairly recently.</p>
<p>It\'s not clear whether the boy and Siraj Wahhaj are related.</p>
<p>There were no injuries during the search, the sheriff said. But Wahhaj and Morten initially refused to follow commands and Wahhaj was armed with a rifle and four handguns, Hogrefe said.</p>
<p>There was little food in the compound, which consisted of a small travel trailer buried in the ground and covered by plastic with no water, plumbing and electricity, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only food we saw were a few potatoes and a box of rice in the filthy trailer,&quot; the sheriff said.</p>
<p>The adults and children appeared like &quot;refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing,&quot; the sheriff said. &quot;We all gave the kids our water and what snacks we had - it was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen.&quot;</p>

            they told Police they were going on a camping trip to New Mexico
           </p>

             Sounds a lot like how the finders operated and kept the victims. The mothers were also present in the finders case as well. Very eerie similarities.

              remember looking up things when Arizona hit the news, theres a network of military tunnels up near the border in NM, leads into Arizonia

              also Epstein has a huge ranch in NM

             I am afraid to admit that it has occurred to me that he may not be with us anymore. There are many sad details to this story and hope more will come out.  That father had no concern for his son's needs, medical or daily survival needs of water and food, nor for any of the others.  Yes, Finders comes to mind.

              Finders, yeah. I grew up in similar conditions just because we were poor southerners, minus the being in the middle of a desert in a buried trailer! The pictures make me wonder if these people are not some kind of Muslim brotherhood types too. Right or wrong, things made a lot more sense in the 70's. They would have been pulled over in every county just for looking out of place. They would have looked out of place even in a big Georgia city. I remember getting our coolers checked for out of State citrus on the way back to Florida in 1982. There is something strange going on out there.

                  Thank's, been busy, and it will get worse for me. If only the Jewish community would take a stand like that. Some have with bad results, true, but it only hurts them in the long run. I am all for being yourself, yet moving to a new country with no intention of assimilating and even taking over by force is just wrong, and has proved to be a futile plan by history. Rome would hire someone else's army('s) to take over a region close to them (usually a rival). The promise would be that we will help you win, and now it's a part of the Roman Empire. The gain for them would be defeat of the rival and all they can plunder, pillage, and rape. This served the purpose of the Empire by mixing tribes customs, religions, languages to a point where neither have any real coherency so as to be easier to rule in 20 years. Surely it worked for a great while, but everyone who has ever read a history book knows how that turned out, and it's legacy around the world.

              odd that the Father picked him up on Dec 1 and the Mother didn't call in till the 10th
             </p>

              A boy with that many problems, you would think the Mother would have stayed in touch

               I hate to say this, but maybe she was glad to be free of the problems.  We don't know what her life was like. We can see he would not help out with medication or his care, she may have had her hands full with him for a husband.  But gee, how could you let your child even leave with a man like that. Yes, if he abducted him it's a different case, but maybe she has health probs of her own.  I hope they do a followup on this. This is so very obvious a traffic op.  And not a small one. Many are connected to others.

            I cant believe they found those children. I have driven thru that area on vacation from Albuequerque to.Telluride and it is so desolate and parched  that it is spooky. Even if a child could escape, that child would have perished in the elements.

             That is surely the point for the location.  If a child does escape he will never live to tell his story.  Horrid.

             Another thought of mine was that in this country there is enough food and water to remedy this situation.  Also for the richest country, this is beyond shameful.  There is enough food, water AND money.  This should not be happening.

              It sounds like that happened not because of poverty but because these are sick people who were hiding their victims.

               There are many trafficking encampments I feel.  Part of small and larger rings.  Also since there are fewer kids avail. now due to the boarder security and drying up of the supply, they have to come up with new ideas.  Slum Camping for the poor should be a tip off.  If people see these groups, immediate reporting is advised. But even these people have surpassed poor.  Just God Awful.

                OAN was doing the story on it today (technically, now yesterday) &amp; there was a picture or video still showing underground tunnels at the compound! Did anyone else see this? I'd read various news articles, but this was the first mention of tunnels found here. No Captain Obvious needed to determine what's happening. I'd like to know who's above these scumbags they arrested. Surely they have bosses in a network.

                  See if this works. Went to 'video' on the OAN site, which this directs to their YouTube channel. I found this statement particularly chilling: "...smaller developed tunnel system below ground..." . The video clearly shows it, too. How could one find out who owns that area of land? This is a common, recurring theme among elites: seems like each circle of friends has a buddy who owns a vast stretch of land, smack out in the middle of nowhere. Epstein included in NM, there's of course the infamous Cibolo Creek Ranch of TX, where Judge Scalia passed (we all remember the shady crap researchers found about that place). Now look at the states that border Texas. I believe there's likely a tunnel system running throughout most, if not, our entire country. These elitists buy up the remote areas just as the fox guards the henhouse. I've seen some of these vast, barren areas first-hand in Texas &amp; New Mexico. You automatically wonder (rhetorically) why anyone would or could ever live out there. And that's exactly their thinking, too.

                 I don't trust LE either.  Also why didn't the missing boy's mother respond.  You hear nothing of her and supposedly he has been missing since Dec.  Thanks for that bit of news.  I am going to check other articles and OAN.   We need to find out if all those children were born of those women that were also arrested.  Could be breeding children?  I put nothing past traffickers.  Also their name is connected to someone in NY of the same last name.  I am busy today but will try to see if I can find it again.  Thank you again.

             Oh God Yes.  How many of these are we going to have to read before things get better.  This stuff has been going on for decades and each decade it got worse.  If not for the internet, we would not know.  Prayers yes, for a good outcome.  Someone there has to care. Please.

              The powers that be use all walks of life to do their dirty deeds . Imagine all the “ nobody’s “ they have blackmailed ? 😮 just like the guy who said voodoo donuts owners are pedo satinist yesterday. He said it’s not all big names . He was abused by some nonamers that were getting paid by upper people . We have no idea what type of people are actually planted in rural areas !

               Exactly.  If they are working like mad to corrupt as many of Our Children as they can, they will have an army out there to poison as many as possible, as quickly as they can.  When I first saw those donuts I knew right away.  pe-donuts.  It someone has a pic of those donuts please post.  OMG.  LOOK.  They have three locations in Portland  now and this bit of Big News.

             I had the same thought, the shoes always click for me right away.  Strange vibes is what I got too when first reading it.

             The sheer disregard for any food or necessities is what bothered me.  I guess people that are selling children are pretty low so I should not be surprised, but really, it was the very bare minimum.  What also worries me is that they were turned over to CPS.  Hopefully this will not be one of those frying pan into the fire situations. And that little 3 yr. old boy............

             He was the son of the apparent ring leader. Not that these people are all that loyal to their own children, but my first thought is the boy has died. He has a siezure disorder and takes medications. I don't see dad of the year here providing the care and meds this kid needed. Living in those hot and filthy conditions probably makes it even worse for the little guy. I hope they find him well, but I'm so worried this will not turn out well.

              Unfortunately like you, I don't hold out too much hope for good news.  Not from the looks of that place.  Where did all those kids come from though?  Both of those men have former charges. which does not bode well for this whole situation.  CPS, another problem. Yes, let's hope the best for that little tyke.
