<p>Interesting article exploring the links between Scientology and the Intelligence community in the US and possibly in Russia. Is Scientology a real religion or cult? I think not. Nobody could seriously believe the stuff they supposedly believe. I\'ve never talked to a Scientologist who actually talked about what it is they believe... they just say it\'s &quot;changed their lives so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: if you\'ve ever been inside a Scientology building, you were definitely recorded the entire time.</p>
<p>Fascinating stuff</p>
<p>Beware Lord Xenu</p>
<p>P.S. Look around at the faces of the Scientologists you know and ask yourself, does this person bear a resemblance to the Satanic spawn love child of L. Ron and one of his love slaves? </p>
<p>P.S. Has anyone seen that scene in Deadpool where they are near some foster home center that they\'ve been talking about being a bad place and the guy running it runs outside the building and they say, &quot;Wow, he even runs like a pervert. He runs like a sex offender who just lost his laptop.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I had the scene to show you, my husband showed it to me yesterday.</p>',

            Standard practice. Scientology is not supposed to tell you what to believe, instead it is supposed to show you how to grow as a spiritual being so that you reach enlightenment on your own terms. In theory, anyway- that philosophy breaks down in the higher levels.

            That aliens seeded this planet with criminals and individualists is to me no crazier an idea than that god sacrificed his "only begotten son" to forgive us of our sins, which he created us to have in the first place. To be clear, I believe neither. That aside, that stuff is from the higher levels, 90%+ of Scientologists never got that high.

            It is definitely a real religion, from the perspective of the normal people engaging in its practice across the world. Perhaps the celebrities and the higher executives have some ties to intel or the satanists, but there are tens (if not hundreds, still) of thousands of normal people who pursue Scientology study earnestly.

            Not true. I was on staff for a few years, did night watch many times, we had normal security cameras for entrances and parking lot, etc, but no cameras in peoples offices or indoors besides the reception area. If you never left the reception area, then yeah, you were recorded "the whole time"- in the same way when you're in line at McDonalds you're recorded the whole time.

            There are several million people worldwide that are active or ex-scientologist... LRH must have been pretty impressive in the sack to have sired that many offspring.

               OK, well the truth is that you remind me of my friend Marla with the line about how your religion is no crazier than other religions. Sounds like a script to me. Since I hear the same phrases from every Scientologist I've ever known, and that's quite a few prominent ones anyhow.

                Please explain to me how the creator of the universe sending his "only begotten son" to earth as a mortal and then having that son be unfairly put to death by corrupt government and traitorous friends would result in salvation for those who accept that son into their hearts and never that sacrifice, where before and otherwise it meant damnation. I'm not saying the wacky concepts of Scientology make AS MUCH sense as any other religion, I'm saying they all make no sense. It's not a script, and I'm not defending Scientology. Bluntly, LRH was a drugged up demented old man when he dreamed up that stuff.

I'm not here to defend Scientology, it's only ever come up a couple of times, and when it does I chime in with what my experiences have been. I would assume that'd be valuable to anyone who wants to know the truth.

                 Many Scilontologists use the "you're just like Hitler" argument against people who are against their religion. I've heard it dozens of times.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The sacrifice made by Jesus Christ makes a lot more sense than Lord Xenu. In any justice system people have to pay for their crimes, and God wanted us to have a path to follow that would allow us to be with him. Salvation is a free gift and it is by grace through faith, not by works, lest any man should boast. No man comes to the Father but through Jesus Christ. If you're here to defend Scientology and waste time, it makes perfect sense that you don't see Christianity as logical, and you're probably a reprobate who rejects God.

                 Scientologists masquerade as normal good people, but wisdom and facts show us that that is not true. Spies, liars and real deplorables. You don't have to live in denial of the Satanic practices of L Ron and how your "religion" is a glorified crazy cover for intelligence ops. And that you rape your Russian slaves and Ukranian slaves and then take them down to the Clearwater abortion clinic on the regular. Or L.A., or whatevs. Say hi to Doyle for me.

                  So well hidden that no on in the religion all the way up to executive levels has any clue that's happening, and pursues spreading the religion honestly believing it will help others the way it helped them. Weird psy-op, gotta say.

                  You're barking up the wrong tree man. Honestly. Go investigate the actual satanists, the ones who aren't even hiding it, and if they repeatedly lead back to Scientology you'll have something. Going after the Scientologists first will not lead you to the satanists, because if there is a connection it is so small that you'll get way too many dead ends.

                   I'm not sure where you get off alluding to accusations that I'm James Alefantis, when if you look through my profile, you'll be able to easily figure out who I am. But I guess when you get ants in your pants because you want to debate why you reject Christianity as your excuse for why Scientology (that you claim you're not a part of) is not "crazy." BYE FELICIA. This post was about Scientology being a fake religion that's a cover for intelligence ops, and not a post about Christianity, and I'm not James Alefantis.

                      I never believed in Xenu, nor have 95% of Scientologists. That was an OT4 thing, and very few people got that high. I know it's hard for your to believe, but you're actually very uninformed about Scientology.

                       I never chose to join your fake religion, so I am not sure what OT4 is, but my ex friend Rick from Operation Snow White knows something about it, so maybe I should call up his wife Carla and ask.  I think I'll rename it Operation Snowflake since you're so offended I said your fake religion is a cover for intelligence ops. I'm actually extremely informed about Scientology as they are about me. Have a nice life.

                        OT4 is higher level nonsense. You should've figured that out from the context of what I said earlier. Or, you know, you could go do some basic research on the religion you claim to know so much about.

            Gunderson, back in 96, said as much. That Scientology has the 'tools' that even outmatch the CIA or something to that effect. My theory on a sumbag like Paul Haggis is that he used Scientolgy goons as long as he could then he switched over to be a 'Company' asset.

            Spook operation for sure, most cults are. A document credited David Miscavige as a CIA source, and LRH said his father was in the CIA. The entire things is the dark occult system anyhow.

            Can’t post link am on phone. Article says L Ron worked for ONI in WWll and never was in combat. He censored letters of servicemen. Also the emblem of the US Intel Comm. Is an 8 point star just as the Scientology Cross. There are other similarities. This article also says who knows who is controlling who but it implies they are connected.

             I believe this. It is demonstrably true, at least at the core. The periphery is perhaps just garden variety sleaze and decadence.

               OKM Rover C II Metal Detectors Dealer India   These type of products do that, if you got the cash. The cave detector is a software application. No, I am not promoting that brand. I just pasted that because they said it was affordable, whatever that means.

                 I was actually looking at the 30,000$ to 75,000$ models a couple years back. You probably would not want to splice a wire to your transportation/generator as to not void warranty on the more expensive versions. Who else but the government and treasure hunters would know they exist? Like any tool it could be invaluable at the right time in the right hands. Find that nuclear bunker from the 50's, and start your own real estate business.

                   I almost bought an apple 2 at a garage sale the other day, not because it was better than my rig, but it is a collectors item. When purchasing electronics it pays to do your research, or pay someone with knowledge to help just like any major purchase. Tesla is a front company. Probably for something not good.
