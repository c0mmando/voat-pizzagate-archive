<h2><strong>There can\'t be any doubt now that dead foetuses and baby skin are used in Satanic / black magic rituals.</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>British Film maker CHRIS EVERARD has been investigating the trafficking of human baby parts by various cults and black magic covens.</strong></p>
<p>Two of the film producers of the BUM FIGHT tv series have been accused of trafficking human baby parts, human skin and a stabbed adult human heart. </p>
<p>The producers attempted to ship three DHL consignments to various addresses in the USA.</p>
<p>The grisly DHL consignments were discovered in Bangkok, Thailand. The DHL parcels are said to have contained a baby’s skull, a sheet of skin and baby’s feet sealed in bags and boxed for shipping, according to CNN News on Nov. 16.</p>
<p>The Hampstead Children claimed that a British Police Officer called ‘Sarah’ with ‘red rosy cheeks’ was a member of the Hampstead cult. The children said that there was a massive cover-up… The Police were, they alleged, protecting the cult. The children named the courier “DHL’ specifically in their video testimonial.</p>
<p>Some reports said there was an adult human heart in one of the DHL boxes which had been addressed to Las Vegas– a stabbed heart can only mean one thing – this was a MURDER – it also has connotations to BLACK MAGIC SATANIC RITUAL SACRIFICE. </p>
<p>According to Thai police one of the boxes contained pieces of HUMAN skin.</p>
<p>Yet again, this confirms what the Hampstead children alleged – they said that cult members removed sheets of skin from the slain babies, and this skin was used to adorn ritual shoes, rather like HUMAN LEATHER.</p>
<p><strong>Back in 2012, we see yet more signs of an international Satanic Cult shipping babies</strong> – this time the premature babies had been ROASTED. </p>
<p><strong>In 2012 Thai authorities announced that a British citizen was arrested for trying to ship six roasted foetuses covered in gold leaf…</strong></p>
<p>In some Thai cults, preserved foetuses are believed to give the owners good fortune or protection from evil.</p>
<p>The British citizen was arrested after a tip-off that infant bodies were being sold through a website offering black magic service.</p>
<p><strong>!!! The man did indeed confess to police that he was part of a SATANIC CULT who medically removed the unborn children, sacrificed them, covered them in gold leaf and shipped them worldwide to Black Magic cults. Black magic incantations were said over the body, as the unborn baby died.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly the roasting of babies, the online international trade, the large sums of money being paid by cult members for dead babies and the Oriental connection ALL CORROBORATE THE TESTIMONIES GIVEN TO POLICE by the children of Ella Draper.</p>

<h2><strong>Is this French case a further proof that Satanists acquire foetuses and baby remains in order to use them for rituals?</strong></h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, in November 2018 firefighters found <strong>two foetuses preserved in formalin-filled jars, a mummified infant and the cadaver of a piglet in the apartment of a 35-year old art gallery owner and tattoo artist</strong>, in Reuilly Diderot, XIIth district in Paris (France). </p>
<p><strong>The flat was also decorated with Satanic</strong> and sado-maso <strong>paraphernalia.</strong> They also found a tattooed arm under a glass bell hung on to a wall, and a series of 40 slides depicting autopsy scenes. </p>
<p>They were not able to locate the man. The name of the art gallery was not mentioned in police reports.</p>
<p>His ex-partner had called the police because she hadn\'t been able to contact him for a while. According to her, he has problems with substance abuse. A source said that he has a history of mental health problems. </p>
<p>The human remains were brought to a forensic institute (IML) for examination. The Public Attorney\'s Office was informed.</p>
<p>Police said they would consider all possibilities regarding the provenience of the human remains, and didn\'t rule out that they might have been obtained from a medical museum collection. </p>

The selection committee most recently honored William Goldring with the 2010 award for his work as president of the Goldring Family Foundation and the Woldenberg Foundation.

              Oh! What a spectacle to behold. The Ogden Museum of Southern Art hosted a mammoth of a gala to celebrate William “Bill” A. Goldring with its Opus Award, a distinction to honor an activist in art and culture.
             </p>
             <p>
              Notable attendees included: John Goodman, Helen Miren, Bryan Cranston, C.K. Swett of Heritage Auctions who served as auctioneer, Mayor Mitch Landrieu, Councilmember LaToya Cantrell, artists John Alexander and Bill Dunlap, and Board Members Roger Ogden, Gregory Holt, Dathel Coleman and Fran Villere, and Board Chair Allison Kendrick.
             </p>
             <p>
              The evening began in the museum’s Patrick F. Taylor Library with a patron party catered by chef Justin Devillier from Le Petite Grocery and a silent auction including more than 50 works by southern artists. Partygoers proceeded into a tent adjacent to the museum for the seated gala dinner prepared by chef Donald Link and chef de cuisine Rebecca Wilcomb. The program, emceed by Bryan Batt, included a live auction featuring a plethora of precious artwork and a 1989 Mazda Miata that was a gift from Steven Spielberg to John Goodman for his performance in the film Always. An impressive total of 35 musicians entertained guests throughout the evening.

             28-year-old Chow Hok Kuen soon admitted to buying the small bodies for a touch more than $6,000, intending to resell them in Taiwan as good luck charms for at least six times the purchase price. There was only a brief media buzz about this grisly find, but these kuman thong (กุมารทอง, Thai for “golden boy”) have a strange and persistent history in Thailand.

            The folklore story is grisly. 
Here's a recap version:
            <em>
             Kuman Thong were famously mentioned in The Tale of Khun Chang Khun Phaen folklore, set in the late 1500s. In the story, Khun Phaen made an amulet out of his child’s foetus by performing a black magic ritual. The unborn child then became a ghost called Kuman Thong, or “golden boy”. The folklore said Khun Phaen used the Kuman Thong for his protection on the battlefield.
            </em>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But now it's a profitable occult practice.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Despite the fictional origins, belief in kuman thong took root in southern Thailand, with widespread belief that these protective ghost children could warn against any dangers that threatened a household. Ancient manuscripts detailed additional steps on how to make kuman thong, such as requiring the ritual to be completed before dawn in a cemetery and painting the dry-roasted baby with lacquer before applying gold leaf.
            </p>
            <p>
             While there are Thai laws against using human-derived products for consecrating kuman thong, occasional stories of more “authentic” charms (like the 2012 discovery) still arise, giving glimpses into the extent of the underground markets for these disturbing artifacts. In another high-profile case in 1995, a Buddhist novice named Samanen Han Raksachit was arrested after a video surfaced of him piercing, bleeding, roasting, chanting, and collecting the meaty drippings of a baby at Wat Nong Rakam in Saraburi province. He had been selling the fatty liquid as ya sane (“lust medicine”) to monastery visitors.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Other reported cases of kuman thong:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             People buying fetal corpses from illegal abortion clinics.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In June 2010, 14 dead babies were uncovered in an abandoned rural home in Ubon Ratchathani province, and a former nurse was charged with illicitly selling the corpses for $30.
Later that year in November, 348 aborted fetuses were found wrapped in putrid plastic bags at a Buddhist monastery at Wat Phai Ngoen, in the heart of Bangkok. They had been bought from five different illegal abortion clinics with the goal of sale to magicians and amulet dealers. Once the news broke, hundreds of people swarmed the monastery to chant for the deceased fetuses, and some even asked whether the corpses would be made available for ritual use.

            <p>
             Mark A. Weinberger is an American businessman. He is the global Chairman and CEO of EY, formerly known as Ernst &amp; Young.[1][2] Weinberger has also held several posts in the public sector in Washington, D.C., including time as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. On December 3rd, 2018, it was announced that Weinberger will step down as EY Global Chairman and CEO effective July 1st, 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
             In late 2000 and early 2001, two U.S. presidents tapped Weinberger to return to the public sector. In 2000, President Bill Clinton appointed Weinberger to the Social Security Advisory Board.[9] Weinberger left EY's national tax department in February 2001 to serve as President George W. Bush's Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy.[9][10] Weinberger returned to EY from the United States Treasury Department in April 2002

               34-year-old Sebastien B. could be an IT personnel, but he has a history of skills in chemistry and a great liking for drugs. He probably supplied the precursor required for the initial processing of the fentanyl drug from China on dark web, according to the preliminary investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Investigation shows that
               <strong>
                Gabriel M.
               </strong>
               , a friend of Sebastian who deals with the drug, survived a fentanyl overdose. Gabriel stocks and promotes an art gallery. He is a long time resident of the 12th arrondissement. But he was arrested on Monday when he was already set to start selling, and fetuses of unborn babies were discovered at his home. His habit is associated with satanic piety.

                 The police are familiar with this thirty-year-old computer scientist and chemistry graduate. He has already been sentenced in 2012 for drug trafficking. Nailed, then released from prison. At the time he had tried to make fentanyl himself. In very small quantities. But this time, the merchandise is of a different nature. Several thousand doses would have been made. Mistrust is therefore appropriate when the bloodhounds of the narcotics brigade intervene on November 20 at his home. They wear protective suits, masks, glasses, gloves ... Above all, they are accompanied by a doctor who holds in his briefcase a valuable antidote to administer to agents in case of contamination. Because the product is extremely volatile, powerful, and dangerous.

                I found another profile under the name Sebastien Becot for a different Bluestone.  Just check out the logo:

              Not sure but this article says it was in the 6th Arrondissement of Paris. I guess that narrows it down a little.

            The Hampstead children also mentioned TNT which is the same company that acquired Fedex in 2016. The shipping company rabbit hole goes deep into hell.

             Thank you. TNT had a warehouse in Essex which was involved in a huge fire about a year ago :

              Huge fire at UK warehouse park last night, Ferndearle Child Care Services fraud case and possible MI5/6 connections. Let's take a look.

              Actually, one of the founders of DHL, Larry Hillblom, was a pedophile, who used the transport facilities for shipping children it seems.
