            What's questionable or inaccurate about this post?  The it does not really exist?   That it is just a joke?  That they don't serve flesh?  I don't understand.    EDIT:  From their Cuisine:   Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite regularly updates our menu with new and daring culinary experiments. The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers. Each dish, therefore, is a study in taste and elegance.

                As I posted i the comments on their menu is Placenta Lasagna.  What more proof do we need.  It does not say it is a fake placenta or made up to be one, it just says placenta.  Yuck.  I can def see the 4 of them eating it.  Chelsea wears an upside down cross and Katy well her Spirit Cooking Album says it all.

What do Katy Perry, Meryl Streep, Anderson Cooper and Chelsea Clinton have in common? They have all eaten human flesh at LA’s notorious cannibal restaurant, Cannibal Club.
The private restaurant has long operated under the radar in Los Angeles, with rumors circulating about who has attended and what is really served behind closed doors. Now a leaked Cannibal Club document has exposed some of the notorious restaurant’s “elite” patrons.
CANNIBALISM ‘MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT THINK’
Meryl Streep, Chelsea Clinton and CNN’s Anderson Cooper all hold Cannibal Club membership, according to the document. Katy Perry, who has previously said that “Cannibalism is way more popular than you might think” and “human flesh is the best meat“, is also a regular diner.
Boasting that the restaurant is the “cutting edge of experimental cuisine” and serves “L.A.’s cultural elite“, the Cannibal Club website makes clear they “specialize in the preparation of human meat” that comes from “young and healthy bodies.“
Cannibal Club’s visiting chefs “hail from around the world” and come to L.A. to “practice their craft free of compromise and unbounded by convention,” according to the Cannibal Club website.
‘FILMMAKERS, INTELLECTUALS, AND CELEBRITIES’
“Our exclusive clientele includes noted filmmakers, intellectuals, and celebrities who have embraced the Enlightenment ideals of free expression and rationalism. On event nights, avant-garde performance artists, celebrated literary figures, and ground-breaking musicians entertain our guests.
“At Cannibal Club, we celebrate artistic excellence as the natural and inevitable expression of the unbridled human spirit.“
Describing each dish as a “study in taste and elegance“, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite explains: “The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers.”
But don’t think you can just walk in there and check the place out. The private restaurant operates a strict vetting policy, according to the website:
“It is necessary for us to operate privately and to vette our members in order to avoid disruption from the less enlightened.“
HUMAN MEAT MENU
The current menu listed on the site includes Sirloin Steak (human meat, flame-broiled 8oz), Liver and Mushroom Pirozhi (“a Russian version of pierogies, baked rather than boiled, with a savory filling of wild mushrooms and human liver“) and Placenta Lasagne (“an otherwise traditional lasagna with one layer of cheese substituted by minced placenta in heirloom tomato sauce, seasoned with garlic, onion and oregano”.)
Elspeth Blake, the Cannibal Club proprietor who claims to have earned her stripes working under Vincent Sardi Jr. in New York, did not immediately respond to our questions regarding where the human flesh comes from.
‘YOUNG AND HEALTHY BODIES’
In the FAQ section of the website, Cannibal Club claims:
“Most of the businesses and institutions who supply us prefer to keep those relationships discreet. On the individual level, bodies are often bequeathed to us. For some, this is a way to supplement life insurance and offset funerary expenses. For others, such as Cannibal Club member Gwendoline Fenwich, who was served to her friends and relatives at the Club in January of 2008, being prepared as a meal, and thereby reborn into the bodies of the living, is an attractive alternative to the more the traditional practices of burial and cremation.“
The revelation that Hollywood royalty, pop stars and cable TV anchors consume human flesh when they are in Los Angeles is merely the latest example of public figures being exposed as dark figures, reveling in the darkness.  Jay-Z described Jesus Christ as “the original fake news“ late in 2017. Miley Cyrus said “Hail Satan” on live radio and claimed she has a closer relationship with the devil than with her “earthly father”, Billy Ray. Rihanna was caught telling children in Barbados that “if Jesus hasn’t answered your prayers, try praying to Satan.”
Just last week, Chelsea Clinton told her Twitter followers that Satanism is a “religion” that deserves “respect.”
These incidents have sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of their masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.

              sorry for the confusion, i didn't mean to imply that CC was totally fake, just that it was 'questionable.' i think we may have been seeing it from two slightly different angles. i should have clarified that i was referring mainly to the
              <em>
               website
              </em>
              being questionable, not necessarily the business itself (to my eyes, the website looks fake af, as does the article from earlier this year that
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/cc1914">
               @cc1914
              </a>
              posted).
             </p>
             <p>
              but that being said, i certainly didn't want
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/cc1914">
               @cc1914
              </a>
              to delete it!  we definitely need to keep looking into this shit, but i wish we had more evidence that it exists (and is in operation doing what they advertise) other than a business registration and a crappy website...
             </p>
             <p>
              my apologies if you guys think it was an

               unfair flair
              </em>
              .  i'm new at this and just trying my best to implement the rules as written.

               I guess we are all learning and this is mind blowing. Following the rules is what works best I appreciate everyone here, no worries. I just can not fathom, how anyone could register a name like cannibal in their business, that in itself is sick and evil.

               Im not saying you shouldn't question something at all .. but to just come in and say " this was debunked a year ago I think " makes it sound like it was in fact debunked and it wasn't . your account is new and we too have to question when people say things are debunked , wether there's a question mark there or not . There have been lots of shills here as your probably aware . I'm sorry if I sound skeptical of your intentions, I personally have never read any of your comments and this is the first time I've seen your name . This is something that needs further investigating , not because I want this to be true , I pray it isn't , but fear it is True !

                Don't delete a post because someone questions it. The only reason i posted it was because i read that a while ago and was asking if it had been debunked. I am interested to see what you guys dig up. I found about 50/50 for and against on the net and i am in the UK so can't exactly do footwork or phone them.

                  I should introduce myself, i am a csa survivor who was abused whilst in case with the local authorities fully aware what was going on. I found others like myself on Twitter along with some high profile MP\government abuse victims. "Nick" who was recently in the news as a liar who had accused alot of MPs of abuse or should i say he was made out to be a liar but many people believe his truth. He was the inspiration for the wall of silence which is a travelling visual display of abuse victims, alive and dead, to raise awareness to the general public.  My picture is included in that display and whilst trying to give others support on their journey of healing i discovered pizzagate and found my way here where i had no bloody clue all this was going on but thank god i know now. I am grateful for that red pill and the work you guys do.

                   Wow ! And thank you for sharing 😔 This is how a lot of us landed here . Has nothing to do with politics , but the 2016 election is what shed light on these nefarious activities that have been going on for a very long time . I too am a survivor and this has helped me in my journey to a long needed recovery . All though I have no memory of my abuse being linked to anything but a few dirty old men , I think it's ALL SATANIC and a well known practice among the few " knowing " ! It ruins childhoods and carries on to adulthood ! There are very few that come out of this and none that come out unharmed IMO

              Ikr! And if look back to historical links of cannibalism, there's the common opinion that younger flesh is "better". Beyond vile &amp; evil to surmise, but you know these people must have networks of sources within the funeral homes &amp; abortion clinics. Think of the well-known phrase: Money is the root of all evil. It is indeed connected to machine every single thing that is of the devil, created on this earth. 
If this doesn't compel you to fall on your knees in prayer to God, I don't know what will.

             ah, i remember that post now!  staff listing definitely appears fake at first glance (but hell, who the heck would publicly display their own name/photo on a site like this?)

               Well it wasn't deleted over a year ago now it's flaired as questionable. This is something we as PG researchers have been trying to connect to the Elite for quite some time .. hence spirit cooking and all

            it would be great if you could directly link the cannibal club (wait... what does the 'Cc' in your handle stand for?? lol) to Marina Abramović (or, better yet, the Podestas).  shouldn't be too difficult to do considering they all travel in the same sick circles (of hell)..

            Collaborating with visiting cooks from around the world, Chef de Cuisine Sophie Laffite regularly updates our menu with new and daring culinary experiments. The meat we serve is selected from the young and healthy. Consistent with the practice of cannibalism in many primitive societies, we view anthropophagy as homage to the dead, who are reborn into the bodies of their consumers. Each dish, therefore, is a study in taste and elegance.
