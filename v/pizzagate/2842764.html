<p>AND WHO IS ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI?</p>
<p>&quot;Born c. 1181–1226
St. Francis of Assisi abandoned a life of luxury for a life devoted to Christianity after reportedly hearing the voice of God, who commanded him to rebuild the Christian church and live in poverty. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;St. Francis of Assisi was renowned for drinking and partying in his youth. After fighting in a battle between Assisi and Perugia, Francis was captured and imprisoned for ransom. He spent nearly a year in prison — awaiting his father\'s payment — and, according to legend, began receiving visions from God. After his release from prison, Francis heard the voice of Christ, who told him to repair the Christian Church and live a life of poverty. Consequently, he abandoned his life of luxury and became a devotee of the faith, his reputation spreading all over the Christian world. &quot;

<p>Nancy has accumulated $100 MILLION while in office. RICH, just like Francis! BUT FRANCIS GAVE IT ALL AWAY! Just think how many CHILDREN could be saved if she kept poor families out of poverty so they wouldn\'t pimp their children for money!

           <p>
            If she said she was 'born again' that's what happens when they're inducted into Satanism: they are 're-born'. George Bush also said he was born again.

             All research is speculative. One begins with facts that appear to cluster into a pattern. This leads researchers to speculate on an explanation that fits the PATTERN. THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF VOAT PIZZAGATE research.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nancy has previously been the topic of VOAT SPECULATION regarding factual evidence pointing to a link with her and a pizza restaurant named GOAT HILL PIZZA. One of the owners worked for Nancy. "This official document CERTIFIED LIST OF ELECTED CANDIDATES FOR THE NOVEMBER 2, 2004 GENERAL ELECTION from a government website shows that Pelosi used
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="59091110151009191e16180d11101515771a1614" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
              [email protected]
             </a>
             as her official email. Her official headquarters seems to also be in the same area of the pizza parlor. "
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442209
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Posters speculated that it could be a campaign money laundering operation front  and/or a front for pedo activity.
THIS POST WAS NOT GIVEN A 24 HOUR FLAIR!  I watched a current interview of Nancy and pointed out her verbal linking of her approval and support of SAINT FRANCES OF ASSISI, a born-again Christian reformer who took a vow of poverty. This seemed inconsistent with her past behavior. VOAT/PIZZAGATE continuously references the SPIRITUAL REALM and acknowledges DEMONIC ACTIVITY and SATANISM  as being a motivator for satanic ritual abuse of children. If Nancy has truly spiritually flipped, this is important research. If she becomes Speaker of the House,  she could have influence over putting an end to child trafficking and punishing those who participate. Even if she is lying about her sincerity, it is important information that she would associate herself with a highly revered Christian.

            Catholic is false and cannot save because it teaches a false gospel of works.  And catholicism is fact at the top of the pizzagate control grid.  The jesuits/vatican control it.  "St. Francis" was unbiblical nonsense.  A true saved person believes in Jesus for eternal life, without adding any of their own works (Romans 4:5).  James 2 isn't about heaven and hell, by the way.  Believing in Jesus means going to heaven and not hell, because Jesus, who is God, died on the cross to pay for all of our sins in full, and then Jesus resurrected from the dead.
           </p>

            Pelosi isn't saying any of this, so she is still part of the system that makes pizzagate happen.

             Just like Francis, Nancy appears to have been caught in the "love of money" trap. We need to pray that God would expose Satan's temptations and FREE HER FROM THIS SIN. Let's pray specifically about GOAT HILL PIZZA:

             She identified with St. Francis of Assisi and his values. St. Francis gave up the world's goods for the RICHES OF CHRIST. Look at Frances' SINFUL LIFE ( could well have included children) before conversion. PELOSI is probably NO WORSE. Saul had Christians MURDERED. When he became PAUL, he died for the followers of Christ. I am presenting you with a different kind of warfare. Unrepentant sinners are doomed already. The ultimate victory IS TO SNATCH THEM OUT OF THE JAWS OF SATAN. Whether she was sincere or not, IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT SHE SPOKE THEM. The True War is waged on our knees. If we don't fight DIFFERENTLY, we become JUST LIKE THEM.

             Evidently, Nancy quoted this prayer attributed to St. Francis (although "it cannot be traced farther back than 1912") "after becoming Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2007."

            <p>
             To be understood, as to understand;

             To be loved, as to love.

            <p>
             For it is in giving that we receive.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,

             And it is in dying that we are born to Eternal Life.

              Coming from the very mouths of Thatcher, B Clinton and Pelosi those words are turned into blasphemy.  They have no right to utter such words.  They mean nothing after what they have wrought upon this world.  What Bleeping Lies. The devil was and is their god.

              Pelosi would find some way to turn it around so the tables would be turned.  She is a flim flam artist.  Her father taught her well.  He was supported by the mob when he was mayor; Thomas  D'Alesandro,  Trump should call her bluff and bring him up.  I want to see her face.

               I have heard that. Do you have any documented evidence that this is true? If so, she would be like Chelsea, didn't have a choice as a child.

              With a forked tongue. Out of the side of her mouth; With a lot of words with long gaps of silence inserted; Like a deer in the headlights. I’m not being dismissive. Pelosi has had decades of practice in lying, evasion, and side-stepping. Yet, she wins elections. smh

                Great that you are taking sides with EsotericShade, pby1000. Not. After you have read what he has done here, and has done to other users. I

                  Calling out someone that did Voat brigading, which isn't allowed here, and groomed female users, and hurt them in the process is hardly 'immature'. When you look for some well known female users who are not here anymore, you can thank him for that.

                    We can't ban him for that. We can ban only for doxxing, posting child porn or perisistently not adhering to the submission rules.

                    . I am aware that users not familiar with what he did, or those who used to regard him as a legit user might be irritated, also new users. But we had to warn people. We didn't even put everything he did on the public thread in order to protect some of his victims.

                    Well, and this is why you are different. He has systematically groomed female users, in order to manipulate them, and has hurt them in the process (and please note, I am

                It 's hard to know which came first.  The change in the subject matter may have frustrated some.  We don't work on researching shipping containers or traffickers using docks and cos.  that are involved in it.  All that has gone POOF.  Totally disappeared.
