<p>We already know how many child organizations have pedophilic symbols, and now this one coincidentally has a pentagram, and it is part of the Clinton Foundation. </p>
<p>Also, Lisa ling is an investigative reporter who has covered Human Trafficking and also had an investigative report called &quot;3 am girls&quot;, which covered underage prostitutes in DC. Is she the most clueless and coincidentally clumsy human trafficking investigative reporter who inadvertently is part of an organization that is suspected to be farming children for elites in DC and possible elsewhere? Or is she a legitimate suspect to be looked at?</p>',
