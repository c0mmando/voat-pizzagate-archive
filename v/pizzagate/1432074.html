<p>It\'s an amazing work of writing that needs to be preserved for posterity, and details the mind set we all need to be using in this investigation. I highly recommend giving it a read through if you haven\'t seen it before. I\'ll leave the preface here for the casual reader. It starts with two quotes and an introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible  government  owing  no  allegiance  and  acknowledging
no  responsibility  to  the  people.   To  destroy  this  invisible
government, to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt
business and corrupt politics is the first task of statesman-
ship.&quot; -(President Theodore Roosevelt)</em>*</p>
<p><em>&quot;While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.&quot; -(The Tempest; Ariel at II, i)</em>*</p>
<p><strong><strong>Introduction</strong></strong>:
To radically shift regime behavior we must think clearly and boldly for if we
have learned anything, it is that regimes do not want to be changed. We must
think beyond those who have gone before us, and discover technological changes
that embolden us with ways to act in which our forebears could not.
Firstly we must understand what aspect of government or neocorporatist
behavior we wish to change or remove.  Secondly we must develop a way of
thinking about this behavior that is strong enough carry us through the mire of
politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity. Finally must use
these insights to inspire within us and others a course of ennobling, and effective action.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s incredibly pertinent in trying to attain Julian Assange\'s perspective. It\'s also a piece of writing I\'ve been looking for, for ages. I hope you guys enjoy it and find the same value I did. </p>
<p>That said, I\'ve been going over some tweet\'s I haven\'t looked at in a few weeks and have found some interesting stuff. There\'s a plethora of information, and no shortage of odd circumstances surrounding the tweets. So I think we should all be periodically looking through them to see if we can spot anything overlooked the first few times.</p>

              First thing that came to mind when you said "fresh pair of eyes" and mentioned the Haiti connection was this summary of points that FBIAnon supposedly raised over the past few months, so it's a shorthand list of things I'm on the lookout for.  The pizzeria seems like a small (yet potentially important) part of the broader conspiracy that JA, Wikileaks and others are trying to unravel.  Thanks for pointing to JA's essays which I wasn't aware of.
