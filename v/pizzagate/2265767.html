            And another one of George Webb's research landmines is stepped on. Truth bombs by Mr. Sweigart... placed carefully 6-9 months in advance. He was all over McAuliffe and the Pay to Play green card scams for months and months. This relates to the Awan's and their business entities as well.

            The last paragraph tells us that Terry McAuliffe wants to run for president in 2020...oh come on!  He was terrible head of the DNC because he was actually working for Hillary. But she wasn't running for 4 more years. So Mcaulliffe didn't do s*** for John Kerry and spent a bunch of his money introducing Obama at John Kerry's convention in 2004. It was a disgusting act and everyone was pissed. They all stood down in 2004, for her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terry McAuliffe is nothing more than Hillary's conductor of corruption. He should never be our president.

            Terry Mcauliffe is a former head of the DNC.  Such a tight circle of Clinton friends.

            The scam as I see it is that their investment in the US in return for citizenship didn't happen. It got swiped. Canada has the same deal.  Put in half a million for five years and you can get citizenship, even if your too old to qualify otherwise.  Being over 45 without a medical degree or similiar is a no no for entering.  Having the 1/2 million to spare is the only ticket in after that age.  The US may be the same way, I don't know the age cut offs.  Canada doesn't want more old folks on the medical system.  No big deal in the US medical mess.

            These two are a piece of work.  These laws were probably created and passed in order to allow for this very payoff.  Aw, poor baby, being Hillary's brother is so hard.  Yeah it is hard to surpass all the rotten criminal operations she has wielded and committed.  Also Terry, is not he the one that donated a pile of money to McCabe's wife for her political run.  Payoff for something else, imo.  Good news, She Lost.

            But it's not illegal.   The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program is legal, Congress passed this law in 1990.  Enticing foreigners to invest in the US in the hopes of getting a green card is literally what this law is intended to do.

            If they lied to investors or misled them, they might be guilty of fraud, but it's completely legal to let people know about a government program that could benefiit them.

             The EB-5 visa, employment-based fifth preference category[1] or EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program, created in 1990 by the Immigration Act of 1990, provides a method for eligible Immigrant Investors to become lawful permanent residents — informally known as "green card" holders — by investing at least $1,000,000 to finance a business in the United States that will employ at least 10 American workers."[2] Most immigrant investors who use the EB-5 program invest in a targeted employment area (TEA)[3]:8 — a rural area or area with high unemployment — which lowers the investment threshold to $500,000.[4] The EB-5 program is intended to encourage both "foreign investments and economic growth."[5] The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program is one of five employment-based (EB) preference programs in the United States.[6]:4

            The Kushner family was doing this same thing. However they "guaranteed" visas to their investors which would be a violation and have been subpoenaed.  If McCauliffe went this far, he could also be in trouble.

             Kushners gonna do what they do. I have best friends that are  HIBC or whatever it's called. 500,+++, and asking for 30 more investors? You just deflected total fraud allegations into Trump was involved somehow. You play by the rules, you are OK. This story is different, and you are bringing partisan politics into an anti-pedophile forum. Sad for America.

              No. I didn't.    First off,  I never mentioned Trump.  Secondly I was making a distinction.  There's nothing wrong with the program itself or promoting the program, that's completely legal.  But you can still have done something illegal in relation to the program.  The Kushner family is being investigated by the US Attorney in NY over it

               By saying it is legal you have accidentally stepped into my realm. What you are referring to is legal VS. lawful. You also said that it had nothing to do with Trump and ended with Pizzagate started with Donald. B.S. Give it up you Pedofreak. This is where pedophiles die.

                And how does that apply in this case?   Is there anything that is not lawful or not legal about the scenario I gave: promoting a legal visa program open to foreign investors?

                You missed some nuances.  You're lumping together two separate things. The first thing, the nothing to do with Trump thing was my post about the Kushner family.  I never mentioned Trump at all.
               </p>
               <p>
                The next part was about this forum not about the visa program whatsover, it was about the partisan origins of Pizzagate and I didn't say it started with Donald Trump.  I said it started on THEDONALD, a forum of fans of Donald Trump, a highly partisan environment.
