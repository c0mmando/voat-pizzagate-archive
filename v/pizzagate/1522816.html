It started when I decided to look at some of the bands that were playing at Comet Ping Pong. One that was named “Death Valley girls“ seemed like a good start. Sure enough the first thing I watch is littered with satanic references – Their video “Disco“ starts with a picture of the singer with a pentagram on her forehead and is followed by a lot of gore and blood. At the end of this song it states “Directed by Kansas Bowling“. I instantly became curious who that was. Meet Kansas Bowling:
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/gv4yLP.png">https://i.sli.mg/gv4yLP.png</a>
Here she is pictured with Death Valley Girls. They joke about sacrificing her younger sister, Parker Love Bowling. Kansas directed “B.C. Butcher“ when she was 17, Imbd.com describes it as the first slasher film set in prehistoric times. 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3150796/?ref_=nm_knf_i1">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3150796/?ref_=nm_knf_i1</a>
She became very interested in horror films when she was very young, she wrote the script when she was 15. Started watching Kill Bill with her sister when she was 7 and Troma films when she was 12. She contacted Troma with the movie and they loved the idea. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troma_Entertainment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troma_Entertainment</a>
Their most famous film is the trilogy of the “Toxic Avenger“. These films are cheap humour mixed with some pornographic gore. They‘ve also released weird film such as “Blood sucking freaks“ also known as “The incredible torture show“: From wikipedia 
Some of the torture methods depicted fictionally in the film include the use of thumb screws, a skull crushed by a vise, amputation at the wrist by a bone saw, the amputation of fingers by a meat cleaver, electro-shock, suspension, the extraction of teeth, the portrayal of an electric drill through a skull with the brains sucked through a straw, the amputation of feet by a chainsaw, stretching on St. Andrew\'s Cross, caning and subsequent decapitation by guillotine, as well as brainwashing, whipping, darts, and quartering.
Critical reception for the film has been negative.
TV Guide panned the film, awarding it 0 / 4 stars calling the plot &quot;flimsy&quot; and &quot;[an] exercise in total gross-out&quot;.[2] Rob Wrigley from Classic Horror.com stated in his review on the film, &quot;If anything makes it tolerable, it is that it is presented as comedy rather than tragedy.
Scott Weinberg from eFilmCritic.com panned the film stating in his review, &quot;When people use the term \'bottom of the barrel\', they often forget about the UNDERSIDE of the barrel, which is where poorly-made dreck like this belongs. It offers absolutely NOTHING in the way of entertainment, and I think you\'re a cruel little nutcase if you talk someone else into seeing it,&quot; also calling it &quot;The nastiest, filthiest and just about WORST thing you will EVER SEE&quot;.[4]
It is considered to be one of the most controversial films of all time by Filmsite.org.[6]</p>
<p>Here is a recent video they released which is basically just promoting smut. I don‘t know why Youtube doesn‘t flag this video and it is NSFW for sure: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnua1afq1FM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnua1afq1FM</a>
This one too. Since they don‘t have millions like some Hollywood films to advertise, they argue, parading naked women around and putting troma stickers on their tits is a perfectly valid method to get peoples attention. This is a video they posted from their “happening“ NSFW
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC8VEEcf_F0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC8VEEcf_F0</a>
Note how one of the girls asks them to stop filming and says she is uncomfortable with all the cameras on her and how she feels she is degrading herself as a woman. The clip also shows two topless women making out in the middle of the street as a part of their “marketing strategy“
Lloyd Kaufman is one of the founder of Troma entertainment and writer of the Toxic Avenger. He is featured in the video above with his arms around the women with the stickers on their tits. Here is an interview he did with Kansas Bowling about how they met:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HZ-jLoNimg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HZ-jLoNimg</a>
At about 11:00 she starts talking about the time they met after which meeting Lloyd mailed her 1000$ to finish the film. He states “I‘m not sure I knew how young you were at the time“ which just sounds a bit disingenuous. How would he not mind to ask someone like that about her age for an entire meeting about a project like this from a girl who looks and sounds like that? Why does it sounds like he‘s apologizing?
Parker Love Bowling is the little sister of Kansas Bowling. She was on the poster of B.C. Butcher and acted in the movie as well. 
Interview: <a href="http://archive.is/I6MbM">http://archive.is/I6MbM</a>
She is 17 today and was 15 at the time of the movie. You can find it online but I don‘t really recommend it. It‘s not a good film and just feels very off to watch. It starts with a group of cavewomen killing a pregnant woman and eating her featus. 
Kansas and Parker are peculiar cases. Their instagram accounts are full of sexually suggestive content. Pictures and comments that alude to incest, satanism and hebe/ephebophilia are also common. A collection of examples of these images can be found in this album (warning, slightly nsfw) <a href="http://imgur.com/a/iDFdo">http://imgur.com/a/iDFdo</a>

<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/QmErja.png">https://i.sli.mg/QmErja.png</a> They speak about their parents at times but something feels very weird and worrying about their behavior. They talk about their parents on their ig accounts but by the looks of it they don‘t seem to have had a lot of rules in their upbringing. I know I would not have been allowed to watch Kill Bill when I was 7. I want to make clear that I don‘t wish them any harm or harassment and I am not implicating them in any crime. I sincerely hope they have not been abused or are being abused in any way. I simply find this scenario a bit questionable. Parker posted this picture of her and Lloyd Kaufman with “Poof“ written on their forehead with a red marker. I found several interpretations of Poof online and most of them were sexual:
„FOOP
An acronym----Flip Out On Pussy </p>
<p>To really go angrily crazy on your favorite cunt, with the goal being, to empty the contents of your bag with a furious vengence.
After his nightly Foop, he proceeded to do berzerkers on his Fuckin Whore!“
foop
Barbadian for &quot;have sex&quot;.
Man, I want foop she bad doh!
foop
Fooping is a mix between farting and pooping. </p>
<p>Foop is a time when you really feel like you hafta fart, and you think, what the heck? Why not, right? So then you fart and later you check your under pants and there is a &quot;foop&quot; right there. </p>
<p>Fooping can also happen in showers, pools, and many other locations you may feel alone in, but your not, FOOP WILL BE WITH YOU!!!!!!!!
&quot;Aww man, I fooped in my pants again!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;When I was using the bathroom, I found a little foop in my pants....&quot;
foop
the art of fapping while taking a dump. cumming when your poop comes out is magical
foops
When you think a girl would be considered foof but upon closer inspection, discover that she is in fact, twelve years old.
Hey, foof! No, wait, they\'re eleven. Foops! Back off.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/9gPbsN.png">https://i.sli.mg/9gPbsN.png</a></p>
<p>Really? Is that ok? It‘s weird, at least we have to agree on that. They refer to him as „uncle lloydy“<br />
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/4uSG9E.png">https://i.sli.mg/4uSG9E.png</a></p>
<p>Hopefully he is treating them with respect. However, having seen some of the filth he promotes and the way he promoted it with girls with stickers on their tits it doesn‘t fill you with confidence. He should be considered innocent until proven guilty but this still raises some alarm bells.</p>

            I have met Kauffman on several occasions. Every time I have seen him at conventions I attend he is with young women, barely over 18, never over the age of 30. always gave me a weird a vibe. I've stood next to him while waiting for a table in Atlanta. Last time the chick he was with couldn't have been older than 25, likely younger. she was pretty much dressed like a hooker.  He's a short little dude too. Squirrelly and creepy is a good description. This doesn't surprise me.

            I saw it a couple of days ago and hoped for information but she didn't seem to be saying much and emotionally she didn't ring true so I stopped watching.

            Wow, quite a bit a work you have put into this. Being a big Tyrion Lannister/Peter Dinklage fan though, I must point out that is not Peter in the Oingo Boingo video. He was born in 1969 and would have been 12 years old when the video was filmed. The guy in the video is clearly much older than 12.

             This ending was missing, hopefully it answers your question:
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously any connection of any of the individuals highilighted in this piece to any of the people directly involved with pizzagate would be groundbreaking, however this is still a part of the big picture and should be examined. If someone can make a video about this information that would be much appreciated too. I considered making a documentary but I don‘t have the time or resources required to that well in a timely fashion. With all the footage available it would be easy to make a compelling case in an easy to digest manner that could bring attention to this.
Thank you for reading through this and for participating in this ongoing global investigation. Please spread and investigate this information further and let‘s end this madness once and for all.

            And also: “Song of the week: “I love little girls“ by Oingo Boingo, practically my life story“
The tweets are from 2010 so either this is his authentic twitter account or the person behind it at least made a connection between him and pedophilia. It seems like he quit tweeting at a certain point but there is no other twitter account linked to him at least and it does sound like his ramblings as he speaks about “God-Head“ and what he likes and doesn‘t like. The really interesting part is where I decided to investigate wtf that song was about. Let‘s start with the lyrics:
           </p>
           <p>
            I, I, I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so bad
When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town
I love, little girls
They make me feel so good
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror
They're not frightened by my cold exterior
They don't, ask me questions
They don't, want to scold me
They don't, look for answers
They just, want to hold me
Isn't this fun?
Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?
Oh, oh, oh I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so, bad
When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town
I love, little girls
They make me feel so, good
They don't care about my inclinations
They're not frightened by my revelations
Uh oh (uh oh), take a second (take a second)
Uh oh (uh oh), it's a mistake (it's a mistake)
Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girl was just too little
Too little, too little, too little, too little
Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?
And I don't care, what people say
And I don't care, what people think
And I don't care, how I look
When I'm down my street
They make me feel so--
I love, little girls
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror
They don't care about my cold exterior
They don't (they don't), ask me questions (ask me questions)
They don't (they don't), want to scold me (want to scold me)
They don't (they don't), look for answers (look for answers)
They just (they just), want to hold me (want to hold me)
Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girls was just too little
Too little, too little, too little, too little
Too little, too little, too little, too little
Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?
Oh, oh, oh, I, I, I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so, bad
When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town
I love (I love), little girls
They make me feel so good
I love

           </p>
           <p>
            Any questions?
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a few... like... who wrote that filth? Who is he associated with? How come I‘ve never heard about this disgusting song before? Did it actually get recorded? Well it did! And they even had the audacity to film a video for it. You can watch it here and it is just as bad as you think it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a screenshot from the video while the lyrics say “I don‘t care what people say, I don‘t care what people think“
           </p>

           <p>
            This is just gross. Did you recognize Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones) starred in the video? (apparently not him, but looks exactly like him imo)
           </p>
           <p>
            So if you haven‘t already recognized him or googled more about him then you are in for a bit of a shock. I know I was when I realized it. The singer in the video is none other than Danny Elfman. The man who composed the Simpson theme and scored countless of Tim Burton movies. This is him singing about how he loves little girls. I am a bit shocked this has not been mentioned anywhere regarding this case. It does not get more blatant than this. Or does it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, obviously I started looking deeper into Danny Elfman‘s story to see if there were any further connections. Here is something small to start off with. A connection to Kroq:

            Forbidden Zone is a film made by Danny Elfmans brother, Richard Elfman in 1980. A little excerpt from this rolling stones article will give you an idea of what we are getting into:
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the years, Forbidden Zone has sparked controversy over its depictions of both African-Americans, including some scenes with blackface, and Squeezit's transgender sibling, René (also played by Bright). Some moviegoers said they'd burn down theaters if it were shown, and the University of Wisconsin banned it.

            I pirated this film and it goes beyond what I can describe. You just have to see it for yourself. Here are two clips from it to give you an idea. This is the less disturbing clip:

            In the next one “chicken boy“ Squeesit, who wears a diaper (who is chained to his crib throughout the film and molested by his mother) is being led by demons to be sacrificed. The devil, played by Danny Elfman sings a song to him before beheading him.

            Here is an interview with Danny and Marilyn Manson. There is a part in it where Marilyn says “I like to be surrounded with young girls in my lap“ or words to that effect and Danny says “Well who doesn‘t?“ and they have this laugh about it which in this context just gives you a bad feeling.

            Danny is political too:

            How has this never come up? Danny Elfman is a huge name and this is all public knowledge! Turns out he has spoken about his “embarrassing Oingo Boingo days“. But he‘s not talking about how he wrote obscene lyrics promoting pedophilia, merely about how there was this one video that he didn‘t like cause he wasn‘t involved with it, and Beavis and Butthead made fun of it which totally embarrassed him! He emphasizes how he was heavily involved in making all the other videos! That includes the one in which he is holding a child‘s hand and kissing her as the lyrics go “I don‘t care what they think“.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeFZtXPUCxs">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeFZtXPUCxs
            </a>
            Danny later went on to claim in 2010 at a comic con that he wrote it as satire, and to shock people. Well, if that was the aim he has succeeded as far as I‘m concerned. Here is his statement:
           </p>
           <p>
            “What made me write it? At that point I was just grabbing onto things that popped up in my head and taking characters and singing from their point of view. So whether it be the right wing guy talking about capitalism or the feisty little girl or quasi molester - these were just things that I thought were funny or interesting and I would just kind of jump into the skin of. Often things I wrote were motivated by nothing but the newspaper. I’d read an article and be thinking about something and write a song from that perspective. So it didn’t necessarily reflect me…but it was just fun and I knew it was irreverent. I was out to offend everybody when I started out. Any subject matter I could find that would be offensive I was embracing, so that was just one.”
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/oingo-boingo-little-girls-music-video-danny-elfman-youtube-a7390881.html">
             http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/oingo-boingo-little-girls-music-video-danny-elfman-youtube-a7390881.html
            </a>
            “What was the deal with Oingo Boingo’s ‘Little Girls’, still the creepiest music video of all time?“
            <a href="http://archive.is/X478R">
             http://archive.is/X478R
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is within the realm of possibility that this is simply satire for shock value. It is also possible and even likely that this is yet another example of pedophiles advertising and promoting their sick way of life. Did this get him the attention of other powerful people who shared his perversion and saw him as useful? Does that perhaps explain his subsequent rise to fame? 
I recommend (purely for the sake of the investigation, it is utter crap) watching the film. The chicken boy stuff is extremely disturbing given what we now know about the “chicken lovers“. 
Hopefully when all this gets exposed we will have time to properly evaluate and investigate concerns such as these. I do not advocate or condone the harassment, threats or any form of vigilante attacks against any of the individuals detailed in this article. I have only used publicly available sources and everything is fair use. I encourage anyone to dig further into these topics and see if they find out something useful.

            He had produced a nr.1 hit with the band Hollywood Argyles. The problem is they payed some poet to sing it and they couldn‘t follow it up in any relevant manner since they had no talent themselves and could not have replicated the song or muster up anything similar:

           <p>
            Coincidentially enough this is the track that is featured in Kansas Bowling‘s B.C. Butcher. It‘s not a bad song actually to be fair and you can understand why it was popular. But Kim deserves only a small portion of the credit for it really as the lyrics and melody probably belonged to the poet, but one can imagine the narcissistic Fowley having had no trouble taking the credit. According to Krome that is exactly what he did for a lot of the work she had done for the Runaways.

            Here is the Runaways first and most successful single, Cherry Bomb, that recently featured in Guardians of the Galaxy:

           </p>
           <p>
            Joan Jett would go on to become world famous with the song “I love rock and roll“ after the Runaways disbanded. The bands story is depicted in the 2010 Hollywood film „The Runaways“ starring Kristen Stewart, former child star Fanning Dakota as Cherie Currie and Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley.

            Kim lived to be a guest at the premiere and was excited about being portrayed by an Oscar nominated actor. He was not allowed anything to do with the film. It depicted his character somewhat accurately, f.e. declaring when Cherie tells him he is 15 “Jail Bait – JACK POT!“ and his verbal abuse is everpresent. However the film is mostly a whitewash when it comes to his abuse.

           </p>
           <p>
            From the article: 
**However, where The Runaways succeeds in telling the story of how these five impressionable, and quite underage teenage girls were seduced by rock and roll — and subsequently criminally exploited by two-bit music biz hustlers like Fowley — there's also one big chunk of this story that's missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            For one thing, what the hell were a couple of minors like Jett and Currie doing hanging out in a glam-rock sleaze-pit like Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco in the first place? The Mayor Of Sunset Strip not only fills in those holes, but in doing so, also tells the unexpectedly tragic story of Bingenheimer himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading about the decadence and debauchery that went on at Bingenheimer's club as a teenager, I would have never pegged him as a sympathetic character at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, based on the stories and pictures in rock-rags like Creem back then, I'd have probably put him in the same morally bankrupt category as a sleazeball like Fowley. What I found instead in Rodney was what not only what seems to be a very likable, if clearly lonely guy, but a story which strangely moved and lingered with me quite deeply for several days afterward.

           <p>
            Though the story is shocking, the worst thing about it is that it isn’t surprising. The Runaways’ iconography was all about their jailbait sexuality, and Fowley’s persona was all about fucking any girl he could get his hands on, the younger the better. And yet the idea that somehow he never interfered with this band of teenage girls that he recruited, produced, styled, controlled, and profited from has persisted for decades—abetted by the official accounts of the women themselves, several books, a sanitized feature film, and, more broadly, the agonizing process by which monstrous acts are subsumed by a collective will not to disrupt the romance we still attach to rock ’n’ roll’s hedonistic glory days.
The desire not to examine the past too closely is powerful, but so is the yearning for acknowledgement felt by people who have suffered

            In this interview Cherie recounts how Kim had all the band members sitting in a hotel room and forced them to watch him have sex with a “young girl“.

            How young was this girl if these 15 year olds were referring to her as young? Definitely not older than them at least which makes the whole thing sound even more disturbing.

            When he died the mainstream media wrote glorifying obituaries. Legend, icon, charismatic, flamboyant and at worst a little outrageous and controversial.

            There is no mention of the many allegations against him. Like Jimmy Savile he lived an entire life in his own words “sexually abusing the world“ without ever having to face any consequences, at least in this realm of existence. They were never so much as arrested and questioned about their activities. Why is there such a clear pattern of officials at the very least condoning and turning a blind eye to crimes of this nature?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are some people parading their depravity around with impunity without ever facing any type of investigation? Why was Fowley so arrogant and almost flaunting about his continued abuse? Never hiding his obsession and proximity with young girls? Was he aware that he would not be prosecuted for these type of activities or was this a combination of blind optimism and luck?
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1978 after being dumped by the Runaways, he formed „The Orchids“, an all girl female band featuring 13 year old rock prodigy “Sandy Fury“. While she does not support the claims made against Fowley this trend is simply too obvious.
Watch any interview or video this guy is in and you will get the same level of disgusting narcissistic dribble accompanied by this unabashed arrogant filth-mongering. In one video:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn-odC1qEK4&amp;">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn-odC1qEK4&amp;)
            </a>
            ) he brags about robbing people when he came to Hollywood as well as selling drugs and prostitutes. At 15:00 he talks about doing time for murdering someone which he claims was self defence. I do not have any more information about that case except what he talks about in this interview.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is worth noting as well that Cherie Currie of The Runaways made a cameo alongside Rodney Bingenheimer and Richie Ramone in a video called “Post teenage angst“ by “Kill my qocuette“ directed by Kansas Bowling.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not found any cases of Fowley or Bingenheimer overtly championing satanism or making satanic gestures/wearing satanic signs. Rodney appears in the Death Valley Girls video which has a very satanic vibe and imagery to it but that is about it. It is clear however that Fowley is spouting the satanic philosophy „Do what thou wilt“ in every aspect of his being. There is plenty more to talk about regarding these guys, I highly suggest watching both documentaries, Mayor of the Sunset Strip and the one about the Runaways. What I stumbled across next was just too crazy. After going through Rodney Bingenheimers twitter account I found a series of disturbing tweets.

He is the ultimate “Yes I‘m a creep, fuck you“ and he managed to consistently live out his sick fantasies until he died in January 2015. His final wish was to be buried and photographed in “Girls And Corpses“ where women pose nude with actual corpses.

            Kim had a well known “taste“ for young girls. Here is an ad he posted in the June 1975 issue of Back Door Man, an influential L.A. magazine:

           <p>
            It starts: If you are an 18 year old girl or under 18 and legally emancipated (with paperwork) then you may have just stumble upon the opportunity of a lifetime.

            Kim Fowley and Rodney Bingenheimer were best buds and he is featured heavily in the documentary “Mayor of the sunset strip“

           <p>
            Together the two were influential in forming the all girl punk rock band “The Runaways“. Kim Fowley was their manager during their first two years and co-wrote their most famous single “Cherry Bomb“ a reference to Cherie Curry, the singer and an obvious jab at “popping the cherry“.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was Rodney Bingenheimer who introduced Kari Krome to Kim Fowley when she was 13 years old at the English Disco. She played them her stuff and they loved it... After talking to her on the phone Kim signed a contract with her on her 14yh birthday.
           </p>
           <p>
            They then met a 15 year old Joan Jett and Sandy West. Kim convinced them he would make them huge stars. Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1974, Fowley placed an advertisement in local fanzine Who Put the Bomp looking for female performers. He hoped to form an all-girl group that he could produce and would perform his songs, but no one responded to the advert. In 1975, he met the teenage guitarist Joan Jett who expressed interest in forming an all-girl band. Less than two weeks later, he met 15-year-old drummer Sandy West who introduced herself outside of the Rainbow Bar and Grill in Hollywood, California. West told Fowley of her aspirations to form an all-girl band after playing in all male groups. This meeting led to Fowley giving West Jett's phone number. The two met and began playing together at West's home the following week. A short time later Fowley recruited Lita Ford, Cherie Currie, and Jackie Fox. They eventually became the Runaways. While he did produce some of their albums and contributed lyrics to songs, the band was primarily responsible for creating their own music. The group severed their ties with Fowley in 1977.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edgeplay is a documentary about the Runaways that I highly recommend viewing in it‘s entirety. I suggest watching a few minutes on from this point before continuing to read this where Kim Fowley explains the meaning behind Cherry Bomb:

            He concludes by saying that if you had a “Bardot-esque“ teenager on a “lolita level“ singing about a cherry bomb it could work.

            He dragged these girls around the country playing small shows, making them rehearse while verbally abusing them. Referring to them as “dogshit“ “dogcunts“ and other derogatory terms. According to many of the members he would play mind games, turning them against each other and making sure they always depended on him for money. He would also manipulate them to make sure they wouldn‘t give up and go back home to their families, some of whom are interviewed on the film and they do not speak fondly of Kim Fowley.

            The band never received the fame Kim had promised but had some small moments of stardom, like their trip to Japan after which bassist Jackie Fuchs quit the band.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Mayor of the Sunset Strip, Rodney and Kim are interviewed together on a balcony where Kim reminisces about the orgy lifestyle they were living.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to get a sense of what they are like just watch that part of the documentary, it starts at 36:30 and is followed by testimony from Cherie Curry from the Runaways where she states Kim is “a beast“ and a “dangerous man“ who should not be allowed to work with anyone underage:
           </p>

           <p>
            It feels like this should have been an obvious case of a potentially abusive situation to anyone even remotely connected to this project but noone appears to have protested. Neither should it come as a big surprise that Jackie Fuchs, renamed “Jackie Fox“ recently revealed she had been raped by Kim Fowley in a room full of people when she was 15 years old, after a Runaway concert.
           </p>
           <p>
            She says she was drugged, taking one qualude voluntarily not knowing what it did and likely given more without her approval. She did not drink alcohol. She passed out and woke to find Kim raping her while people witnesses, including fellow members of the band did nothing. She also remembers someone coming to check up on them and Fowley offering this person to have sex with her saying “she doesn‘t care“ at a point where she was too drugged out to speak. She recounts her experience fully in this interview:

            A number of people who were present have come forward and corraborated her story including Kari Krome.

            He has this mentality that is this unabashed, unashamed creepiness I hadn‘t come across so much since looking at this. This “Yes I‘m a disgusting creep and so what? Fuck you!“. He is a proud satanist and pervert. Before we get into the “king of creeps“ it is time to talk about Kansas Bowling‘s boyfriend. Now, what handsome bachelor was able to win the affection of this attractive, young, up and coming filmmaker?

            Some of you may already have heard about Rodney. He was the subject of a 2003 documentary “Mayor of the Sunset Strip“ which was a big source of information for this research and what led me to the biggest creep of them all.

           </p>
           <p>
            Rodney Bingenheimer (born December 15, 1947) is an American radio disc jockey on the long-running[2] Los Angeles rock station KROQ[3]who is notable for helping numerous iconic bands[2] become successful in the American market. His contribution to the music business has been described as important.[1] He developed a reputation for being the first American D.J. to identify new artists[4] and play "edgy new bands" such as Blondie,[5] the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Guns N' Roses, Duran Duran, The Cure, Joan Jett, Hole, Symbol Six, No Doubt, Blur, Nirvana,[5]Sonic Youth, The Bangles, X and many others.[6]
He managed a key but now-defunct L.A. nightclub called Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco in the early seventies.[7]
He was the subject of a documentary by late filmmaker George Hickenlooper titled Mayor of the Sunset Strip which told the story of a groupie-turned-kingmaker with a knack for making friends in the music industry.[8] He was described as a "famous groupie, now respectable" by Mick Jagger[3] and he has numerous high-profile friends.[4] In 2007, he was honored with the 2,330th star on Hollywood Boulevard.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            Other mainstream outlets will often refer to him as “living legend“ “punk hero“ “cultural icon“ or other fancy labels like that. I can accept a “cultural icon“ if he represents the absolute lowest form of the shallow VIP ass-kissing status worshipping substance abusing degenerates in our society. This autograph hunting celebrity stalker somehow managed to weasel his way into the inner circles of some of musics biggest names by sucking up to them, earning their pity or by showing an enormous dedication to providing them what they wanted. One of those things he found was “young girls with stars in their eyes“. So basically he convinced the rock stars he could get them groupies, and told young girls he could get them in touch with these celebrities. According to multiple accounts in this film he would in many cases end up sleeping with these girls, one would imagine either as “price of admission“ or after their pursuits of the desired star had proven fruitless.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doing this did indeed get him many friends in the music industry. Without going into details, many of the artists associated with him, talented as they are/were, have had many accusations and rumours concerning sex with underage fans.
           </p>
           <p>
            But hey? Those were the days right! It was just the “rock‘n‘roll lifestyle“! Well you see, I can‘t really accept that as an excuse for the systematic introduction of girls as young as 13 into a culture of alcohol, drugs and sex with older men. That is abuse and manipulation, simple as that. Even if the girls “approved“ there is a reason why we have laws to prevent this happening and when adults are willingly encouraging and participating in this with minors they should be held accountable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rodney was and still is a radio DJ at KROQ. In the film he refers to people with VIP passes as „God head“ and explain that this concept is for the “incrowd“. His bar “Disco“ had a special VIP area that was visible to the rest of the guests. His mother was an obsessive autograph collector who seems to have encouraged his pathological behaviour regarding famous people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is some testimony that I found in a story related to KROQ, but the emphasis of that article is on a completely different angle:
           </p>

             http://archive.is/E8PYx
            </a>
            Former KROQ entertainment reporter turned astrologer, Farley Malorrus, is one prominent witness who has told Daily Mail Online that Dr Drew's cocaine use was frequent in the 1980s.
Malorrus, who worked at KROQ from 1983 to 1993, said the entire radio station was 'fueled by cocaine' back then and Dr Drew was no exception.
'KROQ was a cocaine-fueled radio station for the whole time I was there. Everyone was doing it.
'It was like living at the magic castle in Disneyland. Some guy would ring up and say, 'I've got top quality Columbian cocaine'. Jim "Poorman'' Trenton would be like, 'boom bring him in'. If you wanted sex, girls would come in, if you wanted a gourmet lunch, food would arrive.
'It was the 80s, there were groupies for everything at the station.'
Malorrus said that during almost every Loveline show he was involved with at the time, a groupie would appear with cocaine.
           </p>
           <h2>
            'A guy would come in with a mirror which had around ten lines of cocaine on it. The mirror would be passed round the room to everyone including the Poorman and Dr Drew.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Another witness, who asked not to be identified, claimed she was just a teenager when she took the drug alongside Dr Drew.
The woman said: 'Yes 30 years ago I did cocaine with Dr Drew at KROQ when I was just 14.
'I remember we were in the studio hanging out and someone brought some cocaine out, I don't remember who it belonged to.
'The coke was chopped in to lines on an album cover on top of the turntables and we all had a line, at least one or two.
'Everybody was comfortable with it (cocaine), it was a no brainer.'
The woman, who says she doesn't do drugs any more, confesses to being a wild child in the 80s.
She got to know KROQ DJ Trenton who she met at a bikini contest in 1983 and they kept in touch.
She also used to help out at the radio station so knew other people there.
'I was a model and used to go to Los Angeles a lot,' she said.
'I was too young to drive to LA for a night out so me and my friends would put our money together and hire a limo for the night, it was a lot cheaper than a taxi.
'We would go to a concert, then afterwards go to a club, then after the club we'd sometimes take the limo to the KROQ station.'
The woman said legendary KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer at the time hosted his hugely popular show Rodney on the Roq and she says her and her friends enjoyed hanging out at the station after hours.
Trenton and Dr Drew did the Loveline show from midnight to 3am.
'I knew Rodney and I knew Jim so we'd go hang out, it was no big deal and I did look a lot older than I was.
'One night I remember we were doing drugs and that's the night Dr Drew happened to be there.
'It was just another night at the station for us, there was about five or six of us,
'Jim was there, my friends and some other people from the station. There was kind of a party atmosphere.
'I was definitely young, my birthday is in December so I was either 14 or just turned 15. It was at the KROQ station in Pasadena, we took the back stairs up to the studio.'
           </p>
           <p>
            So a 14 year old girl and her friends frequented parties hosted by Rodney Bingenheimer. This went on for decades. To ignore this as something “innocent“ is to take the same mentality as regarding Jimmy Savile. Stories like this were dismissed as insufficient evidence and people quiffed he just “liked them young“ and people were being too sensitive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not saying that Rodney is involved with satanic abuse, there is no proof of this or even an accusation of this to be the case. Never the less, his arrogant “hide in plain sight“ attitude regarding this behaviour is alarming and reminiscent of the “everyone kind of knew“ environment surronding Jimmy Savile.

             (Regarding Kim Fowley photographs in Girls and Corpses. While the site promotes the idea they use actual corpses or plasticized ones, I believe they are fake: What gives it away, they have a link to another site where you can submit a photo and receive a lifesize replica corpse of yourself. Some very creepy people indeed, nevertheless.

             There was a photographer in the 90's who was famous for arranging body parts borrowed from morgues and dissection classes. Saville in the course of his volunteer duties as hospital morgue porter was said to have arranged dead bodies together for his amusement, as well as partaking in actual necrophilia.)
