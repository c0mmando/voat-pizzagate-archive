             You have to stop deleting my stuff.
I posted plenty of information in the comment street below it doesn't let me put all that information on the top it limits me to 200 words so I put it in the first, drain if you keep doing this to people you're going to discourage people from being part of this investigation

            Please listen at 35 min time stamp he starts talking about the full impact Pizzagate could have on humanity, this will help you understand what an important and big undertaking you are part of.this Pizzagate has many angles, financial, moral but also a spiritual angle. Whether we like it or not we are dealing with a large cult at the heart of it all. We have now assembled plent of proof that children are being trafficked, raped and even sacrificed. If we look at a people that surround Alefantis, take for example that movie company 20/20, who did the indie film at Comet Ping Pong. The movie was crap, the acting was crap and did I mention that the music was crap?  But yet someone is funding, supporting and encouraging them. They won awards, yes multiple for heavens sake. And look at Heavy Breathing, what the fuck is that and again they exist and seem to do pretty well for themselves. What I am getting at is there is a systematic brainwashing of people and a very strong cult in place. And they get them to abuse their own children from young on and indoctrinate them into cult. You can look up David Shurter, Hampton case, these are all examples how they start with their own.

            Also Ted Gunderson had mentioned talking with an immigration attorney who also had been born into this cult. And she mentioned that she knew from very young in that she was to he an attorney . They already had a place and a function for her within their cult. And she was used to bring young children from Europe to America, she never knew what happened to those children. But she thought some if them were important because if their bloodline. These kids are indoctrinate from VERY young on. Very few break free and manage to survive. And by the number of people who are trying to sabotage this investigation at so many different points we get an inkling of an idea of how wide spread and how influential this cult is. We have to know our enemy, first rule of war, even in a spiritual war. Keep up the amazing work and know you are part of something that could change the WORLD.
