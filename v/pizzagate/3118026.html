           <p>
            Sounds like they have a corrupt police and willfully ignorant mayor issue too:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Three-thousand?” asked Major Robert Wagner of the Hawai‘i Police Department.” Does that number even make sense to you?”
            </p>
            <p>
             The police department indicated that the media has exaggerated the missing persons and sex trafficking issue in Hawai‘i.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             ...the police have been part of the problem. Nearly half reported that law enforcement officers were their frequent clients.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             When parents reported their children missing, they felt law enforcement rarely took their concerns seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The Hawai‘i Revised Statutes protects police misconduct from becoming public information.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked whether he was concerned that some of Big Island’s missing persons may fall victim to sex trafficking, Mayor Kim responded, “I know very little about the innards and extent of it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He said he had read some about the issue in the press and reached out to police department personnel who told him they weren’t aware of any accusations.

            Man found guilty of secretly filming students in shower - West Hawaii Today

            For decades, alleged pedophile Jay Ram adopted and fostered dozens of boys given to him by state social services. How did it keep happening?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just two weeks later, Ram abruptly moved to the Big Island of Hawaii with some of the boys. Shortly thereafter, he was approved to adopt them, and the boys became brothers
           </p>
           <p>
            The five alleged victims we spoke to say they were all afraid to tell any adults in Hawaii about what was going on. But others did. We obtained records showing at least two boys reported allegations of abuse to authorities in 1989. But once again, Ram managed to avoid charges. And a state social worker named Roselyn Viernes continued to recommend that boys be placed in Ram’s care — at one point, he had at least 11 foster and adoptive boys in his home. When a local newspaper wrote a glowing article about how Ram was rescuing so many troubled youths, Viernes was quoted saying, “The boys have blossomed under his care. He’s a real good influence."

            Langley Frissell, an adjunct psychology professor and Director of Distance Education at Hawaii Pacific University (HPU), was reportedly served and search, 16 November 2017, for child pornography related charges. Frissell, apparently, committed suicide the following day on 17 November 2017. Frissell received an award for “Excellence in Mentoring” of the on-line teaching program. The student paper reported he was available “days, evenings, and even weekends” and “ ‘lurks’ on chats until students are comfortable with technology.” He had published research articles about student on-line chat rooms and was employed at HPU since 1999.
