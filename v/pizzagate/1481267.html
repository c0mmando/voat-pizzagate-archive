            He's a control freak, and that makes him a useful idiot. He was on Facebook acting like a little enforcer drone for the MSM, somehow that fits in to his world view where he's the minister of truth that everyone else has to satisfy for a letter grade and placement on the totem pole of society. As soon as he's faced with the reality of just how powerless he is, he runs away like a coward. I don't think you need to call the cops, just let him have his safe space for a while.

            Leave him alone personally, I can understand why he shut down his page. And if you harass him, he'll get a restraining order and you will look like a nut. But look into other connections he may have, like with the school and his social groups for connections to KNOWN pedos.

            It's posts like this that give Pizzagate the "witch hunt" reputation. He was likely trying to avoid getting dragged into something, right or wrong. I'd say let it lie.

             You could be right. Of course I thought about it. I just think that a responsable adult who just happens to be a teacher in a university would anser somthing like: I dont like where you are going with this, I dont have to answer, I dont want to be your friend anymore. No he deleted his facebook.
