<p><strong>Hillary also wore a small pendant necklace</strong> with the purple suit, but I have not seen it discussed.  And from this article we know she wears jewelry to symbolize sentiments.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton also wears jewelry to signify a sentiment.  He wears a hand-made bracelet given to him by the Columbian band, Los Ninos del Vallentano, whose lead was kidnapped and killed by (ahem) rebel forces a few years later.  Bill has worn the bracelet ever since he was killed as a sign of solidarity with the Columbian people.  <strong>Now why would Bill be showing support for the Columbian people?</strong>  There has got to be more to it than that.</p>

<p>So, it is obvious that the Clintons wear jewelry to send messages, and they obvioulsly want people to know that is what they are doing, so what is the small pendant she wore with the purple?<br />
Here is a pic of her purple suit and necklace.  Can you tell what it is?</p>

            I may have seen that before and I think it might be a double heart necklace.  A small heart within a larger one.  I think Theresa May had one or a pin like that as well.  Does anyone else remember a pic of Hillary with that before?

              I am not able to see the pic clearly, the one with the purple suit, but I do remember her having one. There was one in a much clearer picture, I believe.
