           <p>
            Theres more to this story, didn't realize its an older one
           </p>
           <p>
            Dana William was a sick, nasty, violent piece of human wreckage who had no business walking among us
           </p>
           <p>
            William now has murdered his former father-in-law and likely his former mother-in-law as well
           </p>
           <p>
            Woodell “Woody” Brooks, a beloved Richmond-area medic, was tied up and later suffocated — silenced forever — by William on Jan. 21 in Amelia County. William also bound other members of his ex-girlfriend’s family so he could abduct her mother, Olene Brooks, who is still missing
           </p>
           <p>
            As police closed in on William in Fitchburg, Mass., on Jan. 27, he fatally shot himself in the head.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can say with some degree of confidence that none of this would’ve happened if William had not been set free last year when the state’s request for a civil “violent sexual predator” commitment was denied by the Chesterfield judge
           </p>
           <p>
            Virginia Supreme Court documents show that the Attorney General’s Office was in the process of appealing Hauler’s decision, arguing that the judge improperly denied a continuance so the state could bring a previous rape victim to the hearing, as well as improperly ruling a crucial deposition from that victim as inadmissible, the state alleged
           </p>
           <p>
            The judge (not Hauler) who accepted William’s rape and abduction plea agreement in 2013 clearly didn’t have much choice. The court documents show William called his victim repeatedly from jail, “trying to get her to change her story.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The victim didn’t want to testify, even though there was plenty of evidence. She apparently didn’t even want him convicted of rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lacking that crucial evidence, the prosecution and the defense agreed to a 40-year sentence with 38 years suspended.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other rapes attributed to him in Massachusetts — where he was a known problem — were equally awful, but the cases also were legally weak. He was never even charged in the cases, although he certainly was investigated as the main suspect. His victims were intoxicated, unable to pick him out of a lineup or fuzzy on other key details. He apparently was a master at this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hauler had all this to weigh as he decided whether to commit a man to incarceration who already had been sentenced and served his time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Efforts to reach Judge Hauler for comment were unsuccessful. The assistant attorney general who handled the state’s appeal of his decision declined to talk about the case or the judge.
           </p>
           <p>
            As awful as these attacks were, was there really any strong legal proof against William? And why was he allowed to call his victim from jail, more than 50 times? Perhaps without that intimidation, the victim may have testified and the rapist would be serving a much bigger chunk of his 40-year sentence
           </p>
           <p>
            I can see why Hauler ruled the state’s case wasn’t strong enough for a civil commitment.
           </p>
           <p>
            My main question is why he didn’t allow a continuance to let the state try to get the other witness to court.
           </p>
           <p>
            And reading the reports of the attacks up north, it’s heartbreaking to see how intoxication not only can place a victim in the clutches of someone like William, but also can keep them from helping police and the courts from stopping the next attacks.
           </p>
           <p>
            And why wasn’t William monitored more carefully — such as with GPS and a microscope! — after his release here? He allegedly was free enough to attack a woman in Massachusetts as well as a juvenile female in Henrico County after his release.
           </p>
           <p>
            Legal expert Steve Benjamin, a guy I respect, said, “Judges can only work with what you bring them.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He said Hauler is an excellent judge who sticks with the facts and the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            “He’s courageous enough to call it the way he sees it, based on the evidence presented to him,” Benjamin said. “I have tremendous respect for the guy.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading through all this history and having some behind-the-scenes conversations, my guess is Hauler — who oversaw the establishment of Chesterfield and Colonial Heights Drug Court — isn’t your typical hard-nosed, lock-’em-up-and-throw-away-the-key judge who is favored in many of Virginia’s Republican districts such as Chesterfield, which may have ruffled some feathers.
           </p>
           <p>
            He’s also a rich guy who lives on a vast estate, making it a little easier to judge the judge now

             I saw this too when researching Hauler last night.  My impression was that the author is one of those progressive "convincers" who think they can bring conservatives around to their way of thinking by first making calm and reasoned arguments they know you will agree with and then gently rolling the narrative with the intent that you suddenly find yourself believing the way they do because golly it's just so darned
             <em>
              logical
             </em>
             .  It's a recognizable tactic.  Hard to know whether he was coordinating with others in this particular case.  It seems he's retired now:

             I'm thinking manta.com might be thinking he's a trucking business because of his last name.  I've gotten hits for him on manta with a B&amp;B Trucking and then also with his fellow circuit court judge Herbert C. Gill, Jr., so it might be random associations in Virginia, or it might be something very interesting.  I'll take a longer look.

            The "Pitchfork Rebellion" tried hard to oust Judge Hauler in 2009:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Pitchfork Rebellion, a term for a populist uprising, formed after disgruntled litigants in Fairfax, Chesterfield and Gloucester counties and the Hampton Roads area found one another on the Internet and shared their disdain for the judicial selection process."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "But Hauler was later approved by the committees, despite concerns raised by some opponents, including the fact that he filed a libel suit against his circuit clerk when she opposed his last reappointment. In a Feb. 4 letter to the judge, Sen. Stephen H. Martin (R-Chesterfield) wrote that Hauler was reversed or remanded 44 percent of the time, compared with a 16 to 21 percent rate for the other circuit judges. The senator also said that he had received 46 letters from lawyers on Hauler's behalf but heard from more than 100 residents who opposed Hauler."

            Courts need to be purged of judges, attorneys, and anything else representing the cabal. They've left common decency behind, but I guess that's the point of being in a perv group that exchanges their own private hand signals.
