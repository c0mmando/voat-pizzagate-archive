<blockquote>
<p>An elite Canadian paratroop regiment that shocked the nation with the disclosure of gruesome hazing rituals, racial incidents and the torture killing of a Somali teenager during a 1993 peacekeeping mission is being disbanded. </p>
<p>The decision followed the broadcast last week on Canadian television of two amateur videos. One showed Airborne soldiers in Somalia in 1993 making racist remarks and talking about killing &quot;niggers.&quot; That video was shot in the weeks before the Somali teen-ager was tortured and killed while in the custody of the regiment.</p>
<p>The second video showed a hazing ritual in 1992 at the regiment\'s base in Petawawa, Ont., in which drunken Airborne soldiers eat vomit and feces and drag a black trooper around on a leash with the legend &quot;I love the KKK&quot; written on the soldier\'s back.</p>

<p>There\'s that pesky issue raising it\'s ugly head again.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The second video which needs mentioning is</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/MqiPbF58-fU">Madeleine McCann the Dutch connection</a></p>
<p>In it he mentions a doctor Weinberger, and in the comments section :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dr paul jeromeweinberger worked.Portman downs <a href="https://jillhavern.forumotion.net/t11615p40-hobs-theory-what-i-believe-may-have-happened-to-madeleine-mccann">https://jillhavern.forumotion.net/t11615p40-hobs-theory-what-i-believe-may-have-happened-to-madeleine-mccann</a>﻿ </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Porton Down</strong> you say?  Well, that needed investigating..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of rather more interest is that Weinberger\'s former company, Enigma, was set up essentially as an \'arm\'s length\', government-backed private company, whose office was eventually located inside the highly secret Ministry of Defence establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire, not far from Salisbury.  <strong>It is famous, or perhaps notorious, for conducting research into biological, chemical and nuclear warfare. The murdered Dr David Kelly was associated with it for many years.</strong> </p>
<p>Weinberger did live close to another Ocean Club guest, Dr Julian Totman and his wife, both of whom were General Practitioners in Salisbury. But still more relevantly, Dr Totman had a second surgery actually inside Porton Down.  </p>

<p>Dr Paul Weinberger and his wife are directors of a company called Diasolve Ltd at <strong>7-7c Snuff Street</strong>, Devizes, Wiltshire, SN10 1DU </p>

<blockquote>
<p>June was when the McCanns did the bulk of their Grand European Tour and a plethora of Sirs and Lords appeared on the scene. Sir Richard Branson, Sir Philip Green, Sir Tom Hunter, Sir Christopher Meyer, Lord Stevens and not forgetting that <strong>Lord Tim Bell</strong> had already given his support the previous month. The connection between these people is that they were all endorsed by the Royal Family. They were knighted by the Queen. While the credentials of these people were discussed on the Internet, everyone overlooked the fact that the benefactors had all been honoured by the Royal Family. </p>

            June was when the McCanns did the bulk of their Grand European Tour and a plethora of Sirs and Lords appeared on the scene. Sir Richard Branson, Sir Philip Green, Sir Tom Hunter, Sir Christopher Meyer, Lord Stevens and not forgetting that
            <strong>
             Lord Tim Bell
            </strong>
            had already given his support the previous month. The connection between these people is that they were all endorsed by the Royal Family. They were knighted by the Queen. While the credentials of these people were discussed on the Internet, everyone overlooked the fact that the benefactors had all been honoured by the Royal Family.

            Increasingly of the view that the entire McCann case was manufactured by intelligence agencies. This would explain some things which are otherwise very puzzling e.g. the extremely rapid and wholehearted involvement of the British government. It would also help to explain the 'over-rabbitholed' landscape of the case, full of lurid and unlikely 'leads' including Clement Freud and the Podestas. Here's what a user called 'psyopticon' wrote on the fakeologist website about two of the people who travelled with the McCanns to Portugal: "At the time of the disappearance [of Madeleine McCann], Bridget O’Donnell was a Producer for BBC Crimewatch. For over 30 years, Crimewatch has been Britain’s main crime and policing programme on television. A curiosity indeed that the McCanns should, quite by happenstance, end up holidaying with the producer of this pivotal crime programme; a programme which was soon to feature so big in all their lives. It doesn’t stop there though. O’Donnell’s partner, Jeremy “Jez” Wilkins is also a TV producer. Like his partner Bridget, he too had worked on BBC Crimewatch. But Jez Wilkins is perhaps best know for producing the TV reality show “World’s Greatest Hoaxes”." There are also some other odd signs e.g. with the names. The name 'Maddie' is an anagram for "i am ded" or, perhaps more to the point, "am i ded". On another forum it was pointed out that, in the Sandy Hook hoax, the Parker girls were called Emilie and Madeleine, while the McCann girls are called 'Amelie and Madeleine. Madeleine" = "made (en) lie" Emilie/Amelie = I'm a lie

             I'm not vilifying them.  I'm looking into this because I'm puzzled by all the money that's been thrown into it.  And the more one looks the more one finds connections to government, and the establishment.  It seems that half of Porton Down was staying at Praia da Luz. Don't you find that odd ?

It is home to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, known as Dstl. Dstl is an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Defence(MoD), and the site is believed to be one of the United Kingdom's most sensitive and secretive government facilities for military research, including CBRN defence.

             It is also home to the Health Protection Agency's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response as well as a small science park which includes companies such as Tetricus Bioscience[3] and Ploughshare Innovations.[4]

            <p>
             Porton Down has also been involved in human testing. Most of the work carried out at Porton Down has to date remained secret.

             Porton Group’s history lies in partnerships with leading Government laboratories, funding and developing technology for military purposes, with parallel commercial applications. Such laboratories include Dstl (an agency of the UK Ministry of Defence); Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (the UK Space Centre of Excellence); and numerous other UK Government public sector research establishments, and universities such as Cambridge University. Porton Group has always enjoyed unique access to technology with worldwide market potential; embracing the competition of new entrants to the sector, and diversifying to new markets and opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Historically Porton Group has not been sector specific, having invested in medical diagnostics, biomarkers, access control technologies, next-gen flat loudspeakers, through to materials science and a host of sectors in between. However, Porton Group has a proud heritage in defence and security with many of our significant investments having had national security at their heart, but have gone on to be actively successful in commercial sectors.

             Myself and many other people that I am aware of in Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, Dubai and Tokyo amongst others have been duped out of significant funds as a result of investing in shares of various Tech start up companies through Mr. Harvey Boulter's Porton Capital. It transpires that apart from the many stories and outright lies fed to investors only a small percentage of each investment was going into the companies and the balance was going directly to Mr. Boulter and his gang of over dressed fraudsters! I have recently been made aware that there is litigation pending in the UK by a group of disgruntled investors against Portman Capital/Harvey Boulter/ Pipers LLC either singularly or together.
