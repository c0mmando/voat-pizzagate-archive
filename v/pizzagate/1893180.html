<p>Here is an article about how SEIU tricked Bernie and endorsed Hillary months before asking him to endorse something. It contains a Wikileaks email that contains the info in the previous sentence. It also contains the Local SEIU number of the chapter involved: SEIU 1199</p>

<p>SEIU 1199 is United Healthcare Workers East. NotFBIAnon mentioned Podesta\'s SEIU contacts in VA, &amp; on East Coast and that Palmieri used them to kill Seth.</p>
<p>President of SEIU1299 is Mr. George Gresham <a href="https://www.1199seiu.org/leadership">https://www.1199seiu.org/leadership</a> <a href="http://archive.is/SmDL6">http://archive.is/SmDL6</a></p>
<p>George Gresham is also on the guest list of union bosses that attended a reception for Union in John Podesta\'s home. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50299">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/50299</a></p>
<p>George Gresham and Local 1199 mentioned in several Podesta emails. This one titled &quot;SEIU Readout&quot; dated April 23, 2015:</p>
<p>&quot;Also relayed that HRC can\'t meet with one local cause then it\'ll expand into other locals. He understood. He is advocating for some call time for some of their local leaders from her, my guess is particularly George Gresham at 1199.&quot;</p>

<p>George Gresham mentioned again in Podesta emails, entitled &quot;Call Today?&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;I can report in on conversation with Lee Saunders and I know George Gresham/1199UHW-E has request into HRC.&quot;</p>
<p>Source email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28342">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28342</a></p>
<p>And he made a sizeable donation to her campaign....I\'m assuming that\'s a donation, maybe be from the Local and not from him individually.</p>
<p>&quot;Home run! Local leaders are thrilled Laphonza Butler 268K and George Gresham 300k very impressed with Secretary Clinton!&quot;</p>

<p>George Gresham mentioned again:</p>
<p>&quot;Here\'s my proposal for Local 1199, please let me know what you think. George Gresham is going to be in LA on Thursday and I am sure will bring up his Executive Board request with the Secretary. I\'d like to head that off with a plan. Although we have hit all of the marks with SEIU Intl, Local 1199 will be key to passing endorsement on the board.</p>
<p>Proposal: Coordinate with Local 1199 on a date for George and some key board members to visit our HQ in Brooklyn. We coordinate that campaign stop by when the Secretary is in the HQ. If HRC could stop by for 10 minutes that should put Local 1199 issue to bed.&quot;</p>

            So basically someone had to get Seth Rich to a local area hospital, for a Evil Pd off health care worker to ensure Rich was "silenced" for good!
Well, that explains the sloppy job with the three non life threatening gun shot wounds!
Just needed him to need medical service!

            Local 1199 is nationwide. It is a subdivision of SEIU and is dedicated to healthcare workers, membership almost 400,000 total membership of SEIU is almost 2 million. I could be wrong but I think  if you work in a health care facility you can still join 1199 even if you are not a healthcare worker ie,  maintenance  crew and so forth.

            How do I find the Seth Rich subversive here? Tried going through Google to find it,... no luck.   Any reason the topic of Seth Rich was moved from the pizzagate sub verse to its very own?   May this move take attention away from the idea that Seth Rich has some connection to pizzagate?  Just curious.

             Looks like 50% of posts have moved over there.  It's very happening over there, absolutely rocking in fact, however I think we miss the hive mind of a large group.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would be great to have more subscribers - 600 atm I think, which is still very good.  Please subscribe and participate if you're interested!
            </p>
            <p>
             Material over there is being missed over here.  And... there are still many many SR posts being posted here and not there. We're in between houses.  Our things have moved house but our clothes still here.  Hmm.. what to do?

             You can too?  I can feel it in my bones.  With all of us  researchers brainstorming, 4chan info and reddit we have an army on this.

            Nice work!  Unions have been involved in doing the dirty work for democrats for years. The whole Occupy Wall Street "so called movement" was all planned by DNC and unions paid for by Soros.

            And I know what you mean about editing the Title.  I haven't figured out how to do it yet.
