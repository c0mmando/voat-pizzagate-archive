            This is definitely feasible because of locale.  There's a couple of things to consider - mainly being the time frame...how much time are they gonna take to interrogate and then put him back up on the street level....they'd likely have to have the first on scene officers as lookouts (or other SEIU goons). If that was the case, I'd think that would be all the more reason for the body cam footage disappearing. But still- much speculation...hoping for more basis on this.

            ***I highly agree that there were some strange things going on on Flagler St. at the time around the murder of Seth Rich.  But lets face it, the construction project was there even before he was attacked.  I believe that all of those things like no lights, no police cars, etc. were planned to hide the tunnel construction site.  What a perfect place to arrange the set up.  All the right conditions were already in place.  Thanks for your post.

             I'm glad you found the popville post for others to read. I recalled the construction issue but I didn't know how to go about retrieving it. The construction had already been underway so it wasn't undertaken as part of a plan to assassinate Seth. The culprits just took advantage of it. If someone is interested in pursuing this angle, city blueprints, site plans, surveys, construction plans are all public records.

              Yes I so very much agree that they though of that area as the perfect crime scene.  Who knows what else happened there.

            After reading the related thread, which I had missed, it certainly seems you and quantokitty have found something. It definitely appears DC water is willfully negligent for a purpose.  That purpose may be to invite crime, which would be good cover for their own crimes.

            There had been extensive road and/or utilities  construction going on in the immediate vicinity that neighbors complained about in their neighborhood blog.  Street lighting was being interfered with creating dark nooks and crannies for criminal activity.  Could SEIU affiliated workers  be involved here?  Maybe your ideas are not so farfetched.

             DDOT is the group responsible for streetlights, not DC Water.
            </p>
            <p>
             The First Street Tunnel construction was going on for years.  They just finished it.  Obviously the construction was not due to Seth Rich doing something a year or two later.
            </p>
            <p>
             This theory is an example of hindsight bias.   Now that we know an event happened (Seth Rich was shot), some previous random events pop out like they are connected or that they determined the later event   (Streets were dark for weeks.)
            </p>
            <p>
             This bias can basically affect everyone, it's cognitive glitch in our brains, but it feels right.  Critical thinking is required if you wish to see if these are connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             The construction project itself is unconnected to Seth Rich's death.  It was started years before any conspirators would have thought about killing Rich.
            </p>
            <p>
             How about the lights, they happened much closer to Rich's death.  Well for one thing, this was an ongoing problem.  Residents on a local blog,
             <a href="https://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com">
              http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com
             </a>
             , said they had been complaining about the broken lights every since the string of robberies started which was weeks before his death.     Another key thing about the dark street.   Seth Rich did not live on that street.  It's two blocks from his house.  So the conspirator's would have had to set up a trap on a street they couldn't guarantee Seth would be on.   It's a stretch to connect these broken streetlights on a block two blocks from his house to a plan to kill him.

              As far as lights being out ahead of time, I would think that it needs to be scoped out and tested for visibility-etc. So to orchestrate something at that level, I could see the lights being taken out ahead of time and not JUST BECAUSE of construction or work or whatever....think about it- if the street light goes out, you're a little more alert in your neighborhood...after a week or two, you're used to it and not really paying as close attention to things as you were.
Unless you walked with Seth daily, you haven't a clue what his normal (or abnormal) routes were for that matter.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's coincidences that are apparent, but at the same time, it is good to look at all possible angles. 
If there's more basis for this theory that appears, it shouldn't be entirely discounted.
