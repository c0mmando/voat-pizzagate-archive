            This is pure speculation, and while I do appreciate the attention that Randy Cody has given to Chris's death, he doesn't really have much credibility either. He actually has been getting the majority of his info from the Chris threads that have been going on at the gossip forum site Lipstick Alley ever since Chris passed away. You can find a vast wealth of information about his death, his shady in-laws, his foundation as well as stories about the kind of person and singer-songwriter Chris was there. Here are links to the first 12 threads:

            We may be on a gossip site there, but it's turned into a pretty firmindable collective on investigating the ridiculous amount of inconsistencies that have been going on since 11:00 PM May 17 with Chris Cornell. His wife has changed stories since she first talked to the Detroit Police, and has constantly pushed a false narrative that he is a drug addict and that Ativan made him accidentally kill himself, even though his toxicology report came back proving no amount of the drugs that were prescribed and in his system could have caused what happened. Speaking as a devoted fan of Chris's for almost 30 years, I watched how he quickly abandoned his life in Seattle after he met this second wifs, who with her family,  have transformed Chris' life over the past 14-15 years, and I honestly had been fearing the worst. He had to tour constantly to provide such a luxurious lifestyle to his own family as well as his wife's entire shady mobstery family. There is so much wrong with the Karayiannis family. Although most of their info has been expertly scrubbed, the mother-in-law was a loose cannon on Twittter for the entire first 2-3 weekst after Chris died - she attacked her usual favorite targets -  Eddie Vedder &amp; Susan Silver (his 1st wifs from 1990-2004 as well as the manager of Soundgarden until 1997). However, she got about as low as possible when she went after the only one of Chris's 5 siblings who could stand the in-laws because he refused to follow their Ativan narrative. Peter started a suicide awareness on his social media with push-ups for Chris, and the mother-in-law threatened him on Twitter over him using the word "suicide." Her account went down shortly after, but there are screenshots posted of all of the important tweets from her account on Lipstick Alley.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's just a drop in the bucket of what is messed up and suspicious with his death. Many, many more details can be found in the threads at Lipstick Alley. After Chester's death on Chris's birthday, it was clear there are even more unanswered questions, and I believe that there have been major financial mishandlings of the Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation, most likely by the Karayiannis family. Chris has repeatedly said over the years that he stays out of the finances &amp; created that foundation for Vicky to do charity work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I strongly urge to you researchers who have been working on the Pizzagate case for over a year to take a look into the foundation as well as into the Karayiannis family as they have ties to the 1% in NYC, LA, Miami, Paris, Greece, Eastern Europe, Russia, and who knows where else. They are almost impossible to find info on - they have superior scrubbing skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really know how much truth there is to the story that Chris was going to expose the horrors of these human trafficking and pedophile rings because I have yet to see a reliable source for this. My own take is he discovered the foundation had been suspended by the state of California because of not filing tax paperwork sometime over the past year &amp; he started looking into it himself. It's not really too far fetched to think he could have found something that could have led to either his suicide or even his murder.

             Great comment, well written and concise. I believe you are conveying an important direction of investigation when you mention Cornell's Greek/Italian family. You are right, the Karayiannis family doesn't register very well on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             I enjoy Lipstick Alley, the place is becoming renowned for celebrities and those in and around LA that are spilling some serious tea.

                  Honestly I came here to mock not help. However finding a bottom feeder like yourself is why people talk about a cherry on top.

                  It's a shame that cherry uses other peoples delusion(you're back in) about child rape to promote themselves, but bottom feeder is as bottom feeder does.

            However hastily and poorly thrown together this thread is, as well as for the earlier speculation and curiosity of this OP's newly acquired membership, this thread does seem to have some meat to pick off the bones.

            There might be reason here not to too quickly dismiss what he/she is attempting to describe.

            The quoted material from the above
            <strong>
             twitter link
            </strong>
            does cite an actual

             heavy metal
            </strong>
            fan web blog who's site admin/owner
            <strong>
             is literally citing foul play and 'pedogate' influence in the deaths of both Cornell and Bennington.

            makes some very good points regarding the mental health of both individuals and cited several reasons why neither men should have had any reason to leave such a successful legacy in the prime of their lives.

            But something more striking appeared which seems to
            <strong>
             lend some weight to the entire nonsense:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "I reported 2 months back that an anonymous source close to Chris Cornell’s camp said Chris was killed because he was allegedly getting ready to expose some high level pedophiles in Hollywood and Washington. HOLE’s
             <strong>
              Courtney Love
             </strong>
             purportedly turned up in a black book tied to an elite pedo sicko, so fans have begun to question a possible tie-in."
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            This claim is entirely true   EPSTEIN'S BLACK BOOK -

             NAMES LISTED

A rumor has long circulated for years that claimed Love had her husband Kurt Cobain of grunge rock act NIRVANA murdered back in 1994 and staged his assassination to look like a suicide."

            This, ladies and gentlemen, completes the circuit of an entirely plausible scenario, however it went down and  how everything was understood, it would be difficult to create an entire picture at this point and who knows what truth can ever be told, but there does happen to be a couple other strange clues in the area of the wives of these men, specifically Bennington's wife when:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Talinda Bennington, Chester’s wife,  posted a tweet on July 21 that was later removed and said to have been posted by a hacker that said , “He didn’t kill himself, he was
            <em>
             already DEAD
            </em>
            before he killed himself. I have proof…”

            Maybe they both

            more than we think.
