<p>(HOW THE ARTICLE STARTS)</p>
<p>Sean Adl-Tabatabai–Netflix documentary series ‘The Keepers‘ links Clinton campaign chair John Podesta to a high-level government pedophile ring.</p>
<p>The show documents a government-connected pedophile ring involving the Catholic church and the murder of a woman who was about to come forward to the police with damning evidence about the abuse committed against various children.</p>
<p>The show vindicates what alternative media websites have been saying for years – namely that elite pedophile rings operate within the highest echelons of government involving famous politicians and world leaders, and confirms that such scandals are systematically covered up by the powers-that-be in collusion with our media institutions.</p>
<p>In the show, tesimony makes reference to a man nicknamed ‘Skippy’ who was involved in Cathy’s murder. ‘Skippy’ is the nickname John Podesta used as detailed in various emails leaked to WikiLeaks.</p>',

            Sorry anything this guy, Sean Adl-Tabatabai touches turns to shit. He's a complete liar and always has been. Yournewswire is garbage. He stole equipment from the David Icke themed The Peoples Voice internet based channel and run the forum into the ground.

             In the show, tesimony makes reference to a man nicknamed ‘Skippy’ who was involved in Cathy’s murder. ‘Skippy’ is the nickname John Podesta used as detailed in various emails leaked to WikiLeaks.

           <p>
            I thought 'Skippy' was determined to be his nickname from that "fatherhood" video off that weird world corp website. Are there emails confirming this nickname? I wasn't aware of this.

             Yes, he's also quoted saying he has an alter ego named Skippy. The video from World Corp doesn't say skippy. That was never proven. But he himself has said his alter ego is named Skippy. Even James Woods on Twitter has called out John Podesta and addressed him as Skippy.

              No, but the video from world corp the man sings "I'm John Podesta", although he blurs the ending of podesta as he growls it while the kid screams louder. Shills in here kept saying they didn't here it. There was noththing else being said by anybody else, so everybody heard it.

               You're not wrong. People are hearing different sounds in it. And the kid is singing a song from the show Couille and it's all mixed in there so many people hear him saying stuff from the song from Couille which makes us all question what we were watching. Regardless, that is a child being tortured in that video and voice analysts matched the guys voice PERFECTLY with John Podesta.

                 Seriously I thought that too. There is a GIANT thread on here about it. If you find it, please post the link in here. I'm quite sure researchers found out the kid was not saying, Skippy. But that doesn't mean that's not his other name. He has come right out and said that is his name. Keep digging. You're doing awesome and asking all the right questions.

                   That's what I thought. I always heard John but never heard Skippy.

             Have you seen the documentary? I watched it last year and for some reason never made that connection. It's possible I didn't have the knowledge about Skippy yet when I watched it.

              nah i didnt see it. its just a usual reaction of a blue pilled listener.
the human mind is very fragile, most of the "confirmed conspiracy theories" if not all get denied and laughed at by the masses as conspiracy theory bullshit. they just can not accept it.

            I have to watch this and note the connections to my research over the past few years but... you know... it's kind of depressing and triggering as a token gift baby appropriated and given to other parents by the Catholic Church. I tell you when the Church is fully exposed so that nobody would think of joining it or indoctrinating their child into it, I will be happy. I did not baptize my daughter, I told her about religions growing up and said that she can join whichever one she wants. But if she does, she'll have to go through the longer study path of converting adults, so she can know what she is getting into :) It's been great to discuss with her how to be a good person outside of just following the usual religious rules.

           <p>
            BTW, my adoptive mother was a nun and I know for a fact that nunneries (where girls are sent to as teenagers) are the seat of much abuse and it's a HUGE BIG SECRET that the church is trying to keep quiet.

             Agree. Thanks for pointing this out. There was a big scandal already in 19th century Rome, when it turned out that elder nuns in a nunnery sexually abused the younger ones (together with a high-ranking male member of the Vatican).

               There was a local woman who researched this. She's a hero. She spend tons of money to get access to old documents. Many former children who lived at that home came forward, but there haven't been any sexual abuse allegations. The children seem to have died of deseases, and, as you said, of neglect, which is bad enough, of course. They just threw them away in a pit when they had died.

                yer. There was a similar mass grave in a nunnery in Ireland, though, about 300 bodies i think, and they were sexually abused according to survivors

               You're welcome, Eva. I think the nunnery was called Sant Ambrosio. Someone wrote a book about it, which seems to have been a bit sensationalist, but based on the documents of a trial.

             The whole teaching of celibacy is all false and based on pure shit. The apostle Peter had a wife because in Luke 4:38 it says he has a mother-in-law which means he was married. That was never a stipulation from God. He made man and woman to be together. Celibate is just an open invitation for perversion.

               No, not to say that because they're abstinent from such things makes them such, but they give in to other sexual desires that are unnatural. There is a scripture that says, "If you cannot be single, marry." Basically saying, don't tempt yourself if you know that you're discipline is not strong enough. Well, these priests have no business remaining celibate. None whatsoever because they're doing it as if it's completely scriptural and it's not. And that's fine that Paul was, Peter was not. You can't do what someone else does that worked for them, it may not work for you. "Each one is drawn out and enticed by their own desires."

              Also for isolation. The goal is not the same as the consequence. Upper-class families sent one of their own to the Church... it is the cost of staying in the upper class and continuing to belong to secret societies, you MUST make a gift of a child. My adoptive mother was sent to the nunnery against her will as the family's offering (16). The other daughter was married off to a much older Florida magistrate. I am not sure if mom was a sociopath before, but she was definitely a sociopath after, like the victim of some weird experiments to make people inhumane.

                I don't write about this because I didn't understand how it fits into the bigger picture. It's amazing the stuff we will accept when compartmentalized and made to believe certain people have authority over the matter. Looking into this is extremely upsetting and triggering.

               Yes, extreme abuse, such as ritual abuse, can turn a child or person into a sociopath. That is known. Simple put, you either join them or you are terminated. Sick sick bastards, the Deletes

             Everyone needs to do a tour at the MET in New York called "The Woman and the Seed" and they would see the full pagan scope as to why the church is the way it is. They care more about tradition rather than truth.

              Found this.  It surely shows us that some did not see the real story and history.  They thought it was just another way to force them into religion.  No.  The last person truly gets it and explains the meaning behind The Woman and the Seed.

              I think it was interesting how they traced every belief through history as an exaggeration of Nimrod. They also used every bow and every arrow they could find to prove that certain civilization was worshiping Nimrod and thus, worshiping Satan.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also remember that they traced Greek and Roman mythology back to Nimrod (they established early on that he was Baal, which upon further research, many have arrived to the same conclusion) and how Satan was so eager to hide the truth that he incorporated these false gods to drive them away from the true God.
             </p>
             <p>
              Overall, the tour is interesting if you're into history and I guess since it takes place in a museum full of artifacts, it makes it "scholarly".

               It's absolutely true. If you look at many of the traditions, Catholic, Holidays, Christmas, it all can be traced to Nimrod. And I'm not clicking on that link as it says "ExJW." I've done the MET tour and am doing it again in a few weeks. Ex JW = Angry

                All religions where dickered with to twist them into vehicles to steer us toward Satan, the Devil.  I remember the quote about  Satan convincing us that he did not exist.  That is ridiculous since we read and hear and see evil all day everyday globally.  Who is causing these people to commit these horrid crimes?  Hmm.  I wonder.  We must try to steer those that are fleeing religions back toward God.  No need for the trappings of religion.  Just a need of God.  Just pray to God.  Forget your house of worship.  They only exist to suck up our money and twist the words of God.

                 I'm sorry you feel that way about all houses of worship, carmen. There are good ones left. The trick is finding them. The Bible says do not forsake the gathering of yourselves together. I know how you feel because tbh I haven't been going myself, for reasons that have nothing to do with the church I left. More like one or two people in it. 😕 Good places are out there, I hope you won't give up on it! I suppose I should get back there myself and not let petty stuff get in the way 😞 PRAY FOR ME!

                 Yes but there are many God's in the world. Satan himself is a god. The bible says he's the god of this system. So when you're you're praying, what God do you pray to? What name do you use to be sure that you're speaking to THE God, the creator?

                     I can't stand the Jehovah's Witnesses. No offense to you personally! But they have a pedophile problem and a cover up problem. It is a known safe haven for pedophiles. Don't be fooled!

                      A pedofile problem? Wheres your proof? I don't doubt that there have been issues in some congregations but to lump all JW together as having a pedo problem ?  This is really scary to see people not even thouroughly research stuff before they label  JWs as having a pedo problem . Believe me if this was a  " known " thing I would not be affiliated with them.

                       The elders don't feel it is their duty to warn congregations if there are known pedophiles in their midst. Instead they cover it up and protect them. Simply do a search if you are interested in the problem. I'll also add that the entire church--more aptly called a cult--is built on lies.

                         What do you mean you won't click on apostate material? Don't you think the abused children that left your chuech for a very good reason are worth hearing out? This is a perfect illustration of their problem. Anyone making a claim of harm gets branded an apostate! You won't even click. Man, that's messed up.

                          I  never said that I didn't sympathize with the abused . I have already been to all those websites before I made my informed decision to get baptized . I also was abused as a child and it wasn't by a JW . I wasn't raised as one . Please don't put words in my mouth as so many anti JW do .

                             this isn't by ex jw, you should give it a glance. Especially telling was the bit about "theocratic warfare", an actual Jehovah's Witnesses doctrine that encourages followers to lie to protect their religion. Since the 1950's.

                              So your telling me that I've been taught to lie? That's funny I  never remember studying that doctrine .. really ? If you want to know what we believe and what the Bible really teaches just go to JW.org . We don't teach people to lie or to be pedo protectors . If that was common place I'd be one of the first to speak up about it !

                                What that news report says is so twisted and so CNN ! The article you sent me earlier is written by someone who says Pizzagate is fake news so .. do a little research on " Tray "   As far as the 2 witness rule goes , that is from the Bible . Jesus outlined a specific procedure for solving serious problems that may arise between fellow Christians. Note the steps that he set out at Matt. 18:15-17 If your brother commits a sin, [1] go and reveal his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, [2] take along with you one or two more, so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. If he does not listen to them, [3] speak to the congregation. If he does not listen even to the congregation, let him be to you just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.”​ 
This is where it comes from . I have faith that if there is pedofile coveruping going on still in Australia congregations that it will be exposed just like the rest of the pedos being exposed globally . I'm sorry if you don't like the 2 witness rule but it is a Bible teaching . This rule doesn't mean that if a child or anyone comes to an elder and says " this person touched me " that the person had to have a witness ! The elders would listen for goodness sakes ! They wouldnt say " sorry you need a witness "  This is how people are misinformed about our beliefs and a CNN news story with full on editing capabilities isn't gonna fly here .

                                  When you as " do I think these news stations are making this up " well They have banned JWs in Russia due to being labeled as extreme and there is video evidence of the Russian authorities planting fake literature in our Kingdom Halls so... nowadays you never know .. btw did your make an account solely to attack JWs, because I looked at your profile and though you have been here along time , you've made no contributions to PG ? Only comments .. seriously though it sparked my curiosity.

                                   I only do comments, not posts. This is my first time to talk about the JW cult. Btw some of these links are news reels that came from American news stations. Nice try though. Also convenient to brush them off as "fake news". CNN doesn't fake everything. When it comes to JWs, they don't have an agenda. If Trump or some other prominent conservative were JW, maybe I'd see your point, but he's not.

                                  Are you kidding me? Like I said please don't put words in my mouth . Please see my prior comment where I said " they should and will be exposed if that is what they are doing "  . I've commented for months about this . It turns my stomach to hear this stuff ! I still will not lump them all together , just like I won't lump all Catholics , etc together ! The fact is, I believe the message of hope that comes directly from the Bible and not any imperfect humans mouth . No other religion is preaching the hope of a resurrection . In all my studies I have yet to come across a religion that doesn't preach " when you die you go to heaven or hell "  according to the Bible that's not true .  I have always respected your comments here on voat and if you want to talk about Bible truths , like I said before , I'm all ears .

                                   Pointing out fallacies isn't putting words in your mouth. You may think your organization has policies in place to protect kids, that may be what you would like to believe, but that isn't what the record shows.

                                   %27s_Witnesses%27_handling_of_child_sex_abuse I take great issue with this: "A Watch Tower Society representative testified that the organization does not consider itself responsible for the "physical protection" of children in the community.[32][33] " Even more, I take issue that even if the elders find evidence of pedophilia that person is allowed to stay in the church if they demonstrate repentance. "Anyone found to have sexually molested a child, based upon the criteria established by the organization, and deemed by the elders to not demonstrate sufficient repentance is disfellowshipped from the congregation and shunned.[36]

                                   The elders are instructed to gauge the abuser's repentance based upon their subsequent visible support of congregation activities, such as attending congregation meetings, and actively supporting the denomination's door-to-door work.[37] The sustained participation in the group's activities has resulted in sexual predators remaining in good standing in the congregation.[38] "

An abuser who is judged repentant by a committee of elders is given a 'public reproof', wherein it is announced to the congregation that the named individual "has been reproved", though the nature of their crime is not stated.[36] Such a person is automatically debarred from serving in any appointed position in the congregation, however privileges can be restored in the future depending on whether he or she is deemed by the branch office to be a "known molester".[39] A few weeks later, a talk may be given to the congregation, discussing the type of sin and the need to be on guard against it, but the reproved individual is not named in connection with this talk.[40] It is the intention that the talk about the type of sin, and the previously made announcement of reproof, should allow other congregation members to interpret what type of sin had been committed.[41] When reprimanded, sex offenders may not offer public prayers, read paragraphs during congregation studies, or be given even minor responsibilities in the congregation, such as handling microphones or distributing literature in the Kingdom Hall.

                                   Sex offenders are still permitted to participate in the congregation's house-to-house preaching. According to the Watch Tower Society's spokesperson, J. R. Brown, such ones are only allowed to preach when accompanied by a responsible adult.[42] In 2016, a convicted pedophile was filmed going door-to-door for the denomination.[43][44]"

                                    This pdf from the JW legal department makes it clear that ALL JWs report crimes to authorities. We report elders to authorities as well, if they try to cover up crimes. If an elder ever covered up a crime, or this person ever heard an elder say that... well the instruction is clear. From the top down, every JW is in agreement. That elder should have been reported (if it ever happened). We all take this very seriously.

                                     you found one measly CYA doc on the JW website that appears dated last month (see bottom left on each page of the document, it says 4/18)

                                     This was probably posted to stem the tide of lawsuits that resulted from their heretical doctrine and their corrupt and or foolish elders. Needless to say, I don't feel sorry for the plight of the cult. They deserve lawsuits and the church elders, some at least, deserve prison. Why, oh WHY, would you CHOOSE to stay on a church where sex offenders get to stay in the congregation?!??! That's in the document YOU linked, page two. The proof is in the pudding, and their pudding is full of rotten fruit. Broken families, victimized children, and brainwashed individuals. You're here because you became skeptical about a group of individuals in D.C. being the friendly neighborhood pizza shop they made themselves out to be but your skepticism flies away because "noes my Jehovah's Witnesses". Ugh. I'm seriously pissed that you can't read between the lines. Read page 2 part 11. Read it slow. They admit it. They admit it. THEY ADMIT IT!

                                      You make a good point. I too struggle with the idea of forgiving people for this sin. The rule 11 is about trying to give them an honest chance to change, like Jesus asks of us. Jesus was perfect. We aren’t.” You claimed that this is both heretical and hastily created recently. It is neither. As you can see, scripture supports every rule. It’s heretical for people who cherry pick their Bible verses. Also, if you sift through decades of our publications you will find this has been the guideline/suggestion/rule for a long time. 
 We are instructed to pray for our enemies , It’s hard, but God still sees them as human. Consider the example of Manasseh. He killed innocents, practiced witchcraft. The Bible doesn’t need to mention, but he likely practiced all forms of deprived sex magic. His reign was just about the last straw for God, and then the nation was judged and enslaved by Babylon. Yet later... Manasseh was forgiven. I'm glad I'm not the Judge here , especially since only God knows what has happened to these ones that made them like this in the first place . What if a person truly changed and turned away from bad , then spent the rest of their lives proving they had changed , by practicing good things? If places of worship put a sign on the door that says "not all are welcomed " that would go against Jesus teachings and no doubt offend a lot of people . I'm not trying to make you angry , just trying to be reasonable. I have faith that God will soon put an end to it all and the wicked will be destroyed at Armageddon! That's what the Bible teaches . That's where my hope is , in Gods word . You don't have to agree with my hope or my thinking , but there are over 11 million people and counting that share this belief . They come from all walks of life . 
By the way, I find rule 1 quite reasonable. Here’s why:
1. Law enforcement would be duly informed.
2. Victim protected.
3. ALL parents in the congregation informed.
4. Offender is monitored.
5. The elders rigorously determine if the offender is repentant.
6. ALL JWs know these rules and have an opportunity to address the elders about the enforcement to their satisfaction.
An offender has to be REALLY willing to humbly serve God  and repent to put up with the constant scrutiny that parents in the congregation will be giving, to undergo the shame and humiliation of being exposed, to be interrogated by the elders....
Pardon me if This seems foolish to you, but this seems to be a loving provision from a wise and merciful God. It is exactly like I would expect from Jehovah. I do respect that imperfect humans are implementing these rules. There will be errors, but it’s better than any other organization has come up with.
Before Jesus, we would have just stoned this person to death. After Jesus’ we see that there is hope of forgiveness. Here we are seeing our organization go to the full length to actually apply the provision from that sacrifice. There is only one thing that can be read between the lines in rule 11 is the same as what is read between the lines for the Bible in general: “some humans may pick and choose what rules they will apply and what rules they will ignore and we trust that God will deal with that in His time”.

                                     All that arguing and back and forth.  I certainly understand your side, such brow beating by another member here.  You admitted that there are those that somehow infiltrate, just like the have in other religions.  Enough already.

                                    The link you provided was about the name of God wiki ,  it wasn't the site where you copied your content from FYI .. as far as your issues with public reproof and disfellowshipping goes , that's what keeps the congregation clean and it is also a Bible teaching . That's not to say people don't creep in and deceive ones that's for sure . If an elder really said that it isn't their responsibility to protect children or policy or whatever , he obviously was one who crept in and deceived . It happens and will continue I'm sure until the whole earth is cleansed of all evil !

                             I do not think all the believers are pedophiles, but I think they have a systemic pedophile problem based on the diseased inner working of the church. The belief system and hierarchy of the elders as somehow infallible allowed the cancer of pedophilia to grow and spread. Word  gets out and pedophiles know where to go to have a safe haven. That's how they operate. You're not going to change my mind on this. I've known too many and seen too much. I'm definitely not calling you a pedo, but if you continue to try and rebut me I will continue to post inconvenient truths. You won't read them since they upset your cozy worldview, but others may. How long would you like for this to continue? There's an endless supply.

                    Jesus can be used or Dear Lord, When you use God's name as in Dear God, that is when he will know by the words you say.  I don't think the devil's ears will perk up when you say Dear God, thank you for all the wonders of nature and the bountiful foods and the Guardian Angel you have sent to Guide Me.  That's just an example.  What I am trying to convey, is that God will feel your love.  He will know you are speaking to him by your Loving Message.

                     You got that right friend ! God knows our hearts but he has also put in place a congregation of his true worshippers . At this point , we all have nothing to lose only knowledge to gain ... why not simply study the Bible with someone who is likeminded ? Someone who wants truth as bad as you do ? That would be the JWs my dear friend . We never stop searching and are willing to admit when we've had things wrong . No other religion has changed their traditions in order to please God .
Christmas for instance  , JWs use to celebrate it . They found out the origin of it and quit celebrating it .

                      Yes, I know what you told me about Easter too.  It will take a lot in my family to stop the Holy Holidays.  We color eggs and always make them colors of the tulips.  Ever since I was  little I always told my Mom they remind me of the flowers.  Christmas we put the Baby Jesus in our Stable we have on Christmas Morning.  His crib is empty until then.  I never go to Church to celebrate any of them now.  We used to have a child place the Baby but they are all grown now.  So I do it.   I know this is silly, but I have a statue of the Blessed Virgin and I put a

                       Nothing you've done is silly .. your heart is right and God knows it .  I remember when I threw out all my holiday decorations and my neighbors all thought I was crazy . One neighbor in particular who was a staunch catholic is now studying the Bible with one of my friends . She lived across the street from me for years and saw me transform my life . Then 15 years later I find out she's studying the Bible with JWs . The stories like these are endless . God is amazing .

                        We are amazing too.  It took centuries for us to get to where we are but it will slowly transform I believe.  As people start waking up, others will follow.  I think example is the best way.  You are a good teacher.

                          I think all of us and those that have Our Hearts in the right place will all end up in the same place, no matter what religion we identify with.  &lt;3

                     This. I mean, God isn't dumb. He knows His flock. I was always taught to end my prayers with  "in Jesus' name". But it's not about pointing my prayer to the right being, it's more like "if these things I am asking for are part of Your will; if not, I acquiesce to Your greater plan" My God is bigger and smarter and stronger and greater than any other so I don't have to worry about mixed signals. 😁

                      I believe there probably are places, but I am way too busy now on here to even care.  I don't think God will be angry at me or others after what we have been through.  I am not worried about it, for I think God understands his flock like you say.  Don't feel bad about it either.  What we are doing here is not going unnoticed.  Our Hearts are in the right place.
