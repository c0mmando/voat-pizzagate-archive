            Roy Cohn is a notable figure because:  (1)  Trump called him his "mentor."  Cohn and Trump were very good friends for years.  (2)  Cohn has been dubbed the CIA Pedophile Ringleader.  (3)  He was dirty as hell (mob ties).

             Furthermore, he was Roger Stone's mentor. According to NYPD Gold Shield detective Jim Rothstein Stone was instrumental in running the underage gay prostitution blackmail operations.
             <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/tag/roy-cohn/">
              http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/tag/roy-cohn/
             </a>
             "“Watch for this guy Stone,” Jim said. “I saw him in an interview about Spitzer a few days ago and thought I recognized him. I looked back at my old investigations and remembered that he was part of Roy Cohn’s whole thing.” (ibid)
            </p>
            <p>
             "Jim was referring to Roy Cohn’s sexual blackmail operation. According to Jim, this operation was conducted “under the guise of fighting communism” (ibid). During his time as a police detective, Rothstein had an opportunity to sit down with infamous McCarthy committee counsel Roy Cohn (ibid). Cohn admitted to Rothstein that he was part of a rather elaborate sexual blackmail operation that compromised politicians with child prostitutes (ibid). Roger Stone began working with Cohn when he was the northeast chairman of Reagan’s 1980 campaign (Labash, no pagination). Cohn and Stone had began building an alliance a year earlier when Cohn introduced Stone to mobster Fat Tony Salerno at Cohn’s Manhattan townhouse (ibid). According to the Weekly Standard’s Matt Labash, “Stone loved Cohn” (ibid). Stone said of Cohn: “He didn’t give a [expletive removed] what people thought, as long as he was able to wield power. He worked the gossip columnists in [New York] like an organ” (ibid)."

              Did you watch the video?  Cohn and McCarthy were BLACKMAILING faggots and commies.
             </p>
             <p>
              My opinion of him has changed in light of this new info.  He was just another poser like all the rest.

             <p>
              And to answer your question, the "mob" (mafia) is JEWISH.

               Ok in Chicago but I assume the mob refers to mafia i.e. Italian.  No I didn't watch the video I read an 800 page book by m Stanton Evans.  You're calling a great patriot a poser? What do you think of Nixon?

                Italian/Sicilian mob = crypto ("Catholic") Jewish.  Chicago and NY are their primary bases in the U.S.  You knew that, right?  There is a Russian mafia (Meyer Lansky, et al) that is also Jewish.  The Mormon mafia is crypto Jewish.
               </p>
               <p>
                More on Cohn:  "And the whole notion of anti-communism as saving America was the convenient bait used in a basic Hegelian dialectical system. Cohn was vice president of rabbi George Sokolsky’s political action committee, the American Jewish League Against Communism (this league officially endorsed the Jewish-controlled John Birch Society, which has tentacles all over the alt right). Not only did Cohn’s sex ring help him advance his legal career, it helped him advance Jewish interests, specifically its capitalist dialectic in the West."
               </p>
               <p>
                Cohn-McCarthy were controlled opposition.  I know "they" murdered McCarthy when they were through using him.  Was Cohn involved?  (rhetorical)
               </p>
               <p>
                Nixon was put into office by Prescott Bush and he was taken out of office by Prescott Bush.  Bush wanted his man Ford in there.  Watergate may have been about retrieving "little black book" of Howard Dean's hooker wife (see Len Colodny's book).  Nixon was terrified they were going to kill him like they did JFK (he was on in that too).  That's why he didn't want to go to Water Reed for his phlebitis ("I won't come out").  They took down Spiro Agnew first; Bush didn't want him, he wanted Ford his trusty toad (see Warren Commission).
               </p>
               <p>
                BTW, HRC tried to screw Nixon out of his constitutional right to counsel.  I have no evidence but theory that Bush may have been behind that.  I think Watergate is when HRC and the Bushes first teamed up.
