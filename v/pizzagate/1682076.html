<p>“For the large majority of people, watching explicit or violent porn doesn’t actually have real life negative effects,” he said.

<p>“Without allowing options like virtual sex, we’re basically saying you can’t have any kind of sexuality,” he said. “We are saying ‘Don’t have feelings, don’t have desires, just eliminate it,’ and I don’t think that’s realistic.&quot;</p>

            the recidivism rate with paedophiles is 100% because their sexual preference is children. the only way they can not offend is by remaining celibate and i think we all know that the likelihood of that is very low. having sex with a child is rape 100% of the time. as a victim of childhood sexual abuse i can testify to the long term psychological and physical damage children suffer from permanently and thats if they survive the assault. groups like nambla try to normalise paedophilia in my books they should shut up and not break the law by engaging in deviant behaviour with minors they can try to justify their behaviour all they like i'm not buying into it

            I do however agree that a public database is not necessarily a good idea because it will result in vigilantism. I would be more inclined to use a strike basis, so if somebody is convicted of a sexual offence once and does not serve time for it (because it's not quite serious enough) then they shouldn't be on a public database - a restricted one yes, such which would be used by agencies to run a criminal record check for example. Now if somebody either commits a sexual offence again or it is serious enough as to warrant imprisonment, maybe with a minimum of a 12 month sentence, then there may be grounds for a public database. It could result in harassment of offenders and that's not exactly ethical, but if it reduces offending because it acts as a deterrent then so be it. I just don't think somebody should be on public records because they put their hand up a woman's skirt in a pub, which probably happens occasionally and lands people on the register, but for serious offences I'd say there is a case for debate.

            <p>

           <p>
            If that were true then it would imply that product advertising has no effect. Since advertising clearly does work then surely it follows that virtual pornography would also have an impact in respect of an
            <em>
             impression
            </em>
            (an advertising term).
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of depicting immoral sexual conduct, it would be tantamount to promoting such as acceptable behaviour. Fact of the matter is that attacking children is inhumane and thus the glorification of a suffering child is also inhumane.
           </p>
           <p>
            It goes without saying that there is a victim in regards to child pornography, so I guess there's an argument here as to whether or not there is indeed a victim in regards to virtual depiction. I personally feel that it is a moot point because, as said above, it is pretty much glorification and will only serve to condition an individual into thinking it's okay to target children in such a way. Ultimately, engaging in child pornography, virtual or actual, raises the genuine risk of a physical offence being committed later on. So really this isn't about whether or not virtual depiction should be legal, this is about the deliberate conditioning of individuals to eventually commit a real offence against a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, virtual depiction of child pornography most likely already is illegal, and rightly so.
           </p>
          </p>

            Pedos can not be trusted PERIOD!
I think that in certain cases, convicted child rapists, should be sterilized.  Isolated communities of fellow pedos/child rapist should be built. Preferably like Alcatraz or Gitmo!  Paid for by the frozen assets and money seized of Soros, Clinton's, Bushes, &amp; RthChds.

            This guy is sick in the head, as far as I am concerned.  He IS a pedo or he IS getting paid Big Bucks to say it.  Just because someone puts a DR. in front of their name does not mean they can be trusted.  Remember that Dr. that abused all of his little patients, Bradley I think was his name.  Is this also the co. of Ashton Kutcher is it not?  Thorn.
