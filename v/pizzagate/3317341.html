<p>Some main take-aways from the article are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Redheads do process pain differently due to the fact that the variance MC1R gene that causes red hair also affects the brain, pain perception and other processes. Meaning: there are legitimate biological differences associated with red hair versus everyone else. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of the publicized cases of DID - including Kim Noble, Jenny Haynes and others have clearly natural red hair. Other individuals not known to have DID but who are associated with ritual abuse imagery <strong>and pizzagate,</strong> like Arrington de Dionyso, also have red hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red is the rarest hair color on the planet, and DID is seen in a tiny percentage of the population: common sense would indicate that the vast number of people with DID and red hair should be statistically improbable if it were due to random chance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In attempting to account for this trend, there are a few explanations that come to mind, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rh Negative blood factor. There is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that those with Rh-negative blood are more likely to have red or red-tinted hair. At this time no scientific study has linked the two, so this potential explanation remains frustratingly impossible to prove. HR Giger, who showed insider knowledge of pizzagate coded symbols, also made reference to Rh factor in at least one piece of his art. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neanderthal DNA. It was commonly believed that the known intermingling of Neanderthal and human DNA in Western Europe may have been the origin of red hair, but that theory has <a href="https://archive.is/GmibZ">since been debunked</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red Haired Giants. Although the most outlandish potential explanation, it actually has more evidence surrounding it than either of the two previously mentioned theories. Red haired giants have been documented in myth across the Americas, and physically unusual red-haired mummies are openly on display in South America, specifically Peru. DNA testing has reportedly indicated that some parts of their genetic code is of unknown origin. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than assuming that this unknown DNA is the result of extra-terrestrial or &quot;Nephilim&quot; inbreeding, I think it is likely that these abnormal individuals who appear quite commonly in the historical record, especially around mound-builder sites in the Americas, represent an evolutionary cousin of modern humans, which was both physiologically and <em>behaviorally</em> different in comparison with modern man. Oral histories suggest these individuals were horrifically violent and cannibalistic. </p>
<p>Is this unknown species the ultimate source of ritual abuse, cannibalism, and the ritualized splitting of the psyche into fragmented selves? Is it the source of, or associated with, Rh negative blood?</p>
<p>Though subjects like Rh-negative, red haired giants and the intermingling of Neanderthals with humans are well known and have been explored by many others, the discussion of red hair in terms of multiple personality disorder (DID) is unique to my knowledge. It is currently impossible to reach a definitive conclusion on what might be driving this connection, and multiple theories discussed in this article may be connected in some way to this finding.</p>
<p>I hope other researchers will add to the thoughts presented here in future, and fill in more of the missing pieces of this picture.</p>',

             Interesting. I think this is showing a propensity to split in situations of early abuse, so would not expect to see it in someone who had a normal childhood. Overall though, in those abuse situations, it seems as if people with red hair are far more likely than average to split into MPD/DID, for what reason I don't know.

            I wonder if this has to do with Melanin levels

           <p>
            Albino's having none, I expect some red heads next in line for lack of melanin

             No it's not to do with melanin. If you read the steemit post it talks about the recognized effects of a specific gene variation in redheads.

               Variance in melanin has not been recognized to have a biological effect on people beyond the obvious in terms of Vitamin D production, while the specific gene change in MC1R seen in redheads has a number of documented follow-on effects, including effects on the brain and nervous system, as well as pain perception. Rather than this being an issue of high or low melanin, I think it's to do with the specific changes in the body associated with MC1R, some of which I speculate are either unstudied or actively covered up.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, the changes in pain perception might also have something to do with a person's likelihood to split into multiple personalities during early childhood abuse, rather than a different form of dissociation.

             Yes? I am not saying that every person with red hair is evil or whatever, am looking specifically at people with multiple personality disorder or associated with ritual abuse that also have red hair.

              Have you ever thought that multiple personality disorder is a direct result of terror....or mind control protocol? And that they are targeted for extinction or mind blowing for their superiority in psychic ability? Have read that those with blue blood or elites purposely have children with indigenous to increase that ability...i.e the engineered potato famine which was horrific and engineered by GB. Survivors saw entire communities die a slow agonizing death. Also re. GB , they are the supposedly heart of ley lines at Glastonbury.....Ley lines are to the earth as human chakra systems.........those with psychic ability are seen as a threat by the ones who want to dominate.

               We live two lives, one awake and one asleep. About the blood, for the true in the know it is always about FLOW maybe you should test it? by breath left/right or to mixture with flow to right/left arm of blood by a bracelet. Mixture with it and see what happens.....😂

               Some of the people discussed in the actual steemit post (which it seems most commenters didn't bother to read) have multiple personality disorder and red hair but do not claim to have been abused by MKULTRA or ritual abuse groups (Like Jenny Haynes for example). In other words, not every person with DID was ritually abused, and despite that we still see a lot of the people with DID popping up with red hair. My point is to say that there seems to be a
               <strong>
                correlation
               </strong>
               between red hair and a likelihood to fragment into dissociative identities, especially in light of the fact that  the variant gene for red hair is already recognized to have multiple biological effects.

             Mentioned those in the steemit piece, and they are very interesting. Worth noting that they are "normal" humans in terms of size and skull shape, but some of the mitochondrial DNA still couldn't be accounted for, which even Forbes reported.

             A lot of these red haired mummies - whether giant and abnormal or not - seem to be in situations where they are of the ruling class. It would make sense for "elite" circles to cover this up, even if it's not literally because of ET genes or "nephilim" or whatever, doesn't mean they would want this known.

              When bones of giants etc. are donated to the Smithsonian they disappear. Engineered history = US.

               Seems like it. Luckily the Smithsonian didn't get its hands on some of the bones from South America.

              I agree. Wasn't the red hair associated with the elongated skulls of the ruling class?

               Yes, if you actually read the steemit piece, it talks about that. The post above was a dot-point summary of the steemit article which is 4500 words and much more specific.
