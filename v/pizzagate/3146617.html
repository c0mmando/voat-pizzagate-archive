<blockquote>
<p>“I believed Keith Raniere’s intentions were to help people and I was wrong,” Mack told a judge in federal court in Brooklyn as she pleaded guilty to racketeering charges.</p>

<p>Mack is best known for her role as a young Superman’s close friend on the series Smallville.</p>
<p>She said: “I know I can and will be a better person.” Her sentencing was set for 11 September.</p>
<p><strong>The plea means Mack will avoid going to trial with Ranière, heiress Clare Bronfman and another member of Raniere’s inner circle, Kathy Russell. All have pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.</strong></p>
<p>Potential jurors were expected to begin filling out questionnaires on Monday. Opening statements are scheduled for 29 April.</p>
<p><strong>The question of whom jurors would see seated at the defense table that day had remained an open one in wake of new allegations that Raniere sexually exploited a teenage girl.</strong> His co-defendants have since sought separate trials and engaged in plea negotiations.</p>
<p>Court papers allege Nxivm formed a secret society of women who were branded with Raniere’s initials and forced to have sex with him. Defense attorneys have insisted any relationship between Raniere and the alleged victims, including an unidentified actor and other women expected to testify against him at trial, was consensual.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mack said that at Raniere’s direction she obtained compromising information and images of two unidentified women – called “collateral” within the group – that she threatened to make public if they didn’t perform “so-called acts of love”.</p>
<p>The jury questionnaire covers several topics, including asking candidates for their opinions about “rich individuals” and people who “engage in relationships with multiple sexual partners” and whether they “believe that people under the age of 17 should be able to consent to sex with adults”.</p>

              That is pretty much the  way the system works.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is not possible to take to trial umpteen people facing decades in prison with highly paid, tenacious defense lawyers on constant alert for any and every procedural   misstep that might jeopardize  the entire prosecution.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is WAY more effective to have multiple, low level insiders come clean and flip on the higher ups.
             </p>
             <p>
              Defense strategy will now shift to impugning the motives of Mack et al, but strong corroborating  evidence combined with  credible confessions should seal the fate of Raniere,  Bronfman and Russell.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a potential, additional bonus that Raniere might offer up well recognized politicians in attempts to mitigate his sentencing.
A great deal of behind-the-scenes stuff is definitely taking place.
