            Well said! I never used to believe in (and i dont even want to say it) demons, but like a month ago i saw a hooded figure just staring at me in my room. It was like a flash but it was so clear. It had a grey robe on- kind of like in assassins creed lol. It was just standing near my bathroom door, next to a rubbish bin. The thing is, and this sounds gross, but the bin had my sisters pads in it- she just had her period. And the thing was just standing next to it, like it was drawn to it. And it looked at me like it wanted to know what i wanted from it. A friend who grew up with stories of these things told me in high school that you really have to be careful when you are on your period- and to always dispose of pads properly because a lot of demonic entities are drawn to it. Anyway, i do think these things are always around us, everywhere, and they can only be seen when they want you to know they are there.  We must always think of and remember God so that we are protected from these things.

            Glad I read the comments first, I've already seen one picture today I wish I hadn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wanted to comment on this "
            <strong>
             I know how you feel...we're living in a fucked up timeline.

            "
           </p>
           <p>
            Agreed, try this.  It used to be a slow plodding timeline, now we have something else, it's more composed of what we all think about.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the issue eventually becomes to be exquisitely careful with your thoughts.  Aim for true purposes and you'll be fine.  And, the world will move in that direction.  Pedofiles were nearly all crudely abused in childhood.  Most abused males don't go on to become an abuser, it's a tiny minority that does.  1 in 6 males was abused sexually in childhood.  1 in 6 . org
           </p>
           <p>
            The hidden damage in society is immense.  If we can stop the cycle, life will be awesomely better for future generations.  Think about that!

            A mother breastfeeding her child on a picture is classified as cp. It's a weird topic, but depending on your country investigating this and then providing evidence will get you in jail instead of the people producing the cp. It's been like this since at least 2009, when I first encountered the topic because cp was used as an excuse for internet censorship at that time.

            How is anyone supposed to confirm this? Following a link towards CP is a crime. Seeing CP is a crime. Having CP in your browser cache is a crime. Searching out CP to report to police/FBI is a crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't even have to find those kind of sites to kind of get that there's a conspiracy going around. They'll probably outlaw talking about CP next.

             The website is hidden like a normal fourm. Has a "video game, movie, general threads cartoons and anime" threads but then look when you go under the "amature" and "sexy girls" and "teens" pages. People are casually commenting on pics of CP like as a normal person with a heart we're supposed to turn a blind eye and be like "eh it exists don't talk about it" Isen't that what Pizzagate is pedophilia hiding in plain site?

             I found out by mistake though a Breitbart article mentioning another website through google images by mistake. It's a horrible, disturbing sick website full of horror but it exists. Just like that in the open on the normal internet not the "deep web" or "darknet" or whatever. Another user on my original topic confirmed it

              , though a little tricky and weird, it popped up from some link not to do with porn, archive.is can't even archive the page, it has no IP, its clearly set up by expert IT's.

               Very much like this! Like What the fuck!! The website is a fourm with other threads like "video games, movies" and has active users but look under the "amature" and "sexy woman" and "teens" section. Oh god... it's a forum for these fucking animals

            I agree, it's all sick and it's changed my perspective on things for sure. Even to the point of wondering if the surreal nature of what we uncover is making me recognize how surreal fucking everything is...does that make sense? Is this fucking reality?

             I know how you feel...we're living in a fucked up timeline. We're told were living in the best generation of humanity in our modern world full of wonders and amenities and human progress yet when you go down the rabbit hole it's all a fucking surreal joke. What the fuck it's like waking up one day and realizing literally everything you know is a lie. I had a favorite game as a kid called Indigo Prophecy and it's all I can think that hits the nail on all this evil shit and how I feel

             The first minute is exactly how I feel. This and the Matrix scene where Morpheous describes what the real world is which now no longer feels like just a movie scene but our fucked up reality.

              Wow, that's kind of a fucked up game. But yeah, what exactly are we living in? My mother always warned us against summoning spirits, so I never used a ouija (sp?) or anything, and I do truly believe that the average person can summon spirits. With all of this crazy stuff we've been researching I have to say that I'm beginning to believe that we're fighting an epic good vs evil battle.
