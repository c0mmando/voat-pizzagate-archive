   We've spent a lot of time researching how child sex victims were brought into to the country. Turns out, there was nothing too sophisticated about their method.

            Turns out, Trumps wall and his immigration policies regarding the  Mexico/US border IS A RUSE AND A DISTRACTION. He's making his moves to protect, for the beast he serves, the three biggest underground businesses there is, drug, sex and gun trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drugs coming on land from Mexico are a nominal factor. However still horrific, human trafficking and drugs coming out of Mexico serve a different caste, run by gangs, and are therefore subject to 'harsher' regulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The REAL sex trafficking and drug issue, as far as pizzagate is concerned, issues anywhere from small yachts transporting mk and ritual abuse victims up and down the East coast from Maine to the Caribbean by elite businessman and the CIA, to the major shipping class vessels ON THE SEA.

             Trucks bring in everything from auto parts to appliances, produce and livestock.  In fact, a veteran Homeland Security official told Judicial Watch that cattle trucks passed without inspection during the Obama administration because Mexican farmers complained that the security screenings frightened their cows. “Our guys were livid that we were not allowed to check cattle,” the federal official said.

              Ethical Code[edit]
             </strong>
             The Knights Templar cartel was founded on a strict ethical code[13] developed by La Tuta. The code is contained in a small book that is handed out to all members of the cartel and even to the public. The book is decorated with knights on horseback with lances and crosses. The 22 page book is titled "The Code of the Knights Templar of Michoacan" and contains the rules and regulations of the gang.[14] The gang has based its rules on those of the European Knights Templar. Members swear to help the poor and helpless, fight against materialism, respect women and children, not kill for money, and not use drugs. The Knights even go as far as drug testing all members.[15] While the cartel has moved more towards accepting criminal acts prohibited by the ethical code, breaking the code can still incur punishment by death."

             With all our modern equipment, it would be insane to think that anyone could get away with smuggling drugs, guns, or people over the border. Yet those sophisticated scanners, devices, and x-ray machines were just collecting dust

            <p>
             Cramer, a K9 handler at the Nogales port of entry in Arizona, stated that massive amounts of illegal drugs are smuggled across the border while hidden inside of cargo trucks, trucks that used to generally be waved through but now undergo radiation and X-ray screening, sometimes even having their cargo thoroughly searched if the truck, driver or load raises any suspicions.
These screening processes seem pretty standard. It’s actually surprising it wasn’t happening already.
             <strong>
              It’s almost as if Obama wanted these trucks to pass through unchecked

             Um.   No.   Not at all.             The policy was to do random or targeted searches and then screen the drivers of any vehicle.  Anyone suspicious could be pulled over and inspecteted. The only thing all trucks were scanned for was nuclear materials.  You also don't seem to understand the limits of the devices.

             If you want to search all trucks crossing the border there is a cost associated with that.  And that cost is not just in manhours at the border, but, the cost of delayed trade through out the economy. One study of the agrciultural sector estimated increased wait times to cost  $12 billion USD a year, and cost 54,000 U.S. jobs by 2017.  And this is with 25% trucks being subject to inspection.
            </p>
            <p>
             The average inspection of truck takes 17.5 minutes.  One crossing in Laredo, TX gets 4800 trucks a day.  That's 1,400 hours of inspections at one spot.  I assume it's more than one person doing the inspection, but you will need more people and if this increase in trucks inspected is not met by a staff increase, it will increase wait times which negatively affect the economy.  There's tons of trade-offs to be considered.
