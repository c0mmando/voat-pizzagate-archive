            Going over some of my older research today, I came across this bit of information and wanted to see if you were aware of this program.
            <a href="http://sexandhistory.exeter.ac.uk/">
             http://sexandhistory.exeter.ac.uk/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Wellcome Trust keep a 'collection of erotica' that is used in the "Sex &amp; History" program.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The University of Exeter’s Sex and History project is an award-winning and innovative initiative which aims to empower people of all ages – and especially young people – to talk more openly about the issues that really matter to them by using objects from past cultures as a stimulus for discussing issues relating to sex, sexuality and relationships. 
Our pioneering methodology harnesses the powerful effect of learning about what people from across time and place have thought about desire, arousal, intimacy, gender, body image, beauty, power and control.
Exploring different cultural attitudes takes us outside ourselves and our everyday concerns, brings fresh eyes to our own ideas and quite simply shows that sex is nothing new and it’s OK to talk about it.
Intriguing images from history provide an arresting focus for discussions, affording a safe distance from sensitive subjects and allowing us to bring in as little or as much about our feelings and experiences as we feel comfortable with.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the project pages;
            </p>
            <p>
             The “Lust in Translation” link from above is a project partner and says this on it’s website;
“Promiscuity, dating tips, how to find a husband, what red shoes really mean, infections, being sexually exploited, ugly rich guys getting beautiful girls, cars as symbols of virility, how to pull on Plymouth Hoe, the importance of kissing, the madness of being in love, loneliness, risk-taking, how to get someone to fancy you…
From November 2010 to April 2011, Effervescent artists spent a total of one hundred days in the company of thirty-five young people aged 16 – 25, twenty-six older people aged 50 – 87, five adult volunteers, three museum professionals, and seven youth workers from Plymouth, with only one thing on our minds: sex.
Provoking challenging and giggly inter-generational dialogue mediated with calming cups of tea; initiating inflammatory ideas-generating activities such as dressing-up games, photographic assignments, choreographic tasks and biggest-poser competitions; as well as exploring objects and documents from the Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth and West Devon Record Office and the Wellcome Trust’s collection of erotica.

            Yup - inside srands of the spiders web. That is exactly where the orders come from. Think tanks select their pedo blackmailable freaks - having Brownstone OP as the procurers and Handlers (how else does a Pizza Parlor owner gets listed as the 49th man in DC - Fake Jones, Megyn?? !!!! ) like Alifantis(Aka Rothchild) Epstein, Saville .. etc.

            If you can find a medical research student they are often given anonymized patient data which can be used to find patient data for specific people (ie Tony or Kim Noble).

            This makes me sad.  I was reading about Tavistock from this sub almost a year ago.  As a whole we're much further into this than we think, but maybe it's not conglomerated well enough.

            I just want to give a bit of a short summary because someone requested in the previous thread (I'm the original author). It’s a whole lot of complicated information but I really want everyone to see just how tightly intertwined the ‘Comet Group’ is to Tavistock.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Tavistock has been viewed as a kind of social engineering machine to control the populace, but researchers have failed to identify the Tavistock Institute as being culpable
            </li>
            <li>
             It’s more likely that ‘Tavistock’ as we know it is run by a group called the Wellcome Trust. They are a foundation derived from a company that happened to run a museum, which itself ran a company that was supposed to look like a foundation. This confusion is by design. Today, the drug company is owned by Glaxo Smith Kline. Wellcome is located beside University College Campus in London, as is the Tavistock Institute.
            </li>
            <li>
             Archived newspaper articles from the 80s and 90s reveal AIDS advocacy groups called ACT UP  and amfAR were bankrolled by the Wellcome Trust while Burroughs-Wellcome PLC (The drug company) tried to pass AZT. Fringe critics who called the operation fraud and racketeering were silenced.
            </li>
            <li>
             25 years later, Alefantis appears to organize a protest for the same group, or at least on behalf of their members. His friend and Comet associate Kid Congo Powers is revealed to be a card-carrying member.
            </li>
            <li>
             Artists and Musicians involved in all of this begin showing more and more links to British and American intelligence, most notably out of art galleries in NYC, DC and London. MOMA appears to be the US power center and in the UK, the TATE Modern (interestingly, the movie Children of Men hints at this).
            </li>
            <li>
             Investigation into financials shows that the Rothschilds, Rockefellers are major funders of Wellcome and have worked as researchers for them. An international art therapy program operating out of Baltimore and Switzerland links Tony Podesta to the former and Alefantis to the latter.
            </li>
            <li>
             Links show Jimmy Savile was also involved in this program at the hospital where he abused hundreds, and that Kim Noble was one of its victims.
            </li>
            <li>
             A century-long examination of socialites in DC through newspaper archives reveals the Harriman family, one of the world’s wealthiest, have been one of the main providers of ‘entertainment’ to congress. They also co-founded Tavistock and a series of Eugenics programs with the Rockefellers.
            </li>
            <li>
             My conclusion is that ’Tavistock’, MK Ultra, Skull and Bones and The Rothschild Conspiracy are all one single monster bankrolled by the City of London and backed by Western Intelligence.

              There's little doubt that AIDS treatment did save lives and that the drug cocktail used today is beneficial. What I explain in the article is that the pharma company paid off the very protestors that attacked Wellcome for not introducing the drug fast enough. It was a ploy. AZT had not undergone thorough inspection before being passed because of massive pressure from Burroughs-Wellcome on the FDA. That doesn't take into account the role of AZT in relation to the consumption of amylnitrate (poppers) in gay bars in the 1980s, which was known to be extremely harmful to one's immune system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Burroughs-Wellcome held the original patent on amylnitrate, meaning that their drugs were either poisoning the gay community or curing them. It's a racket.
             </p>
             <p>
              And yes, amfAR has saved lives. It's also rife with money laundering (see: Harvey Weinstein).

               Are you claiming Wellcome and ACTUP were working together initially?   Because they attacked Wellcome over the price of AZT and forced them to lower the price.
              </p>
              <p>
               My guess is you are jumbling up dates to create this ploy.  That Wellcome eventually donated to ACTUP.

                That was accurate to what I remember as well. But there did seem to be a magic hand running behind the movement. They got lots of MSM coverage for example Peter Tatchel was never off the tv in those days. Worth following the work of Len Horowitz regarding HIV having been in the hep B vaccine given to gay men in NY/ SF in 1978.
