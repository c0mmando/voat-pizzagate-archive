<p>Qui tam. Source: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam</a></p>
<p>In common law, qui tam is a writ where a private individual assists a prosection and can receive all or part of any penalty imposed. This exists in both federal and states laws. It allows a private person to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government against government contractors.</p>

<p>How this specific post adds value to pizzaget investigation:  Researchers are finding indications of material evidence which can be used to pursue a qui tam lawsuit on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>The DOJ or government attorney then decides if the government will take up the case. If they do, they government takes this over and private plaintiff gets 15-20% of any penalties imposed. If government doesn\'t take up the case, the private individual can still pursue and collect a higher percentage. (Referenced in qui tam wiki link above)</p>
<p>As noted above, this provides a mechanism where even if the there are portions of the government corrupted, citizen investigators can still push this through the system.</p>

<p>Anyone not following that policy is open to qui tam....</p>
<p>Fuck trying to convince corrupt media, take this this straight to state and federal courts and make it a matter of public record. Any corrupt, shit, evil organization you find with ties to pizzagate, target the ones that have government contracts.</p>
<p>This is a fight that private citizens can do using existing federal and state laws. Use this and other laws. We still have far more power than they admit we do. It media, LEO, .gov is corrupt, it does not stop us.</p>
<p>Like fbi anon said, follow the money. But go next level, take their fucking money and use it to fund more fights against their corrupt/evil shit.</p>
<p>Wiki qui tam Find attorneys that specialize in qui tam. Bring the fight to these scum Take their evil blood money and do something good with it.</p>

             Private citizens can bring lawsuits against any government contractor for fraud and abuse.  You are suing on behalf of the government and you get a percentage of the penalty assesed.
            </p>
            <p>
             You don't have to be involved or hurt by it like a class action lawsuit.  ANY CITIZEN  can bring a lawsuit against a government contractor for corruption and fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any citizen can file a Freedom of Information Act.  (FOIA)
            </p>
            <p>
             What I'm talking about is a mass citizen enforcement fighting corruption. Next level stuff, Robin Hood style with Voat, wikileaks, Anon throw in.  Vendetta American style.
            </p>
            <p>
             Take our money back from those that are using our money to victimize us.  I'm talking getting paid to fight for humanity.  Building strength and using that money to fight them even harder.  Taking that money and putting in good political candidates.  Revolution through existing laws.

             If .01% of the U.S. population were to do the above as described, that would be 30,000 lawsuits against the corrupt, evil scum that think they have so much power.
            </p>
            <p>
             If 10% of those lawsuits were successful and the average penalty was only $150,000 the damage inflicted upon the corrupt would be almost half a billion dollars.  That is before the loss of business that would result afterwards as well.

             FOIA the receipt for $65k in "hotdogs"
Is $65k excessive for goods/services received?
Does a receipt represent a contract between gov and provider or goods/services?  Qui tam?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone can file FOIA for that receipt....

            Thanks.  My first 2 attempts at posting were deleted because I did not follow posting rules.  No complaint, my own fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Comments on my deleted were good.  Someone else suggested class action lawsuits but, I think that would only apply to those directly affected.  But, should be kept in mind once victims are found and encouraged to participate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is direct action we, as private citizens, can take.  It is the natural course of action for those who have put in so much determined research.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is our tax dollars they are using in many cases to pay for these evil deeds.  $19trillion in debt the U.S. is in.  How much of that was used to do deeds against our people?
           </p>

            They won't give up their power.  We need to take it from them.

            This is excellent. Great work op. Can anyone suggest how to / where we might put together a possible list of targets, maybe in the hope of identifying a particularly strong line of attack? I think if we did get a strong case or cases together, people might be more encouraged to take the leap and bring a case.

             Adoption agencies, organizations supposed to be supporting kids and victimizing them instead.  Ones who get grants or other funds from .gov.

            Been through similar before.  Gov entity settled out of court because it would have become public record.  Settlement was very beneficial....
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people don't understand the true power of the court system.  Every case sets precedent, that is the basis of case law.  Win one, the next gets easier and so forth.  Forces public records.  Pulls DARKNESS into the LIGHT.
