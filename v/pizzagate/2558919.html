<p>Nonoo is the first Jewish person, and third woman, to be appointed ambassador of Bahrain. She is also the first Jewish ambassador of any Middle Eastern Arab country,[1][2][3] and <strong>the first female Bahraini ambassador to the United States</strong>.[4]</p>
<p>Prior to her appointment to the Majlis al-shura in 2005,[10] she founded in 2004 and presided the <strong>Bahrain Human Rights Watch Society, a society for the advancement of women\'s rights[11] as well as of foreign workers in Bahrain</strong>. For a total of three years served as a member of parliament (40-member Shura Council), after being appointed by King Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah. Her appointment made headlines because Houda is part of the small Jewish community of Bahrain. Bahrain\'s Jewish community reportedly consists in just thirty-seven people, most of whom are the descendants of immigrants from Iraq and Iran.[1][2] Nonoo is not the first person in her family to enter Bahraini politics, or member of the Jewish community. In 1934, her grandfather Abraham Nonoo served as a member of the Manama Municipality, the first ever elected municipal body in Bahrain.[12] In 2000, a cousin, Ebrahim Daoud Nonoo was appointed to parliament. The Nonoo family is originally from Iraq having moved to Bahrain over a century ago</p>
<p>On July 3, 2008, Nonoo was appointed Ambassador of the Kingdom of Bahrain to the United States, a role that also involves responsibility over Bahraini diplomatic representation to Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina (non-resident). Some local media criticized the appointment,[14] and <strong>Radio Canada reported that her nomination was controversial within Bahrain, with some suggesting that a Jew might not be the best choice to defend Bahrain\'s refusal to recognise Israel. Al-Khalifa rejected these concerns</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The appointment of Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo (46), the first female Ambassador from Bahrain and the first Jewish Ambassador of an Muslim  Arab country in Washington, was praised by U.S. diplomats when it was revealed recently in one of the Wikileaks cables.</p>
<p>She was credited with organizing the meeting between King Hamad and Bahraini Jewish immigrants in the U.S. and arranged a dinner at the home of <strong>Rabbi Levi Shemtov, director of the Washington office of American Friends of Lubavitch</strong>, with the Bahraini foreign minister and representatives of U.S. Jewish organizations.</p>
<p>The facts Narrated above shows the Inclination of the GCC Arabs , and the Injustice of the Bahraini Monarchs , that in the country where , Shia Muslims who are there in a Majority are even being , denied of their legal right of having Government Jobs , Such as in Municipality , Police , and armed Forces, But a Women of Jewish Community is been appointed in a Muslim Country , at such an Important Post of Ambassador of US, as this shows that these Monarchs of Arabia , whether Bahrain , Saudia Arabia , UAE, Qatar , or Kuwait call them selves Muslims but , they are Munafiq’s , and one hand they are creating sectarian divide in the Muslims , by Propogating Wahabism in the Arabs of Muslim World, and second of all they can go to any length to make Happy their Masters , by serving the Zionist Regime of Israel. Which are Openly defying Muslims of the World and working to destroy Islam , as the fore fathers of these Arab Monarchs were even Zionist, who never wanted to be Muslims , but were fascinated by the Power of the Muslims in the world , and to enjoy the Powers , they declared themselves as Muslims , but deep in heart were Zionist , and that can even now be judged by there rulings and there acts of Promoting Zionism in the World by all there deeds and orders, and on the other hand doing injustice to the Shia Muslims Majority of the country.</p>
<p><strong>In can be very easily judged that by appointing a Jew at such a Key Position , of a Muslim State , can not be in the favour of the Muslims , but in the favor of the Zionist, So they can condemn the Muslims and divide the Muslims , on all the accounts available.</strong></p>

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The appointment of Houda Ezra Ebrahim Nonoo (46), the first female Ambassador from Bahrain and the first Jewish Ambassador of an Muslim  Arab country in Washington, was praised by U.S. diplomats when it was revealed recently in one of the Wikileaks cables.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was credited with organizing the meeting between King Hamad and Bahraini Jewish immigrants in the U.S. and arranged a dinner at the home of
            <strong>
             Rabbi Levi Shemtov, director of the Washington office of American Friends of Lubavitch
            </strong>
            , with the Bahraini foreign minister and representatives of U.S. Jewish organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The facts Narrated above shows the Inclination of the GCC Arabs , and the Injustice of the Bahraini Monarchs , that in the country where , Shia Muslims who are there in a Majority are even being , denied of their legal right of having Government Jobs , Such as in Municipality , Police , and armed Forces, But a Women of Jewish Community is been appointed in a Muslim Country , at such an Important Post of Ambassador of US, as this shows that these Monarchs of Arabia , whether Bahrain , Saudia Arabia , UAE, Qatar , or Kuwait call them selves Muslims but , they are Munafiq’s , and one hand they are creating sectarian divide in the Muslims , by Propogating Wahabism in the Arabs of Muslim World, and second of all they can go to any length to make Happy their Masters , by serving the Zionist Regime of Israel. Which are Openly defying Muslims of the World and working to destroy Islam , as the fore fathers of these Arab Monarchs were even Zionist, who never wanted to be Muslims , but were fascinated by the Power of the Muslims in the world , and to enjoy the Powers , they declared themselves as Muslims , but deep in heart were Zionist , and that can even now be judged by there rulings and there acts of Promoting Zionism in the World by all there deeds and orders, and on the other hand doing injustice to the Shia Muslims Majority of the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In can be very easily judged that by appointing a Jew at such a Key Position , of a Muslim State , can not be in the favour of the Muslims , but in the favor of the Zionist, So they can condemn the Muslims and divide the Muslims , on all the accounts available.

              There's a lot of speculation online of the truth behind the facade. See the Beard Club on Twitter. Did Prince Harry have to get married to avoid blackmail &amp; scandal? He was papped repeatedly at "The Box" in London with Andrew's 2 daughters.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a lighter note watch the following vid of lip readers decoding private conversations during the wedding &amp; wonder why xanax &amp; opoids played a big part according to some online posters familiar with these drugs. Sadly both were victims of extreme childhood sexual abuse.

Then when Euro ISIS breaks out, have the EU tell the army of the hapless host Nation to 'Stand Down- human rights dont you know'

            you never venture to draw any conclusions from your posts.  feminine timidity no doubt.

           <p>
            you also show over-compassion by not wanting to single out a group for blame.
           </p>
           <p>
            when group blame is apparent but necessarily limited to a sub-section of it, you instinctively reject the logic that if a group BENEFITS AS A GROUP THEY CAN BE PUNISHED AS A GROUP; and we all know

            I am not trolling when I say womens involvement in policy-making is a huge problem.  why do you think these NWO-NGOs prioritize womens "empowerment" in every single country? obviously to sink their birth-rates and introduce communism.

            so even without a jewess 'setting them up' we already know its a jew psyop, because race-mixing is overall rare and unpopular and that's why jewish-dominated media &amp; advertising agencies have to push it so heavily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it called Paddle8?  Because it's the infinity sign, which features heavily in Kabbalah:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jewish family behind the Child Mind Institute even uses it as the logo for their family newsletter

           <p>
            and lol@ using a muslim source for an unnecessary conspiracy theory; it is no secret that since the end of the cold war the jews have depended on falsely pitting muslims and Christians against each other.

             In fact, N1's dispassionate, sourced approach to the potential role of Jews in Cabal machinations and his efforts to connect this person of interest to Abramovic is far more potent and potentially damaging research than any of the histrionic smear-mongering we usually see on this subject.

                that's not what crowding out means, dumbfuck.  the artificial supply of Q posts inhibits the normal supply of PG posts from even forming by redirecting peoples time and attention.  I thought you jew-rats studied economics??
