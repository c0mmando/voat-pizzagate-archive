Someone in the thread suggested going to adoption agency sites to try to find victims but there is also large community on FB in various groups where parents and sometimes even former foster children post about sexual abuse their children are experiencing or have experienced in the system only to fall on deaf ears because CPS won\'t acknowledge those abuses.  There are also published articles on this type of abuse.   Could victims possibly be found through these social media pages on FB?    
</p>
<p>This morning I searched for some of these families stories and published articles and had no problem finding any.  In fact I\'ll post the links I came across.  The first  one I found is that of a former foster child herself  and it appears that she just recently set up a FB page for former foster kids to share their stories.   Maybe a forum such as the one she created could attract children who are were runaways and foster children to share their experiences with the dark pedo world?   
</p>
<p>I\'ll post some links to what I came across.  The first is the former foster girl\'s story.</p>

<p>This was just a small sampling of the many articles I could have posted here and begs the question could social media help in gathering current and past victims?   
</p>
<p>There are also many groups on FB who post these stories, many filled with stories from parents claiming their child/children are being abused by their fosters. These groups though, appear to cover a variety of issues within the system, not only sexual abuse. I couldn\'t find one that just deals with that particular subject.

            There are also , " sponsor families," used for refugees. The book , "Let Haiti Licve, " mentions this often and many states. Mentions the S. FL Boystown often. States many sponsor fans are in NY, VA, and DC. Mary Podesta could also be a "sponsor family."/I cannot stress reviewing Boystown website, Boystown Research Website, Wikipedia, gold silver IRA and coins that Boystown Seels, and 2015-2016, Forbes, most profitable charities, Boystown #48; and doing the same for the nuns Npo connected to all the abuse and pedo cases with kids and poor females in Norway. Norway kids were brought to the USa, and that Npo is huge and expanded, in the USA and worldwide, just like Boystown/ Flanagan is name on Forbes article.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, there are a lot of support groups out there, esp.on Fb. Privacy and safety issues, including protect the sources and not retraumatizing are key. I have already been talking to various victims and gathering a list of ones from all over the web, that post in all the ways that you mentioned above. Natives are also sin bstantial victims, esp.on reservations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many are complaining on the adoption review websites, that can hone down ones related to CPS, adopt centers, hospitals, welfare recipients, drug treatment centers, mental institutions, etc. Also, the back of various local mags that have a lot of sex call numbers, also have adoption centers that advertise to pregnant moms.
A lot of victims are on Safe Access phones with no internet, or very limited internet and cell phone use.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have posted a lot of substantial research here and on other subverses. The one Dr that works with strokes, that you researched; I think is a very good lead, and all of his activities and networks are very interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr and nurse home visits, have led to ones being judged about their home, erroneously and reported to CP's about children and moved ng adults into the profit making institutions and nursing homes. Looking up the boards and stocks of various instituons, pulls up many that are vonflictbof interest that are governors and other govt positions, hmo board members, and corporations that are on Obamacare contract.
           </p>
           <p>
            For examples: Rick Scott gov invests and is on boards of many nursing homes.
Boards on Logisticare/ Providence/Igneus are on United Healthcare HMO boards and stocks, nursing homes AND own a home nursing co, also. Igneus is worldwide social welfare programs, and Juvie and felony programs, including back to work AND programs for disabled and poor. Social welfare galore network worldwide that are on Obamacare contract for eight years, plus Obama recently awarded Logisticare/ Providence, another four year contract.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is also pertinent for all over the USA, all ages, including infant mortality have died and conditions coarsened as the contract is for the federal NEMT program, non emergency medical transport. Accidents as car/ drivers in violations not adhering, abuses including sexual, stranded in dark parking lots for hours or all night, no show, fraud billing, immigrant drivers/ popup drive cos ran out of homes/ call staff at nonstop bedbug locations, illegally blocked and gross delayed every medical necessity from drs, cancer treatments, diagnosis, ongoing medical treatments, dr offices in chaos from no shows, very late, patients stranded d, patients finally arriving in severe distress from such abuse even on the phone, Hippa violations, illegal invasive calls by call staff to the Dr offices and illegal demanded apps to be filled out are not even the whole list of ongoing and escalating violations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Media has covered up and barely a story comes out, and always with innacuracy and absent of necessary facts, including that is violations on federal contracts that defraud trillions in public tax dollars.

              Texas news of substantial increase in infant mortality of low income babies with moms on welfare. Most do not drive and require the federal nemt rides. Besides no shows, strands, endangerment, the call staff and drive cos have stranded recipients on phone for hours, up to all day  as mindgame and abuse for rides. These are multi federal public health law, fed contract, and ADA gross violations.

            Attorneys and disability advocacy groups are not assisting, not even federal funded Disability Rights in each state that are required too; nor DOP, OIG, and all others on the federal contract ( governors, medical boards, local/ state/ regional/ federal AHCA, CMS, DHS, HHS).

            BBB, multi victim reports and legit drive cos never paid, reimbursement, put out of Biz by this corporate privatizing of NEMT.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only two states, have stopped using corp privatized and went back to.local driving cos and jobs.

           <p>
            Obamas, HR-5 bill is how the immigrant felons and refugees are brought in to the fed NEMT program for call centers, drive, fly by night home drive co operations. Many brag on their Fb of all the money if they own as travel all over, staff brag about and mock the sick/ disabled they are harming, mass photos of not working but office parties and drinking/ socializing/ online; which are federal law and contract violations that EACH employee must be trained and sign the contract.
           </p>
           <p>
            Office of Inspector General of HHS ( OIG) ignoring mass complaints, even documented; yet there is a Wisconsin yearly review and a 2016 NJ yearly review of the state Dept and Logisticare by OIG, FULL of gross violations NOT penalized in any way that is Ag the law for his job duty requirements. If you go to the OIG website, you can find both of these reports as PDF files, and also compare and contrast the many cases the OIG did investigate and punish with financial.penalties, victims comp, severing contract, and federal prison. But, most of these cases are small, local crimes, not these way bigger ones on way higher tax dollars and harm to the beneficiaries.
           </p>

            I have a long list from a state AHCA agency of FOIA requests on beneficiaries with case problems. The Foia are not just done by victims, but most by big govt and corp attorneys, main media, npos, big govt corp lobbying research that demonstrates they do know that mass victim latiins go on and how the publicly c health care system is public health law and federal contracts as the sysyemic infrastructure.

            That large PDF file of have is full of victims, and requesting other states can be done. Victims often never receive their foia requests or is gross delayed needing mass calls and cert letters to get, and high printing costs.

            Ones do not realize that even getting medical records or in full is a huge problem, and also the substantial costs. Dr medical notes are frequently full of false or discriminating info. You would be quite surprised. These notes carry by drs and psychs carry much weight in medical, govt entities, CPS and authorities.

            Very easy to ROUTE people and take children, and force into medical and psych procedures and treatments.

            Don't forget Mary Podesta, "adopted many people."  Most adoption sites search the other way, so you can find kids that have been given up for adoption.  No records with runaways sadly.
