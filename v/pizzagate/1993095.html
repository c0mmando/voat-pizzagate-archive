            I did some digging through the Twitter account you provided and found a blog space with tons of entries from Pedos, here is a quote: "On the other side of this coin, we’ve got the pro-contact crowd. Before Virped, whenever I was speaking in any forum with other pedophiles, that’s who I always found myself sparring with, and I never could seem to get around it. I tried at times to just stay silent on the contact issue, but I always found the things the more vocal pro-contacters said to be so grotesquely wrong that I never could keep my mouth shut for long. I don’t suppose I need to tell anyone that this did not make me very popular in some of those old pedophile groups. Eventually, I always wound up vastly outnumbered, would be shouted down, and would wind up leaving out of pure frustration. Thank god for Virped."
           </p>
           <p>
            Has Virped been investigated or discussed on here? I'll have to go look. So disturbing!

            Yeah, so let me explain something that I've been noticing.  They are admitting this stuff, but at the same time making sure they aren't doing anything illegal. I first noticed this on minds.com since Ernst and the Heart Progress gang showed up there recently. Minds is basically run by a bunch of alt right people who want to shut this down, but I look at the pedo's profiles and they're all doing the same thing:
           </p>
           <p>
            They put in their bio's something to the effect of "I do not advocate anything illegal, including illegal sexual contact between an adult and a minor. I believe that we should accept pedophiles in society and that their actions with children have no harm on the child."
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you see what they're doing?  It's the same as just saying "I support the legalization of weed." You can't arrest someone just for saying that. You can only arrest them for actually smoking weed. (it doesn't matter what your personal opinion on weed is, this is just a clear example).
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise, you can't arrest someone for supporting pedophilia...only for actually having sex with a kid, or distributing child porn, trafficking with a kid, etc. Do you see the fundamental difference? Same as, pre-civil war you couldn't arrest someone for saying slavs should be free, only for actually freeing slaves.  And the list could go on forever...
           </p>
           <p>
            So...look. I in no way support pedophiles...I helped migrate pizzagate from reddit to here...but as a matter of principle I do protect free speech. I hate westboro baptist church, but I would always protect their right to say it (and tell them they'll eventually get their asses kicked). Is it disgusting that they'll say this stuff? YES. Is it illegal? NO. As soon as they cross the line into illegal territory should they be banned, arrested, trialed, found guilty, and locked up for the rest of their natural lives? YES.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not as simple as pedophila is bad in this case. They know what they're doing and it's important that we do too.

             They can have their free speech but so can we and if we want to call them out for being disgusting and unnatural in their proclivities and irresponsible in their speech , then we have that right. We can toe that line just close enough to harassment without doing anything illegal ;)

              Sure, I never said you can't. I'm just explaining what the line they are taking lately. They know what is and isn't perfectly legal and are also trying to bait people into "oppressing" them at the same time. I'm sure they are counting on us doing this, then they will call for "hate speech protection".  It will be another step in their normalization procedure.

               Ah! Excellent point. I've always taken issue with the term "hate crime". A murder is a murder, the motive of hatred shouldn't levy a stiffer punidhment.  It can be discussed as a motive, it can be discussed for being despicable. But other than that, there doesn't need to be a special class of "even worse murderers". (I'm thinking of poor murdered Matthew Sheppard who was killed for being gay). Murder for any reason is wrong. There doesn't need to be a special victim class for gays, jews, etc. because all human life matters. Adding in hate crime laws has only served to muddy the legal waters and diminish free speech.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you're right that it is undoubtedly the game plan. It's worked for other groups and pedos want their piece of the action.

             That "talk to kids about masterbation" YouTube video was classic grooming.  They have taken the strategies of satanism and pedo grooming, broken into many unrecognized pieces and are now integrating into the culture at large.
