             Why is it related? Why does it not belong in CBTS? People are going to look back some day and regret they ruined our movement. There will be people running around, republican cheerleaders, calling themselves pizzagaters, who are nothing but freemasonic zionist republican cheerleaders. You are facilitating the pollution of our movement and I am sad that you do not see what it is getting ready to do to the most special elite pedo hunting unit on the planet. Its already getting fucked up by it and its getting ready to get worse. Voat has a CBTS forum and

              It's really weird to me, Esoteric, that you assume everyone following the Q situation blindly supports Republicans. Everyone I talk to is disgusted with the Republicans. The only difference between stickying this leaker and FBIAnon is Q has been right more times and is being much more specific about what needs to be researched.

               Like I said bro it has nothing to do with whether he is right or wrong and has everything to do with Freemasons. For some reason, for you, him being right or wrong is relevant to the Freemason issue but it is not. Not at all. Its about ideology.

                 Our government is 100% Freemasonic, Jesuit, Skull and Bones, et:al types. Freemasons and Jesuits are the reason we have the crime infested child trafficking government we have. If Q really is affiliated with our government then he comes from that world. The Freemasonic world is full of the most clever snakes God ever created. Nobody has any idea who this person is. It could be the copy boy in a news room for all we know. But if he is who you think he is than he comes from the Freemason world.

                 The only thing that has changed in our government is that the Freemason Republicans don't like Social Justice Warrior type bullshit. They play a totally different end of the propaganda game. The Republicans play the "we are Christians" end of the sphere while the Democrats play the Anti Christians.

                 One thing we can see already is that the Republicans are the FAKE end of the Christian pole too by supporting the Israel/Jerusalem deal. Real Christians do not support bombing REAL SEMITES in Palestine out of their homes that are actually closer to the bloodline of Jesus than these Khazarian Zionists who are killing the Palestenians. Israel is full of Talmudists. If you think we have a problem with baby raping satanists, oh my God, Israel is infested with them. I'm sure they are kidnapping those kids every single day and torturing them to death.

                 Israel is the child trafficking, baby murdering, satanic Rothschild mecca of the earth and our Republican government loves and supports them why? Because that is who our government is. Might be a hard pill to swallow but its true.

                 People hate to hear this but Trump was given 100 million dollars for his campaign by Sheldon Adelson who is a Zionist Freemasonic criminal and billioniare gangster in the Vegas casino world. Trump bows to AIPAC. I'm sorry but Trump is not a Christian because Christians do not support bombing innocent people out of their homes, rub shoulders with Zionist casino Freemason gangster billionaires, and consort with baby sacrificing murders like AIPAC.

                 Trump is an ant on the hill compared to the power that surrounds him. Trump does not run our government, our government runs Trump. OBVIOUSLY. Same with any president and Trump has no special powers other presidents did not have.

                 We still have chemtrails. Its business as usual but for some reason there is suddenly a trust in Freemasons because we like Trump. In my opinion people are not approaching the Trump thing properly anyway. We should be holding him accountable. We should be tweeting "where is our wall on the border Mr. Trump, we want it."

                 "President Trump everybody knows the Clintons are child traffickers. Why don't you arrest them?"

                <p>
                 "President Trump Jeff Sessions is not doing his job, he is not arresting child traffickers. We all know he knows, so why is the man not doing his job?" "President Trump why are you not doing your job?"

                <hr/>
                <p>
                 If Trump is who you think he is then people should be non-stop asking him directly, bluntly, why he and Sessions are not arresting the peophiles in our government. That is how you handle public "servants." You ask them why they are not serving. The reason he is not, is because he cannot, or will not.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 All this BS people are spreading about "Trump has to redpill the public first" is as about as delusional as it gets. Our government does not condition the public so that it can serve us, it conditions us because it refuses to serve us.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 Redpilling the public is what WE DO. Fooling the public is what THEY DO. If our government is "redpilling" us then they are fooling us.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 Same as it ever was. Nothing new under the Sun. So we need to go back to what brought us here today, which was redpilling the public and BLUNTLY asking our president to arrest pedophiles instead of being Freemason cheerleaders. Spreading trust in Freemasons is like spreading brain cancer.

                  Esoteric, can you please provide evidence Trump is a Freemason? All I've seen is feral hatred of Trump from both sides of the aisle. It defies common sense that he is part of a brotherhood sworn to protect its members that is so desperate to remove him from power.

                  Honestly, with no evidence, this "Don't talk about Q because Trump is a Mason" just makes you look like part of the shill brigaid that has ineffectually diddled around here since last November.

                   Theatre, same as it ever was, absolutely nothing new under the Sun. If people understood that Jesuits run the world and Freemason politicians carry out Jesuit orders the picture would become clear. They have to fight one another for our stolen taxpayer money to maintain the illusion of a two party system. All these people are from the same bloodlines. Hillary and Trump are descendants of the House of Plantagenet. We call people pedophiles with much weaker ties than I just gave you.

                   I DO NOT HATE TRUMP. I WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM AS A PRESIDENT THAN HILLARY. But i'm not blind because I know who Jesuits and Freemasons are and I know their history.

Its not my fault you guys caused this sub to start pumping out poison in our movement like Podestas, Chelsea, McCain, Obama, Hillary, were under house arrest or arrested, etc....We have enough credibility problems without all that. People already call us crazy and now they can add to the list.

                       Not offended, but in our business, we are often forced to run on intuition and circumstantial affiliations, those that we make by pattern matching. There is seldom "evidence" in what we are able to ascertain. We are pattern matchers first and foremost, its how we all learned what we know.

                   It won't matter. You will ignore it and say there is no "evidence." Honestly the first link alone is enough but people ignore it. Trump was either born with a genetic defect that causes him to throw 3 WELL KNOWN Masonic hand signals a minute or it is a "coincidence." I didn't say don't talk about Q. I AM SAYING that if Q is who you think he is then he comes from Jesuit Freemason D.C. because D.C. IS Freemasonville and I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

                  <p>
                   Donald Trump has been the subject of media frenzy as of late. It seems that a considerable amount of those who subscribe to alternative sources of information are Trump supporters. They see him as some kind of rebel, going against both the Republican and Democratic parties (as exemplified by his recent non-commitment to support the Republican nominee for President).
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Could it be though, that Donald Trump is a "false flag candidate" being used to secure the vote of the ever-increasing independent constituency in order to inevitably lull the US into a false sense of positive political novelty and thus to subsequently impose Jesuitical right-wing fascism leading to a nation-wide race war as devised by the masters of class adversarialism, the Sons of Loyola?

                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   It very well could be. Here is why:
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Trump claims to be Presbyterian, yet he attended Jesuit Fordham University for two years and then transferred to the covertly Jesuit-controlled University of Pennsylvania. 1
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   The University of Pennsylvania is funded by various Papal Court Jews, notably by The Annenberg Foundation, 2 started by Papal Knight and hofjude Walter Hubert Annenberg. Annenberg briefly attended the University of Pennsylvania in his youth and later established the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Annenberg is a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. 3 , 4

                   Court Jew David L. Cohen is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania as well as an alumnus of University of Pennsylvania. He is also the executive vice president of Comcast. 5 He was recently named co-chairman of the leadership planning committee of the Roman Catholic World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia (which is the coming of the Pope to Philadelphia!) 6
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   University of Pennsylvania could be renamed "Hofjude University" because of its enormous amount of Papist Jewish funding and leadership and really the entire Pennsylvania area is controlled by the Roman Catholic hierarchy via the Jesuit provincial holding jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, the Archbishop of Philadelphia and the Bishop of Pittsburgh in conjunction with the temporal coadjutor government officials produced from UPenn and the following Roman Catholic or Catholic-funded Universities: La Salle University, Duquesne University, Pennsylvania State University, Villanova University, Temple University and Saint Joseph's University.
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Protestants do not attend Roman Catholic institutions, especially counter-reformation Jesuit institutions like Fordham University, so Trump is at the very least an apostate for having done that. However, the story does not end with Trump.
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Out of the five children he has, the three listed on Wikipedia have attended the following schools: 7 , 8 , 9
Donald John Trump, Jr. - Alma mater: University of Pennsylvania
Ivanka Marie Trump - Alma mater: University of Pennsylvania
Eric Frederic Trump - Alma mater: Georgetown University
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   There you have it; Trump, in addition to being affiliated with both Jesuit Fordham and covertly Jesuit UPenn, has at least three children who are all alumni of UPenn and notorious Jesuit Georgetown University!
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Whether it be Trump, Jeb Bush, Hilary Clinton or even Bernie Sanders that ends up winning the 2016 election, all of these candidates are connected to Rome and all will only serve to implement the tyrannical, neo-Romanist policies of the Papacy and its professed soldiers of the Society of Jesus.

              Well I am very convinced that all these things are connected behind the curtain,(This news is more proof)...the reason I did not post in CBTS is, I was checking it the last days, and as I understand it is only a backup now, in case 8chan/cbts goes down.
Do not forget that money laundering, drug trafficking, child trafficking,weapon trafficking are all connected. Parts of one network are connected to others.
This was a really strange and very telling news.
14 warrants!! So this means they know something,...BUT THEY DON'T WANNA ACT ON IT YET!!
Why?? because it's all connected, it's connected to many other indictments,and we know at the core it's made of trafficking networks.
