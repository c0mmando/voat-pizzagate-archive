   This is getting creepy. Where are these two women pictured in a "pizza" image sent to John Podesta? Are they missing? Did they die? They seem to have vanished!

<p>So Bill Clinton and Doug Band seem to have nabbed the women before the women could plug in the final pieces of the puzzle. Here\'s where it gets eerie.

          <p>
           Brief background. These two women, reporters working on child trafficking, were in North Korea investigating a child trafficking network.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, whatever they saw, or whatever they were ABOUT to see in the course of their investigation, about near gave Bill Clinton an aneurysm. Their discovery was so pressing that Bill Clinton himself along with Doug Band flew out on a private jet and extracted them.
          </p>

           (Remember? The media made it seem like Clinton just did it out of the goodness of his heart? They said it was "heroic" etc. LOL. please)
          </p>
          <p>
           So Bill Clinton and Doug Band seem to have nabbed the women before the women could plug in the final pieces of the puzzle. Here's where it gets eerie. When they brought the two women back, they sent a photo of the two women eating pizza to John Podesta, as if to assure him that the mission was accomplished (almost like "we got them before they could figure it out, don't worry.")
          </p>
          <p>
           They even named the image "pizza.jpg" -- indicating that the pizza is significant.
          </p>
          <p>
           The working hypothesis is this:
           <strong>
            these two reporters were about to discover something that would take the Clinton Foundation down, so the Clintons scrambled to extract them. The women THOUGHT they were being rescued by Clinton but in actuality they were being contained and managed.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           If that hypothesis is true, it is urgent that we find the women and see what they knew, and compare notes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Alas, it seems these two women have vanished. I hope I am wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both of the links to their supposed websites are redirected and I can find no trace of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           If we can find them, we can compare notes and see what it was they were looking into. They have answers.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is, of course, a big 'if'.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope to God they are not missing or dead, but it is difficult to find them anywhere.
