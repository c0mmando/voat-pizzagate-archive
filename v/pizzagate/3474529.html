             Well...  it is odd because he says he flew to Canada first, then Russia.  He says the police were coming after him because he recorded them discussing their corruption.

            If he has indeed evidence that girls where raped by Epstein pals, he might have the moral obligation at some point to make the names public. Because I doubt that the perps will be prosecuted properly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not really sure what to make of this guy. On the one hand, he has made some of the corruption in the sheriff department public, which was a good move; on the other hand, he might not always tell the truth about other stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd be careful re going go to his website, he has doxxed the addresses of numerous people in the past. He might collect IP addresses.

            “Prieschl is a fucking little man with little man syndrome, he doesn't give a fuck about anyone but him, and will go out of his way to fuck anyone he can. He has no friends here, but he is a Freemason, like the rest of the Capts and Majors, they are all Freemasons. The sheriff is one, and he is also one a Shriner. Only freemasons and shriners are ever going to be promoted while Bradshaw is here. If Prieschl saw anyone doing anything, he would be the first guy to go out of his way to make sure the person was screwed. The ONLY way he wouldn't, is if he knew said person was some how connected and fucking with them would ruin his chances of being a major. He believes he will one day be Sheriff along with Maxwell. These are facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kletzy is a good guy and the agency needs more men like him because he is the complete opposite of Prieschl. Kletsky would risk his own career to stand behind his guys. He always sides with the cop and under no circumstance would he ever try to fuck a cop. He refused to go to IA when they asked him to. That alone tells you he is a good guy. There are Sgt who go out of there way trying to get in to IA.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there is PJ. He is another fucking racist asshole who hates whites, hates his men, thinks he is better than everyone, and was only given Capt bars because the agency needed to show they promote blacks. He is a fucking disgrace, his men hated him as a Sgt, Sgt's hated him as a watch commander, and Lt's hated him as a CDO.”
