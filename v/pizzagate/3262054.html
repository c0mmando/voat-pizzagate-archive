A lot of connections arise from this as promised by Q, including: Epstein, Clinton, Chloe Sevigny, Biden, Marina Abramovic, Terry Richardson, Downtown Standard Hotel, Dazed magazine (heavily involved) and many more. The themes include some very nsfw material, lots of nudity and semi nudity or suggestive content with young and young looking models (ages unknown in most cases). The usual TDS propaganda and deep state talking points are promoted heavily throughout which should come as little surprise, abolish ice, anti gun control, climate fearmongering etc. There is a lot of tedious work and screenshotting included in this and more help would be useful.</p>

<p>This one is actually the first on the list after Midland Casting Agency, which we know that Rachel works for. You may notice this is the first male that we examine in this series. It is a bit different and there were not as many pictures I screenshotted from, a lot of them are from these weird looking shirtless males and of him doing his best heroin addict impression. Not as much of the young looking and dodgy models and nudity though. The series with the bloody inverted cross across the face and the fact that he works with Rachel at the Midland Casting Agency and seems close to her made me feel like he should be included.</p>
