Mr. Matzneff could face up to five years in prison, yet the case is also an implicit indictment of an elite that furthered his career and swatted away isolated voices calling for his arrest.</h2>
<p>In a widening investigation, prosecutors announced Tuesday morning that the police would start seeking witnesses to find other possible victims of Matzneff.</p>
<h2 id="md-late-president-mitterand-was-an-admirer">Late President Mitterand was an admirer</h2>
<p>President Mitterrand socialized with the up-and-coming author and remained an admirer, even after Mr. Matzneff published a full-throated defense of pedophilia in 1974 titled “Les Moins de Seize Ans” (“Under 16 Years Old”).</p>
<p>After he became president in 1981, Mr. Mitterrand invited Mr. Matzneff for lunch at the presidential palace at least once, in 1984, according to the François Mitterrand Institute.</p>
<p>The president also wrote a laudatory article for a small literary magazine, Matulu, that devoted a special issue in July 1986 to Mr. Matzneff. Describing Mr. Matzneff as an “impenitent seducer,” Mr. Mitterrand wrote that the author “has always amazed me with his extreme taste for rigor and with the depth of his thinking.”</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p><strong>The scandal began last month when Vanessa Springora, one of Matzneff victims, who was groomed and sexually exploited by him when she was 14, published a book about her experience that hit a nerve in France post-Epstein. (Remember, Epstein owned a flat in Paris, and had ties to the French elites).</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Matzneff’s fall, if late in coming, was swift. His three publishers dropped him. The head of the National Book Center said that Mr. Matzneff would lose a prestigious, seldom-awarded lifetime stipend. The Culture Ministry is re-examining two state honors conferred on him in the mid-1990s. He lost his column in the magazine Le Point. </p>
<p>Last month, suddenly emboldened, prosecutors raided the headquarters of Gallimard, a prestigious publishing house, to seize copies of the books. In the case scheduled to start on Wednesday, Mr. Matzneff’s publishers and promoters could also be held to account — with the books as evidence.</p>
<p>Matzneff has been in hiding in Italy full of self-pity (of course /s) since the end of December.</p>

            Oh, France. This is a many years old german documentary about SRA in France with english subtitles. It has graphic descriptions but whoever is interested in this subject I recommend watching it.

            At 2:11 the subtitles fail to translate that Yanick Lanuvelle(one of the accused perpetrators) is a retired elementary school teacher.

            So glad you spelled out what YSL wrote abut in La Villaine LuLu. The ones I found were a cleaned up image. Rather like a naughty teeny bopper  type. YSL and his partner entertained many at their “den”.  No more protections please for these nasty perverts.

              Loose morals all over Europe. I refuse to use EU. But when you have a man leading his country with a wife that was his teacher who asked his parents if they could get married when he was 16. Well. This sounds like an R Rated drive in movie. And all the way before Mitterrand as well. Yes no wonder Roman hands fled to France.
