The song written about the YMCA was sung by The Village people who were gay. The song says that a young man can play with all the boys. What\'s crazy is the YMCA song was remixed by Disney which a main shareholder is the now arrested Prince Alwaleed who also owned floors of the Mandalay Bay(that is a Y shape from above) that Paddock stayed in when the Vegas shootings took place. Paddock is alleged to be involved in human trafficking.

            Y's and OWLS?  My 2 cents. I am a simpler thinker. How would these traffickers/abusers  have done this in the past? Before the Internet? Who was the first research engine that was poplar, before google? Yahoo. I went to Yahoo Groups, Searched on OWLS and found a lot of groups that are offering files (Zip) that I am unable to access, as well as vidoes, that sound freaky as heck. These videos are titled with words such as "Teen" "Kids" in the message boards.  I started to look at the groups with larger members, and noticed the file names do not match the "Group Description, Examples are  1. EZOwl Visual OWL Editor is the one with the zip files and messages offering XX in the hundreds. Looks Korean and has contact info to purchase the Viewer.  2) Owl Collectors 3) owl-fun etc (foreign).  4) Owls_Diplomacy .  I just started looking into this today, can use some help digging.  It appears that OWL is a key word - there are literally hundreds of groups in Yahoo. Just a thought. Thanks.

            The YMCA in Wilmerding, PA is right near the old Westinghouse Castle that George Westinghouse had his main office in. It could be a coincidence or not.

            My friends mom used to go the The "y" in Northeast of El Paso, Tx  I remember her mentioning one day that when she was a child some teachers she used to have there were arrested for satanic ritual abuse.  She spoke of how they used to take kids out of the classroom and they would come back crying.  she mentioned a few other things she seemed uncomfortable with remembering the story especially when talking about how they used to sit all the kids during circle time and make them sing terrible songs she was almost in tears and said it was because the songs were so terrible she didnt want to repeat them.  im trying to get a hold of her, by her claims this would have happened even yrs prior before the abuses surfaced.   honestly i thought she was bullshitting til now

            You can't assume that every YMCA is full of predators. There are good and bad people in every organization .  It's up to the good people to weed out the bad.

            Thank you for posting  this info. I've noticed the use of the Y in different places and thought it was odd., but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I've researched the  Y as an occult symbol, but I couldn't really find anything significant. Like certain people writing Y'Know instead of You know which wasn't typical of their writing style. Have you noticed this too?

            Tunnels found underground that lead to a YMCA... here is the link

            Disney also has underground tunnels and some locations have a YMCA kiddie care facilities. Just speculation of course...but could all these loud booms underground and shaking around the USA and worldwide (that are not from earthquakes) be our military destroying some of the tunnel underground network used for trafficking?

            Please do not assume that all YMCAs are a den of pedophiles. Like many of these organizations its usually the people in control at the very top that are bad and a few will be seeded into street level facilities sometimes.

            The Owl is a symbol for the hidden knowledge of the Ancient Mystery Schools. The White House, from an aerial view, looks like an owl.

            The "Y" can be symbolic of the horns of Baphomet among other things. The Y also has astrological meaning. It can also be associated with the shape of the Crescent Moon and other astrological things I can't remember.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Following the symbols can lead you to their dens for sure. We all know that. But just like the Catholic Church is rotten to the core at the top (Vatican) all Catholic centers and meeting places are not dens of pedophilia. Please use discretion.

              Of course it is and I never said it was harmless. I said do not assume that all the street level YMCA's are harboring pedophiles because they are not.

                Every YMCA is not staffed by pedophiles. I know all the people personally at the one in my town. Nice people. Only a moron would think all people involved at their local YMCA is a pedophile.

                  If you do not understand something so basic as what the Owl means in occult symbology then you know just enough to lead people astray. You are a know it all, that does not know it all, and knows much less than he imagines. The Owl is so basic to occult symbology that if you don't even understand that yet, and are too lazy to look it up, then it just makes you a lazy know it all who does not know it all.

                 <p>
                  It means many things. It has many layers, just like the occult itself. Your view of the occult is very two dimensional, at best.

                  I also consider you to be an extremely abrasive, obnoxious, paranoid, and grating personality. I would much prefer it if you do not approach me for conversation, ever.

                      There are basically two types of Masons and to put it into simplistic terms we can call them Black Lodge and Blue Lodge Masons.
                     </p>
                     <hr/>
                     <p>
                      One is what I would call a "builder Mason" that seeks to build and grow things, the Blue Lodge Masons. These Masons are more the "good old boy club" Masons that are in it for the fraternal brotherhood and business connections. They do engage in shady business deals such as Trump has in his real estate career with Roy Cohen, and at the high levels affiliate with gangsters, but they are not dark occult Masons that make a living destroying things. Trump is one of these builder Mason's in my opinion.

                     <hr/>
                     <p>
                      The Black Lodge Mason's are a whole other breed. These are your dark arts Masons, the pedophile blackmail group. I do not believe Trump is in this clique, and I never have believed that Trump is in this clique.

                      So see? You paranoid schizophrenic obnoxious mother fucker I never said he was. You are just too stupid to understand how the Jesuit Order is constructed and if you did you would understand the difference.

                Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

                Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire MONTH ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

                If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

                Claims Trump is insulated and will not be addressing the nation on what is supposedly the biggest mass-arrest in national history.
Claims there are more patriots than traitors in the government (LOL).
Claims something is in the works to make the Democrat Party lose the nigger vote entirely.
Claims martial law inbound.
Claims mass arrests of the government are inbound.
Claims the EBS will be invoked.
Claims no one will have to lift a finger and that the government will take care of itself.
Claims Obama went to North Korea and may be there right now.
Claims Trump would leave an important message on Twitter before leaving for Asia.
Claims Twitter, “My fellow Americans, the storm is upon us…”
Claims the CIA/alphabet agencies were responsible for the 11 minute Twitter takedown of POTUS account.
Claimed that martial law and the arrests will be made during Trump’s Asia trip.
Claims false flag attacks at right-wing gatherings (cities, sporting events).
Claims elections no longer matter.

                 I don't see it as paying attention to Qanon means ignoring everything else happening. They're not mutually exclusive. And although those things didn't happen as they were predicted to, I don't see these revelations and questions as a bad thing. I'm glad people are analyzing those questions. It makes us think deeper and helps us connect dots. Most importantly it opens the eyes of people who never even knew these things go on behind the scenes at the upper levels of our "government".

                 So try to look at it that way and don't worry that people are believing that everything is gonna be ok because those people are a small minority. Most of us are just glad to know that others are waking up at a phenomenal rate now. If nothing else, just having a smidgen more hope is good for our well being.

            The song was "written by Disney"?  Why do you say that?  I mean, the Village People were gay - and from the East Village - and that's the kind of stuff they always wrote about in their songs like Macho Man and In the Navy.

             West Village.   Also claiming they had anything to do with YMCA policy is like claiming they were Admirals in the Navy or that they wrestled in the WWF.

             Disney is a publically owned company.  No one person owns it. The largest stockholder was Steve Job's wife and she didn't even own 8%

            In 1971 a group of altruistic volunteers founded the Oahe YMCA in Pierre. The humble beginnings started in the MASONIC TEMPLE and the “little church” located next to the State Theater.  Out of this “storefront operation” support grew along with programs. The original building was opened in 1978 and was outgrown by the early 1990s. You can read more here.
