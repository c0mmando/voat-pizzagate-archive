            Well. Wow. So very few 'breadcrumbs' or 'tea' being spilt in here. I'm surprised noone in here more 'adept' didn't help you guys out at all on this thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, you just happen to crawl into a very prominent conspiracy. A very all encompassing, important aspect of the conspiracy realm that is, even as of yet by the very scientific community that has enveloped it, not very well understood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me first state that ALL cartoons are programming tools. Although I am not aware of the ownership nuances listed above it is already very well apparent that the large mind control production facilities are responsible for all of the major superhero franchises in existence, the most ominous in my opinion does happen to be MARVEL comics however.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a little hint before we continue: Stan Lee named his MARVEL comic franchise after
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)">
             Jack "Marvel Whiteside" Parsons
            </a>
            , founder of the Jet Propulsion Laboratories who subsequently, allegedly, blew himself up with one of his own rockets. If you pay careful attention to the Iron Man's father you will notice that he seriously resembles the late Jack Parson's and that the Stark foundation is none other than JPL's successor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack "Marvel Whiteside" Parsons was an AVID OCCULTIST of Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis and was involved with many of california's elite personalities. let me just hint at the fact that the Parson's clan may be very well connected to the Black Dahlia case which devolves into the Hollywood Elite's taste for ritual sacrifice due in part to the mechanizations of Jack Parson's, the OTO, and another faction...
           </p>
           <p>
            Project Paperclip Nazi's.  There is no doubt that the United States space program would have gone nowhere if it wasn't for the Paperclip Nazi transplant of Werner Von Braun into our rocket designing apparatus.This inclusion of nazi's extended over every aspect f American society, transplanted into science, entertainment and politics to begin the transformation of men, into beasts and ripen it for slaughter, which they have been doing for over the past 70 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that began as a transformation of your mind. Cartoons was one of the ways they found a way into your brain for a lifetime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like the Psyop that was the countercultural revolution, controlled opposition, science also had theirs:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "ONI Naval Lt. Robert A. Heinlein, above U.S. Navy 1929, was one of the most famed and respected writers of science fiction’s “Golden Age,” which occurred from the 1940s to the 1950s. Heinlein’s science fiction recruits worked out of the U.S. Naval Air Experiment Center in Philadelphia, PA.[34] Lt. Heinlein’s secret think tank also included George O. Smith, Murray Leinster (Will F. Jenkins), L. Sprague de Camp, Isaac Asimov, and Fletcher Pratt."

            What is PrinceRay of MCBA trying to tell you? ALL or most of the most PROMINENT WRITERS for SCIENCE FICTION were SPOOKS.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's their AGENDA? To not only get you NERDBOYS interested in SCIENCE, but eventually, ALL IDEAS REVOLVE AROUND THE
            <strong>
             OCCULT
            </strong>
            . Watch Star Trek careful enough and you realize that they are space representatives of the earths satanic society.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's funny that you mention science fiction in this vein because a program of massive intensity is operating in this very manner as we speak, it is the phenomena of the show
            <em>
             The Big Bang Theory
            </em>
            . If you will notice the show is trying to MOLD and INSPIRE the young nerds of society to continue with their scientific studies because you will get the 'HOTTIE' you always wanted. In between, peppered in the dialogue, are all the control mechanisms one needs to crystallize a person's personality into the scientific mold that has been present for generations... scientifically cold with a peripheral interest in occult matters and these science fiction 'entertainment' references (ie, star wars, star trek, asimov, etc etc).
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are any admirer of ancient 'wisdom' and are familiar with the work of the Turkish Mystic Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, he illustrates what it means to become 'crystalized' or stuck in a belief system without ever entertaining anything further. Also, he illustrates how IMAGINATION, although a very important tool for the act of creation, can also be used as a tool for this 'crystallization' process that he talks about. Imagination is being used as a
            <strong>
             magickal tool to trap our minds in a world of fantasy and imagination that will not ever have any place in reality.
            </strong>
            For many of us, that crystallization can keep us in a state of mind an entire lifetime that is blind to many other possibilities. How long does a child retain in his mind the wonderful idea that he could eventually BECOME a superhero that can leap over tall buildings or stop a bullet with his teeth? These things WILL NEVER HAPPEN, but I can guarantee you, that along with that fantasy, and many others that we were fed throughout our existence, like good paying jobs and healthy families, are ANCHORED to your psyche and they will not let go, lending to those philosophies that lead to poor self worth and a tumult of interpersonal conflict.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS is what Stan Lee of Marvel comics and all of the rest of those garbage peddlers persist in giving the public, something to satisfy their urges for escape to a better, far off place where everything is right, when in reality THE reality is that if ever a world existed as it does in the comic books and movies, will ONLY be aided by the 'MAGICK' of technology and perpetual enslavement to your unrealistic imagination.

            I didn't know this until recently but apparently Marvel has been super Jewish and Pro-Israel for decades... long before they got sold to Disney, which also happens to be run by Jews since the 1980s and has been pro-pedophile (at least at some level, perhaps a secret group) for who knows how long... perhaps since the days of Walt, sadly. There are old stories of Walt's later years in life... he would NEVER leave the park. He would be underground somewhere in the tunnels for up to half of the day and he would only appear to his staff members in the afternoon. The theory is that he had a private room down there like a bedroom, but who knows if it was more sinister perhaps.

            Nah, the Teen Titans one is a woman knowing where her strengths lie, her sexuality, she's only using what she was taught to try and subdue the man. If you pay close attention to how Deathstroke acts he has no care for it, he didn't raise her in a sexual way for his own benefit, he did it as a means of using her features to subdue the Teen Titans and take advantage of their emotions.

             Agreed about Deathstroke, but..
            </p>
            <p>
             Terra's a teenager, not a woman, (TEEN Titans) and she repeatedly references wanting to be with him after that scene till the end when Deathstroke betrays her.  Her emotional response is that of someone who believed she was going to be with him until that moment of betrayal.  If she "knew where her strength was" she would have responded more like black widow, a grown woman, and just rolled with it knowing there was always that possibility, not like an innocent child being betrayed by him &amp; her emotional investment, again.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least that was my take on it.
My wife watched it with me and responded the same, that the scene of Terra in a woman's nightie throwing herself at an old man was creepy.

             I agree with you but you have to work on your delivery and learn to respect etiquette and social boundaries, otherwise all you are during is hurting the cause. You can't go full 1488 until you salt the earth with red pills, and quite frankly I don't think you are doing a good job "red pilling" anyone on here right now.

Would love to roll into one of those sick rituals Duke Nukem or Snake Plissken style and beat them each within an inch of their life.  Think it would fulfill some internal instinct.

            I'm sure you are aware, but, to add fuel to the fire - here's HRC with the one and only, Stan Lee:

            And another breadcrumb to follow:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently he donated heavily to HRC, and it kicked up quite a bit of turmoil/lawsuits.

            Stop with the jew shit... it's a silly label that should not be haphazardly applied to entire religions. Are some bad? Are some evil? Are some involved directly with PG? Yes x 3... but that applies to nearly any major religious/ethnic group.

              Look I am probably as anti-Jewish as your average reader of the daily stormer... I am very very anti-Zionist. But JewBurger19, I am calling you out as a false prophet of sorts. I don't believe you are really anti-Jewish, I think you are some kind of astroturfing troll who apparently doxxxes moderators on this website. No real national socialist is going to behave like that. Hitler had honor, show some respect you fucking Jared Kushner worshiping untermensch. I don't care if you are a Jew or not, but you are sure acting like one. So shut the fuck up, get off this board, get off the internet, and start saving the white race (be successful, get married, have kids, raise a healthy family... in today's world a tall order) otherwise you are a scum hypocrite who causes more harm than good and Hitler would have put you in the oven, if there were ovens.

(2) What is the basis of their dispute? — Rab makes nine years the minimum; but if one committed sodomy with a child of lesser age, no guilt is incurred. Samuel makes three the minimum."

             Totally agreed.  I need more upvotes in order to downvote these anti-jew and obvious disinfo posts.  They're making us look like a bunch of crazy Nazis.  New articles every week wrongly focusing on these kind of crazy posts or comments in order to discredit the real research.  These Nazi shills are actually starting to have a negative impact unfortunately.

               You were right, my mistake.  I've only been a distant fan, not hardcore, but my hardcore fan friends told me for years that Marvel bought DC over a decade ago.  Looks like it almost happened, but didn't.

               I read comics occasionally growing up, but only started watching Marvel &amp; DC as an adult to track the amount of occultism being exposed to kids in it.
