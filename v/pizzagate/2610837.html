<p>Timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Poltergeist Series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happy Days:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fatal Incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Location: On the set of Rocky Road</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time: Sometime between 1/24/1988-1/28-1988, during midday (by triangulating the incubation time of a sepsis infection). Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspects: Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by anal rape.</p>
</li>

            <p>
             Time: Sometime between 1/24/1988-1/28-1988, during midday (by triangulating the incubation time of a sepsis infection). Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted.

            Speaking of Heathers, another Heather,
            <em>
             Heather Locklear
            </em>
            has gone off the rails recently. In the last couple of weeks shes been arrested countless times and sectioned/jailed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that item we had on her a while back? The one where she and ex boyfriend Charlie Sheen raped/played sick sex games with Heather's daughter when the daughter was a kid?

             Yes and Only now possibly she is starting to feel the pain that she caused her daughter.  So she kills it with booze and drugs.  So obvious.  She was surely abused as well.  Round and Round it goes where it stops.............

            I just came across this post on Facebook. Does this make sense to you? It definitely made my ears perk especially the pizza bit.  Posted 20th July 2016.

           </p>
           <p>
            Copy of post:
           </p>
           <p>
            DEAR SEAN , BEFORE YOU GO LISTENING TO ANY MORE OF DOROTHEA HURLEY'S AND HER FAMILY'S TALES OF WOE AND SO THEY CAN'T LAY THE BLAME ON ME FOR THEIR PROBLEMS AGAIN ! THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING I HAVEN'T BEEN WISHING ON THEM ! I CAN PROVE IT , TOO ! PLEASE GO TO THE LATE HEATHER O'ROURKE'S GOOGLE SITE AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN !
           </p>
           <p>
            THAT HURLEY HAD ACTUALLY CALLED UP KATHY PEELE AND THREATENED THAT POOR WOMAN WITH OPPRESSION , IF SHE DIDEN'T LET HER HAVE A MAN KNOWN AS ENIGMA 800 ON GOOGLE GO TO HER DEAD DAUGHTER'S GRAVE AND TALK TO HER AND SAY THINGS LIKE " HEY , HEATHER WISH YOU COULD HAVE PIZZA WITH US IN THIS SATURDAY , SWEET DREAMS KIDDO ! " AND BEFORE THAT , HE SAID IN A SARCASTIC TONE , " WELL , THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY 2 : 43 P.M. THE TIME HEATHER HAD PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY 1, 1988 ! THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED TO YOU TUBE AND WAS TAKEN ON SATURDAY , FEBRUARY 1 , 2014 ! SO , JUST TYPE IN HEATHER O'ROURKE FEBRUARY 1 , 2014 ON YOUTUBE AND YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT !
           </p>
           <p>
            SHE ALSO HAD HEATHER'S BRONZE MEMORIAL MARKER PROFESSIONALLY REDONE WITH MONEY SHE WAS MAKING BECAUSE OF ME , JUST TO HURT KATHY , THE LATE HEATHER O'ROURKE'S MOTHER BY DOING SO ! AND SHE HAD ENIGMA 800 SAY HOW PROUD HE WAS OF IT ! THAT IS VERY CRUEL TO DO TO THAT POOR KID'S MOTHER ! AND THIS WAS RECENTLY , JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ! THERE HAVE BEEN MANY VISITS TO HEATHER O'ROURKE'S GRAVE IN WESTWOOD VILLAGE MEMORIAL PARK IN LOS ANGELES , CA FROMT THIS ENIGMA 800 . THESE ENTAIL A VIDEO ENTITLED"  HEATHER O'ROURKE KISSED " , HEATHER O'ROURKE'S FUNERAL AT THE CHAPEL OF THE PALMS , AND A MYSTICAL VISIT TO HEATHER O'ROURKE'S GRAVE ! SHE ALSO PRESSURED THIS ENIGMA 800 TO GO TO HEATHER O'ROURKE'S FORMER MIDDLE SCHOOL BEFORE SHE HAD PASSED AWAY , AND IF YOU WATCH THE LONGER VERSION OF THIS YOUTUBE CLIP , YOU'LL HEAR ENIGMA 800 SAY THIS IS WHERE HEATHER'S TREE WAS .. AND NOW IT'S GONE ! IN SUCH A MEAN TONE , TOO ! HE ALSO HAD A TOUR THROUGH HEATHER O'ROURKE OLD APARTMENT COMPLEX IN LAKESIDE , CA ! , HE ALSO HAD A VIDEO MADE OF HER FORMER SWIMMING POOL AT HER FORMER APARTMENT COMPLEX , HE ALSO HAD A VIDEO POSTED OF THE LOCATION OF THE LATE HEATHER O'ROURKE'S MEXIAN RESTAURANT ( FORMER LOCATION ) NOW , FOR THE VIDEO ENTITLED " HEATHER O'ROURKE KISSED " ENGIMA 800 WAS LAUGHING AT SOMEONE HAVING PUT ON RED LIPSTICK AND HAVING KISSED HEATHER 0'ROURKE'S GRAVE STONE ! THIS IS NOT ONLY MORBID , BUT CRUEL TO HER LIVING RELATIVES , ESPECIALLY HER MOTHER !
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY IS THIS HAPPENING ? SIMPLY PUT , THAT WOMAN AND HER HUBBY KEEP REFUSING TO GIVE ME THE MONEY THAT THEY OWE ME , AND THE END RESULT IS THEY KEEP GETTING HURT WITH THE LATE HEATHER O'ROURKE'S PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY AND THE WAY SHE LOOKED ! SO , DOROTHEA HURLEY TAKES IT OUT ON HER LIVING FAMILY ! ALSO , RECENTLY , GOD HAD TO BURN DOWN THEIR EXTRA BUSINESSES , SO THAT WOMAN WOULDEN'T KEEP DOING THESE THINGS TO KATHY PEEL , AND SO SHE WOULDEN'T KEEP GIVING MY ENEMIES , INCLUDING MY RELATIVES MONEY FROM THOSE BUSINESSES , BECAUSE MY IDEAS THAT I HAD GIVEN JBJ BACK IN 2006 ABOUT DOING A COUNTRY ALBUM AND BEING NOMINATED IN THE COUNTRY CHARTS WHILE REMAINING IN THE GENRE OF ROCK HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THEM EVER SINCE ... ALL THE MONEY THEY HAVE KEPT AND THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING SINCE 2007 IS BECAUSE OF ME PERIOD ! AND GOD DOSEN'T LIKE THEM CONTINUING TO OPPRESS ME ONE WAY OF WITCH THEY KEEP REFUSING TO GIVE ME MY MONEY AND MY PROPERTIES ... HAVE YOU NOTICED THE DROUGHTS IN CALIFORNIA AND IN NORTHERN , NJ ? HOW ABOUT ALL THE FIRES THAT HAVE OCCURED IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE THOUSAND OAKS ? HOW ABOUT IN ALBERTA , CANADA ? , AND FLORIDA ? I HAVE BEEN GETTING HARRASSED FOR GOD'S WRATH ON ALL OF THOSE WHO OWE ME MONEY AND KEEP REFUSING TO PAY UP ! THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE ENTIRE JBJ BAND , INCLUDING THE GUY WHO REPLACED RITCHIE SAMBORA ! SO , BEFORE YOU GO BLAMING ME FOR ANY OF THEIR HARDSHIPS , PLEASE BEAR WHAT I'M TELLING YOU NOW IN MIND , AND DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION WHEN THEY TRASH MY NAME AGAIN ! OKIE DOKIE ?  PLEASE ALSO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SPY ON ME ANYMORE , BECAUSE EVERTIME I TRY TO HOME - SCHOOL MYSELF , THAT HURLEY HAS THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS BARKING VERY ANGRILY AND THIS HAPPENS CONSTANTLY FOR HOURS AT A TIME EVERY SINGLE DAY AND NIGHT , ESPECIALLY WHENEVER I SO MUCH A OPEN A BOOK ! PLEASE DO WHAT EVER IT TAKES ACCORDING TO GOD'S WILL TO GET THIS OPPRESSION SETTELED , SO I CAN GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND GET ON WITH MY LIFE AND MY HOME - SCHOOLING ! RIGHT NOW , SHE HAS THAT DOG BARKING ANGRILY , BECAUSE SHE KNOWS I'M COMPLAINING TO YOU ABOUT HER ! THANKS , SEANY ! I LOVE YOU EVER SO MUCH ! PLEASE HELP AND HURRY ! TTYL ... LOVE ME !

              Yes that name also stirred some interest, especially as they are connected to heather lockyer via sambora... and we've all seen those CDAN's.

             <p>
              Bon Jovi sent his kids to Poly Prep. A private school exposed as having a pedo football coach. Meryl Streep (polanski sympathiser) also sent her kids there.

               I posted on here a while back that J Bon Jovi quietly sold his Manhattan penthouse recently for $12mil.
              </p>
              <p>
               When a celeb sells their house quietly, under the radar, it usually means they need to raise cash quick to pay people off for a past scandal or they have gambling/drug debts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wonder who that $12mil is going to....?

            Sure I have posted this before, I worked for Conrad Bain (jewish/other) in 1987(?) at one of his pads on Fire Island. There were two ferry's a day. That's the only way besides boat. One restaurant that I could find. Played pool with Gene Wilder and his buddy, and me and this Puerto Rican kid slaughtered him, and his buddy. No money exchanged unfortunately. My uncle said on the long drive across the Barrens that Fire Island had a reputation as a gay island. I said What! Why! He said it is just well known. I just chalked it up to Northern folklore. I saw a pretty girl leaning against a rock when I went to the beach. Not going to dox her, but it sounded Russian to me, even though she had perfect English. I went to her and asked for a date. We went to the only restaurant, and I tried to get some information out of her, (customary for Southern Folk dating), and she just said I shop in NYC. That was her hobby apparently. Just in case he comes up in investigations, I did the slab under a very old dirt carport. When I say old, I mean when the house was built, or before. I met him before we left, and he seemed like a nice guy, but what did I know then? I was mostly thinking about the girl next door.

            Her health issues lasted much longer than a week before she died.  She was bloated from steroids used to treat her condition during the filming of Poltergeist 3, which finished filming 7 months before her death.  March of '87 she was diagnosed with Crohn's so she was obvs suffering symptoms before then, in fact her own mother says the symptoms began in Jan '87.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the only logical conclusion, if we believe the abuse story, is that she had suffered repeated abuse through the years which caused the intestinal obstructions to be a chronic condition and that the final Rocky Road/Jeopardy soundstage incident was the nail in the coffin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can we tie in any events from just before or during Jan of '87?

             My brother has Chrons. From what I know, the ones most reliably able to accurately identify the disease are surgeons.
            </p>
            <p>
             My theory: The Chrons Disease diagnosis is part of the pedowood cover up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reasoning: As per my theory regarding the Judith Barsi murder, "The best lies are the ones based on a truth."
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, the truth about Chrons being statistically more common in females is part of the cover up to the repeated anal rapes.

              It's a common(ish) intestinal parasite, but in the context of Heather's story it's important to mention because her symptoms did not clear up after the parasite was successfully treated, they only got worse.  She was then diagnosed with Crohn's when her symptoms persisted and she showed signs of inflammation.

               The Chrones diagnosis, as you mention, was not correct. The only onesI know with it are due to their diets. More hiding or a really bad doctor.

                Right, her mother even sued the doctors/hospital over what she believed was a misdiagnosis.
               </p>
               <p>
                "The suit charges that the operation performed on Heather on the day she died at Children’s Hospital and Health Center in San Diego established conclusively that she did not have Crohn’s disease but an acute bowel obstruction due to a congenital stenosis."

                Here is the article from way back in 1988 just after Heather died:
