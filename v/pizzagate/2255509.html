            Your first suggestion makes sense if there is indeed data that is being deleted (checking links for 404, make list, compare, filter). Lots of work for sure. If you do get it going tho, the results could be interesting.

What family was permitted to leave immediately after 9-11?
Who authorized the departure?
Why is this relevant?
Was anyone else permitted to leave?
Repeat.
