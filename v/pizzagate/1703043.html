            Now that portions of Vault7 are out we know the CIA has capability to do this. We know Podesta is involved with the CIA. This smells of stinky psyop directly from the Agency to push their narrative.

            OR.....the CIA hacked them &amp; made it appear like it was Russian hackers. We'd never know the difference if not for vault 7. And they could use it against Trump. Now that we know, they're not going to admit being hacked.

            From the wikileaks Vault 7 release yesterday, we now have confirmation that it's an easy and frequently employed technique to create email that traces back to any country or person the sender want to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, the days of saying, assuming, or even trying to prove that any email came from this or that country, this or that business, this or that government, etc. is at all relevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            In many ways still unfolding, parts of our world changed overnight.

            This is a very strange report and I think it's bs and they are trying to set up a desperate defense if anything comes out against them. If you pay ransom and then admit you paid some ransom for some unknown thing, then do you expect that to help your case if some news comes out about your misdeeds? The only point I can see in the report is that they fear their skeletons will come falling out of the closet and all they can think of is a fake "I already paid a ransom to those dastardly Russians for this, so don't be harsh in your punishment because I've already been punished!" defense. Something similar to that. Because there will be a juror who needs that excuse to clear you.

             BTW, the DNC actually refused to allow the FBI to look at their server which was "hacked." it would've been much harder to manufacture the fake story about Russian hacking if they allowed them to look at the computer forensics. The fact is that a hack never occurred and that the data got to wikileaks through a leak by Seth Rich, who paid with his life.

             Something else interesting is that only these two liberal organizations are named, and Arabella Advisors says there was an attempted blackmail attempt while the Center for American Progress says the report is wrong. And the report is said to be based on statements from unnamed FBI sources.

             Hooray for You!  I agree.  They are on the Russian Bandwagon again.  I am so sick of it.
