            A lot of Black People are JWs.  Possibly he took it up or was told to in order to please his fan base.  Joe was a Mighty Promoter.  I don't think any of the pedowood members were really running to JW meetings.  They used it to their best advantage, although a few might have been, but those I believe really succumbed to the JW craziness.

            This is bullshit, I would not be surprised if this is catholic/mainstream Christianity projection ! There is no secret database the JW's turn all Molestation charges to proper authorities, this article is laughable as keeping a database is not even a focus of the organization ! Most halls don't even have a computer and the claims that they sent in "letters" instead of a digital format to populate a database is a huge red flag to anyone who knows how much work goes into databases, especially today when anyone could have sent it by phone or computer.

            Haven't you learned that reporting from another news source is not creditable without vetting sources, this is how the "Russia Story" began.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The allegations against the religious group were first outlined in a bombshell report published in The Atlantic on Friday.

           <p>
            Would not be surprised if the Atlantic gets charged ! Who runs 90%+ of all media ? Who is on their board of directors ? "The current editor is Jeffrey Goldberg and the publisher is Hayley Romer." "July 28, 2017. Emerson Collective became the majority owner of The Atlantic" Emerson Collective is a social change organization focused on education, immigration reform, the environment, media and journalism, and health. Founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, the LLC uses philanthropy, impact investing, advocacy, and community engagement as tools to spur change in the United States and abroad.

            MJ was exonerated of all charges he was not a child molester, I am not a fan of MJ but i trust my gut and I knew he was innocent back when the allegations first came out conveniently while he was on tour and would have cost him more to stop the tour he was coerced to pay the first "ransom" he did not want to.

            MJ knocks out at your door wearing a fat suit to tell you an important message, which he promises will be totes brief, a message your neighbors thought was totally cool and not ignorant at all, what do you do? BTW, pretty sure Donny Childish Gambino Glover, born to a daycare worker and post office worker on an air base. also has a JW background.

Part of the religion is teaching you that the world is an evil place, so trying to reconcile really liking stuff in the world but also being told it’s bad makes you want to figure out,"

            Founder of the Watchtower, C.T. Russell was accused by his estranged wife of improper relations with their foster daughter:
           </p>
           <p>
            "During the trial Mrs. Russell's attorney alleged that in 1894 Mr. Russell had engaged in "improper intimacy" with Rose Ball, by then a 25-year-old woman. The Russells had cared for her as a foster daughter said to be an orphan. Mrs. Russell alleged that Ball had told her Mr. Russell claimed to be an amorous "jellyfish floating around" to different women until someone responded to his advances. Mr. Russell denied the accusations and said he had never used such language to describe himself.[79] When the judge asked Mrs. Russell if she was accusing her husband of adultery, she replied, "No".

            This thread was started to get your eyes off the mainstream churches who are the one who are doing the real child sacrificing. Always get their eyes off on something else!!!! You can gives me thumbs down all
You want to but I know the real truth!!! IT IS THE CHURCHES WHO ARE THE REAL SACRIFICERS. Because I saw them doing it!!!! No one can tell me they aren’t. The mainstream churches in the USA have massive amount of demons in them and they are the sacrificers of the children!!!!!!!! I’ve been saying it for 37 years and I will keep on saying it!!!!!! They give me thumbs down because they don’t want you allto realize just how massive the problem really is. There are sacrifices going on in every church, every cult group like the JWs, in government, Hollywood, music industry, colleges, art, corporations, banks, the Vatican, everywhere!!! It is so common if you really knew the truth it would scare you witless!!!

             Not all churches. Not even all Catholic churches. NOT EVEN
             <em>
              ALL JW CHURCHES
             </em>
             . I am simply saying that JW churches have a culture of silence that is attractive to pedophiles. Don't sensationalize, you do NOT help anything by doing that.

              The churches are who are sacrificing, it is the perfect place-no one would ever suspect it. The sacrificing is on a massive scale.

              Yah but JW is not mainstream, and there have been lies told about them for decades because the refuse to follow the paganism prevalent in mainstream. As above poster used one of the buzzwords that is thrown when discussing JW's "cult" I know for a fact he knows very little about the organization.

            I have made the case that JW are great places for pedophiles before. Their church is very concerned with appearances and will tell victims to shut up and forgive because that is their duty. I've known families to be split in two. This is not a true church at all, but one founded on lies. I'm glad I don't have to be the only one saying this here anymore. I didn't like being the only one. There's a researcher here who is a JW and I hate telling good people they've been taken in by something bad. Leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth.

            Prevalence of child abusers that are JWs in England:
           </p>
           <p>
            "When you consider the number of Catholics in the UK as compared to the number of Jehovah’s Witnesses these are horrific numbers.   How many priests are listed over the last four years?  According to the list 137 Priests were in court or charged with abuse.  When you consider there are 5.7 million Catholics as compared to 137,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses the ratio works out to one Catholic priest molester to 41,605 Catholics as compared to one Jehovah’s Witness elder molester to 5,269 Jehovah’s Witnesses.  That helps to show the epidemic proportions of the abuse problem within Jehovah’s Witnesses."
