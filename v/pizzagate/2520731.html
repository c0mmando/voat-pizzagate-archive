<p>After seeing this video, it makes you wonder if Avicii\'s (Tim Bergling\'s) death really was an overdose/suicide like they are telling us. Don\'t believe everything you hear. He was obviously exposing human trafficking/Pedogate/Pizzagate here, the Deep State\'s <strong>WORST</strong> fear.</p>
<p>Let\'s break down the video a bit... Who is the first person you see in the video?
(<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107906.jpeg">https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107906.jpeg</a>) Does this remind you of anyone? Look closer... what about now? <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107894.jpg">Fidel Castro</a> But... &quot;Fidel Castro wasn\'t a pedo/sex trafficker...&quot; Wrong again, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/17/nation/na-bush17">Castro Promotes Sex Tourism, Bush Says</a>.</p>
<p>Now let\'s take a look at the person at the end of the video (the last one they go after): <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107895.png">Politician</a> A politician smoking a cigar... And which politician that we all know famously smoked a cigar? That\'s right, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107896.jpg">Bill Clinton</a>. So what happens to the politician in the end? (<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107897.png">https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107897.png</a>) He was hanged.
Now, he may not look exactly like bill, but it seems there\'s a good chance that\'s who this guy is portraying... ESPECIALLY when you look at the <strong>last scene</strong>: <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107904.jpeg">Hanging Politician</a>. There\'s almost no question here that this looks like Bill at the end.</p>
<p>Let\'s look specifically at what the two who are taking out traffickers do to the pedophiles in the video: they brand them with the word &quot;pedofilia&quot;. This might be a shot in the dark, but my immediate thought was NXIVM and Keith Rainere, as he is known for branding his victims with his initials. [Keith Rainere and NXIVM]: <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107925.jpg">Keith Rainere</a> <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107923.jpg">KR branding</a>(<a href="http://time.com/5217727/keith-raniere-nxivm-sex-slaves/">http://time.com/5217727/keith-raniere-nxivm-sex-slaves/</a>) Could Avicii have known about NXIVM as early as 2015 and tried to expose them? Why are we just now finding out about this?</p>
<p>So... what was Tim trying to tell us when he released this music video back in 2015? And why does the music video have nothing to do with the song lyrics? I believe he knew too much and was trying to red pill and wake us all up, using his popularity and platform the best way he knew how. In case you didn\'t know, Avicii/Tim directed, produced, and starred in this music video. It\'s true, it turns out he is actually one of the now grown up kids from the beginning who are tracking down and killing the pedos/sex traffickers throughout the video: (<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107905.jpeg">https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107905.jpeg</a>) </p>
<p>Is it possible Tim was actually a victim of child trafficking himself? Whatever the reason, he felt a strong need to speak out against what we now know as Pedogate/Pizzagate, saying this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The promise of a better life often traps families and children into being used as tools for some of the most despicable people on Earth,” as he released the videos.
“It’s an issue about which I hope to start a louder discussion, especially now with the huge number of families on the move from war-torn countries looking for safety and shelter.” 
<a href="http://entertainment.inquirer.net/177875/avicii-tackles-human-trafficking-in-directorial-debut">Avicii tackles human trafficking in directorial debut</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this was in September 2015... Why would a video from 2015 cause his death in 2018? Well, let\'s consider the events that took place between then and now. Shortly after he released the music video, he was constantly on tour, playing at nightclubs across the U.S. and worldwide. This obviously took a toll on his health, with all the hardcore EDM drugs and heavy drinking. Let\'s rewind... almost two years before the video release, in March 2014, Avicii canceled his Ultra performance, as he was diagnosed with pancreatitis and had an emergency surgery in Miami to have his gallbladder removed: <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/avicii-hospitalized-from-blocked-gall-bladder-superstar-dj-cancels-ultra-music-festival-2014283/">Avicii Hospitalized From Blocked Gall Bladder, Superstar DJ Cancels Ultra Music Festival</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, Avicii was battling these major health issues. You\'d think his management would have been understanding and supportive but instead, his manager, Arash (Ash) kept pushing and pushing him to keep performing. Avicii even said if he continued, it would kill him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have said, like, I\'m going to die. I have said it so many times. And so I don\'t want to hear that I should even entertain the thought of doing another gig. And I know Arash knows this, which is why I feel extra hurt - because he has said that [I should play more gigs] when it suits him.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows that I’ve been anxious and that I’ve been trying. I didn’t expect people to push me to do more shows. When it really, when it’s you now, how s****y I felt doing it. I got a lot of resistance when I stopped doing the shows.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ash\'s response?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s probably harder to cancel these shows than to just do them… As long as you know it could cost you quite a lot. Just be clear on how much money you’re going to miss out on.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That\'s right, it was clear his manager only cared about how much money Avicii could bring him. <a href="[https://www.bustle.com/p/aviciis-family-released-a-new-statement-about-his-death-its-absolutely-heartbreaking-8908972](https://www.bustle.com/p/aviciis-family-released-a-new-statement-about-his-death-its-absolutely-heartbreaking-8908972)">Avicii’s Family Released A New Statement About His Death &amp; It’s Absolutely Heartbreaking
</a></p>
<p>One year later, in March 2016, Avicii announces that he is retiring at the age of 26, due to his health issues and wanting to leave the touring scene to live a normal life: <a href="http://ew.com/article/2016/03/29/avicii-retirement-touring/">Avicii announces retirement from touring</a>. </p>
<p>Soon after, in December 2016, Avicii fired Ash: <a href="[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7633087/avicii-ash-pournouri-split](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7633087/avicii-ash-pournouri-split)">Avicii &amp; Longtime Manager Ash Pournouri Part Ways
</a>. So why would Ash push Avicii to perform, knowing that he\'s literally dying? Is it because of his human trafficking music video? Is Ash connected to the Deep State? It\'s possible one of the traffickers in Avicii\'s video is supposed to be Ash, meaning Avicii knew there was something not right about Ash years ago. Look at the comparison: (<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107916.jpeg">https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107916.jpeg</a>) <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107917.jpeg">Ash Pournouri &amp; Avicii</a>.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at who Iranian born Arash Pournouri is. Arash, along with one of the co-founders of Spotify, founded the annual Brilliant Minds Conference in Sweden. Seems like a catchy, trendy event right? Wait until you see who he\'s had perform there... </p>
<p><a href="http://nordic.businessinsider.com/brilliant-minds-2017-6">Pharrell, Jeff Koons and Elon Musk’s mom are just some of the stars visiting Stockholm for Brilliant Minds – get a sneak peek inside the super-exclusive event</a>. One person, according to Ash\'s Instagram is the spirit cooker herself, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107910.jpeg">Marina Abramović</a>. Another one of his performers? The sicko artist himself, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107912.jpeg">Jeff Koons</a>. If you don\'t know much about him, his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Koons">Wikipedia</a> page itself is enough to raise a red flag... especially when you look at who his ex wife is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Staller">Ilona Staller</a>, a &quot;Hungarian-Italian porn star, politician, and singer&quot;. Oh look... here\'s Marina Abramović and Jeff, together with Lady Gaga, one that many know as a Deep State Luciferian who has attended many spirit cookings. <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3c65c29742/107914.png">Jeff Koons, Marina Abramović, and Lady Gaga</a></p>
<p>So you tell me... was Avicii\'s death the result of a &quot;drug overdose&quot; or was he taken out because he knew too much? My belief is that he is only one of many who were killed because of what they knew about pedophilia and the Deep State. Consider: Prince, Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse, Robin Williams, and many others <em>(Might do more threads on these in the future)</em>... all died way before their time and all seemingly random suicides/overdoses. </p>

It's possible one of the traffickers in Avicii's video is supposed to be Ash, meaning Avicii knew there was something not right about Ash years ago. Look at the comparison: (

           So you tell me... was Avicii's death the result of a "drug overdose" or was he taken out because he knew too much? My belief is that he is only one of many who were killed because of what they knew about pedophilia and the Deep State. Consider: Prince, Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse, Robin Williams, and many others

             Avicii acknowledged at the time of its release that his 2015 video for the song “For a Better Day” was intended to call attention to the issue of child trafficking (particularly in war-torn countries); it wasn’t a coded attempt to furtively “expose” a particular child trafficking ring

            Pinky rings came to prominence as far back as Mesopotamia, where men wore ones adorned with their coat of arms, family crest or monograms. These rings would get dipped in wax to be used as seals on letters and documents, functioning as a kind of signature. They were worn on the pinky finger for convenience, allowing a property-owning businessman or government official to validate their transactions on the go.

            I didn't realize that Avicii played the male survivor in the video. Wow.

           <p>
            Also, this video was made in 2015, when more than 1 million people immigrated to Europe. Many children went missing, and were trafficked.

            Basically, a situation like in Haiti after the earthquake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes you wonder what Avicii actually knew about politicians involved in trafficking of refugee children.

            One thing I noticed is that the time of the watch the politician in the car wears is about 12:20 - like Avicii tried to say it is in fact not 5 to 12 to tackle the problem of child trafficking, but 20 past 12.

            Is it just me, or does Avicii's character in the video have breasts like a female?

            His breasts are even more pronounced than the female character's.
           </p>
           <p>
            I assume he did not really have breasts, and that this must be symbolic of something. Any thoughts from other goats what that might symbolize? Or am I imagining breasts?

             I noticed this as well. Not sure what he was trying to say, but by this point I can guarantee he was saying something. He produced and directed the whole thing. When you direct, you get to pick the characters/make artistic changes - quite interesting that all the characters have similar features to someone famous or people closely in his life. He had a purpose with all of the nuances.

              ~Ora's management got in touch with the American label, Roc Nation, and told them about her. Ora signed a recording deal and a publishing deal with Roc Nation in December 2008, and was one of their first signees.[20][21][22] She made cameo appearances in Jay Z's video for "Young Forever" (2009) and Drake's video, "Over" (2010).[23][24] After being signed, Ora recorded an album and wanted to release it, but her label advised against it and she started to work on other material for her debut album.[16]

             In June 2017, British singer Rita Ora debuted a semi-acoustic version of "Lonely Together" at a private event at Annabel's in London.[126] "Lonely Together" was later the second single from Avīci (01). From 13 July to 2 August, Avicii shared one-minute snippets on Instagram, captioned "New music coming very very (very) soon!", with track titles as hashtags.[127][128] Avicii uploaded teasers of each track from the EP online upon release.[129][130][131]

            <p>
             On 10 August 2017, Bergling released the six-track EP Avīci (01).[8] Avicii said of the release: "I'm really excited to be back with music once again. It has been a long time since I released anything and a long time since I was this excited over new music! My focus on this first EP of the album was to get a mix of new and old songs: some that fans have been asking about and waiting for mixed with brand new songs that they haven't heard before!"[8]~~

In 2016, Bergling's health deteriorated and he subsequently retired from performing live.[145][146] Bergling spoke publicly about his health problems and pressure from his management in the 2017 documentary Avicii: True Stories, in which he is shown working from his hospital bed.[147]

             Avicii has left longtime manager Ash Pournouri's At Night Management firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             An Avicii representative confirmed the split in a statement: "2x Grammy-nominated songwriter/producer Tim Bergling and his production/publishing entity Avicii Music AB have parted ways with manager Ash Pournouri, At Night Management. Bergling is signed to Universal Music Sweden and is expected to release an album next year."
            </p>
            <p>
             The Swedish artist's announcement follows Axwell &amp; Ingrosso's departure from At Night Management earlier this year to return to longtime manager Amy Thomson's fold.

            Okay, so Arash likely had nothing to do with Tim, Rita and "Lonely Together", seeing as how the song was released in 2017, with Tim dropping Arash ~6 months prior, in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             So, what's going on here?
            </strong>
            <em>
             Were Tim and Rita reaching out for help?
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <em>
              I think so...
             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that Arash was pushing Tim to perform even in ill-health, it certainly begs the question what Arash's motives may have been and, given the child-trafficking relevance of the video for "For A Better Day", whether the company he keeps would have had any involvement in overworking Tim or otherwise pushing him to his death...

             Jeff Koons rose to prominence in the mid-1980s as part of a generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era.[18] He gained recognition in the 1980s and subsequently set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his work—in a similar mode as Andy Warhol's Factory (notable because all of his work is produced using a method known as art fabrication).[19]~~

             <p>
              The second weekend of Coachella is underway, and attendees have already been #blessed with a pretty epic surprise: an unexpected performance from Ariana Grande.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fans suspected that the singer-songwriter might be making an appearance at the festival when her manager, Scooter Braun, posted a couple of pretty cryptic tweets yesterday evening. "Hey
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ArianaGrande">
               @ArianaGrande
              </a>
              ... what are u are you doing tonight???" he asked, adding a cactus emoji for emphasis. Later, he tweeted again: "On the way the Coachella stage! Let’s see who is there?????" Needless to say, Arianators quickly flipped out, replying with excitement: "OMG #ARICHELLA IS REALLY HAPPENING!!!!"
             </p>
             <p>
              And yes, #Arichella did really happen. As noted by Entertainment Tonight, Ariana took the stage during Kygo's set to perform her brand-new single "No Tears Left to Cry." Her signature ponytail was tinted lavender for the event, and she rocked a color-coordinated outfit to match, complete with over-the-knee boots.
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              Soon enough, excited concertgoers began sharing photos and video of the performance on social media, posting enthusiastically about the epic surprise. "MY BABY #ARICHELLA," one fan tweeted alongside a colorful photo of the stage. "I CANT TALK OMG IM SOOOO OMG," another audience member wrote (honestly, I'd have the same reaction).~~

            <p>
             Curiously, the above article makes absolutely no mention of Avicii - despite that Kygo's set, during which Ariana debuted her song "No Tears Left to Cry", was underscorded by his tribute to Avicii...
            </p>
            <p>
             Something about her presence and apparent capitalizing on the death of Tim, in order to push her (coincidentally titled) new song... it reeks of an attempt to harness the emotion surrounding Tim's death and thus bolster the emotional effect of "No Tears Left to Cry", consider now, how many people who listen to that song, will be reminded of Tim's death and all the grief/emotions that come with it... something stinks here...

              The Manchester Arena bombing was an Islamist terror attack in Manchester, United Kingdom. On 22 May 2017, a shrapnel-laden homemade bomb was detonated as people were leaving Manchester Arena following a concert by the American singer Ariana Grande. Twenty-three people were killed, including the attacker, and over 500 were injured. After initial suspicions of a terrorist network, police later said they believed the bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, had largely acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans.

              Running theme:
             </strong>
             Ariana Grande seems to have death and emotional turmoil literally following her around - a way to facilitate emotional puppetry of her audience and ultimately bolster her celebrity status and increase her profitability. Is Ariana being used as some sort of pawn or worse? Quite likely.

             <p>
              Paintings and sculptures from the Popeye series, which Koons began in 2002, feature the cartoon figures of Popeye and Olive Oyl.[79] One such item is a stainless steel reproduction of a mass-market PVC Popeye figurine.[80] The artist will also make use of inflatable animals again, this time in combination with ladders, trashcans and fences. To create these sculptures, the toys get a layer of coating after finding the right shape. Then a hard copy is made and sent to the foundry to be cast in aluminium. Back in the studio the sculptures are painted in order to achieve the shiny look of the original inflatables.[81] For these surrealist installations, Acrobat in particular, Koons got inspiration from the Chicago Imagist H.C. Westermann.[82]
             </p>
             <p>
              Hulk Elvis is a work series by Jeff Koons created between 2004 and 2014.[83] The works range from precision-machined bronze sculptures—inspired by an inflatable of the popular comic book hero and extruded in three dimensions—to large-scale oil paintings.[84] The work series’ title combines the popular comic book hero Hulk with the pop icon Elvis. The triple image of the Hulk figure recalls Andy Warhol's silk-screen printing Triple Elvis (1963), regarding both the multiplication and the posture of the Hulk figure.[85]
             </p>
             <p>
              According to the artist, the Hulk Elvis series with its strong, heroic image of the Hulk represents "a very high-testosterone body of work".[86] Koons also perceives the series as "a bridge between East and West" since a parallel might be drawn between the comic book hero Hulk and Asian guardian Gods.[87]
             </p>
             <p>
              The three-dimensional works Hulk (Friends) and Hulks (Bell) (both 2004–2012) feature apparently inflatable Incredible Hulks that actually weigh almost a ton each and are made of bronze and wood.[88] The sculpture Hulk (Organ) (2004-2014) includes a fully functional musical instrument whose potential deep sounds match the figure’s powerful and masculine appearance.[89]
             </p>
             <p>
              The series’ paintings are collages made of several photoshop layers. The images range from abstract landscapes to elements of American iconography (trains, horses, carriages) and comprise characters such as the Hulk or an inflatable plastic monkey.[86] The landscape paintings often have explicit or implicit sexual content. For example, a recurrent crude line drawing of a vulva refers to Courbets L’Origine du Monde (1866).[90]
             </p>
             <p>
              The Hulk Elvis series has been exhibited at a number of international art venues such as the Gagosian Gallery in London (2007), the Gagosian Gallery in Hong Kong, China (2014) and the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, Austria (2015).[91]

              So you tell me... was Avicii's death the result of a "drug overdose" or was he taken out because he knew too much? My belief is that he is only one of many who were killed because of what they knew about pedophilia and the Deep State. Consider: Prince, Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse,

              , and many others (Might do more threads on these in the future)... all died way before their time and all seemingly random suicides/overdoses.

              Love him or hate him, it’s impossible to deny the sway Jeff Koons has held over the art world for going on three decades. With his Whitney retrospective opening this week and all his Koonsian periods on view – from the iconic balloon animals and vitrine-sealed vacuum cleaners to his more recent forays into industrial-grade cartoon paintings and hanging trains – maybe we can all make up our minds once and for all.

               For the last two years we've doing a lot of looking and watching and waiting with great excitement for the Renzo Piano-designed Whitney Museum of American Art to open in The Standard, High Line's backyard.

             </p>
             <p>
              I hope so. The show is divided into 24 chapters and each one takes on a certain idea that is drawn from the collection. It’s a history as told through this collection. There’s no one history, there are multiple histories. But that said, there are also icons that we look on as markers in the history of American art, whether it’s Hopper, or Mark Rothko, or Warhol, or Alice Neel or Stuart Davis, or Jeff Koons.

              Kimberly Lynne Watzman, the general manager of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood, was one of the three people killed in a helicopter crash in Newport Beach on Tuesday.
             </p>
             <p>
              Watzman, 45, had worked as general for the Standard Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard since July 2015. Previously she had been a manager and director at the Standard in downtown Los Angeles.
             </p>
             <p>
              Watzman, who lived in Santa Monica, was one of four people on the helicopter when it crashed. Others who died were Joseph Tena of Newport Beach, who apparently was the pilot, and Brian Reichelt of Hollywood, Fla. Another passenger was seriously injured and was taken to Orange County Global Medical Center in Santa Ana. Reichelt was the regional finance director for the Standard’s parent company.~~

              One of four people identified thus far as having died in a private plane crash on April 9 in Scottsdale, Ariz., was Mariah Sunshine Coogan, a resident of West Hollywood.
             </p>
             <p>
              HollywoodLife, the celebrity gossip site, reports that Coogan, 23, was flying to Las Vegas with several young friends, who also were killed. Three of them, including Coogan, are said to be “Instagram celebrities” because of their large following on that website. Coogan is known on Instagram as mariahsunshiinee, and has 31,300 followers.~~
             </p>
             <p>
              ~~Just before the crash, Coogan took a video of herself and fellow passengers, including Anand “Happy” Patel, 26, who also had a large Instagram following. The Federal Transportation Administration is looking into the cause of the crash, and it appears that James Pedroza, the 28-year-old pilot, did not have a pilot’s license.~~

             Yes, and actually a recent article backs up this claim, according to where Avicii was found...

              Yeah Wow!  I can't find the link in here that showed Pharrell and others with that Natalia in a picture together but when I saw that last name it set off and Alarm.  Bingo!  She connects this to the elites and Clinton and Obama.  Where the heck did I see that link now?  Hmm.  I have gone through most of them.

            UpVoat!  Thank You.  Your analogy is amazing.  If you look at my other comment you will see there is a tie in to the elites especially with BC and BO.

            The Castro thing is a bit of a stretch for me. It doesn't have to be a literal representation of people either. That part of the video suggested rural players to me. The other stand-out thing was the signet rings, this seemed like a big clue to be deciphered to me.

               Is TP the one with the glasses?  I can't see who you mean.  Also the post says that the guy with the cigar is BC and I believe it to be so.  Also see the guy in the vid with the long hair?  Does that signify Raniere?  Lot of symbolism in here. Yes, the guy in the car could be meant to be BC.  Anyone on here can see that now that OP has pointed it out.  I still don't know who JP is.  The one with the gray hair and the ring?

                Thanks for this comment! Yes, I said originally, it only looks to resemble BC with the cigar and all, but at the end, the last scene also definitely looks like him from the back. Not sure about any Podestas, I'll have to watch it again to see. As for Castro, I think that likeness is way too coincidental (military hat and long gray beard, what he's known for) to be a stretch. Also if the other IS BC,  Castro only makes sense, as they were both in power at the same time.

                 Yes, and think about it if they were in power at the same time.  I also think Clinton was being bad way before we have records of it. He may have been flying drugs back and forth and I remember from some  other post a while ago that possibly they were dropping off drugs and picking up children and bringing them back on the return flight or visa versa. This reeks so bad.  As far as the Podestas go, they are only evident if there is symbolism going on.  But to be truthful not everything in the video needs to be symbolic.  Possibly only the Major Players were included.

                I was wondering that as well. Wow, things I keep missing! I've watched this video probably 20 times now and didn't see the Podesta resemblance but I wasn't looking either. Could be true about the Raniere likeness too! Some things I'm still trying to figure out are who the Asian resembles and the guy with the beret.

                 Also the scruffy looking guy, the bony faced dark hair guy that gets beat up is that Wiener, is there more going on here than meets the eye?  Maddie and trafficking.  All tied together.  But if we are looking at symbolism that's who I think that is.  There is a lot of meaning here.  Not just scruffy looking guys, but elites too.  It is showing the pedos come from all walks of life.  Sometimes the ones you least expect.  Big Message Here.  Did you see my comment about the Brzezinski family being involved, Mark and his wife, the wife being the CEO at the Symposium.

              Here is a picture of his last days and 2 other people.  Is that Ash?  Also I believe that the Natalia woman is with them.  That means she was in Oman as well.  Since she is linked to BO and BC this is getting Very Interesting.

              Evidently I can't copy that exact link but if you scroll down you will see Avicii with her.

              I found it, yes the Symposium Stockholm and she is in that same link as you have with Pharrell.   Scroll down and it says:  Symposium Stockholm CEO Natalia Brzezinski together with her co-host, legendary Swedish rapper Timbuktu.  She is right under it and it has her name.  Amazing.

              The gold pinky ring thing is interesting, might be something work looking into... As for the politician, I don't think it's Davis, but not sure who the actor is.

               Could be something that really successful procurers wear.  The Really Big King Pins, possibly.  Like the mob.  I think a lot of them wore Pinky Rings.  Didn't Sammy Davis Jr. wear one?  His connection to Satan.  This could be the answer.
