</p>
<p>I went looking a little further into this and found some intriguing stuff, maybe you guys can help me shed some light on this.  
</p>
<p>So <a href="http://itccs.org/">ITCCS</a>, or International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State, is this organisation that appears to be run by a Kevin Annett - <a href="http://kevinannett.com/">his site</a> - and associated with another organisation called Republic of Kanata (more on that later), and Mr Annett apparently makes documentaries together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Lawless">this person, Louie Lawless</a> to raise awareness about the various forms of abuse suffered by children in Canada\'s Residential Schools.</p>
<p>For a little context, Residential Schools were Christian-run boarding schools back in the 80s and 90s that essentially stole Native children away from their homes, families and culture and inserted them into, well, Christian boarding schools, where it is pretty well established that rampant physical, emotional and sexual abuse occurred, we know this from the many witnesses who survived and from the addictions and mental illnesses suffered afterwards by former victims of the &quot;schools&quot;.   
</p>
<p>So anyway this ITCCS has an article <a href="http://itccs.org/2014/12/17/historic-common-law-grand-jury-to-convene-january-15-2015/">here</a> and another <a href="http://itccs.org/2014/12/21/itccs-breaking-communique-december-21-2014/">here</a> talking about a &quot;Common Law Grand Jury Inquiry&quot; which was supposed to start on January 15, 2015.  I quote (emphasis mine):  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Among the issues to be investigated by the Common Law Grand Jury are:<br />
-the Pacific Rim <strong>child trafficking and “snuff film” industry, and its ties to the Canadian, Thai and Chinese governments</strong><br />
-Catholic and Ndrangheta <strong>Ninth Circle sacrificial practices</strong> among west coast indigenous people, and the <strong>unsolved disappearance of over two hundred aboriginal women</strong> in British Columbia<br />
-the regime of <strong>“institutionalized pedophilia” and child killing operating among church, police, business and judicial leaders</strong> in the so-called “Twelve Mile Club” and the Vancouver Club<br />
-the unsolved murder of six aboriginal ITCCS activists in Vancouver between 2009 and 2014<br />
-ongoing “black ops” attacks against ITCCS leaders including Kevin Annett by Ndrangheta-paid operatives in Vancouver  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let\'s go down the checklist here:<br />
<strong>-Pedophilia</strong><br />
<strong>-Human trafficking</strong><br />
<strong>-Satanic cults</strong><br />
<strong>-Sudden and mysterious deaths of witnesses and activists</strong><br />
<strong>-Claims of British monarchs and various governments being involved in said crimes</strong>  
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/RepublicKanata">Republic of Kanata twitter</a> gets all excited for January 15th leading up to the date then abruptly tweets its last tweet on January 20th, 2015. Meanwhile <a href="http://www.republicofkanata.com/">their website</a> just links to a nonsense site full of auto-generated gibberish.  
</p>
<p>So what exactly is a &quot;Common Law Grand Jury Inquiry&quot; and why doesn\'t it seem like it ever took place, or led to any answers?  
</p>
<p>(Incidentally, <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/International_Tribunal_into_Crimes_of_Church_and_State">here</a> is an article vehemently insisting that Kevin Annett is a liar who runs &quot;phony organisations&quot;. Personally I think Annett\'s allegations are awfully specific to be fabricated, and obviously in light of pizzagate seem even more plausible.)  
</p>
<p>The ITCCS doesn\'t appear to be an organisation with much sway (it might consist of just the one guy...also, the website itself is not very well crafted) But it seems to me Kevin Annett knows some things that could help us.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>',
