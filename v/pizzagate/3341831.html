            <p>
             Helen Parkhurst (March 8, 1886[1] – June 1, 1973) was an American educator, author, lecturer, the originator of the Dalton Plan, founder of
             <strong>
              The Dalton School
             </strong>
             and host of "Child's World with Helen Parkhurst" on ABC Television Network.[2] Parkhurst took her cues from developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and education reformers such as John Dewey and Horace Mann, producing a progressive education philosophy emphasizing the development of the “whole child."
            </p>
            <p>
             Born in Durand, Wisconsin, she graduated from Wisconsin State Teachers College in 1907, studied at the universities of Rome and Munich as well as with Maria Montessori and was awarded her M.A. in 1943 from Yale University. She taught briefly in Wisconsin, moved to Tacoma, Washington, in 1909, and returned to teach at Wisconsin Central State Teachers College from 1913 until 1915. For a time, Parkhurst served as
             <strong>
              director of all Montessori schools in the United States
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Parkhurst was the author of “Education on the Dalton Plan,” which was published in 58 languages; “Exploring the Child's World,” with an
             <strong>
              introduction by Aldous Huxley
             </strong>
             , and “Growing Pains,” a book about teenagers. Parkhurst was named one of the 100 Educators of All Time. Parkhurst was decorated by the Queen of Italy, Empress of Japan, and Queen of the Netherlands. Maria Montessori best summarized Parkhurst‘s career by stating, ”Her intelligent activity is truly rare and precious.” Eleanor Roosevelt greatly admired the work of Parkhurst and played a significant role in expanding the population and resources of her school.

            <p>
             The Guttmacher Institute was founded in 1968 as the Center for Family Planning Program Development. At the time, Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon had begun to call the public's attention to the problem of unplanned and unwanted childbearing and its consequences for individual women and men, their children and their communities both at home and abroad. Concurrently, the United States Congress was taking its first steps toward the development of an international population assistance program, as well as a multifaceted, national program aimed at providing equitable access to modern methods of birth control in the United States. ...
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The Center was originally housed within the corporate structure of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). Its program, however, was independently developed and overseen by a National Advisory Council separate from the PPFA Board of Directors. Its early development was nurtured by Alan F. Guttmacher, an eminent obstetrician-gynecologist, teacher and writer who was PPFA's president for more than a decade until his death in 1974. The Center was renamed in Dr. Guttmacher's memory, and the Guttmacher Institute incorporated as an entirely independent nonprofit policy research institute with its own Board in 1977.

            ::
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             TCCR has teamed up with Mischon de Reya
            </strong>
            to help address the need to offer alternative ways to resolve disputes for families, so that litigation can be the last, not the first resort for the resolution of parental disagreements.
           </p>
           <p>
            This project comes in light of recent government figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, which reveal that the numbers of unrepresented parents in family court cases have increased dramatically over the last year coinciding with the withdrawal of legal aid from most family proceedings in April 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            Compulsory mediation information sessions were introduced by the government in April this year with the intention of reducing the number of parents litigating childcare disputes, however this has not had the desired effect. Instead the numbers of disputes reaching the courts have increased.
           </p>
           <p>
            As part of the initiative, TCCR has worked closely with client-facing staff in Mishcon's Family Department to develop a common language to help their clients understand the benefits that therapeutic remedies can offer them and their children. Now that this training has been completed, TCCR and Mischon are working to create materials designed to support the law firm's clients in making positive choices about their children when going through divorce or separation. These materials will be supported by the best research evidence, practice guidance and practical tools available, to make any referrals effective and useful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Susanna Abse, Chief Executive of TCCR said:  “TCCR welcomes this new partnership with Mishcon de Reya which gives us the opportunity to further roll out therapeutic services to help parents come to collaborative agreements about their children.  We know from experience that the need for these kinds of services is huge and this project will offer a ground breaking example of partnership between lawyers and therapists”
           </p>
           <p>
            The service will last for six months and will provide a fuller evidence base and case study for advocacy and wider roll out to other law firms; broader adoption of the initiative being a key goal for both TCCR and Mischon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sandra Davis, Head of Family at Mishcon de Reya, added: "Despite the best intentions of the Judiciary, CAFCASS, specialist family law practitioners and experts, the process of separation or divorce remains fundamentally adversarial and blame-focused. Inevitably the child loses out. This project aims to promote the more positive alternatives to litigation, to ensure that as few children as possible are negatively impacted by the process".
