            Hard to fathom. These people are evil. Obviously Washington knows about it. Hillary has many ties to the Saudis. Notice in one part it talks about how when the Saudi family places an order of a particular type of kid in the US, that "Washington" looks close by to take one never to be seen again. The Saudis pay top dollar for these poor kids so obviously there is interest in taking them. So for Washington to keep secure ties with Saudi Arabia they provide them US kids and turn a blind eye and people profit, no questions asked. Fucking sick. I recall Paul Bonaccis account when he was a child trafficking MK Ultra sex slave he had mentioned about being in an auction in Texas where there were about 9 or so kids lined up and a Saudi was present and bought a couple and had a plane close by. There were other auctions in which he was aware of on the eastern US and Toronto Canada. So yes this shit does, sadly, happen.

             this incident from 2013

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Days after federal authorities busted a “possible human trafficking” ring at a Saudi diplomatic compound in Virginia, state lawmakers and law enforcement officials warned that the Old Dominion is becoming a sanctuary for sex traffickers.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Wonder why we haven't heard any more about it?  Especially considering the following, you would think the Media would be all over it, right? /sarc
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Nearly 80 Northern Virginia establishments have been identified as operating illicit sex rings that enslave mostly young American girls, forcing them to engage in sexual acts for money, Rep. Frank Wolf (R., Va.) and state law enforcement officials told a crowd of some 50 concerned residents during a town hall forum Friday morning in McLean, Va.
            </p>
            <p>
             Onlookers appeared shocked to learn most of those who are forced into the sex business are 12- to 14-year-old local girls who come mostly from well-to-do families.

            I have found some weird stuff online that says the House of Saud is actually Crypto Jewish.  That the King of Saudia Arabia in 1969 said they were Cousins with Israel and they would not let any Muslim do anything bad to Israel.  Kind of weird stuff that I never would of thought was true until this Pizzagate rabbit hole.  It has made me disbelieve everything and not reject even the weirdest of conspiracy theories.  Because if the Global Elites are Satanic Pedophiles that rape and eat children then franklly any fucking thing is possible.

             Assuming this problem is limited to one group or race is dangerous; these personalities infiltrate ever culture. They are often the friendliest and most charming among us. They love to hide right under everyone's eyes, it part of the thrill. I've known Jews, Christians, atheists, and even avowed satanists who would murder anyone who tortures and murders kids. I've also known all of the above who might just be twisted themselves. Persona, culture, and tribe are all just means of access and manipulation to the psychopath.

             Yes i have read that in the past. I think even apart from that the Saudis do what's best for them and i think there is definitely a US/UK Israel Saudi axis pulling strings together in the middle east. The axis beneficial to all of them to promote perpetual war from which the corporations and their real owners benefit

             Yes it would have been ideal if they had, but still useful for various other reasons and some of the newspapers referred to could probably be found. try to look on the positive , not just post a negative comment

               You are criticising someone elses blogs from 20 years ago for not sourcing as you want, when you have no idea why they did not. That that is not you "aiming for high research standards", that is you demanding high standards from others.  Cant you be happy you got a load of new info.? I doubt it , so I am not carrying this on

                Well I am doubting the new info since it's not easily verifiable but I do am happy with the links and the fact that sources are mentioned so they can be verified. I support anyone who wants to dig into this.
