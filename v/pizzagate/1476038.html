<p>&quot;A thin, stern-looking man in photographs, Mr. Podesta was given the moniker
Skippy the Evil Twin by the staff when he was in a bad mood, according to
his brother, Tony Podesta&quot; -  &quot;Good story, but Tony needs to stop talking to the press.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Podesta was known to politicos as
“a man of rare humor” and “a straight shooter,” but “with a low threshold
for nonsense,” which, if anyone on his staff did something stupid, provoked
a “mean, surly presence” that colleagues nicknamed “Skippy” -- to be
avoided at all costs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With Skippy in the White House, it’s not hard to imagine what Jewell’s 50
research projects will “discover.”</p>
<p>That’s orchestration worthy of a Beethoven symphony, but the fingerprints
look like Skippy’s.</p>
<p>It’s all performance art, like the Wizard of Oz or stage magic, dazzling by
the misdirection of attention: Listen to our wails of outrage over here
while we wreck America’s industrial strength over there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who has worked for Podesta in the past decade knows Skippy, who first appeared during Podesta\'s eventful years as chief of staff in the Clinton White House . As scandal rocked the end of that presidency, staffers knew they had better come prepared to meetings. Otherwise, nurturing mentor John would be replaced by Skippy -- Podesta\'s quick-tempered, edgy and sarcastic alter ego.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven\'t seen him in this meeting, have you?&quot; the transition co-chairman for Barack Obama  says with a laugh, noting that many a reporter has met Skippy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This was, after all, the man whom Clinton staffers used to joke had an evil twin named Skippy to explain his flashes of imperious anger, slamming doors, slamming phones and berating staffers. He even kept a jar of Skippy peanut butter on his desk.&quot;</p>',
