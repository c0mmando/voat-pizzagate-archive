<p>Thank you all for doing a great job! I been following this from the beginning on 4chan,8chan and Reddit. The number of people wanting to help investigate this is growing exponetially leading to so many threads it is now difficult to get the big picture and focus on the important things and it will explode. Newcomers might also have a problem to check if somerthing already has been investigated. This is a historic event with the masses fighting back(at least in US, in my country, Sweden, people are like zombies and they are all supporting Hillary).Considering the amount of info I think it is crucial to organize the data. That might also lead to less &quot;doublethreads&quot;.  Would it be possible to have a &quot;middlelayer&quot; between pizzagate and the threads, like a list on the side that comes up after you click on pizzagate? What do you think?
Something like this:
- Summaries
- Info for newcomers
- New leads
- James Alefantis
- David Brock
- Obama
- Podesta brothers
- Soros
- Childtrafficking foundations
- Monica Petersen/Haiti 
- FBI/CIA
- The tunnel systems
- Earlier investigations
- Symbols/rituals
- Other
etc etc</p>',

             We need the moderators or admins to do that and I can't send them a message because I don't have enough points yet...This is something I believe needs to be done now before everything becomes a mess with all the leads.
