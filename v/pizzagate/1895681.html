<p>I highly suggest you sticky this thread for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The white house petition to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Seth Rich case is currently at 27,382 in just 9 days. <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/appoint-special-prosecutor-investigate-murder-seth-rich-alleged-wikileaks-email-leaker">https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/appoint-special-prosecutor-investigate-murder-seth-rich-alleged-wikileaks-email-leaker</a></p>
<p>At that pace, we would fall short of the required 100,000 by less than 10k signatures. I\'m actually quite shocked that there are even half that amount, considering how many of us believed that the pizzagate petition signatures were being tampered with. I was sure the same would happen when I first signed this petition last week. But here we sit with a pretty significant amount of signatures in just a little over a week and the likelihood of reaching the 100k goal is not far fetched at all. If we could reach the 100,000 goal, a WH official response would have to be made, which would bring so much more awareness to the Seth Rich case.</p>
<p>Seth Rich made the ultimate sacrifice to expose the corruption within our political system, and we owe it to him to do what is within our power to bring justice in his name. Now we all have an email address, so first things first. Go to the WH petition linked above and sign the petition. Then go and spread this on social media and anywhere you can. It would be nice if we could all find someone, like say a James Woods, a celebrity who isn\'t afraid to call out corruption, and have as many people as we can asking that person to share the petition. It\'s quite possible they may be bold enough to help the cause. Kim Dot Com shared this exact petition and is probably a major contributing factor to the amount of signatures we have thus far. <a href="https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/867906775709761536">https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/867906775709761536</a> Therefore, getting other celebrities like James Woods who has 661k followers could really help us in reaching  the 100k goal. </p>
<p>If you have suggestions on how else to reach as many people as we can in the next 21 days, then please share, so that we can all work together in reaching the goal. </p>
<p>C\'mon folks...the Seth Rich case can quite possibly take down some of the people involved in Pedogate, which is a win for us, but more importantly...for the children. Let\'s not forget...there are children out there who are being abused and murdered and that should be reason enough for you to at the very least...sign the petition. </p>
<p>I feel this thread should be stickied through the end of the petition on June 18, so that it can be available to all the new group members, and also to those who hadn\'t seen the previous posts on the petition.  Lets take some action guys...without massive action from the public...Clinton, Podesta, and the rest of the crooks will just continue to win. So sign the petition and share, share, share for Seth.</p>',

            Truthseeker: Are you allowed to vote in elections more than once. The petition process is looking for 100,000 individuals, not email accounts. Why would you be dishonest? Sounds like the tactics that David Brock and HIllary  use.  We are better than they are and our meritorious efforts do not have to rely on cheating  to get the message out.

            That's not very good numbers I thought we only had 30 days to get all the signatures, if that's the case we are not a third of the way yet and it's been almost a third of the time we have. It needs to be spread faster. I might be wrong about the thirty days thing I thought I heard that on the last petition about PG anybody know for sure?

            Thos post is the #1 way to deligitimize this campaign. Putting this kind of thing to print could potentially throw it out.
