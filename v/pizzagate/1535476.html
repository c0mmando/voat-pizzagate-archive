            Actually I have analyzed these headers and what I am seeing is there is no record of the source before podestas email server. So tracing that servers origin would not nescicarily show you his location just his servers location. That's is the xmail.podesta.com server.. I am not seeing anything in there that points out his location... I mean it is possible that the server is at his house. Even that both he and the server were at his house or another location, or in different locations. I am not seeing any useful information here unless it just so happens that the server is in the same location as the torture chamber.

            Wait so how could someone be fracked to two locations in one email. The way it works is you send an email to an smtp server. The server records what it believes to be your IP in the header. Then that server connects to the IP listed in the MX record for the recipient. There may be more stops along the way... but only the first IP address is the sender... That is if it wasn't spoofed or thwarted, which we have no reason to believe it was.

            There is some speculation that Hillary Clinton's "home server" was used to store / access / interface with secure government installations, re: "snuff material".

           </p>
           <p>
            apparently, they were using onion (basically TOR) router services to do this, with US government property, under auspices of the Secretary of State's imprimatur. But also, it's alluded to that the Clinton's "had front row seats" to disasters like 9-11, etc. "Snuff" type disasters. that would indicate possibility of prior knowledge, which is something I have suspected of the Clintons for a few years know (re: 9-11). sick.

            First of all, podesta's brother looks guilty as fuck and there are some serious questions about much of this stuff. I think you can read these tea leaves as pointing to John's involvement too. Whoever won't consider that work might be considered a torture chamber has never had a real job. Or is insanely lucky.
           </p>

            I think these rituals are probably real, and probably include blood sacrifice, as in the days of old.

            It is all still circumstantial. But the cards mean magic.  It's all in the cards.  Magic is real is spirituality is science is aliens is illuminati. The CP is a distraction. Think podesta's nervous little bit about UFOs. The ancient occult, the old religions, and science all add up.

            I'm not saying there's not child abductions on some level, but consider that might be missing something much much bigger.

            The forest for the trees. Why did the ancients sacrifice the innocent? To make themselves eternally guilty and full of shame?

            Or is there something deeper?

            Perhaps it's more like Hyperintelligence agencies.

             What matters is what they do to our children. Even if Reptilians exist and control the elite. Even if we have infinite potential with magic. None of that shit matters compared to the prior. The prior is what will get people moving. Everyone is disgusted by this shit. Once people get moving and force the elite to step down, the truth will come with it. It is them who have held the veil over our eyes for so long.

            That's actually not too strange of a sentence if you consider that it might refer to ordinary art installations or performance art pieces that are video-based and otherwise impossible to view as the artist intended. I, personally, find performance art of that kind to be pretentious bullshit and its adherents quite mentally-suspect, but to each his own. Most of the postmodern "artists" that these people are into have an astoundingly low degree of technical ability, and they just throw shit together to make some kind of deep, existential statement. "Hey, look at this gilded toilet seat, it's totally a commentary on capitalism and disposable culture, hyuk hyuk hyuk". I don't care if it makes me some sort of philistine. That kind of art is just plain shit. I like realist painters who actually know their shit, not people who fling paint at a canvas and call it art.

If your not a shill then you are missing the point... noone would build an underground room to display 3d art.. its just stupid. Any room with the widows covered would do the job..

              I'm not a shill. Let's be realistic, here. AFAIK, from photos in the articles about it, the setup consists of an open floor plan with projectors facing four separate walls, so that the viewer is "surrounded" by a motion art piece. No, furniture, no obstructions. You could project anything on it. Marina Abramovic's "Spirit Cooking" bullshit makes heavy use of cubicle-like setups, with things scrawled on all four walls in blood. I wouldn't be surprised if this setup was specifically intended for that. Don't believe me? Look at her video. This system could easily represent that silly piece. Or, you could project child porn on all four walls, I guess. It would be horrible for that, though, because seeing as there's apparently no furniture in there, not even a sofa, you'd have to jerk it while standing up or sitting on the floor, though I suppose the space could've been easily reconfigured in the meantime. It could be used as a ritual chamber if you're an occultist, I suppose. Maybe draw a pentagram on the floor and put goetic symbols on the walls or some shit, I don't know. So he has a basement home theater. So what? Lots and lots of people have those. One can only speculate on what he uses it for. A basement home theater or projection room on its own is not inherently suspicious. It's the other shit he's said and done that
              <em>
               makes
              </em>
              it suspicious.

            I kind of doubt he would use a literal phrase like torture chamber if he was actually in one. Not trying to give Podesta tha Molesta a pass but I've always felt this was referring to something else like the dentist.

             I can tell you from personal experience people who are in positions of power become so over confident and egotistical that they believe they have no need to hide what they do. We have all had bosses who get on power trips and think they are untouchable.   In fact they think they are above the law and can do whatever they want.  The podesta s  are "elites" and they run the show. Hiding is for the lower classes who do not control governments and judges and politician. Remember they are NOT like "normal everyday Americans" a phrase that Hillary Clinton despised. These people truly believe they are a gifted and higher breed of human.  If they have a problem as a result of their actions they typically hire a PR firm to clean up their image. They solve problems by hiring someone.like David bBrock and CTR. To them the public is nothing than a meal ticket both literally and and financialy. The fact that they barely bother to hide what they do is because they are relying on their connections to protect them. They know they are safe. They think the public is complacent and ignorant. This is the ruling class, they write the laws, they hire the judges, they groom the politicians. No one on this site is part of that society. The elites have no need to hide, their idea of damage control is deleteing emails from wiki leaks and assasinating investigators and whistleblowers. So when you read torture chamber.....don't assume it means something else unless you have reason to believe it is a codeword. Don't project your "everyday American point of view"on these schizophrenic scumbags that have become Mentally deranged with power and human blood. Let's follow the logic: 1. a person who displays art of torture victims 2.celebrates blood rituals and canibalism. 
3.associates with many convicted pedofiles : denis Hassett, the clintons, Anthony wiener, Jeff Epstein.alefantis, and the Amanda Klein man and the list goes on..... 
Well now,  the term torture chamber does not sound out of place when put into the context of their lifestyle.

             Or they were so fucking stupid they though they could never get caught? Or the ego was so large, perhaps they thought even if we did catch them, what could we do about it?

             Agreed.   But the timing/circumstances are contradictory to your logical assertion.   Coupled with the occult and pedo smoke, I would say it at least deserves some deeper examination.  Praying Julian drops some bombs soon.

            You only know this exists, because he volunteer it and was later photographed standing in it.

             It's been gone over before at great length, but their core psychology is narcissism. They feel a great need to brag about what they're doing and rub it in people's faces, even if they use code language to do it.

             And in a sense he's not telling the Guardian so much as he's telling other people in the know about his latest project so they know what's up when the invites go out for one of these "art viewings".

            Ok, so here is the timeline of events I have pieced together on this...sourced in my previous posts:
           </p>
           <p>
            John Podesta had surgery on 1/13/2014 and did not start rehab until June 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the day in question at 4PM Christopher Lehane emails JP and says "Break a leg, or a hand tonight" basically. Then John Podesta emails Tony P at 7:17 AM the next morning, "Had fun last night" to which TP replies "Still in torture chamber".
           </p>
           <p>
            Sketchy as F.   How do you explain still being in the torture chamber at 7AM the morning after a social event?  I mean if it was just BDSM and back-dooring the wife (have ya'll seen that email?) I would be OK with it.  But with all of the cheese pizza and pasta BS, this is pretty F'n creepy.  Also, pol is never wrong.  Christopher Lehane needs more digging, as he appears to be in the know.  Also, any events at CPP or neighbors on 1/31/2014?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Edited to correctly reflect that Tony Podesta was the one that replied "Still in the torture chamber"
            </strong>

             "Break a leg"is common phrase to wish a performer luck right before he or she enters the stage. I wonder could he have injured his hands by using them violently. I knew a guy once he broke his hand in a fight. Is the torture chamber where they "perform" violently?

              No idea.   All that is certain is that John and Tony Podesta were at the same event on 1/30/2014, and at 7:17 the next morning John texts Tony "Last night was fun" and Tony texts back "Still in torture chamber".   The use of the word "still" at 7AM would imply that the torture chamber (whatever that is) is related to the prior nights activity.

            Something weird is going on with my posts...so re-posting a summary.   I previously posted about why John Podesta's hands look gnarly.  He has a condition called DuPuytren's Contracture.   He had surgery on Jan. 13, 2014.

           <p>
            He did not start rehab until June 2014.

           <p>
            The torture chamber was definitely not hand related.  Check out this email from Christopher Lehane sent  to John Podesta on Jan. 30, 2014 at 4PM, the day before the "Last Night Was Fun" email...."Break a leg (or a hand, as the case may be) tonight..."

              Now that's interesting, thanks. So until proven otherwise and contrary to what I thought the still in torture chamber thing is NOT debunked.

               You are welcome.  I accidentally deleted my post with more info...my posts are showing up 2x when I vied thread.  Anyhoo, check out my re-submit.  TLDR: JP had surgery on 1/13/2014 and did not start rehab until June 2014.  On the day in question at 4PM Christopher Lehane emails JP and says "Break a leg, or a hand tonight"  basically.   Then Tony Podesta emails JP at 7:17 AM the next morning, "Had fun last night" to which JP replies "Still in torture chamber".

                 And that could be very significant.  Before my eyes were opened to this mess, I would have never believed how important symbolism is to these people.  And what's even crazier, is the tin-foil hat side of me now thinks that all of the 7's surrounding Trump might be significant.  Alex Jones is now the most prescient MF'er on the planet.  Hillary attacked a cartoon frog and then passed the fuck out and was chucked into a van like a side of beef.  Pres. Trump  defended his dick in a presidential debate.  Maria Bartiromo has luscious baby feeders. At this point I'm not ruling anything out.

                  I'm usually very cautious with the 'occult' angle cause I know well how disinformation works, on the other hand it's blatant that the moon, the moon cycles and full moons, are important for cult/sect followers, etc.

            When a guy collects torture/child porn art, has a large subterranean vault under his house and says he's still in the torture chamber after a night of 'partying', I have a hard time believing he's talking about his hangover. 
But he could be.

              The pizza code is legit. I'm pretty sure that the torture chamber refers to hand surgery.

              Remember that JPodesta is pretty clever and either uses code language or doesn't refer to crime at all in his emails.

             then provide sauce and i'll delete the post. if your so sick and tired of debunking this you must have a bookmarked Go TO sauce link for this post to quickly debunk. Although the torture chamber rarely comes up so i doubt you could be sick and tired of debunking this. Explain the naked kid pics in his room as well. Yah you can't cuz your a shill

            Tony Podesta admittedly has a huge area dug under his house to watch "complicated videos". I pointed out the torture chamber before and people said he was probably playing. I don't think he was playing if they deleted the message.

             This is baffling how obvious all of this is. who tf says this in an interview with a real journo from a somewhat legit msm outlet?

             Sounds  a lot to me like he's storing exploit films, snuff films and cp, and that's easy enough to do, but I needed a special seedy place under my home to slither down to and unwind after a long day of work.

             I've re-read all of that many times and by "complicated" they seem to mean that the room is equipped to project video on all four walls. Really, Tony is going out of his way to support "certain" artists whose work would never sell. But WaPo removed the article in the archive quite fast very early on in the pizzagate thing. I like "the call is coming from inside his house", that's pretty freaky!!! Also, this room would be very well insulated for sound.

             They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls.

             3D snuff porn instantly comes to mind when he says "difficult to display". I know they have some great hologram tech now days.
