<p>Erin Moran who played Joanie on happy days committed suicide Saturday.  The head of the child star group comments a lot in the article.  Says things like:</p>
<p>we were like family.  We tried to help her.  The past week half a dozen of us were doing what we could with the resources we had.  She was in a dark room and couldn\'t find the switch.  
</p>
<p>I found the title interesting and the child advocacy guys comments interesting - as if they all struggled with child stardom.  Is abuse the reason why? </p>
<p>Last paragraph talks about her writing a memoirs titled happy days depressing nights.  
</p>
<p>Here\'s the article:
The final days of Erin Moran’s life were plagued with instability as the star shuffled around various locations in Indiana’s Harrison County while her fellow former child actors tried in vain to get her the help she needed.</p>
<p>Moran, 56, was found dead Saturday by emergency responders after a dispatcher for the Harrison County sheriff\'s department received a 911 call.</p>
<p>An autopsy is pending.</p>
<p>According to the Indianapolis Star archives, the actress who played Joanie Cunningham on “Happy Days” was last known to be living at a Holiday Inn Express in Corydon, where she was spotted in September 2012.</p>
<p>Before that, it was reported the star had been staying in a trailer park with her husband Steve Fleischmann and his sick mother. The couple first settled in Indiana in 2011, the local paper reports.</p>
<p>Her distance from her California support system of former child stars may have contributed to her struggles, according to Paul Petersen, of the child-actor advocacy group A Minor Consideration.</p>
<p>“She was so far away in Indiana,” Petersen lamented in a Facebook post early Sunday morning. “The help she ran from was right here, as close as a call.”</p>
<p>Petersen, himself a former child star on “The Donna Reed Show,” said the group did its best for Moran.</p>
<p>“I am proud of our efforts over the years to help Erin Moran whose troubles were many and complex. Don’t doubt for a moment that we tried…sincerely tried through time and treasure…to give comfort to one of our own.</p>
<p>“At least a half-dozen [former child stars] were actively reaching out to Erin in the last week of her life... From Paris to London, from New York to LA, our members were in there pitching, doing what they could to help. Do not doubt that for a minute.</p>
<p>“Erin had friends and she knew it. Abandonment was not the issue... We did our best with the resources available to us, but it was a very dark room. Some don’t find the light switch in time.”</p>
<p>Moran admitted in past interviews that she struggled after “Happy Days” and “Joanie Loves Chachi” came to an end.</p>
<p>Still, she said in 2009 she had fond memories of her time on the shows and she seemed to harbor no ill feelings toward her famous cast mates.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened with all of us was like we were this family,&quot; Moran told Xfinity in 2009. &quot;It was so surreal with all the cast members. ... They were my family, get it?&quot;</p>
<p>In 2011, she and former &quot;Happy Days&quot; stars Marion Ross, Anson Williams and Donnie Most sued CBS, saying they were owed money for merchandising related to the show. The lawsuit was settled the following year.</p>
<p>Moran told Xfinity that she had been working on a memoir, called &quot;Happy Days, Depressing Nights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OH Erin... now you will finally have the peace you wanted so badly here on earth,&quot; co-star Henry Winkler, who played Fonzie, tweeted Saturday. &quot;Rest In It serenely now.. too soon.&quot;</p>',

             I read the article on my news app at 730 monday morning and saw nothing about cancer. I thought I'd share it later when I got a chance, so I copied it. when I later created the thread, i pasted the article from the app as well as a link to fox's website, but didn't read the article again on their website. I think their website article had the cancer part but the news app one did not. The news app only said an autopsy was pending
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry for the mistake. I would edit title if I could buy titles can't Be edited. Everyone thinks I purposefully left out the cancer part, but the original article said nothing about cancer and I didn't know she had cancer.  I've never seen happy days, so she's not really an actress I'm familiar with

            I read the article on my news app at 730 this morning and saw nothing about cancer. I thought I'd share it later when I got a chance, so I copied it. when I later created the thread, i pasted the article from the app as well as a link to fox's website, but didn't read the article again on their website. I think their website article had the cancer part but the news app one did not. The news app only said an autopsy was pending
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for the mistake. Everyone thinks I purposefully left out the cancer part.  I've been participating credibly in

            for 6 months.  This is the first time such a mistake was made.  It was not on purpose.  I did not know she had cancer

            Btw, the reason "they were trying to help her" is not that she was suicidal, rather she was an addict (drugs or alcohol, I'm not sure which) and she suffered from depression also. I don't know where the depression and addiction stemmed from but it may or may not be related to her childhood. Who knows? But we can't state such as a fact when we don't know for sure. I can imagine the stage 4 cancer could have been the result of a hard, addicted lifestyle.

             Yes.  I'm not jumping to conclusions.  I just thought the child star group was interesting.  Thought it was worth looking to.  I've never seen happy days and I didn't know she had cancer

              I completely agree, child actors are definitely a good research subject. There have been several former child actors that have come out recently stating they were molested/raped (Corey Feildman and Elijiah Wood, to name a couple) so we know something fucked up is going down in Hollywood. It's not out of the realm of possibly that something horrible could have happened to Erin Moran, especially since she was an addict. Unfortunately, we don't  know. The situation is incredibly sad though.

            I was a very little kid when Happy Days was airing... and I remember something interesting... The Dad, Howard Cunningham, belonged to a lodge... The episode where he was given the "Fez" , to my recollection, looked very much like a Shriner hat.... Getting the fez was a great honor on that episode..... Must have made the 33rd degree... also, they had a first born son named Chuck, who went away to university and was never spoken of again..... maybe it was just a decision about cast trimming.... but to never mention the first born missing son again... I always found that wacky... Just a few thoughts on this.... peculiar though...

           <p>
            Money and fame come with a price!
Allowing children into an environment where anything goes, and access to millions, spells disaster! Parents who allow/force their kids into Hollywood are no better than the criminals that is Hollywood! 
Make believe and pretending is not talent. Groomed and developed it is brainwashing. They are trained to fool the audience. 
It's no wonder why many are into cults, like Scientology. Fooling people is their only ability that is rewarded, and rewarded well. 
Really just glorified con artists!

            You're awful and shameless. You edited your citation of the article to remove the fact that she was suffering from cancer. Your title is entirely and pathetically misleading. You're as bad as the mainstream media. Fuck you.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first few paragraphs of the article,

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             An autopsy has revealed that Erin Moran “likely succumbed to complications of stage 4 cancer.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “A joint investigation into Mrs. Moran’s death was conducted by the Harrison County Sheriff’s Department and the Harrison County Coroner’s Office. A subsequent autopsy revealed that Mrs. Moran likely succumbed to complications of stage 4 cancer,” Sheriff Rod Seelye said in a statement sent to Fox News.
            </p>
            <p>
             Toxicology results are pending but no illegal narcotics were discovered at Moran’s Indiana residence, the statement revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moran, 56, was found dead Saturday by emergency responders after a dispatcher for the Harrison County sheriff's department received a 911 call.

            I think they said no illegal substances where found.  Pain meds from a doctor are not illegal substances.. Stage four cancer. Relief or ?

             I read the article on my news app at 730 this morning and saw nothing about cancer.  I thought I'd share it later when I got a chance, so I copied it. when I went to share it, i pasted the article from the app as well as a link to fox's website, but didn't read the article again on their website. I think their website article had the cancer part but the news app one did not.  The news app only said an autopsy was pending
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry for the mistake.  Everyone thinks I purposefully left out the cancer part

              No. I didn't think about your omission in a negative way.  I don't think the over all concept of something afoot should in any way be denigrated. Just pointing out that death can be complicated, but, the journey she took was suspect as you said.

            I cut off cable because I didn't want anything to do with Disney or Nckelodeon or my kids watching it. Dan Schneider is a predator and this has been open knowledge for years, Hollywood is riddled with these sick fcks. Look at Miley Cyrus (Disney), pizza and pedobear motifs on her albums and tour backdrops. Poor Britney (former Disney Mouseketeer) broke programming and flipped out. Amanda Bynes (Nickelodeon) flipped out. I hate those cutesy shows (like I,Carly etc.)because no telling what those girls had to do to get those parts.

             I read the article on my news app at 730 this morning and saw nothing about cancer. I thought I'd share it later when I got a chance, so I copied it. when I went to share it, i pasted the article from the app as well as a link to fox's website, but didn't read the article again on their website. I think their website article had the cancer part but the news app one did not. The news app only said an autopsy was pending

             Sorry for the mistake. Everyone thinks I purposefully left out the cancer part

              No, when I looked at the Fox story, I could tell it had been updated. That's something that I think a lot of people don't realize (I didn't before PG) that online news media continuously change articles without citing editing. They can be pretty sneaky about it especially the NYT. When they change the headline of a story, it doesn't change in the address bar.

            You're all apparently old as shit and know many examples.  Hollywood is not a sentient being from space.  It's basically shorthand for an industry of Jews and queers.  Stop euphemizing.

            Well, her first mistake was being a child. The next was announcing she was writing a book.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of what is said is chilling. Especially this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "OH Erin... now you will finally have the peace you wanted so badly here on earth," co-star Henry Winkler, who played Fonzie, tweeted Saturday. "Rest In It serenely now.. too soon."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is creepy given that Winkler was one of the co-stars she accused of abusing her. Pedo/RapeyWood is such a horrible destruction town if you don't play along. Ms. Moran could have been a Miley, a Angelina, a Rhianna being all tatted up and participating in playing The Queen in rituals, but she went the route of being caught in between. Tepidly venturing forth with allegations, she'd retreat into trying to normalize the situation and letting molesters help her get sicker. Very sad.

              Well, they've done a good job of scrubbing it. If you do a search, there's no direct quotes anymore. You only get hints of people saying they remember her saying 'something'. But, yeah, she made a couple of statements. One about Winkler ... and then saying something about molested multiple times by other cast members. And let me add this, she'd blurt it out and then go silent. You'd think she'd just keep going and tell details, right? But add in that the multiple abuse caused a multiple personality disorder. It would explain why she'd go quiet because if another personality took over to protect her from speaking out, that personality wouldn't necessarily remember all the details. I've met several women who exhibit signs of this multiple personality disorder. It's very strange talking to them . I mean, uber strange. They'll say one thing, and then immediately switch into someone else. It's disturbing to be around hence Ms. Moran being thought of as crazy, but what's even more disturbing is to think that things actually happened to cause this dysfunction.

               Yes.  Very sad.  So many starlets and stars end up with serious mental problems and addictions : Amanda Bynes, Miley, Selena, Demi Lovato, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Marilyn Monroe, Judy garland, Courtney love etc etc etc
              </p>
              <p>
               The males end up with lots of deadly addictions too: Michael Jackson, heath ledger, George Michael, Bobby brown, cobain, and the list goes on and on and on

               Parents should realllllly reconsider allowing or encouraging stardom of their children.  Just the weird act of acting in and of itself seems unhealthy to me - especially when the actress or actor is a child whose brain, persona, identity etc are still forming

                You make excellent points, but consider this: in Britain this doesn't happen to child stars. It seems Pedo/RapeyWood is the problem. It's very unhealthy, as is the notion that these kids aren't allowed to grow up. Do you watch TV? If you do, pick a British series ... any British series. Now watch an American series ... any American series. What will pop out at you is the difference in how grown actors look. In England, people ... and I'm talking women ... are allowed to mature. They have wonderful lines in their faces, double chins and look as if they haven't been unnaturally pulled by a surgeon's knife. In America? Everyone looks so fake and as if they're in Never Neverland where everyone is bound and determined to remain an unhealthy 30. If you read Ms. Moran's comments, it's pretty much what she echoes. How women aren't hired after 30, so the next best thing is to hideously preserve yourself so you don't age. You mention, Michael Jackson ... he's a prime example of it. Look at the lengths he went to to remain young. Yup, in America we got a huge big problem on this push to finance cosmetic surgeon's lifestyles. They've convinced us it's the route to go. It's Pedo/RapeyWood spilling over their culture onto us. Now women in Ohio want their butts enhanced ... why? Anyway, I did want to throw that out. The children from Harry Potter have all matured and gotten parts in filmed. They're not ostracized for growing up. Juxtaposition this against Mary Kate and Ashley starving themselves to remain small. Really horrible. It's Pedo/RapeyWood that's the problem and all the pervs that going into making that place so insidiously insane. I do feel so sorry for kids with aspirations. Actually, acting seems sort of wonderful for kids. It's why kids are always putting on plays and pretending to be characters. It's play and fun, but not when you mix it with rape, molestation, and abuse.

                 Good point that imagination shouldn't be squelched.  I'm getting extreme.  It's acting in Hollywood that is usually very unhealthy for the development of a child.

                 I have always noticed that European women are "allowed" to age.  Just the other day I read an article of a French girl always being amazed by the flat ironed hair, sun kissed tanned skin, and perfectly white straight teeth of female American foreign exchange students.  Several years later she moved to America and was astonished that most of these flat ironed, white toothed, bronze skinned girls failed to get dressed before they left the house.  She said everyone wears pajama pants and flip flops.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I thought that was funny. She's right.  I see a lot of pajama pants and flip flops.  I dress daily unless I'm doing yard work.  But a lot of women no longer get dressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sorry to go off topic, but I thought her observation was funny

                  Totally on point. No one worships youth like American sickos. And they're foisting it on the rest of the population. We don't care that you've been lipo'ed to death! Do something important ... like reveal the pedos raping children! That I'll respect.

              Yeah, it boggles the mind how messed up she must have been. And it showed. It's why it was so easy to dismiss her as crazy, but then they call even rationally-sounding people nuts. Remember, Bill Clinton saying that about Monica Lewinsky? It's getting tired. The Cannibal Pedo elite are crazy. Erin Moran looked uber normal in comparison.

             Yeah, the book memoir is very telling, none of them wanted it to be released I'm sure. No way she died by cancer, the Facebook postings alone verify that. The Fonzie quote is odd to me for some reason, I mean first off look at the strange capitalization the H and then the second sentence In It. This tweet took him a long time to write I think because he kept backspacing and retyping. The "oh Erin" is wierd. Were they close the last decade or so? How would he know she so badly wanted peace? That to me is very telling. So sad.

              You're spot on in your observations on that statement. I mean, WTH?!!! I think it's more likely he kept a close ear on what she was saying. No way they didn't have someone close to them reporting back on what she said. Pathetic.

            If this isn't an indication about how not only how corrupt and dishonest Hollywood is that they would let one of their own, a woman that we all grew up with who entertained billions then and around the world today, could be left out in the darkness and cold for so long without anyone offering a helping hand I don't know what is. Maybe someone did, we don't know, but we do know now that if someone did they stopped short of actually going and getting her to a rehab. Those 'stars' above did nothing more than just make a phone call. Something tells me Joannie  was dealing with much more trauma than what we are aware of. This kind of event, seeing the once bubbly and bright Erin Moran reduced to a shell of her former self, by the mechanization of Hollywood and life, should give us a sad perspective on the lives we're forced to endure on this planet by the likes of our 'overlords'.

             Remember that show on tv Dr Drew Celebrity Rehab? It went on for a few seasons with many stars on the show, some leaving part way through but there were so many instances where the drugs and alcohol abuse were due to childhood trauma.

            Mackenzie Phillips' book High On Arrival delves into the depravity of showbiz. It was just a few years after this (clip below) that daddy and others began to sexually abuse her and teach her how to shoot heroin.

             I read the article on my news app at 730 this morning and saw nothing about cancer and it said Saturday.  I thought I'd share it later when I got a chance, so I copied it. when I went to share it, i pasted the article from the app as well as a link to fox's website, but didn't read the article again on their website. I think their website article had the cancer part but the news app one did not. The news app only said an autopsy was pending
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry for the mistake. Everyone thinks I purposefully left out the cancer part

            Well, La-dee-da.  What do we know about Henry Winkler?  I know that there was a YT vid on here about Tom Hanks on the Kimmel show grooming a little princess girl.  Ron Howard was featured in it.  These people may be glad she is gone and maybe she had a little help dying.  She was getting ready to write a book.  She called Happy Days Depressing.  Maybe she would out some people as pedos.  Maybe they are glad she is gone, and breathing a sigh of relief.  Wasn't there also talk about Garry Marshall?  Not sure about him.  There are loads of scumbags in Follywood.

               I can't find any source for that other than QuantoKitty, though. In fact, I only find an interview where she says:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Question #13:I also read somewhere you where abused as a child, is this true? PLEASE explain? Did this mean as a child actor or a child?
               </p>
               <p>
                Answer #13: I have never been abused in the business! There was mental and physical abuse in my family.
               </p>

               EDIT: Ok, so according to National Enquirer, she accused Winkler of sexual harassment in 1992. It's been taken off the web, but you can read the google cache for now:

               Some say she had a "breakdown" on Howard Stern, talking about having sex with Scott Baio and being abused on set. (One source here:

               Maybe you knew him before he was tainted by the industry?  See QuantoKitty's posts below.  Winkler is one Moran had accused of abusing her.

              Yes, that is why I did not point blank call him a pedo.  But I am sure there were others that could have done the job on Erin.  The poor girl.  I just have a bad feeling about her death. That is why there will be an autopsy.  I wonder who is paying for it.

            Yes, forgot about her. Possibly she could have told you some things, about herself, or about Danny not even wanting to go home at night, and sleeping elsewhere. Of course they ripped Cassidy off. Susan Dey told her daughter who wanted to pursue show biz that they would chew her up and spit her out.

            this is bizarre, but not really that surprising sadly.  knowing what we know now, i think we can agree that its highly possible, if not probable, that a significant percentage of child stars have suffered greatly at the hands of a group of sick, depraved fucks, who inflicted upon them unimaginable abuse.  it also appears that it's systemic within the industry (so much so that it necessitates the formation of an advocacy group.)  ALL children's agents and talent scouts should be under heavy scrutiny at this point.

            Well that's sad. But I knew it was coming. Danny Bonaduce was experiencing abuse filming Partridge Family (not sexual that I know of), was strung out on drugs like this girl later. David Cassidy drank himself into dementia. The list is endless.
Edit: I think Erin Moran was mainly drinking.

             Guess what, being "so old", I was in love with David Cassidy as a teenager, and when I learned about his drinking, I was - disgusted. This story, and your comment, put everything in a different light.

              I'm a guy, I wanted to BE David Cassidy! Very sad what has happened to him, his dad was an alcoholic too. I'm afraid David has had a big chip on his shoulder for a long long time, and he can be quite obnoxious and self-centered. He thinks too much of himself.

            At some point there needs to be a class action law suit on the child endangerment that goes on in Hollywood. it is obvious that there is institutional child abuse in the entertainment industry. So many children in Hollywood end up sexually and emotionally abused but also financially destitute and often their own parents are the ones putting them in harms way. I myself would advocate banning the use of anyone under the age of 18 in Hollywood. It would severely limit their ability to push their pedo and sexual deviant agenda on the masses.!

             I'm absolutely on board with you there. And I've been researching the employment of children by the media in recent months as part of a bigger media reform project. But, if there's one specific issue that's most concerning and a part of the "system" most broken it's exploitation of children.

             I can't hire a 9 year old to work in my factory. But, if I'm a Hollywood producer I can hire them to work for my studio, in my film or TV production. WTF? Child labor laws allow this under certain conditions, but can I hire a child to work in my factory under "certain conditions?" Hell no.

              You bring up an interesting point. Wow. Historically children's age of consent was tied to labor laws regarding children. There was a movement to raise the age of consent but also to protect children from abusive labor practice. It was called the purity movement. B cause of the activism of a small group of fanatics who demanded the age of consent be raised to I believe 16 children were then entitltled to schooling and shorter working hours. Interestingly enough up until that time pedofilia was a common and accepted practice. It's interesting that you made the connection between child labor laws and child exploitation in Hollywood. Bravo.

             I'm pretty sure everyone in Hollywood is in some part influenced my mk. Rosanne stated it and hasn't had a job anywhere near there since. The kids are all being conditioned to be blind actors.
