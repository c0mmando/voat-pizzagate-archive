            Grand Juries can be set up in secret. To have a secret jury chosen on a criminal trial the trial would have to be secret as well. Not likely. But who knows what laws were passed in the last 8 years. Propaganda legalized in 2013. Law enforcement's ability to lie but not be lied to I think is post 9/11. Naming control of Internet lost 10-31-2016. Supreme Court Justices bringing in Euro Laws as part of their deciding process, last twenty, maybe. Yet, if there are any secret trials, they are... secret (sorry, had to do that)

            You have to remember if any of these arrests are real, there will be trials.  It would be in the best interest of the prosecutors to secure juries and sequester them before the most powerful weapon of team evil, "the trusted news and entertainment sources" put their spin into people's heads.

            </p>
            <p>
             Do you believe that there is any truth in PizzaGate? Do you believe there is corruption that goes up to some of the highest positions in several countries? Do you believe that John Podesta and the Clinton Foundation are guilty of child trafficking, or at the least pedophilia?

            I like it. That might be the reason Podesta is the most interesting part of this, because as slimy as Hillary is she's not smart enough to surround herself with loyal staff. She just collects more of her own kind.
