<p><strong>Before I go into detail about them here are some things Ive discovered from Sussman</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Donated $21,613,000 to Hillary Clinton, her second highest donor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Made 200 million dollars from the AIG bailout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resident of St Johns, Virgin Islands. <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/offshore-tax-haven-leak-implicates-seven-figure-pro-clinton-donor/">http://freebeacon.com/issues/offshore-tax-haven-leak-implicates-seven-figure-pro-clinton-donor/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Haiti earthquake he donated the use of his private jet for &quot;medical supplies&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donated $11,000,000 to Priorities USA Action, the largest Democratic Super PAC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Member of the CAP, Center for American Progress, board of directors. John Podesta is on that board as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In wikileaks emails he is referred to as the &quot;top priority&quot; when calling for donations and finances to DNC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58548">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58548</a> ....Went to a dinner with Soros, Podesta and Rothschild. Intimate dinner with only 6 people being there</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So first with Haiti. In this article the pilot of the plane puts emphasis of bringing lots of baby formula and even says that they brought a toddler back with them.

<p>“We  had about 4,000 pounds of I.V. fluids, bandages, crutches, tubing, I.V. stands, diapers, and formula, lots of formula,” said Jim Wilson, one of Sussman’s pilots. “There were narcotics, surgery supplies and supplies for doctors to perform amputations. We also had nine medical personnel on board going there.” </p>
<p>&quot;The extra time on the ground, however, allowed official to get a toddler from the Virgin Islands — who had been visiting family in Haiti but was separated from her mother — to board the flight and return home. They were trying to get the baby back to her mother but there were some issues during the first attempt,” said the pilot. “We were able to get the baby on board and reunite her with her mother.”</p>
<p>Possible connections with Jeffery Epstein?

<p>According to the article above they both have the same lawyer, Paul Hoffman. Also both have connections to De Jongh family.</p>
<p>I wish I could dig further, but right now this is all I can muster up. Hopefully this can be a good lead for people who are more capable of being more tech savvy and can dig deeper. I\'ll add onto this post if we uncover more information!!</p>',

            Love the scare quotes around "medical supplies."
           </p>
           <p>
            When you say "brought a toddler back with them," that sounds like they took a child from Haiti as opposed to helped a child return home to the Virgin Islands like the quote shows.

            Why do all these people have surnames that are something-man - Sussman, Cullman, Furman, Hoffman. Also, it's Donald Sussman, not David!

            Anyway, Gail Furman is apparently a leading child psychologist - weird that she'd be at a dinner with a load of ancient billionaires, although she is on the Council for Foreign Relations.
