<p>The children and siblings of some of the most important men of Mexico follow Keith Raniere and are high ranking members of his cult, called NXIVM or, alternatively, Executive Success Programs, or for short, ESP.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/migratorypatterns">@migratorypatterns</a></p>
<p>Alejandra González Anaya is an example. She is a NXIVM/ESP coach. She achieved the rank of Orange Sash with two stripes. {Raniere bases his ranking on martial arts with sashes and stripes].</p>
<p>Alejandra’s brother,José Antonio González Anaya, is chief executive of Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex),   Pemex is Mexico’s national oil company.</p>
<p>One of Jose Antonio’s allies is Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, who was accused of secretly withdrawing 240,518,000, 000 pesos from the national assets invested in Pemex.</p>
<p>Jose Antonio, a rising star of The Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. is expected to crook up the quiet end of that controversy and be appointed Finance Minister of Mexico.  He is close friends with current finance minister, José Antonio Meade, who may be the next candidate for president for PRI.</p>
<p>Mr. Anaya boasts that among his closest friends is former president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>
<p>Students of Mexican politics will recall Carlos ran for president in 1988 against Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who headed up a leftist alliance against PRI which had ruled the country since 1929.</p>
<p>Initial vote tallies showed Cardenas was going to win the presidency. The PRI, which controlled the government at the time, announced the ballot counting system had failed [They later burned the ballots] and declared Carlos Salinas president. The episode is Mexico’s most notorious case of vote rigging.</p>
<p>Keith Raniere is mentor to ex-president Carlos Salinas’ son and daughter, Emiliano Salinas and Cecci Salinas. It is not known if Cecci is a branded DOS slave or not.  But she is deeply inside the cult and one of its leaders. Both siblings hold the rank of Green Sash.</p>
<p>Emiliano Salinas also gets an allowance from his father, the former president, who reputedly stole a fortune from the Mexican people. Emiliano is kind of a nincompoop son of a powerful, but corrupt father.</p>
<p>Alejandra Gonzalez Anaya, sister of Premex chief, Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, was brought into ESP by Emiliano Salinas.</p>
<p>Besides being a coach for ESP/NXIVM, Alejandra is co-founder, producer and artistic director of a Raniere controlled company called Anima Inc.</p>
<p>ANIMA INC. was founded in 2007 by Keith Raniere and Alejandra González Anaya. The company is based on Mr. Raniere’s humanitarian philosophy and concepts, and manifests through Ms. González Anaya’s artistic vision and direction. Our work transmits some of the most intimate aspects of being human to create experiences that not only delight and entertain, but also profoundly transform.</p>
<p>Anima’s team also includes ESPians Anabel Cantú Merodio, who holds the rank of Orange Sash, with four stripes in NXIVM/ESP.</p>
<p>Branded DOS slave, Lauren Salzman – one of the highest ranked in ESP  -[she is a Green Sash, with edge and four stripes] is part of Anima.</p>
<p>The CEO of Anima is Esteban González Guzmán. He is a coach for NXIVM/ESP and holds the rank of Orange Sash, Edge, with one stripe. Esteban ‘worked’ for Emiliano Salinas’ [Raniere] company called Prorsus Capital.</p>
<p>Prorsus claims to be an investment capital firm focused on technology, real estate, tourism and financial services in Mexico and Latin America. I could not find mention of any venture projects on the Prorsus website.</p>
<p>But why don’t they have one single project on their website, which has been around since at least 2010?</p>
<p>Overall, Carlos Salinas is a man reviled as the keeper of the dark side.  Mexicans hate and fear him. Many believe he is the most powerful man in Mexico.</p>
<p>These are ruthless, yet powerful, daring men. Emiliano is the wastrel son and nephew. He spends most of his time chasing women, and men, and is in an open sexual relationship both with his wife, actress, Ludwika Paleta, and his business partner, Alex Betancourt.</p>
<p>At Prorsus, Alejandro ‘Alex’ Betancourt is President. At ESP, he holds the  rank of the Green Sash with three stripes.
Alejandro Betancourt, president of Prorsus, is the profligate son of the accountant for Manuel Espinosa Iglesias. Pappa Betancourt is said to have become wealthy through creative bookkeeping for his boss. Daddy Betancourt gives his son Alejandro a generous allowance, eliminating the necessity of him working.</p>
<p>Alex, now 40, spends about half the year on vacations in exotic locales [often with awfully young men] and splits the rest of his time between Mexico City and Clifton Park.</p>
<p>Emiliano Salinas is Vice President of Prorsus and he is a NXIVM/ESP Green Sash, but with only one stripe.</p>
<p>What gives Prorsus away as a possible shell company is having Espian Farouk Rojas listed on its website as a member of the board.</p>
<p>Farouk is a recruiter and coach for NXIVM/ESP and lives in Clifton Park, New York. Like most ESPians, Farouk is broke.</p>
<p>Poor Farouk, he has been a Yellow Sash with four stripes for at least six years, while people who started ESP since he got his last stripe, have advanced far ahead of him.</p>
<p>A source told me, most earnestly, that Farouk’s real problem with advancement is that he is fat. No one can advance in ESP if they are fat. Only thin people are allowed to coach and to teach. Thin people are the beautiful people, at least as far as the enlightened teachings of Keith Raniere are concerned.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many other wealthy Mexicans and Latin Americans in ESP. Almost all of them are the children of wealth and earned nothing themselves.</p>
<p>Edgar Boone and Omar Boone, the sons of Ricardo Boone.  Gabriel Delgado Ayua, the grandson of Manuel F. Ayua, the founder of the first libertarian university, Universidad Francosco Marroquin in Guatemala. </p>
<p>Vera Autrey de Costa [may be branded], whose parents had one of the world’s great art collections in Brazil, is another Latin American member of ESP. She spends her days in Raniere’s thrall in Clifton Park and sells off her fabulous art collection in increments to support herself as she takes ESP classes interminably.</p>

            Well Well. Three of Mexico’s Presidents are in some way involved in this cult, Salinas Fox and Pena Nieto. And people still find it hard to believe pizzagate exists. Hopefully once this news spreads some will realize what evil the elite are capable of and more eyes will be opened.

             So right!  Now that we are on to them and researching them we find that they are not as smart as they think. We see they eventually make mistakes and get caught. Yes I too fell comfy right where I am too. Snug as a 🐛 in a rug!

            I remember reading - maybe at the Frank Report website too - that NXIUM has been blackmailing Mexican judges and politicians. One third of NXIUM members are Mexicans, and E. Salinas denies that they are doing anything nefarious.

            He will probably be NXIUM's leader when all the US execs will go to jail.

            NXIVM hacked billionaire's emails with Hillary Clinton, world leaders
            <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Records-NXIVM-hacked-billionaire-s-emails-with-6576310.php">

           <p>
            Clare W. Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Company business empire, allegedly implanted a "key logger" virus on the computer of her late father, Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., so officials with the NXIVM corporation could secretly monitor his emails, including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to court records.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last month, the Times Union reported that Keeffe, in emails attributed to her, claimed top officials in NXIVM paid a Canadian investigative firm to sift the financial records of six federal judges and U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. According to Keeffe, NXIVM officials also used the Canadian firm to obtain financial information on Edgar Bronfman and other officials with the Jewish World Congress, which Bronfman headed from 1981 to 2007.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's unclear why, as Keeffe claims, NXIVM officials would have sought the financial records of judges and others, including employees of the Times Union, which published a 2012 series, Secrets of NXIVM. The federal judges identified by Keeffe have all presided over cases involving NXIVM.

            Stephen E. Herbits, 73, who was a longtime confidant of Edgar Bronfman and formerly secretary general of the World Jewish Congress, declined to comment. Herbits is one of at least three people who were associated with Edgar Bronfman and whose financial records were sifted by NXIVM officials, according to an email attributed to Keeffe in court records.

            A person who was close to Edgar Bronfman, but did not want to be identified for this story, said it's very likely that Clinton and Edgar Bronfman communicated through email. They became friends after meeting in the late 1990s when Bill Clinton was president, the person said, and Hillary Clinton supported Bronfman's successful efforts with the World Jewish Congress to get Swiss banks to pay billions of dollars in restitution to relatives of Holocaust victims.

            Bronfman, who was 84 when he died, was a financial supporter of Hillary Clinton's candidacies, including her unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton sat next to Bronfman at his 75th birthday celebration at Seagram Company headquarters in New York City in 2004. In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded Bronfman a U.S. Medal of Freedom.

            "Clare told me that Edgar found out, and they blamed Elan Steinberg, who had been the former executive director of the World Jewish Congress, for doing it," Keeffe said. "Elan Steinberg died in 2012, but people at the World Jewish Congress will attest that this computer was hacked."
