<blockquote>
<p>While all the very talented people on the independent news scene were uncovering new information about the glamourous Nicole Junkermann, I was focused on the one question that remained unanswered from my article. What were Jeffrey Epstein and Nicole Junkermann doing in the United Kingdom, from landing on August 31, 2002 until leaving on the 2nd of September?</p>
<p>.......... I had succeeded in narrowing down a search area, which would prove to be correct, but without something truly miraculous happening, I felt like I was doomed to never know the answer. I put a tweet out saying that I was still looking for Epstein and Junkermann\'s location on the first of September 2002, but in reality I was losing hope. I had done my best to get the question out into the public arena; if the answer was to be found, then the universe would have to provide it. On this occasion, the telephone was the universe\'s preferred method of communication.</p>
<p>From this point on, I must protect my sources. So, I’m going to start by giving you a basic round up of the events of that weekend. Then we can go into each of the details I was told, and any evidence corroborating the story.</p>
<h1 id="md-the-slightly-polished-dramatisation">The Slightly Polished Dramatisation</h1>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein and Nicole Junkermann landed at Birmingham Airport, located southeast of the United Kingdom\'s second biggest city, on the afternoon of Saturday, August 31, 2002. They were met by a prearranged helicopter pilot, most likely a representative of the Bristow Group. They were then flown 25 miles south to a secluded country house in the stunningly beautiful Warwickshire countryside. ......</p>
<p>......They landed at a relatively recently installed helipad near the highest point in Warwickshire county. They were in Ilmington, which was once the seat of the Canning family, until the death of Robert Canning in 1848. Situated on the northeastern cusp of the scenic Cotswolds, the Grade 2 listed building where they would be staying is Foxcote House, and was purchased by Leslie and Abigail Wexner in 1997. The two best rooms in the eleven bedroom house were already taken by more important people, so they would have had to settle for the less grandiose quarters.</p>
<p>........The majority of the security men were moonlighting British police and the two guests who were the centre of attention were both sitting United States Senators. This very small gathering wouldn’t be all fun and games. America was on its way to war. In just over a weeks time it would be the first anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and exactly one month later Joint Resolution 114 would be voted on by those same senators. The vote to go to war with Iraq, based on a “dodgy dossier” of exaggerated and manipulated information.</p>
<p>....The following day, on Monday September 2, 2002, Epstein and Junkermann were flown back to Birmingham airport by helicopter, where they would soon return to Paris. Nicole and Jeffrey went their separate ways. The next day, Epstein would fly from Paris with Jean-Luc Brunel, Sarah Kellen, and Cindy Lopez.</p>
<h1 id="md-the-senators-and-security">The Senators and Security</h1>
<p>I went from trying to find out where 2 people were located on 1st September 2002, to attempting to identify the whereabouts of the 100 sitting senators on that same day. The Wexner’s could not be identified as present, so the senators seem to have been meeting with Epstein directly. That seriously narrows down the candidates.</p>
<p>......When I first found out the location of Epstein and Junkermann, I assumed that at least one of the Wexner’s would have been present. That left all possibilities to the identities of the senators open, as Abigail supported a wide selection of Democrats and Leslie nearly always backed various Republicans. ......... However, there are other likely suspects including New York’s Chuck Schumer and New Mexico’s Jeff Bingaman who both received public funding from Epstein.</p>
<h1 id="md-the-wexner-war-on-iraq">The Wexner War on Iraq</h1>
<p>...Les Wexner would be a major force in pushing for the war with Iraq. A document leaked in 2003 entitled, “Luntz Wexner Analysis: Israeli Communications Priorities 2003,” commissioned and produced by the Wexner Foundation, should be studied in universities globally as a perfect example of elite state propaganda. On its opening page it states: “The fact that Israel has remained relatively silent for the three months preceding the war and for the three weeks of the war was absolutely the correct strategy—and according to all the polling done, it worked.”</p>
<p>...Fitrakis finishes his enthralling article by stating, “Lobbying groups like the Mega Group and government insiders like Wolfowitz and Richard Pearle are engaged in a systematic campaign to identify Israeli national security interests with U.S. military and security interests. The Wexner Analysis merely documents this extensive, often covert campaign, that deserves public debate and democratic discourse, not secret PR campaigns.”</p>
<h1 id="md-conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>....<strong>The article had some collateral damage; I’m sorry to the folks of Voat.com, if I am really responsible for your site being cyberattacked and shutdown. I salute thee, fallen soldiers!</strong>...</p>
<p>P.P.S. A small footnote on the donations of Les and Abigail Wexner: Records from the Federal Election Commission show that Leslie and Abigail Wexner had made many donations before and after September 1, 2002 to Democratic and Republican political organisations. But their donations to individuals were rarer. Between the period of September 27, 2000 and June 21, 2004 they gave personal donations to 5 of the 100 senators who were sitting in September 2002. Those five were Max Baucus, Mike DeWine, Trent Lott, Arlen Specter, and George Voinovich. The two closest payments to the date in question were to Montana Democrat Max Baucus and Ohio Republican George Voinovich from Abigail Wexner and Les Wexner respectively. But even more fascinating is the $5000 donation given on the Saturday night of the event. Abigail Wexner donated the funds to the Ohio Democratic Party on August 31, 2002.</p>

            I Love Love 💕 Love Vedmore!  Les is so gay he reeks it. I met him briefly like my time ago while shopping. His cos. have that special pass through customs so they are not inspected like others. We have discussed this here before. He and his fake beard wife are connected to the Arts and we know what they buy with their art. He is corrupting our young girls making all that disgusting slutty lingerie in teeny bopper sizes. Stupid moms getting them V.S. credit cards etc. I swear those models are under 18. The just barely had their b days. Leslie has been ducking under the radar for a long long time. He and wifey are involved with Columbus Hosp. also.

              Lynn likes girls so I have read. Perfect friend for Jeffrey and Ghislaine.  I don’t want to overhear any of their conversations. Steven is going to be found out. Hopefully Prince Andrew will fall soon so people will sit up and take notice. So sick of people with their Director Idols on pedestals. Nauseating.

                  Well, not sure what years you attended school. I started pre-school in 1984 at the age of three. I can say it was pretty much obvious indoctrination by the mid-90s on. Jee, about the time ol' Slick Willy took control! Who'da thunk.

                   Well I went through the Elvis stage during the 50s and 60s in school. Actually it was Catholic Schools. When I think back I kind of enjoyed school. I was an only Child so being around other kids was just great. Sex Ed was very minimal and we didn’t get most of it. Duh.

           <p>
            "Very few services look to human curation to enhance the music experience — Pandora, Spotify, and other big players rely heavily on algorithms — making this one of the key selling points of the service. Plus, Songza has tons of data around what people like to listen to based on the time of day, the weather, location, and activity, which can be immensely valuable to a company like Google who is looking to seamlessly integrate technology into every corner of your life."

             "On June 16th 2019, Nicole Junkerman’s NJF holdings website issued an article under the title “London Hospital’s Could Offer Patient Data to Google-backed AI Startup in a Bid to Develop Better Drugs.” It was exactly as I had expected. The convoluted title was celebrating the fact that OWKIN had already been promised NHS patient data, and they’re already confidently announcing it to their investors, and their other associates. We need to call for Matt Hancock to remove Nicole Junkermann from the Healthtech Advisory Board as of immediate effect, and we should have an inquiry into how NHS data can be protected from hostile foreign intelligence agencies."

             What do yo make of this? Wexler University | The Library | FANDOM powered by Wikia. Is this a TV show or disinfo? I do not watch TV so I am not sure of what I am seeing online a lot. There is  Sandy Wexler 2 |2019| Will there be a sequel? Which is obviously a TV show that has Rob Reiner as Marty Markowitz, and Arlen Specter's son, Allen Covert as Gurvy. Zohar sucked, and America hated it Sandler. (just in case he is listening)

             New Albany was virtually created by the man himself. I guarantee that town has some fishy shit going on. Maybe some model agencies, some sketchy clothing stores, etc.

For Israeli leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of both countries. What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is  losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today."

             "Back to Syria. It is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security — not through a direct attack, which in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel has never occurred, but through its proxies in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, that are sustained, armed and trained by Iran via Syria. The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel's leadership understands well  why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Speaking on CNN's Amanpour show last week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak argued that "the toppling down of Assad will be a major blow to the radical axis, major blow to Iran.... It's the only kind of outpost of the Iranian influence in the Arab world...and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza."  Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel's security, it would also ease Israel's understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly."
