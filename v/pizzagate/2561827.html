<p>Okay, I really, really, REALLY was starting to doubt the theory I\'d posted. I mean, Daniels was getting on my last nerve ... especially her scummy lawyer Avenatti who has set his Twitter account to private. I was starting to hate on her and mumble nasty things, but I missed this story yesterday! It went unnoticed and it\'s HUGE ...MASSIVE ... INCOMING!!!!  Yeah, that big! </p>
<p>Basically, Judge Kimba Wood rendered a judgement in the case brought by Peter Gleason for a protective order to be placed on: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>any notes from a 2013 conversation with Michael Cohen about ex-State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\'s alleged abuse of two women was rejected by a judge Thursday.</p>
<p>Attorney Peter Gleason had sought a protective order on notes Cohen might have taken during their conversation. Those notes could have been seized by the FBI during an April 9 raid on Cohen\'s law office and residences.</p>

<p>YES! Those conversations are now in evidence! Here\'s more ... same link: </p>
<h1>Protective order on Michael Cohen\'s notes over Eric Schneiderman\'s abuse allegations denied</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>In a terse one-page ruling Manhattan Federal Court Judge Kimba Wood rejected Gleason\'s effort for an added level of secrecy on the notes.</p>
<p>Wood is overseeing an ongoing case over the raid, which revealed an investigation into President Trump\'s personal attorney for campaign finance violations, as well as bank and wire fraud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this important? For the obvious reasons, and the not so obvious one. You see, the four women who brought the abuse allegations are NOT the same two that spoke with COHEN!!!! Brilliant! Genius! But now whatever those two women said can be used because they were ruled admissible!!!</p>

<p>The timeline of events don’t match up, either. It’s a pattern we’ve seen again and again in the era of #MeToo. Men who abuse women are often accused more than once, or twice, or even four times. Abuse of power is about entitlement, and many powerful men feel very entitled. </p>

<p>Yeah, Jane Mayer and whoever is writing this article!!!! THAT\'S THE POINT! They\'re two DIFFERENT women! And we don\'t know what they said! Are you all getting the drift of this? </p>
<p>Best of all these women are not connected to Trump! They\'re the ones wearing the pussycat ear hats and screaming at the sky to RESIST!!!! </p>

<p>The New Yorker reported on the experiences of four women, noting the timing of three of their accounts. Mayer, tweeted that none of the women she interviewed is connected to Trump:</p>

<p>Hmmmm .... rabbit hole deepens ... And the alleged woman abuser wearing guyliner also was relied upon to help derail Trump\'s presidency in bolstering the false narrative based on the bogus dossier and lie about \'\'Russian collusion.\'\' </p>

<p>Smart guy, huh? Prophetic, too. But what about Q\'s contribution to this evidence seizing? Yup, there\'s that, too: </p>

<p>Again: </p>

<p>Cohen raid by FBI?
Public context: re: payment to Stormy Daniels?
SC &amp; FBI raided POTUS’ attorney to pull Stormy Daniels payment info?
RR signed off?
What other docs were collected?
How many places raided?
Raid on the President of the United States’ attorney for payment details re: private case re: Stormy Daniels?

<p>Why you do it through the use of one very gorgeous, smart gal! </p>
<p>Only question for me is whether Stormy was one of those women who talked to Cohen ... and what could it have had to do with .... ????? </p>

             No bleach-bitting. No hammer. Our POTUS knew Cohen took notes ... probably copious notes.

             Ha! Can't wait to find out what they say because, remember, these statements weren't made in a court of law. They were women talking to an attorney and spilling their guts. No telling what was said or who was purportedly involved.

             It has to be done because any straightforward attempts would be blocked. You actually think Mueller would knowingly put that into evidence? Absolutely not. The only way would be to create a false narrative. He knows he's been had.

            <p>
             And the other good thing is that Kimba Wood is a white hat. I would not have guessed that. She was a Playboy model, and I would have assumed, caught up in the cabal. Could be some of her friends were caught up in the abuse or could be she has a sense of ethics.

            It's all theater. Lose the exclamation points. The government was disolved March 9th 1933 via the emergency banking act. The country was turned into a corporation controlled by the Rothschild banking cartel. Politicians are employees of the cartel as are spooks. You really need to grow out of your need to think progress is being made. The master will not have the servants arrest each other and the servants will not be instructed to free the slaves. Slaves must revolt or remain slaves. Servants will not fight for them. Probes and investigations are a show to give the veneer of legitimacy. Retain the knowledge you have searched out and stop regressing. There is no and never will be a PG investigation by the servants of the masters. Covering up their own crimes is what they do. Leave fantasyland and join us in reality. Adults have the responsibility of facing it.

            Btw, I don't believe the Jehovah's Witness bit in your post has to do with an accusation against Schneiderman.  It's about a whistle-blowing ex-JW filing a complaint against JW officials for covering up crimes.  The complaint was filed in the NY State AG's office.

             Well, that would directly involve Schneiderman if it was filed in the time he was AG.

                Well, okay.  I don't get what you think the article was saying about Schneiderman.  People typically file legal complaints in the attorney general's office.  That's all the article was saying about the AG's office--that the complaint was filed there.
               </p>
               <p>
                There doesn't seem to be a connection beyond that between Schneiderman and the complaint that was filed is all I was trying to point out.  Not a big deal.

                 But it is his discretion  that is used in following up on said complaint. I know, I'll give you an example:
                </p>
                <p>
                 An actress is assaulted by a big-time movie producer/director. She goes to the LAPD and files a complaint. The LAPD determines there's no evidence that the sex was not consensual despite bruising, a hospital report, and two witnesses. Who would you say is responsible for the case not going forward?

                  The case was filed May 18 and there's no indication in the article that it's not being followed up on, but I say let's agree to disagree and move on.  It's a mole hill.

               Oh, if she's in on helping our POTUS, Q would never mention her. She would be working as a double agent, pretending to be working against him. No, he would never mention her. But Stormy ... and she sometimes uses the last name Waters. That has been mentioned ... a lot ... then there are the photos.

            the U.S. attorney's office in Albany,
           </p>

             I'll try to squeeze that in OP, but I'm right at the word count limit.

             I gotta admit I was losing my faith. I was moving over to thinking she was a dirty girl. But this has restored my faith that my original gut feeling was on point.

               You're meeting her now.
              </p>
              <p>
               Right around the time when she would have been tapped, she was in financial trouble. If they dangled earning money in front of her, she might have bitten.
              </p>
              <p>
               She does not use good judgement. She's had two bad marriages, and this third was abusive ... that is not a confident woman. It's someone that makes really bad decisions.

            so what this seems like is Donald Trump was stockpiling fuel for blackmail.
           </p>
           <p>
            He certainly didn't say he had this evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also  how does this balance out all the damage that is coming from Michael Cohen.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, we now know that Michael Cohen drew up a 1.6 million dollar hush money NDA for different woman, but he used the same "David Dennison" pseudonym for Trump in that NDA.  Elliot Broidy claimed to be the reason for the NDA, but I think he's just the beard.......this is just one unexploded bombshell among the Michael Cohen stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cohen's business partner in the NY Taxi buisiness just flipped and his cooperating.  He's connected to Russian mob elements in NYC, just like Cohen is.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might think the Cohen investigation stemmed from the Stormy Daniels case, but that is just timing.  Mueller has been investigating Cohen for months and months now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The warrant against Michael Cohen is for crimes SEPARATE from the Russia probe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cohen's possible invovlement in the Russia probe is still ongoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we will find your idea of bait to be not supported by the full case when we know it.

              Why is someone deemed a shill whenever an opinion is expressed contrary to that of a poster?  Rigorous debate tests the opposing argument. Assume for a moment  that AreWeSure's  statements are accurate despite no links. Do they bring into.doubt the validity of Migratory's scenario?

             <p>
              Most of this is common knowledge.
             </p>
             <p>
              What do you want to know.  Perhps the one people may not is Cohen's Russian mob ties.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cohen's uncle owned and later gave a piece to Micahel Cohen, a club called the El Caribe Country Clug.  Evsei Agron who was the first Russian mafia boss in Brooklyn operated from that club.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cohen got into the taxi business and was introduced to Trump by his father in law, a Russian from Ukraine convicted of money-laundering.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cohen knew Russian emigre Felix Sater from Brighton Beach Brooklyn before both started working with Trump.  Sater is a convicted felon who was involved in a $40 million dollar pump and dump scam involving both the Russian and Italian mob.  I know a guy who was arrested as part of that case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cohen and Sater worked on a deal to lift sanctions against Russia over Ukraine on terms very favorable to Russia.  They would put able to "lease" Crimea for like 80 years.  They were trying to get Michael Flynn to introduce this deal.  Cohen and Sater were also working on a deal to build Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 campaign  A deal that included Kremlin friendly financing.
             </p>
             <p>
              My favorite fact on Cohen was his name kept coming up on the BORIS case.  BORIS was the Big Organized Russian Insurance Scam that involved fake accident and fake insurance claims.
Somehow many of these fake victims used Cohen as their lawyer
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Starting around 2000, Cohen was involved in scores of car insurance lawsuits, often on behalf of plaintiffs who claimed to have been injured in auto collisions and were seeking judgments to cover purported medical expenses.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this time, a wave of staged auto accidents, involving immigrants from the former Soviet Union who claimed to have been hurt, had led prosecutors to open a massive investigation. They dubbed it Operation Boris, an acronym for Big Organized Russian Insurance Scam. The prosecutorial push resulted in hundreds of convictions.
              </p>

             Can definitely confirm JW's are a shady ass organization with cult like tendencies. I grew up as one and have had 2 family members molested by people in the congregation when they were very young. They have a 2 witnesses rule they derive from a scripture in the bible. So their official stance on sexual abuse is that if it's just the abused reporting it they say that it's up to god to judge them and look no further into the issue. To make matters worse they will shame children for reporting and will tell wives they need to fuck their husbands more often if they rape their children. Absolutely disgusting organization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: they also keep a database of reports of abuse and
             <strong>
              will not
             </strong>
             allow anyone but the governing body of the organization see it.

              Before I made the choice to get baptized, I thouroughly investigated everything that I could find about this. I found that most of the statements you just made are unsubstantiated.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not doubting your experiences happened. I do dispute your assertion that the organization has a policy from the top cover up or to stamp out abuse claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have found that claims of abuse with JWs are equal to or less than one finds in the general population.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have documented that there has been an organization wide policy to report suspicions of any crimes; in the congregation or not, regardless of how many witnesses, directly to the police, going back more than 30 years. Child abuse is specifically mentioned. Don’t believe me? Use the online library. Check the awakes andwatchtower magazines thoroughly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many victims (including myself) have been through other religions. I can promise you, on the whole, this one is doing it’s best to protect kids and keep up with understandings of child abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are they perfect? No. Sadly, a whole congregation can be “infected” (my term) with sick behavior. In my investigation, these congregations give the impression that it’s organization wide; sometimes even in the bethels and branch offices.
             </p>
             <p>
              When it’s exposed, we believers at the bottom want transparency, justice and truth. Please don’t call us sick.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are humans doing our best against an insidious enemy just like you.

             There was something else he potentially could have been covering up and that is NXIVM. I might add this to the main OP because both are important. It seems Schneiderman started in inquiry into NXIVM's brain activity experiments in April? This is after how many years of smoke signals that something was horribly amiss? The story about NXIVM being a cult started en mass in 2007. Anyway, Guyliner started an inquiry in March!

              Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office had filed a court case in early March asking a judge to order Bronfman and Porter to turn over their records related to brain-activity and other human behavioral studies, which had been conducted without any apparent oversight. The attorney general's decision to suspend the probe followed the March 25 arrest of NXIVM founder Keith Raniere on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor.
             </p>
             <p>
              The state investigation focused on the nonprofit Ethical Science Foundation that was formed in 2007 by Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Co. business empire who has described herself as the operations director of NXIVM. Bronfman is listed in public records as the trustee and donor of the Ethical Science Foundation.

             So he was FORCED to suspend an ''investigation'' that would have allowed him to possess/collect/gather ALL RECORDS of what went on concerning these experiments. The feds timed it just right because there's no doubt in my mind all that would have been suppressed, put down the rabbit hole, and the PR statement issued: That after a thorough, exhaustive investigation, we found nothing that rises to the level of criminality.
