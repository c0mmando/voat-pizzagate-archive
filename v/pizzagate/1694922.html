            Obviously we do not always know the truth, even when it appears to be backed up by evidence. It seems to me, from reading everything I can find on this, that there must be some sort of an ultimate plan involved. What I consider to be clues to the bigger picture here:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) We know that Sessions is passionate about putting an end to our epidemic of human traffikking.
2) There appears to be evidence coming out that supports marijuana interferes with mind control.
3) Traffikking and mind control are often very connected.
4) There are some pretty sick pot traffikking criminals out there.
5) A large demographic of Trump's supporters are supportive of marijuana despite his apparent objection to it.
6) The states with legalized marijuana are raking in tax dollars by the millions.
7) Trump is all about the economy.
8) Those who do NOT want Sessions attacking human traffikking DO want an end to legalized marijuana.
           </p>
           <p>
            My question keeps coming back to 'how does a stance against marijuana support President Trump's ultimate goals? Somehow, I feel it connects to his desire to end traffikking. So how does this all fit together?

            I read somewhere that Gen. Flynn's replacement as Natl. Security Adviser is a globalist deep-state guy. Any truth to this? I hope not - as it would mean that they've won and now have one of theirs on the inside (Maybe I'm naive, but I'm not convinced that Priebus isn't loyal).

             More than once I have felt President Trump tends to practice 'keep your enemies even closer'. We could be seeing some of this.

            I'm curious, because I've heard countless times by everyone around me and most news outlets that Sessions, is adamantly against Marijuana and a hardcore racist. I'm not sure how much truth is in this. As for the MEDIA's recent vilifying of Sessions, I have to ask, why?? It seems like all news outlets including the very local news and print papers are vilifying sessions. Did he sought to expose pedophiles in government, why is Stephen Colbert and almost all comedians pushing this, albeit confusing narrative. I'm not sure what they have on sessions, I'm not really sure what kind of guy Sessions truly is. My family gets their new from John Oliver, MSNBC and Stephen Colbert so they're not too fond of him. Just not sure who's lying here. I'm not a Trump supporter, I've looked into who he appointed. Rothschild's, Goldmen Sachs, etc. He's nothing but a puppet in my view and as for the left-right media paradigm, could it be a circle jerk to divide and conquer?

             The racist thing is blown way out of proportion as far as I could tell. Apparently Sessions said something pretty tame back in the 70's, though I forget what it was. And the weed thing I've heard quotes from him like "Good people don't smoke marijuana" which is concerning. Sessions and Trump could be legendary but I hope they don't go regressing on shit like weed laws. Re-criminalizing it is a retarded idea all round.

            Although I do believe the outline I posted of what happened with Flynn, I have got to say I agree with you 100% on all of the rest. No one wants to believe it because it is too sick. I've seen the facts. Life is more sick and twisted than we ever saw in our worst nightmares.

            Totally disagree - Sessions won't be deterred by the Russia thing...
           </p>
           <p>
            The DNC blew their wad on Mike Flynn, thinking they'd set a Russian snowball in motion. Unfortunately for the ham-handed Democrats and globalist page boys like John McCain and Marco Rubio, Mike Flynn's departure completely backfired - as it framed the Russia narrative in practical terms. The entire country flushed out the controversy amidst a flurry of MSM propaganda, settling on a consensus view held by anyone with an IQ above double digits;
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              <em>
               Of course
              </em>
              Flynn was going to talk to Russia, he was about to become the National Security Advisor to the United States - and Obama had been aggressively goose-stepping the country towards certain war in Syria over that stupid Saudi-backed pipeline.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <em>
               Of course
              </em>
              Trump was going to seek to mend relations with another nuclear superpower.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <em>
               Of course
              </em>
              Flynn lying to Mike Pence was a fireable offense.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Flynn was canned for lying to Pence, not talking to Russia.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In a
            <strong>
             monumental strategic error
            </strong>
            , the Democrats intertwined their Russian election influence thesis with debunked claims of Mike Flynn malfeasance and ended up killing both narratives - as evidenced by the lack of a special prosecutor, or anyone giving a shit outside of liberal echo chambers.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Moving onto Jeff Sessions
            </strong>
            and the attempted Pelosi-Franken-Schumer takedown; a few chinks immediately appeared in their cardboard armor. For one, Sessions was a god damn US Senator on the Armed Services Committee, so it's absolutely reasonable that he would meet with the Russian ambassador to conduct business on behalf of the United States. Also, thanks to democrats insisting Sessions recuse himself over any post-election Clinton-related investigations, the general concept of recusal being no big deal was baked into the national psyche, and an ADHD addled America - at least the part that matters, couldn't care less.
           </p>
           <p>
            Russophobia is now a joke, and the Watergate 2.0 scandal erupting as we speak is yet another nail in the coffin of Democrat credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sessions is full steam ahead.

            Obama it seems had wiretapped Trump months ago. If there had been anything, it would have been leaked. Now Obama and the CIA are in trouble.

            Haven't seen this until just now and couldn't find it on Voat. This seems to be an excellent rundown of the facts on what is happening to Jeff Sessions and why.

             And above and beyond all the Sessions stuff is Donald Trump doing nothing but shooting out accusations, which is fine. In the meantime his staff is almost all CFR. He has to fire someone. They have to make a large scale arrest. OR, it's up to the Proles to continue to shame government, MSM, and Hollywood. It may take 1776.

             It seems to me that this explanation fact checks far more accurately for the explanation as to what happened with Flynn. It was planned and it succeeded.

              Excellent link. Thanks! It's all about the 5-D chess that's been ongoing. I lol'd when MSM was reporting Flynn had been tapped and was doing something nefarious. Ya ok! The career military and intelligence guy slipped up THAT badly. What's SAD is that so many, including IC lapped this up like puppies to milk.
