          </p>
          <p>
           During 2005, trustees of the Clinton Foundation caused a raft of filings to be submitted to federal and state authorities inside the United States and to authorities in numerous foreign countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           This Exhibit explains key defects in selected filings relating to 2004, that remain uncorrected, and should be amended.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Exhibit 20: Arrangement of “Sham” Merger of Old CHAI into the Clinton Foundation Effective 31 December 2005
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Starting in 2005, trustees of the Clinton Foundation attempted, illegally, to structure a merger with Old CHAI that they falsely claimed became effective on 31 December 2005.
          </p>
          <p>
           This Exhibit examines the background and traces the known timeline for this sham transaction inside and outside the United States, using documents that purposefully have been omitted from Clinton Foundation filings.

            Edit: 3 hours, no response yet.  Flairing as "accuracy in question" for now.  The only reason I am not deleting this right away is the number of upvotes.  This post violates rule 3, as nothing here is sourced.

            Well we made it through elections, electoral college, we still need to get through congress to ratify it, and then inauguration. AND THEN we still have to keep an eye things. But at least once Jan 20th passes with out difficulty, we will be in the clear as far as some things go. But they will be doing whatever they can to fuck with us. Its the smooth talking lawyer types we have to watch out for, like Obama, so many can't seem to hear what he says. I think the dumbing down through our sickingly corrupt education system has worked all too effectively.

            We may even have to initiate a 25 year dictatorship if we can find somebody trustworthy enough to do the job. We are going to have to get past this "dumb ass" generation somehow.

            Is anyone working on Exhibit 3? CHAI / Ira Magaziner AIDS drug price fixing?  there is this recent article for comparison. The relevant email (I still need to find it) suggested that the AIDS meds were distributed cheap internationally by CHAI in exchange for inflated prices to the US market. So this also explains Hillary's position on Obamacase vs. singlepayer or universal medicare.

            You know this kind of thing has been going on for decades if not longer.  I'm sure all the charities set up by Rockefellers, et al have been either fronts for money laundering or more nefarious enterprises.  The Clintons have learned at the knee of Kissinger and Soros and Pappy Bush how to play this game.  The people who supported Bill Clinton back in the day were liberals/democrats who were disgusted by the Bush crime family, and they believed that he was going to sweep in and do away with all that corruption, and make the world a better place for minorities/women, etc.  They would not consider it possible that he was working with Bush behind the scenes.  Keep that in mind while you have any expectation that Trump is one of the "good guys".  The only difference is now we have access to more information, but the people have yet to let go of their left/right bias and still believe they are in opposition to each other, that one is actually preferable to the other.  When people rise up against the system itself, then we have a chance for substantial change.

             A lot longer, this has gone on for centuries! The last "good guy" was Hitler, look how the propaganda machine did Germany and the Nazi's. To this day, the vast majority still believe the lies over the truth. They still teach the lies in school even though the truth was revealed. The Bolshevik infiltration was deeply rooted in western society back then already and it still is today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who ever were the creators of Bolshevism are the same ones who created what we see today, and the likely the same ones who created Islam 1400 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some peoples research into pizzagate has revealed to some , the connections going all the back to ancient Greece. Cult connections. A empire hiding among us, manipulating our world, and keeping people divided so nobody can ever see the truth. Divide by race, culture, religion, gender, ideology or whatever they can think of.
            </p>
            <p>
             They have been grooming the children in schools and priming them for a pedophile culture and slavery. The last decade or so, this has been going full force, teaching kids about sex in grade 1, to the 5 pillars of Islam in grade 5.
            </p>
            <p>
             I almost forgot, there was another person since Hitler who was a true opposition to whats going on. President Kennedy. They took of care of him quickly as to avoid another uprising like Hitler.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way Trump gave his speech at that diner, I started having more faith in him. To stand there in the midst of all those snakes and start saying the things he was saying and not so gracefully, I have to remember that to remind me it is the dead giveaway that he is indeed the good guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides, in all my years, I have never seen a time that Trump wasn't a good humanitarian.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has never been a fame seeker for the good things he has done for those less fortunate, he simply isn't into rubbing their noses in how he helped them. He doesn't boast about those things.
 He doesn't even boast much about his business empire, he is so worried about being a good man he sometimes sound narcissistic but he isn't, he just isn't great with words when speaking to the public. Which is fine, he does great when he stays on the point and nobody is working hard to push his buttons, and considering how much the demoncrats and repulsickins have tried to push his buttons, I would say he did a great job!

             Both sides have the wolf in sheep's clothing thing going on. You are correct. The only difference between the two groups is social issues which are fabricated to keep the voting blocks in order. They are the perfection of evil.

             I think you are right. Trump ain't going to do shit. He might do away with no term limits, and call that his fight on corruption, or sign some other bullshit, but I really doubt he is going to go to war with these guys. Main reason being, is because this encompasses all of Washington. He hasn't mentioned anything about human trafficking, or rampant pedophilia in government. If he plans to, he is keeping a tight lid on it.
