Germany: 3700)</p>
<p>Apparently this industry <a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/02/the-corrupt-business-of-child-protective-services/">boomed</a> after Bill Clinton signed The Adoption and Safe Family Act. And because international adoptions have declined world wide, the industry requires a steady supply of US children.</p>
<p>I\'\'ve been reading <a href="http://archive.is/B17hf">story after story</a> about court room battles with adoptive parents pitted against natural parents, coercive counseling, dubious attorneys and adoption agencies, corrupt judges and babies a few days old <a href="https://www.babble.com/parenting/kimberly-rossler-unethical-adoption-one-year-later/">literally</a> taken away from their mother\'s breast by sheriffs.</p>
<p>There\'s even an award for worst companies in this industry, They\'ve named them <a href="http://poundpuplegacy.org/demons_of_adoption_awards">Demons of Adoption</a>, because Congress has a yearly award called Angels of Adoption. Ironically the Angels winners are <a href="http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/7291">excellent resources</a> for investigation not least because many if not most of the \'Angels of Adoption\' Congressional Award winners go on to win the Demons of Adoption Award only a few years later.</p>
<p>Now I would not want to accuse every adoptive parent of dubious motives for wanting to buy these children. But <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/adoption_subsidy2014.pdf">roughly half</a> of them have subsidized <s>disabilities</s> special needs. And why should the demand for domestic children be a factor 10 larger than other countries?</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/dwoJ1">Reading this</a> (empathetic, but still casually obtuse about even wanting someone else\'s baby) adoptive parent\'s story, I was surprised to hear the waiting time is usually less than three months, and adoptive parents are matched according to profiles to \'birthmothers\' - a term that appears to be a reverse euphemism for natural parent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those seeking to adopt may choose the race they\'re prepared to parent, and the amount of drug and alcohol use they find acceptable during the pregnancy. They may decide what level of mental illness they are comfortable with in the birth mother\'s history. And they may decide as well if they are prepared for—or desire—a child with special needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it\'s a dating service connecting adoptive parents with mothers/babies. The former throw a lot of money at their baby wish, adoption agencies hire coercive counselors, dubious attorneys and if need be corrupt judges all to satisfy their customer\'s wish for someone else\'s baby.</p>
<p>And this US industry, unique in the developed world and rather <a href="http://archive.is/syRLI">disturbing</a> in its implications, demands a steady supply of US children (&gt;110.000 a year) and that requires \'breeding grounds\' of sustained poverty, drug abuse, disabilities and child medicalization, strict abortion laws, expensive contraception and sexualization of early teens.</p>',

            Well explained. This topic should be common and in your face until something is done.
Observations:
1) Not sure what the question is as asked in the headline. It is answered in the first paragraph. 2) Why do I keep seeing the ASFA as 'what Bill Clinton signed' when it is Hillary Clinton who defines this as her proudest accomplishment? She may not have signed but she certainly made sure this evil document served her purposes. She's a sick &amp;%*@#!

            Adopting from foster care costs virtually nothing because the minimal fees are normally reimbursed to the adopters.  It's very lucrative for the states to remove children unjustly from their homes because they are the "commodities" needed to acquire federal funding for the children.  The funds are a subsidy where both the state and the Fed funds cover the cost of foster care.  The subsidies range from 50%-80% of the expenses incurred.  ie family services are only 50% reimbursement whereas placing a child in a group home would return 80%.   States have caught on to this and have hired companies such as Maximus which is a consulting firm to get "more bang for their buck".  So many states are now eliminating the services that gave them a smaller reimbursement and putting more efforts into where they get a higher return.  AZ is one such state.  Also Lockheed Martin is now getting into the same business as Maximus offering states the same consulting services.
           </p>
           <p>
            The funding from the FED is mainly from the FED IV-E funding (your social security)  and the avg. per child is 85k per yr to cover all costs which includes judges, court appointed attorneys, social workers, case workers, visitation transporters, therapists,  foster family, etc. etc etc. 
And that's just the beginning, the states also get bonuses for each and every child they adopt to the tune of 5k-10k per child (depending on their age) IF and only IF the state adopts exceeds the total adoptions from the  previous year.
           </p>
           <p>
            It helps keep citizens in the state gainfully employed but the kicker is they need children to keep their circus going.  This is why so many children are wrongfully removed from their homes.  And  they target lower income families who don't have the means to hire an atty that can cost from 30k-150k.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are plenty of FB groups filled with parents who've lost their kids unjustly and it comes as no surprise that they are prime targets for pedos to foster and or adopt and get paid for it.  Adopters are given a maintenance subsidy check monthly until that child is 18.

            This goes hand-in-hand with agencies like CPS: There are CPS whistleblowers on youtube. Listen to them. Carlos Morales is one. But there are others who describe, yes, the state can just  take your kids away and adopt them out. Its a money-making business where the courts are fake, the legal representation (if provided by the public defender) is fake, you are never charged with a crime because that would mean going to court with a jury of your peers instead of crooked closed fake-courts, children are sometimes "LOST" (go physically missing) in the system but still get counted so they can get PAID, a molested child is often purposely left with molesters because these kids can be "un-adoptable or hard to place", children may already come into the system special needs but we know how kids get diagnosed for everything under the sun &amp; are given cocktails of meds once in the system so as a result they then are considered "special needs",  and so much more which is just sick to listen to. These vids are often long and take time to listen to, but its worth it to learn about how sick it is. Parents need to be protesting in the streets over this shit, not fuvking fake feminism with pussy hats!

            It isn't a difficult question to answer, there are huge financial incentives for states to aggressively confiscate kids and huge incentives for people to adopt, put in place by Clinton:

            Okay, there is another piece of the puzzle. There is huge income disparity in the states. I imagine that there are more adoptions in the lower income brackets and because of the disparity there are more people in the states in relative poverty. If they are being paid (with living support and rent etc) this may be a way to help support themselves.

            My son was adopted as an infant, through a private attorney, not an agency.  Two years prior to that we were matched with a local birth mother.  We spent a ton of $, maternity clothes, lamaz classes, paid her rent, etc.  72 hours after she gave birth she changed her mind and it was a done deal.  Some families cannot have children and not all agencies are horrible.  The agency we went through supported the birth mother 100%.  We were devastated of course but learned soon after that about 35% of birth mother's change their mind at the last minute.

               Christian Girl Lover was talking about adoptions as a possible means of getting children.  I talked to him extensively he is a sick Mofo teaching english in Thailand and abusing children.  He is a CP producer and distributer.  He needs to be taken down A.S.A.P he is very impulsive and dangerous.  Click on the "channel" icon and his friends are even posting CP as their avatars on youtube!!!  He is suspected of having something to do with Young's Talent Agency fake (not to be confused with the real agency in Arizona).

               What we noticed was that for LGBT parents the process was very complicated; for that reason we started asking a lot of questions of the agencies. We found out that there were not that many LGBT adoptive parents in Arizona despite the fact that there are over 17,000 children without homes in our state.  It seems there is a big population of LGBT people here who choose not to adopt, don’t know how to adopt, or don’t even realize it is possible. In addition, there are other steps that need to be accomplished to get legal recognition, creating unnecessary barriers.
We went to four agencies before we found one that would allow us to adopt. Arizona has a law that permits adoption agencies the right to refuse based on politics, religion, or just private reasons. Finally, we found one that would: Arizona Children’s Association

               If you approach him on Youtube and talk to him he will try to recruit you.  You can verify everything I said.  Do it at your own risk because he is more then willing to send you illegal stuff.  As for the Museum stuff.  No I wont post evidence I don't want to end up dead sorry.

            A rhetorical question but I'll answer anyway just to concur with you. As you point out in your opening paragraph, the reason is because they monetized it just like everything else, and it became an area of business. Pretty sick really.

            Exposing the Dark Side of Adoption
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Inspired by stories shared by birth parents, adoptive parents, and adult adoptees, PPL explores the dark side of adoption, and the consequences illegal and unethical actions have on future family-life and the well-being of those affected by adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
             Too many children are placed for the benefit of agencies and based on the demands of prospective adoptive parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             Too many children are placed in inappropriate homes because the business interests of adoption agencies have higher priority than the safety of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             PPL documents and archives cases where the child placement system did not work in the best interest of the child and we offer a platform for those who want to express their thoughts and feelings about the dark side of child adoption.

             Three adopted children were removed from the Jim and Paige Nachtigal home in North Newton— a 14 year old girl, an 11 year old boy and an 11 year old girl. The oldest child was adopted about four years ago, with the 11 year old children adopted three years ago. They are not biological siblings, according to investigators.

             Reaction after three children adopted from Peru have been removed from their North Newton Home and their adoptive parents arrested has ranged from rage to disbelief.
            </p>
            <p>
             The parents, Jim and Paige Nachtigal, were active in business and ministry in the Newton community. Jim Nachtigal serves as the CEO of Kansas Christian Home. Paige Nachtigal is a former employee of the Newton Area Chamber of Commerce. Both were actively fund-raising to go to Peru as missionaries.

             That reputation, and the felony charges that appeared Tuesday, led to a prayer walk around the Harvey County Courthouse and Law Enforcement Center Wednesday morning — about 30 minutes prior to a press briefing inside by the Harvey County Sheriff's office.

             I had an employee (a wonderful, honest, caring woman) who adopted a child from another country with cerebral palsy. There are some people out there willing to share their energy in the caretaker role. It's important that we separate the wheat from the chaff and not judge according to our superficial biases (which are surely inflamed by some of the ugly and real stories we see as we investigate).
