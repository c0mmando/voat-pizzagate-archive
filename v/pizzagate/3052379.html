            I keep seeing the ads for those apps in my Twitter feed. Hard to believe people fall for this crap. But as my 80 year old aunt said about it: "It's not like we're going to lose much if fools empty their minds."

            Here is the except from the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            When will the West wake up and realize that this Cult of Tantric Lamaism is far more dangerous than any other cult in our midst? When will we start calling these faux-religions, “Cults” and treat them accordingly?  Before it is too late and their sickness keeps spreading to destroy our western nations by stealth?   These Tibetan Lamas and their thousands of western helpmates are determined to destroy the separation of Church and State in our Constitution. No one notices, still.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Shambhala cult is also praying that no one discovers that most all the popular apps on Mindfulness  such as calm.org, ,advertised on major cable news stations, including Fox News, seen by more Americans than any other cable T.V..  and on Facebook, and every other social media platform,  are  mostly created by Shambhala and /or  Tibetan Lamaist cult members.  Many, who are listed as the mindfulness instructors on apps like these, are the more ‘advanced’ mindfulness teachers, i.e. those most soaked in their guru-worshipping cults, whose mindfulness meditation form put them in the same mindfulness trance as these Kasung  who accepted this terrible abuse for so long, programmed to ignore western laws, ethics, and values.  The Sakyong wanted ten million members by 2010.   He may reach his goal through his students’ mindfulness apps by 2020.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a massive movement being promoted on iPhones and Androids,  and courses online, advertised and hosted on social media platforms and other mass media venues to push a “Secular Spirituality’ Buddhocracy by stealth that is slowly undermining the reasoning abilities of increasingly more westerners  and the separation of Church and State in our Constitutional Democracy. It will make more people passive and dumbed-down, self-obsessed and  believing they are becoming more awake as they lose more of their individuality. The people they really hook?  Are those who will commit to more mindfulness practices in the mindfulness instructors’ group retreats, later on.
