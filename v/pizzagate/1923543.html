            Soros and the Clintons have basically taken over the Democratic Party over the last 25 years at the peril of the US people and ultimately the Democratic Party.

            Who's Pushing ?    Who's Pushing?
           </p>
           <p>
            The former head of the FBI just testified under oath about the POTUS asking him to let an investigation go.  He turned over his notes to the special prosecutor and said the special prosecutor will look into if that was part of a felony.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who's is pushing this?  The top levels of law enforcement in the United States and the coequal branch of government in the the Senate Intel Committee, and all of our executive branch Intel Agencies have agreed on Russian interference.
           </p>
           <p>
            POTUS  has now hired outside counsel because he realizes he needs a criminal defense.  He also accused the Former head of the FBI of perjury.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not going away and there will be calls for POTUS to be put under oath to answer these charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI director confirmed that Flynn has been in legal jeorpardy.  He confirmed that Pence knew about Flynn all along. He further declined the chance to say POTUS did not collude with Russia.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Do you believe Donald Trump colluded with Russia?” - Sen. Tom Cotton
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “That’s a question I don’t think I should answer in an open setting.  When I left, we did not have an investigation focused on President Trump. But that’s a question that will be answered by the investigation, I think.”
           </p>
           <p>
            So the correct answer is the evidence is pushing this.

             The problem with your story is there is NO evidence. That is the Deep State's problem.  If there was evidence it would have leaked when Obama's admin. was doing all the unmasking, but they couldn't find any unless you want to consider the fake pee pee dossier with that loser Steele.  Zero, zilch, nada. The three-letter turds are all filled with pedos, blackmailed, corrupt individuals.  Comey is as dirty as they come.  Bought and paid for like Mueller running his Uranium deal for HRC to the Russians. Of course, let's be fair. We have McCain with his Rayethon kick backs, Lindsey Graham with his issues, as well as Ryan from Racine!!
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing that never was leaked was that Trump wasn't under investigation. The senate Foreign Policy and Intel are totally corrupt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump will drain this cesspool and we will take our country back.

              Funny.   I remember this story.
Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia
              <a href="https://nyti.ms/2dWIfBL">
               https://nyti.ms/2dWIfBL
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Also Richard Nixon did not burglarize the Democratic HQ himself.  He did however obstruct justice during the investigation of it.  The investigation is ongoing.  We shall see where it heads.  But Trump himself said he fired Comey for political reasons.  He didn't like the Russia investigation.  Now we have under oath testimony, i.e., evidence, that Trump leaned on Comey.   Evidence that is backed up contemporaneous memos and witnesses to those memos.  In cases of phone calls, witnesses to Comey's side of the call.   Courts have given great weight to this type of evidence.

             <p>
              The president has been in office 5 months.   There's a special prosecutor looking at him.   This is a record.  The National Security Advisor didn't last a month in office.  Quickest a high level official has been tossed from office.   NSA gone.  VP, AG and President all have legal worries.  Nixon was in office for years before Watergate hit.   President admitted he  fired the head of the FBI because of the investigation into Russian interference.
             </p>
             <p>
              The special prosecutor has the authority to Look into related crimes like money laundering.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you think this good news for the president, you're kidding yourself.  The WH response was to bring out Trump's personal criminal defense lawyer to falsely accuse Comey of a crime.

               It's funny, I guess it depends on where you get your "news." Zero Hedge is a great site.

               You know you remind me of my two nutty in-laws who are democrat lobbyists. They've got so much invested that they're kinda blind. They hate Trump w/ a passion.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ah, but you're smarter than that and I'm counting on you! At least maybe you'll admit this Russia stuff is woven out of whole cloth. Are you a lobbyist?
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: Just btw, you do know the Nixon thing was a coup by Bush right? You should read Russ Baker's book. Do you know I once had a chatty-do w/ Laura Bush? She was sweet.
              </p>
              <p>
               AND FURTHERMORE! Trump fired Comey on a sudden and while gone so ding dong Comey couldn't retrieve anything from his office, it became property of DOJ. Now Trump is continuing to say he will release some tapes "shortly."

                Trump also said he would release his taxes.  Trump also said there would be clear divisions between Trump Inc and the White House.  Trump said he would have a plan to defeat ISIS.   Trump says a lot of things.  Why would you believe him?  Comey called his bluff and welcomed the tapes.  You still think we are going to see them?

                You will admit at the very least the Trump administration/campaign had an unusually high number of Russian connections/meetings, yes?  And did not reveal these?
Flynn who was fired for this.
And Sessions did not reveal his meetings.
Kushner met with  Russian bank and then lied about this on his security clearance.
Have looked into Felix Sater?  The convicted gangster who worked for Trump Organization? Until it became public.  Then helped finance Trump Soho and this year was able to get a plan to lift sanctions to the United States National Security Advisor through Trump's lawyer?
Trump's lawyer's​ Soviet born business partner was just indicted for fraud.

                 "Russia thing" I just mean that they allegedly interfered w/ the election. That narrative isn't working out too well for the dems. Nothing to it. Jury is still out on Flynn, who knows, but not a big deal to me. You probably still believe there was a real "deep throat" too. That was all nonsense, as were idiots Woodward and Bernstein.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Speaking of, why don't you check out this documentary (the book is better) and see what connections Ben Bradlee of the "great" WaPo, who was brother-in-law to Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was married to CIA Cord Meyer, had to the CIA. CIA murdered the woman cause of her affair w/ JFK and the knowledge she had. Ben Bradlee saw Angleton of CIA snooping for her diary on two different occasions and let it slide.

            I have never witnessed a white wash of this magnitude! It's utter desperation. They even went as far as labelibg Sean Hannity a consoiracy theorist for pursuing Seth Rich story. Ben Swann's social media vanished. Alex Jones apologized the Freak of The World and now Hosts Megyn Sociopath Kelly (Pedo protector) on his show. I had no idea public was that brainwashed. Voat should be overloaded with traffic!  When will the public wake up and smell the coffee??!!!

             Most don't know that we did 9/11 along with Mossad. They think the news wouldn't just make things up. It's the news! Most don't know anything and won't ever know anything.

              And you remember the headlines during the campaign about Trump supposedly mocking a disabled reporter - who had supppsedly retracted his statement about bunch of Arabs celebrating 9-11while filming it from New Jersey? Why would he retract that from WP? Because these 'Arabs' (Mossad agents posing as Arabs) have come to be known as the infamous Dancing Israelis! They were arrested, interogated before being smuggled out of US. They appeared on Israeli TV and said that they were 'students' who had set up a camera in order to DOCUMENT THE EVENT!!! Dressed up as Arabs! Fully sourced, irrefutable story with Police deposition!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              That was the reson that desabled reporter did not want Trump to go near that! It was white washed.

            Brock detailed American Bridge’s plans to communicate its findings to Congress — where Democratic lawmakers can use Bridge’s findings to ensure proper oversight is conducted on Trump — as well as to “the news media, progressive allies, and to the public directly, including a targeted campaign to reach Trump’s own supporters, via social media and paid advertising.

            Trump’s administration.
The Washington Post reported, “The DNC’s new communications and research operation, to be staffed by former aides to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, will be one of several efforts from across the Democratic firmament to take on Trump, including the office of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Center for American Progress, and American Bridge.” Clinton campaign manager John Podesta founded the Center for American Progress, and Clinton surrogate and former aide Neera Tanden serves as its president. American Bridge, a super PAC, is run by controversial Clinton propagandist David Brock.
