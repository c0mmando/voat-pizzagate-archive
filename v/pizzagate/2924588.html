<p>&quot;Has anyone else noticed this odd coincidence? Slave Lords quest line and Pizzagate conspiracy are using the &quot;BLogo&quot; as unclassified by the FBI. This has only recently been given public exposure. Slave Lords quest line is themed on releasing slaves from captivity and eliminating their captors. The quest entrances all have the triangle spiral &quot;BLogo&quot;. The symbol (in RL) is used to direct child abusers / human traffickers where they needed to go for what they are looking for. I don\'t like seeing in used DDO. I\'m not trying to stir up issues with out purpose. Awareness of this issue has lead to very recent arrests. 474 arrested, 28 children saved&gt;&gt; <a href="http://fox40.com/2017/02/05/sheriff-...ldren-rescued/">http://fox40.com/2017/02/05/sheriff-...ldren-rescued/</a>&quot;</p>

            They all come from Pharaoh. Templars created new world order. Old world order was the red house of Pharaoh. New world order is White house. Blue is for war. And that is how they  enact  the most swift and decisive change. War.  Borders and rules change after war. And they are behind all wars. D&amp;D has always been satanic. They had an aritst by the name of  David Trampier who had a cryptic dispute with the company, then went awol, never returned or cahsed the checks owed him. Friend of his that was tracjed down was quoted as saying David thought TSR was an evil company.

            Actually, there are more symbols than that in the game, there is also the cicular symbol on a tree stump as if it is the trees natural circles. No reason att all for them to put it there, any more than Disney pointing all the stuff in the childrens cartoons they do. They are Masons, who are Occultist.

            I recently quit playing D&amp;D online. Loved the game. IMO, CIA ops are trolling as players in there. If this sounds a bit, ah c'mon, do some research on the subject. I noticed the symbolism, tons of players with character names that were not so much fantasy but occultish, and people that intentionaly try to aggravate you. For no apparent reason. I set a trap. In my characters bio, I put things that suggested I knew about agendas, and quotes from those in power that only those in the know would undserstand the implications of. I  almost instantly got people going out of there way to pick my brain and attempt to argue and gas light me. I knew it. One had the character name Biggbossbane. He tried to start fights about 5G, LED lighting, and referenced NASA in an attempt to see if I discredited them. I moved for check mate and asked him if he was aware that DDO had paid players. He quickly aborted mission and eneded the convo. D&amp;D online has one quest  after another featuring, occultist organizing undergroung, summoning demons from portals, demon godess and their minions, devil invasions, A town that is urged by vampiric pupette masters to bring children to annual fesitvals etc. Spends more time on occultis themese than fantasy. This becomes apparent quickly.  Many players with names like Illuminato, SET, Demonchild, Demonthis and Demon that. You would think the game was Demons and Dungeons. And yes, I saw that thread and the way the shills pounced on the poster using emotional personal attacks. Obvious sign. Just so you know, CIA admits to having ops in World of Warcrafr online with the excuse to practice fighting "terrorism". Research it yourself.

            Not to be too far off topic, but an earlier build of Fortnite had a shit ton of cabal imagery that would spawn around the island. One of the most common rock models used to be a triangle with an eye in the middle. blatantly obvious.

            There is a massive amount of symbolism and predictive programming in video games.

             I believe so. I have been keeping a list of several different games of of late that do so. As you said Persona and Dragonronpa Ultra Despair Girls drop alot of redpills. On my other post I also showed how the Deux Ex games have been as well.

             Many white hats in the industry. However some I do question. For example this horrific game that came out on Steam called for Lust for Darkness.Lust for Darkness is about occult/satanic sex magic, Eyes Wide Shut style depravity, rape and murder, pedophilia/necrophilia, and has a Freemason logo in game. I can't tell if white hats or black hats made this

             That's the MSM's narrative the NPC's swallowed. "Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring in a pizza place! Lol stupid internet conspiracy losers!" And that's as far as they looked into it.

            Its a pretty simple symbol. Its also being used as a BAD GUY symbol so that means if anything its likely the DDO guys where trying to clue people in on it. At least in my worthless opinion.

             Gaming industry white hats are more common than you think.

             Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls called out Hollywood pedo rings two years before pizzagate broke out (not to mention calling out pedo shit in the gaming industry). Also pointed out the link between sexual abuse and corruptive effects.

             Persona 5 is based as fuck for those who get its deeper truths. Lots of allegory though. The main villain = allegory for the Clintons and all their tactics. Akechi is an allegory for the CIA and their use of false flags.

              Not a chance. If you are being thrown hints, it is because they must always signal and represent. They know the normies know nothing. You are being mocked.
