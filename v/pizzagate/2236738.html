<p>Mali’s economy continued to be largely dependent on gold exports, which historically have accounted for the majority of the country’s total export earnings from mining. Same with Nigeria. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry_of_Nigeria">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry_of_Nigeria</a></p>
<p>Gold deposits are found in Northern Nigeria, most prominently near Maru, Anka, Malele, Tsohon Birnin &gt;Gwari-Kwaga, &gt;Gurmana, Bin Yauri, Okolom-Dogondaji, and Iperindo in Osun state it is not very &gt;dominant in the country.[1]</p>
<p>Gold production began in 1913 and peaked in the 1930s. During the Second World War, production &gt;declined. Mines were &gt;abandoned by colonial companies, and production never recovered.[1]</p>
<p>The Nigerian Mining Corporation (NMC) was formed in the early 1980s to explore for gold. Lack of &gt;funds, and the lure of easier profits from oil production led to its failure. There is no large scale gold mining operation in Nigeria today, though there is small-scale mining carried out by artists.[1] The family of Aleye from Anka is one of the leading gold families in the region.</p>

<p>In 2012, there were 6 gold mines in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso is the 3rd biggest site for gold exploration in Africa and 4th biggest gold producer in Africa. West African gold is not as high grade as gold from South Africa.[3]</p>
<p>Cluff updated its bankable feasibility study for the Kalsaka gold project, which is located about 150 km northwest of the country’s capital, Ouagadougou. Measured resources were estimated to be 6.5 million metric tons (Mt) at a grade of 1.6 grams per metric ton (g/t) gold, and indicated resources were estimated to be 2.7 Mt at a grade of 1.2 g/t gold.</p>

<p>&quot;I\'ve never heard of Rima so I decided to look into it. Turns out Rima is in Burkina Faso which is a landlocked nation in Western Africa. Rima is roughly in the center of the country from what I can gather. Burkina Faso looks to me like it could be a key destination as a crossroads for contraband and human trafficking for any destination in Europe or the Middle East. I really don\'t know very much about Africa but I do know the US Military Socom has had an enormous presence in Africa (I think it\'s called AFRICOM ) and of course Nigeria which does not border Burkina Faso but is not that far a way is also the home of Boko Haram which is basically ISIS with darker skin and in a jungle instead of desert. I also know that the domain of Boko Haram is the northern part of Nigeria and that typically these warlord child soldier armies aren\'t typically very confined by loosely regulated national borders.&quot;</p>

            Nigeria is also a major human trafficking hub. The Nigerian Mafia trafficks women (and probably children too) to Italy and other European countries. There's currently a power struggle between traditional Italian mafia organizations and the Nigerian Mafia (Black Axe) in Southern Italy. They have required a reputation for being extremely cruel (torturing people).
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus, Black Axe has set foot in Canada as well. There is a close affiliation with the group Black Movement, many they it's the same organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, please check the cult background of Black Axe and other Nigerian Mafia organizations. This is really dark. These cults operate at all Nigerian universities, recruiting new members.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wannebee initiates to Black Axe have to rape a woman before they can become a member.

            Not sure where this ties in but the Company Uranium One scandal has uranium mining rights in South Africa and a headquarters ther. This is connected to Guistra and Clinton Foundation. Stephen Paddock and Marilou Danley were managing the ratlines. Danley had passports for Australia and South Africa where two Uranium headquarters are located. Uranium is worth more than Gold.

             <p>
              "Giustra gold mining Burkina Faso":  Giustra and his partners including a Russian firm are ALL up in West Africa with gold mines including Two in Burkina Faso. Apparently That whole area is like one of the greatest low cost new gold mine opportunities in the world. Here's a quote:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Nordgold also has a reputation as an efficient and smart operator. The Russia-based miner built its newest mine, the 200,000-oz/yr Bissa gold mine in Burkina Faso, in just 15 months, Giustra points out. The company is also familiar with the geological neighbourhood because it operates three mines in the West African Birimian Shield — two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nordgold was founded in 2007 as a division of Russian steel giant Severstal and went public on the London Stock Exchange in January 2012. The company is among the world’s fastest-growing gold miners, a feat accomplished mostly through acquisitions.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “People have said to me ‘Watch out for the Russians,’ ” Giustra says, “but they’ve been great partners. We come to agreements on a handshake and they follow through.”

                Clearly Hillary and Bill agree.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              For a decade, Aoun’s party has been part of a political coalition with Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group backed by Iran that has seats in Lebanon’s parliament. Hezbollah is classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S., which holds the group responsible for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut and a Marine barracks blast that year that killed 241 American servicemen. Drug Enforcement Administration investigations have also found that Hezbollah is in league with Latin American cartels to launder hundreds of millions of dollars in drug profits.
             </p>
             <p>
              Chagoury was “known to have funded” Aoun, a Lebanese government minister told then-Ambassador Jeffrey D. Feltman in 2007, according to a cable published by WikiLeaks that didn’t go in detail about Chagoury’s relationship with Aoun. The minister suggested that the U.S. “deliver to Chagoury a strong message about the possibility of financial sanctions and travel bans against those who undermine Lebanon’s legitimate institutions.”
             </p>
             <blockquote>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Chagoury never got a scolding, though. Instead, Band, Bill Clinton’s aide, pushed for new access for Chagoury after Hillary Clinton took over at the State Department.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In 2009, Band wrote his friends in the department. “We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance guy re Lebanon. As you know he's key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp.” Huma Abedin, a longtime aide and confidante to Clinton and now vice chairwoman of her presidential campaign, suggested Feltman.

              ICMEC is a joke unto itself.  Who knows what other benefits this Chagoury was going to get when donating such an amount.  That is obscene, just like her.  Bring Back Our Girls is a another fake lie like the ones she tells to the Black People in our country as well.  Yes, she is a disgusting pile of flesh.

              CIA Covert Ops in Nigeria: Fertile Ground for US Sponsored Balkanization
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               A divided and warring Nigeria ultimately serves the interests of the United States as cited by Zbigniew Brzezinski, top adviser to Barack Obama and leading US foreign policy theoretician.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Brzezinski, who co-founded the Trilateral Commission and openly credits himself with the creation of the Afghan Mujahideen [24], has influenced policy that encourages the division of existing nation-states by the succession and emergence of microstates, based on all cultural, ethnic and religious peculiarities. Author and historian Dr. Webster G. Tarpley writes, “For Africa, Brzezinski recommends the so-called ‘micro-nationalities’ concept, which means that national boundaries established in the 19th century should be swept aside in favor of a crazy quilt of petty tribal entities, each one so small that it could not hope to resist even a medium-sized oil multinational” [25].

              The Nigerian Tribune has reported that Boko Haram receives funding from different groups from Saudi Arabia and the UK, specifically from the Al-Muntada Trust Fund, headquartered in the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia’s Islamic World Society [8]. During an interview conducted by Al-Jazeera with Abu Mousab Abdel Wadoud, the AQIM leader states that Algeria-based organizations have provided arms to Nigeria’s Boko Haram movement “to defend Muslims in Nigeria and stop the advance of a minority of Crusaders” [9].

             <p>
              It remains highly documented that members of Al-Qaeda (AQIM) and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who fought among the Libyan rebels directly received arms [10] and logistical support [11] from NATO bloc countries during the Libyan conflict in 2011.

              As the UN warns that weapons such as rocket-propelled grenades and explosives from Libya may reach Boko Haram [18], armed Tuareg fighters in northern Mali have been seen operating in army issue Toyota Hi-Lux technical trucks [19], armed with mortars, machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons originally belonging to the LIFG, al-Qaeda affiliated Libyan rebels [20]. UN reports also disclose that Boko Haram members from Nigeria and Chad had received training at Al-Qaeda camps in Mali in 2011 [21].

             <p>
              There are a handful of non-militant groups accused of shuttling money to Boko Haram, including Britain's Al-Muntada Trust Fund and Saudi Arabia's Islamic World Society. "Monetary practices embedded in Muslim culture, such as donating to charities and informal money-transfer centers, have compounded the difficulty in tracking down terrorist financial links," says David Doukhan at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The fact that the U.S. didn't formally designate Boko Haram a terrorist organization until last year has become the focus of a partisan attack against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was in office when the Obama administration was debating the move. Key to the accusation is the idea that adding the group to America's terrorist list would have made a difference, presumably by restricting funding to Boko Haram. We can't evaluate that charge without knowing where the Nigerian Islamists get their money.

                Wow.  Axelrod.  They use their friends and those that know all their secrets to keep all secret operations close to their vest.  Yes, the State Dept. traveling all over to make sure countries have secure democratic elections but can't promise the same at home.  Yes, it seems pretty obvious that they were holding off on purpose with the FTO.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              During the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, who seized power in Nigeria in 1993, (Lebanese born) Chagoury prospered, receiving development deals and oil franchises.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the 1990s, Chagoury portrayed himself as an Abacha insider as he tried to influence American policy to be more friendly to the regime. Soon after President Clinton named Donald E. McHenry a special envoy to Nigeria in 1995, Gilbert and brother Ronald Chagoury visited McHenry in his office at Georgetown University in Washington. The U.S. was pushing for the return of democratic rule in Nigeria; Abacha, meanwhile, was eager to have his country taken off a U.S. list of nations that enabled drug trafficking, McHenry said.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “Their effort was to try and influence anyone who they thought could influence the U.S. government,” McHenry said, adding that the approach was heavy-handed. “They tried every key on the piano.”
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Abacha turned out to be “one of the most notorious kleptocrats in memory,” stealing billions in public funds, acting Assistant Atty. Gen. Mythili Raman later said.
After Abacha’s death in 1998, the Nigerian government hired lawyers to track down the money. The trail led to bank accounts all over the world — some under Gilbert Chagoury's control.
             </p>
             <p>
              Chagoury, who denied knowing the funds were stolen, paid a fine of 1 million Swiss francs, then about $600,000, and gave back $65 million to Nigeria; a Swiss conviction was expunged, a spokesman for Chagoury said.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the years afterward, Chagoury’s wealth grew. His family conglomerate now controls a host of businesses, including construction companies, flour mills, manufacturing plants and real estate.
             </p>
             <p>
              He has used some of that money to build political connections. As a noncitizen, he is barred from giving to U.S. political campaigns, but in 1996, he gave $460,000 to a voter registration group steered by Bill Clinton’s allies and was rewarded with an invitation to a White House dinner. Over the years, Chagoury attended Clinton's 60th birthday fundraiser and helped arrange a visit to St. Lucia, where the former president was paid $100,000 for a speech. Clinton’s aide, Doug Band, even invited Chagoury to his wedding.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Chagoury also contributed $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to its list of donors. At a 2009 Clinton Global Initiative conference, where business and charity leaders pledge to complete projects, the Chagoury Group’s Eko Atlantic development — nine square kilometers of Lagos coastal land reclaimed by a seawall — was singled out for praise. During a 2013 dedication ceremony in Lagos, just after Hillary Clinton left her post as secretary of State, Bill Clinton lauded the $1-billion Eko Atlantic as an example to the world of how to fight climate change.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Chagoury also has given to Republicans: He and his brother, along with Eko Atlantic, are listed as sponsors for a 2014 art exhibit at the George W. Bush Presidential Center.
