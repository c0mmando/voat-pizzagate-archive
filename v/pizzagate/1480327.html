<p>Of course, as is often the case with things like Pizzagate, odd links keep coming up. Many will recall that former BBC Director-General, Mark Thomson resigned from the BBC in 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. Thomson had defended Savile and, in 2012, the Telegraph reported that Thomson had lied to the Savile inquiry. It was also claimed that “the BBC’s instinct is still to cover up potentially embarrassing information rather than facing up to the truth.”</p>
<p>As the Daily Mirror reveals, Thompson is now at the New York Times where he is being sued over allegations of age, race, and gender discrimination. Of course, none of this suggests that Thompson is a pedophile or that he is involved in Pizzagate in any way. However, as reported by the BBC itself, Dame Janet Smith’s report into the Savile pedophile and sexual abuse scandal makes it absolutely clear that the BBC had numerous opportunities to put an end to Savile’s activities.</p>
