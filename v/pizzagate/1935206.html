<p>UPDATE:  Port of Charleston Cleared After Potential Threat (CNN)</p>
<p>(CNN)  A South Carolina port terminal was briefly evacuated because of a &quot;potential threat&quot; in a container ship, then reopened early Thursday after authorities scanned it and cleared it.
Authorities got a warning Wednesday night of a threat in a container on a ship at the Port of Charleston, the Coast Guard said.</p>
<p>The ship, Maersk Memphis, was at the Wando terminal, the Coast Guard said in a statement.</p>
<p>The terminal, which is used for container cargo, was evacuated to allow federal, state and local bomb detection units to conduct investigations. Authorities did not detail the nature of the threat.</p>
<p>When the threat was ongoing, the Coast Guard tweeted that a &quot;safety zone has been established around the vessel&quot; as multiple agencies investigate. Several hours later, it gave the all-clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Unified Command determines no existing threat to the port. Terminal will reopen &amp; safety zone has been lifted,&quot; the Coast Guard tweeted. &quot;There were four containers where threat was posed at terminal in Charleston, SC. These have been scanned and cleared by authorities.&quot;</p>
<p>It said the source of the &quot;original reporting source of the threat&quot; has been detained for questioning.
Coast Guard Lt. JB Zorn said the threat was based on an anonymous claim shared by a man on YouTube.</p>
<p>The Maersk Memphis left New York three days ago, according to the MarineTraffic website. </p>

<p>THIS RELATES TO PIZZAGATE because George Webb has been an integral character amongst PG investigators.

            Has anybody bothered to read the 6 Accidental Journalist articles by Trish the Dish aka Patricia Negron praising the exploits of  George Webb?  He is LEADING  the largest crowd source investigation in hiistory.  He has an ARMY of  researchers  who contribute  their work product to him for publication on the net. I do believe she's  referring to us Pizzagaters.  And by the way  she tries to provide him with some lame cover by stating the name  of this fabulous investigative journalist, George Webb,  is a pseudonym inspired by Gary Webb, George's hero.  All this made me want to gag. I betcha they are lovers because she is way too smitten by him. Otherwise her articles are very well written and she's writing on all the great issues of concern to us. She just has way too much pixie dust in her eyes to see clearly.

            Good question. How many agents were diverted to this one port? How many smaller ports were able to send ships to sea during this time frame? S Carolina is a 2 hour flight from DC. IDK how long by boat along the coast. How many kids are missing in DC alone since January? Who owns all the ports in S Carolina? Panama just tightened relations with China the other day. The congressman shot was pushing for heavier anti-trafficking. The ship in question.........which companies typically have used it over the last few years? I see we know where it has docked, but carrying cargo for who? Was there any S Carolina government people at that ball game, yesterday?

           <p>
            Please explain why alerting the authorities about a possible dirty bomb is bad. What am I missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb got the Port of Charleston shut down for a few hours in the middle of the night. This wasn't a hospital or freeway this was a tiny inconvenience.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem you own right now Horsefucker is you dissuading people from calling in suspicious things like possible dirty bombs could have disastrous consequences. I don't know what fucking Nazi hell hole you post from but here in America we have an expression "Better safe than sorry.".
           </p>
           <p>
            That means you don't try to rip a person a new ass hole for trying to help people. Far from George Webb looking bad YOU ARE the one who's plumbing new depths here.

             LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WERE CALLED OUT.  An EVACUATION ENSUED. Local media went APESHIT; there were PAGES OF GOOGLE HITS as this story broke.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Webb et al were just being "cautious," and Webb really has all these "intel ties,"  all, he had to do was contact one of his "connections": on the QT to have it checked it out.  Instead they cause MASS HYSTERIA, making the "conspiracy community" look like a bunch of idiots.  Maybe that was the POINT of the whole "exercise."
            </p>
            <p>
             But hey, YOU are the IDIOT who wrote yesterday that President TRUMP IS PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISPOSITION OF REP. SCALISE IN THE HOSPITAL. YOU WROTE THAT IF SCALISE DIES, IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S FAULT!!    LMAO!!

            I think it's great you left this post up. I believe MORE speech is always better than LESS.

           <p>
            Yesterday I made a similar off-topic post about Steve Scalise getting shot and it was immediately removed. Both this post by equinelvr and my post yesterday are both equally off topic. Their's is kept mine is given the boot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why the double standard?

            Were they duped, or was Webb in on it?!    At this point, frankly nothing surprises me in a story involving Webb.  We DO know that he has admitted to participating in child trafficking in the "good old days" (he claims that he "had to do it to learn how they operate"), and it has come out in the last day or so that he was a "sexual abuse victim."
           </p>
           <p>
            Webbland is Crazyland.  Oh well, at least it's entertaining -- in a trainwreck sort of way.
