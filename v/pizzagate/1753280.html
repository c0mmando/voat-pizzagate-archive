<p>So I saw a very interesting post today on facebook that made claims trump is a possible pedo.
Here is the link shared:

<p>Obviously questioning source as we should always do but it seems pretty solid. Idk what I\'m really trying to get out of this but I thought it was worth posting. Also I do have a request if someone could comment below with an answer that would be awesome. Are there any flight logs that put Trump in Epsteins pedoplane? If so please site source because this could be huge in gaining the masses on both sides of the party into investigating pedogate. Most people on left are refusing to even look at the evidence right now because it puts the people they thought were so good under some extreme scrutiny, but if trump were to get tied into this(whether he is a pedophile or not the ties alone will be enough) I feel as though many of those same people would be eager to start investigating in attempt of finding some dirt on trump which could be momumental for this movement. Anyway, please comment what you think and PLEASE don\'t delete admins.</p>',

            IMO just more theory that Trump knew what Epstein was up to.

            Trump is a Tribe of Dan crypto Jew.  He is also a Freemason.   He is also the POTUS, and EVERY single POTUS has been an royal bloodline Jew/Illuminatus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even IF all the above weren't true (it is), Trump had/has two very suspect very close "friends:"   The late Roy Cohn, a homo Jewish attorney who was CIA and has been dubbed the CIA Pedophile Ring Leader. Cohn has been called Trump's "mentor" (!).
           </p>

            The other is the bisexual, cross-dressing, 09/11 profiteer, phony conservative, phony "hero" Rudy Guiliani.  Good article on his 09/11 involvement by Devvy Kidd.

            That, of course, is IN ADDITION TO his 15-year "friendship" with Epstein, whom many of you believe has been "explained."
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, I voted for Trump.  But I am a critical thinker, unlike most here who are WORSHIPPERS of these various "personalities" because they are addicted like CRACKHEADS to the idea that some "superhero" is going to "save us all."

             I'm skeptical of him. Why would I not be? His name is Trump and he's shark from the same pool as the rest and all I know about him is what I've seen on the screen and read in books.  Hoping to  surprised about that though and he's the good kind of "double agent"/  We shall see and know in the coming years if at least some of the major players are prosecuted. Not holding my breath though.

             You are awesome and this comment is awesome... honestly wish this post was on hot page just so people could see your comment. Most pizzagate researchers right now are trump loyalist and we will not be able to defeat these people if we are picking sides. Thanks for the links you should make a post about trump connections to Cohn. Still wanting to see if we can pin trump on those Epstein flights like claimed in the article though

                I hope he isn't .  Sorry I didn't see that comment just responded to my inbox. I do remember during the election this came up. Trump said Epstein was showing up to his hotels with different young girls claiming they were his neice. Then one of them made a complaint to the staff at his hotel &amp; they called police and turned him in. It was a comment live on msm. I could never find it on youtube.  Aslo he stated  Bill Clinton was going to have lots of problems with the upcoming "Lolita Express."
I went through the available flights logs. They are  available online. I didn't see Trump on there, but not all the records were available only a few years. I did hear a story of him going to Epsteins Island but he split once he realised what they were up to. That part may be election disinfo who knows, &amp; I don't have any sources.

            Am I misreading or misunderstanding the sentence, "a Florida attorney, who represents convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein‘s alleged victims, and the disgraced billionaire himself"  ....why would an attorney represent the victim &amp; the predator, or Trump?  either person, doesn't make sense to represent both sides of the lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is old news.  This would be the 3rd time (I think) the Clinton/Epstein party have tried to include Trump in that investigation as a way to take heat off themselves by redirecting onto and discredit Trump.  This is the Clinton &amp; Democrat Modus Operandi.   Project onto your opposition what you are guilty of.  Saul Alinsky tactic.

             I think it is saying the trial he is a supposed witness to envolves the victims lawyer and epstein himself. Idk though, was slightly confusing and I could be wrong. Anyway I know the whole blame people what you're guilty of tactic but the fact is Epstein is already fucked, and if trump is tied to being on that plane and the flight records can verify that I, peronsally, find that to be huge. And again we shouldn't be playing sides except the side of righteousness and if this means digging into trump and Epstein ties we, as a community, must investigate. This could get both sides on the discussion/investigation if any link is true(regardless if he actually is a pedo or not the link alone will draw the lefties into the discussion) and further awake the brainwashed left of the horrid acts that have been going on(this includes their beloved podestas and clintons)

              I'd agree if the story of Trump's involvement sounded even half credible, but all the stories I've seen seem to clearly point at misdirection instead of legitimate facts or evidence.   Epstein's brother saying Trump was on there, without proof, is as believable as Hillary making the claim.  Comes from an untrustworthy source that has an invested interest in discrediting Trump.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I wouldn't say Epstein is fucked, he got a slap on the wrist.  Until Trump or FBI lock these bastards up for 100 years, it's the public that got fucked, not the pedos.

             I disagree... their is a major cover up across the board. Why didn't they expose McCain using your same argument?

              I'll tell you why. It's because they can't risk being caught. Period. They would rather the opposition wins in politics then be caught for doing the same thing they would accuse them of.
