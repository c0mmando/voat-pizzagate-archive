             Geldof is widely recognised for his activism, especially anti-poverty efforts concerning Africa.[7] In 1984 he and Midge Ure founded the charity supergroup Band Aid to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.[5] They went on to organise the charity super-concert Live Aid the following year and the Live 8 concerts in 2005.[8] Geldof currently serves as an adviser to the ONE Campaign, founded by fellow Irishman Bono,[9] and is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa.

            Speaking of Scott Peterson, looks like he may be about to get another trial. There was an alternative theory that Laci was in fact killed by Satanic Cult members, who had already killed 13 other pregnant women in the Modesto area.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Matt Dalton, a criminal defense attorney in the Peterson case, said that police overlooked the fact that since 1992, seven pregnant women disappeared from the same area Laci disappeared from. He stated cult members were never looked into thoroughly and police chose not to investigate the “cult theory.”
            </strong>
            <strong>
             “She [Laci] was targeted because she was pregnant,” Dalton said, who still believes Laci was a victim of a homicidal cult.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Always thought Scott was a slimy piece of shit, but tbh there was actually zero forensic evidence linking him to her murder. I would also be interested to see increased media awareness and exposure of these Satanic Cults.

             I remember this case and never heard of the cult theory, thank you for sharing this. Very interesting. One of his former lawyers believes that to be the case and has written a book about it.
