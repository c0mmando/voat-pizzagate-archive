            Another card I think is related is the spam mail card from that illuminati game. The question is how long have pedos been using codes in plain sight of the public? I read that they were using spam email with codes instead of just codes words. They got a little bold or lazy and just started using direct mail. Thing is they were using spam snail mail before the internet. I wish I had a pile of old spam mail from the 90s lying around.
