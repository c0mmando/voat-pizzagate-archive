Jeff Kasky is notable to the Pizzagate because he was vice-president of One World Adoption Services in Florida.  User <a href="https://voat.co/user/MolochHunter">@MolochHunter</a> had a great post <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2420160">here</a> which gives a great explanation of the situation as discovered by Digital Empire.  One of the locations for OWAS in Georgia after it was found they were coercing children away from their mothers in the Congo.  
</p>
<p>On Jeff Kasky\'s personal youtube channel the videos are almost all about his sons Cameron and Julian, particularly when they were babies, toddlers, and small children.  In a video that is open to everyone and not age restricted called &quot;Julian Kasky right after birth&quot;, Jeff Kasky shows footage of the birth of his son which includes tons of nudity of his own newborn son.  The section on actual childbirth is actually relatively short so it would be hard for Youtube to classify it as existing for educational purposes.  Even if we assume his posting of the video was merely bad judgement and not intended to be sexual, it doesn\'t explain some of the other videos.  One video is called &quot;Julians1st birthday and lap dance&quot; (that is verbatim)  where an unknown woman makes another small (presumably female) toddler perform a lap dance on Julian and then makes them kiss.  Below is the link to the youtube.  Watch any of it with warning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jeffkasky">https://www.youtube.com/user/jeffkasky</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe there is strong evidence of predatory adoptions and human trafficking being rampant in Florida and Jeff Kasky is merely one example and egregous case.  I believe that this Youtube is not merely inappropriate but evidence of Jeff Kasky\'s own perversity and criminal mind.  While the mainstream media will decry this as extremism, only one year ago a Huffpost writer spoke out about Kasky for referring to adopters as <a href="http://archive.is/a7LtY#selection-579.1-867.21">&quot;consumers&quot;</a> and being dishonest about disclosing his financial motivations and treating adoption as a business and not a charity with the best interest of children at heart.</p>
<p>I suggest we all flag the account and hold Youtube accountable for allowing such content while disallowing viewpoints they oppose.  The world deserves the truth.</p>',

            Just a thought but speaking of ADOPTIONS does anyone have any info on Cruz adoption? I know he said his birth mom was jewish and thats about it could he have been connected to this (or another) shady adoption agency? There seems to be A LOT OF MONEY involved in his family estate and he stood to inherit like close to a million right?  Lots of questions....

            That shit reminds me of the Jimmy Comet "caris taped to a table" picture. It was
            <em>
             clearly
            </em>
            sick, wrong, and associated with pedophilia undertones, but what did all the normies say about it?
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             You're
            </em>
            making it perverted.
            <em>
             You're

            I heard that reaction so many fucking times from PG deniers. Some people just can't handle the truth even when it's dick-slapping them in the face.

            I saw great piece on Jeff by Urbanmoving on Bitchute. He was banned on Youtube after exposing Florida Shooting and that DavidH guy (they track his name)! If we think about it, it all adds up. Which kid or a family would participate in high treason (which is exactly what crisis actors do) unless they are not like the rest of us!!!! It's a cabal of pedo/psychopaths. Take down PG and you take down the NWO.

            I am just now hearing about all this.  Looked up the channel and the voice is rather similar but I can't truly say.  What struck me is how the "Jeffy" character is basically a retarded Autistic kid.  If true Kasky runs the Autism Channel for good PR while he mocks actual autistic kids with Jeffy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also considering we are to believe Jeff has like 4 jobs already I wouldn't be surprised if Elsagate puppet master is one more.

            This is interesting. I put up a post on whatever about the Jeffy youtube videos being much like Elsagate. When I looked into it there was a /pol post about Jeff Kasky being the owner of the channel/website that they came from, which I thought was weird (could not independently verify)

            The sad thing is that is kindve normal behavior for Sodom and Gomorrah.  I mean Dade and Broward counties.  It is so over the top sexualized there, and always has been. I trully believe female children actually develop younger there to. I used to think it was the hormones from the cows.

             Thank you.  I just watched the video titled "Julien May 1998." It has no nudity but Julien appears to me to have the "panda eyes" or sunken eyelids which are usually a sign of abuse.  Let me know what you think.

            Notice the Logo      39, 413 Children Represented     Volunteer Your Legal Services    If you’re an attorney who wants to use your legal expertise to give a voice to a child, you will find rewarding service through the Florida Guardian ad Litem (GAL) Program.  There are more than 30,000 abused, abandoned, and neglected children under the jurisdiction of Florida’s juvenile dependency courts.  Effective legal advocacy of their best interests is crucial to ensure they reach permanency quickly, get the services they need, and have a voice in court.  IS this how Jeff Kasky was volunteering?  Donating his Legal Services?  AND What is Gestational Surogacy?

            assist-reproOn January 14 at 2 pm, attorney, Jeffrey A. Kasky and Marla B. Neufeld, co-authors of the new book, The American Bar Association’s Guide to Assisted Reproduction will explain the available ART options; the process for choosing the appropriate team to assist with your ART journey such as medical providers, psychological implications, and legal representatives; understanding and entering into appropriate agreements; and the unique issues that may arise pre-and post-birth. The ABA’s guide provides those considering embarking upon ART with the foundational knowledge they need to make informed choices regarding which ART method to use and the criteria to select the right professionals. The book also contains insight from experts in the ART industry such as renowned reproductive doctors, embryologists, mental health professionals, lawyers, religious perspectives, and those who shared their personal struggles with family building.   WOW.  Just Wow.

              I wish I could copy that pdf.  Yes he donated about 18K to Hands Up For Haiti and if people actually think the money went to helping those 25K people, some of whom a re children, they are sadly mistaken.  He has ties to Haiti, and ties to really quite a few org. that are connected to children.  Unfortunately, being who he is, this is not a good thing for those children or their families.

               Yeah, I saw it.  I didn't know about the GAL part beforehand so that was very interesting.  It doesn't surprise me though that they have the most corrupt people representing children, by design.

                It seems that there is no end to these Orgs.  They are all over the place and I think are interconnected, in so that certain people are part of them.

              "(Paul)Gold and Deschamps tried to help their mother, who was in her 60s and in poor health."

             <p>
              NO WITNESSES?
"“He was ostracized his whole life,” said (Paul) Gold, who said he was one of only four people, including Nikolas, and his younger brother, Zachary, who attended the funeral of his mother, Lynda Cruz, in November."
"Lynda Cruz came down with the flu last year and refused to get medical treatment, (Paul) Gold said. “She was so frugal, she didn’t want to spend the money, she wanted to save everything for the boys,’’ (Paul) Gold said."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Cruz was about 11 when (Paul) Gold and his girlfriend, Rocxanne Deschamps, moved next door to them in Parkland."
"Lynda Cruz stayed home with the boys, and sometimes watched Gold’s daughter, who was friends with the boys."
"(Paul) Gold said that Cruz escaped his misery by playing video games for eight, 12, even 15 hours a day. Gold, who owns a film and video production company, sometimes would play a game or two with them.
“It was kill, kill, kill, blow up something, and kill some more, all day,” he said."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Cruz — at 5-foot-7 and 120 pounds — was scrawny, and rarely, if ever, felt comfortable with other kids, either in his Parkland neighborhood or at Stoneman Douglas, according to Paul Gold, who lived next door to the Cruz family and remained in touch with Nikolas up until his mother’s funeral in November."
             </p>
             <p>
              "By then she had sold the house and moved into an apartment. When she died, Nikolas Cruz called (Paul) Gold and asked him if he would drive him to the funeral. The only attendees, (Paul) Gold said, were Cruz, his brother, (Paul) Gold and Deschamps."
             </p>
             <p>
              "After (Paul) Gold and Deschamps split up and went their separate ways a few years ago, Cruz stayed in touch with (Paul) Gold. His mother remained best friends with Deschamps, who took Nikolas Cruz and his brother into her home after their mother died."

             Speaking of Cruz, here's something interesting:
            </p>
            <p>
             "After he left the Deschamps home, Cruz went to live with Kimberly and James Snead in Parkland, where he had grown up. Mr Snead, a military intelligence analyst, and his wife Kimberly, a neonatal intensive care nurse, said that given a second chance, they still would have let Cruz into their home and let him bring his guns with him."
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5427285/Photos-Nikolas-Cruz-interring-mother-revealed.html#ixzz58AcvjNRg">
              http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5427285/Photos-Nikolas-Cruz-interring-mother-revealed.html#ixzz58AcvjNRg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that he was staying with a military intelligence analyst and a neonatal intensive care nurse screams Pizzagate and MK Ultra to me.

               I would say most certainly there is. At the very least, a masonic connection. Just a matter of finding it.

              Good that you are making that assessment. Stands out to me too.  The whole arrangement is suspect.  The  Military and Alphabet Connections  in this Shooting certainly point to the fact that there may be a Set Up going on here.  FBI and the MIC are present in the background of the Alleged Shooter and the alleged crisis actors, whose fathers are suspect as well.  This should be obvious to most.

             A recent post was deleted but it contained some important video leads and connects Kasky's "Autism Channel" with some creepy You Tube videos of what appears to be children with autism who  getting ther brains hooked up to a computer by Kasky's cohort, Lynette Louise, aka "The Brain Broad". Is this sick comedy or REAL? (she claims to have been a stand up comic, among other things.
Don't forget the $3 million in donations collected by Kasky's son.

               I hope many will look further into these leads. Kasky's combo of talent/busineses is quite interesting. Not to mention that he is mentoring his son in managing the $3 MILLION in school shooting donations.
Could this be an attempt to replenish cut off Saudi funds?

               The videos are older, 2008. They were calling it "biofeedback". This woman is a clueless idiot. Autism is a brain injury from vaccine poisoning. They are born normal. The treatment is to detox them from mercury, aluminum, etc. Some can be helped, others cannot. Their sensory perception has been altered and many times their gut/digestion has been affected. Most are intelligent and their aberrant behavior is because they are suffering from the assault on their nervous system (including brain). I successfully home schooled my child. He grew up to be a great success and works for a Fortune 500 company in computer engineering. I can assure you, I would never hire this woman.

               I believe autistic children are the new target for trafficking.

            <em>
             This is what stood out to me in the last article you linked:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              'I believe (...) adoption is in most cases a parent welfare intervention, an intervention often with disregard for first parents and their plight, with disregard for welfare solutions that could help children within their families and communities.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Follow the money leads also in adoption to the truth: the truth that those who have the money define the narrative. Adoption as a privatized and commercialized social service is an American invention
            </p>
            <p>
             The goodness-of-adoption-normalcy myth found recently its top honors when the venerable American Bar Association (...) published in April 2016:
             <strong>
              The ABA Consumer Guide to Adopting a Child
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The book is written by the owners of a Florida adoption agency, father and son Robert and Jeffrey Kasky, both adoption lawyers.
             </strong>
             The latter runs a surrogacy agency on the side.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who protested on the web against the title, which shows a complete disregard for adoption as a child welfare measure of last resort and coins adoption as a commercial act, received demeaning tweets.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...he ABA officially signed off on a business-driven, client-driven adoption narrative, which is by growing numbers in the adoption community seen as immoral.'
