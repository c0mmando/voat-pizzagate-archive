<h1>Jane Doe gives chilling account of what it was like to be one of Allison Mack\'s alleged sex slaves</h1>
<p>Yahoo Entertainment received a copy of the civil forfeiture action filed on Wednesday in Brooklyn Federal Court by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, and more unsettling details have emerged around the sex cult allegedly run by Raniere, who oversaw a self-help group called Nxivm, and the 35-year-old Smallville actress.</p>
<p>A woman simply identified as “Jane Doe 1” recalls her foray into Nxivm’s secret society called DOS (or Master Over Slave Women) and the disturbing occurrences that she says took place at both properties in Halfmoon, N.Y. In one instance, she claims she was tied to a table while someone performed sexual acts on her.</p>
<p>Jane Doe 1 is described as an actress in her early 30s who began taking Nxivm classes in 2015. In February 2016, Mack — an alleged DOS master— is said to have first recruited Jane Doe into the secret sorority. DOS masters recruited slaves mostly from within Nxivm’s ranks, according to the document. When identifying prospective slaves, masters “often targeted women who were currently experiencing difficulties in their lives,” it says. A master reportedly would tell a potential slave that it was an opportunity to “join an organization that would change her life.” Slaves were then required to perform “acts of care” for their masters, which were often sexual, and to pay “tribute,” the document claims.</p>
<p>One night, according to the court documents, Mack woke up Jane Doe and told her to meet Raniere and “do anything he asked her to do.” When they met in the middle of the night, she says, Raniere directed her to remove all her clothes, blindfolded her, and led her through some trees “into what she believed was a shack, and tied her to the table.”</p>
<p>There was another person in the room whom Jane Doe did not recognize, and this person began performing oral sex on her “as Raniere circled the table making comments,” the document reads, adding: “Jane Doe 1 did not want to participate in this sexual activity, but believed it was part of her commitment to DOS and that if she broke her commitment… collateral could be released.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just an aside and word to any potential victims: If you don\'t want to participate in sex acts, DON\'T!!!! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following months, Jane Doe 1 claims she had sexual contact with Raniere on a number of occasions, most often at one of the properties mentioned in the document. At least two other DOS slaves also had sex there, she says.</p>
<p>Throughout Jane Doe’s time in DOS, the document states, “Mack regularly required her slaves to pose for nude photographs, either as assignments or collateral. These photographs included on one occasion close-up pictures of their vaginas.” The pictures were supposedly being sent to Raniere. On one occasion, Jane Doe says she saw a message exchange between Mack and Raniere in which he responded to the naked photo, “‘All mine?’ with a smiling devil emoticon.”</p>
<p>Jane Doe also describes the branding “ceremony” in which slaves reportedly were cauterized with Mack and Raniere’s initials. It allegedly took 20 to 30 minutes, and slaves took turns holding each other down while the branding was filmed — so it could be used as collateral later, according to the document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said, it really doesn\'t sound like this filming was collateral. No way, it wasn\'t distributed as \'\'eye candy\'\' to other members of this sick, sick, sick, sick group.</p>',

             That brings up a point I didn't mention.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure distributing the video had another purpose. After all, the Cannibal Elite spend a lot of time and money in training these psychos. Therefore, Raniere and his ilk need to prove their worth. The video not only gets jollies off, but it proves to his handlers how he's doing and how adept he's getting at mind control techniques. It's also teaching material for the next wanna be little Satan -- or Satanette as we call them -- because it shows aspirants what fun you can have and how powerful you can be at terrorizing and controlling victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which reminds me that I haven't posted that info on the Process Church. It has something to do with this and is pertinent.

            There are some reports of Raniere’s involvement with teen girls. Was branding an element there as well? Is there any reports of branding trafficked children? It seems highly unlikely. It conflicts with deniability and victim shaming.

              We are definitely talking about people that are deprived enough. I’m certain that megalomaniacs and serial abusers are likely candidates... but serious traffickers wouldn’t bother. Two reasons:

              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Temporary goods are to be disposed of when their used up, without evidence.
               </p>

               The lust for power is not the only motivating factor but is certainly at the root of it.

               Looking at the situation from the very uncomfortable perspective of livestock sales, trade, and management, individual unit identification (and potentially tracking) would be wise regardless of the particular phase that unit is in. It doesn't have to be a tag in the ear. Hell, it doesn't have to be visible. Is your dog chipped?

              I think the family should have sued certain media outlets over the way they painted them. The poor woman was down to 80 something pounds, covered in bruises, had chain marks and was branded.

               Yes, but people don't understand how someone can ''willfully'' submit to that kind of torture. Especially submit to a dump like that POS. Narcissistic Sociopath if I ever saw one -- a Mr. Potato Head version, but one nonetheless.
              </p>
              <p>
               You add in that he gave the line that these victims would be his Buddhist Goddess, and society objectifies them also. I think these women need to figure out what it was that attracted them in the beginning. That's when the hook is shoved into the soft palate. Once the hook went in, the control, intimidation, peer pressure takes over, but it's the beginning they need to process and not let happen again.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's a scary thing to think your mind can be controlled, and I think it's easier to objectify these victims. I gotta say that following that dump is hard to accept. But I know that he's been trained as a handler and was specifically telling them what they wanted to hear. It's what good serial killers do. They shut down that frontal cortex decision-making ability and go for the fantasy factory where hopes and dreams win out over logic.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ultimately, I feel very sad for this victim. It's going to take a long time for her to heal, but I really think the families should have sued the authorities like Cuomo/Scheinderman, etc. They were in charge of protecting the public and they had the information and didn't. They're culpable and should be the ones held responsible.

              Possibly kidnapped for torture and sex to sell.  Could be MS-13.  They have been committing really sick crimes mutilation, torture and sex possibly filming.  Mafia led possibly to make money.  Plenty of business for this on the Dark Web.  Imo, the mob is behind all of this.  They control mostly everything.  If there is money to be made on something they want a piece of it.

               I think at this point, the Mafia is cutting up the pie ... they've got competition. Of course, the church was always behind them hence them being so powerful. Damn, we're slices of pie or pizza to them ... just a means to an end.

                Wonder if any of this will go anywhere or if it will just fritter away like it did before.  Before when they were almost eradicated centuries ago.  Then they rose up again.  This time they have to go.  It has to happen.

              Understand the branding, like handkerchiefs, etc., are a form of enduring memento.  My gut says that something like that wouldn't be shared widely, nor could it be monetized.  Branding someone is pretty tame by pervert standards.  My guess is the brands were a highly prized "possession".

               This not a memento. This was the start of something sick. And remember, there are plenty of people taking part in this movement. They get off seeing other members getting trashed. You know, where you are in the hierarchy is crucial, so it's like someone that's been through this watching something who's just entering this charmed circle get his or hers. And that's just with members.

               What about that guy in Australia that made all that money? He was getting Russian/Eastern European women to abuse their kids. There was one that burned their baby with a curling iron everytime she said, "Come here." The kid would toddle over and KAPOW! They'd get burned. Made gazillions.

                Collecting mementos from deviant sexual encounters is something "nuts" do.  There is a pathology shared by pedophiles, rapists, and serial killers.  Psychos keep souvenirs from their illicit acts.
