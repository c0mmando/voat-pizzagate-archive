<hr />
<p>For those of you with short attention spans, I will try to summarize just the facts here. If you want the juicy details and other creepy connections read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stylianos Christofides is a member of the BOD at DuPont Underground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stylianos is also a co-founder of ICG Properties LLC which is a subsidiary of Elwan Group operated out of UAE. (Ibrahim Elwan is interesting in his own right)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stylanios has been a guest speaker at the &quot;Enriching The Middle East\'s Economic Future Conference&quot; in Qatar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The welcoming and opening speeches are given by two members of the Al-thani family: the Prime Minister and the Emir (aka the leader)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another member of the Al-thani family was convicted of sex with 16 underage girls in the Czech Republic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qatar was recently in the news for its $1M gift to Bill Clinton in exchange for a 5 minute meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guess what they talked about: Investment opportunities in Haiti</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No, these connections don\'t blow the lid off of anything, and some of them are quite loose, but they tie more people together and give us new areas of investigation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now the juicy details:</p>
<p>Stylianos was first brought to my attention when I found <a href="https://twitter.com/stoladisuzanne/status/598587227610939392">this photo of him with Braulio Agnese</a>, former managing director of DuPont Underground. The photo was posted by Suzanne Pyles, executive at <a href="http://www.stoladi.com/----executive-contacts">Stoladi</a> where Stylianos is also an Executive. Suzanne is also on the BOD of <a href="http://www.aliceskids.org/">Alice\'s Kids</a>, but that\'s an investigation for another day. Stylianos is a co-founder of ICG Properties LLC.</p>
<p>I had to use the wayback machine, but I found this article about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120721082617/http://www.scaminformer.com/scam-report/stylianos-christofides-stylianos-christofides-at-icg-properties-stelios-c23537.html">fraud surrounding ICG Properties in DC</a>. Possible money laundering?<a href="http://www.icgproperties.com/"> ICG Properties</a> is owned by Ibrahim Elwan, who has his own interesting story of scamming the World Bank and building a power plant in Pakistan with its own scandal. ICG Properties also redeveloped the Gallup Building and renovated its famous Masonic Temple, which is interesting. I have a feeling there is more to ICG Properties, but I must move on.</p>
<p>Stylianos was a speaker at the 2010 <a href="http://www.qatarconferences.org/enriching2010/program.php">Enriching The Middle East\'s Economic Future Conference</a> where the opening speeches were given by Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar. Interestingly Hamid bin Abdal Sani Al-Thani was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4594579.stm">convicted of having sex with 16 underage girls</a> in Czech Republic in 2005, so they have a history of pedophilia. They also have a terrible record for human trafficking and serve as a hub. Qatar donated $1M to Bill Clinton for his birthday and for a 5 minute meeting in which <a href="http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/oct/16/mike-pence/did-qatar-promise-clinton-foundation-1-million-fiv/">they discussed investment opportunities in Haiti</a> I think the Clinton/Qatari connection has everything to do with sex trafficking. Another speaker at the <a href="http://qatarconferences.org/dohaforum2015/participants.html">Enriching The Middle East\'s Economic Future  Conference in 2015</a> was Mr. Hani Hikmat Masri who is the president of <a href="http://www.tomorrowsyouth.org/2011/03/tyo-in-the-big-apple/">Tomorrow\'s Youth Organization</a> which works with the Clinton Global Initiative. Hani Hikmat Masri is also an<a href="http://edgar.brand.edgar-online.com/DisplayFilingInfo.aspx?Type=HTML&amp;text=%2526lt%253bNEAR%252f4%2526gt%253b(%22HANI+HIKMAT%22%2c%22MASRI%22)&amp;FilingID=6303798&amp;ppu=%2fPeopleFilingResults.aspx%3fPersonID%3d4654464%26PersonName%3dHANI%2520HIKMAT%2520MASRI"> investor in DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc.</a> which isn\'t really related to DuPont Underground other than the name DuPont.</p>
