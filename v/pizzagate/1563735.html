<blockquote>
<p>One of the Clinton Foundation\'s main donors (donation amount between $1-5M) is Absolute Return for Kids/(ARK).

<blockquote>
<p>Mabel has a new love: Arpad Busson, a 52-year-old French multimillionaire. (...) Arpad Busson travels the world as a philanthropist and committed his foundation Absolute Return for Kids (ARK) for good education for children. Mabel was a guest at the Girl Summit 2014, which was co-organized by the ARK. At the annual ARK dinner are always many famous guests who all come where Mabel also finds out the circles (Bill Clinton, Queen Rania, Prince William).</p>
<p>Princess Mabel closes its foundation <a href="http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/">Girls Not Brides</a> (against child brides) with the objectives of ARK, but also in other areas they committed, like Arpad, passionate. For example, to help people with HIV / AIDS. In addition, Mabel and Arpad both live in London. Sounds like a match so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some facts about Mabel taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mabel_of_Orange-Nassau">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Mabel_of_Orange-Nassau</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau (formerly Mabel Martine Wisse Smit, born Mabel Martine Los, 11 August 1968) is the widow of Prince Friso, brother of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>She studied economics and political science at the University of Amsterdam, graduating summa cum laude in 1993. During her studies she also completed internships at the United Nations, Shell, ABN AMRO and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition to Dutch, she speaks fluent English, Spanish and French.</p>
<p>During her university years, she showed special interest in human rights situations around the world, and later specialised in Balkan diplomacy and international relations. In 1995 she was present at the peace conference in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Wisse Smit was co-founder of the <strong>European Action Council for Peace in the Balkans</strong> in 1994, which was a non-governmental organisation that strove for peace, democracy and stability in the Balkans, and had Margaret Thatcher, Simon Wiesenthal and Valéry Giscard d\'Estaing among its members.</p>
<p>In 1995 she was one of the co-founders of War Child Netherlands, she was on the Trustee Board until 1999. In 1997, she was appointed director of EU affairs of the <strong>Open Society Institute</strong> in Brussels, one of the foundations of Hungarian-American philanthropist <strong>George Soros</strong>. From 2002 to 2008, Princess Mabel worked in the London branch of the Open Society Institute where she was the International Advocacy Director, to help coordinate all international OSI advocacy activities aimed at international policy change.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum in Switzerland counted her as one of the hundred &quot;Global Leaders for Tomorrow&quot;. She is a member of the worldwide Forum of Young Global Leaders, a thinktank and lobby group that aims to tackle global issues.</p>
<p>She is one of the founding members of the European thinktank European Council on Foreign Relations. She is also a member of the Interpeace Governing Council.</p>
<p>From July 2008 till May 2012 she was the first Chief Executive Officer of The Elders, a group of eminent individuals convened by Nelson Mandela to use their wisdom, independent leadership and experience to tackle some of the world\'s toughest problems. She oversaw the day-to-day operations for the Elders.</p>
<p>In May 2012, Mabel van Oranje resigned as CEO of The Elders, following the February 2012 accident in which her husband, Prince Friso, was caught in an avalanche and remained hospitalised until his death on 12 August 2013. She continues to be involved with The Elders as a member of its Advisory Council, which she sits on in her capacity as Advisory Committee Chair of Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>After announcing the engagement of Prince Friso with Mabel in June 2003, the Dutch Prime Minister stated that Mabel Wisse Smit had given &quot;incomplete and incorrect information&quot; about the duration and extent of her contacts with known drug lord, Klaas Bruinsma, and that because of this, the government had decided not to seek permission for the marriage from parliament. Prince Friso stated that the couple had given some incomplete information, but had not given any incorrect information nor did they lie. The couple admitted that the sailing friendship with Bruinsma was indeed closer than had been mentioned, but denied a love or sexual relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far the Wikipedia article. A bigger controversy might be Mabel\'s cause for Bosnia in the 1990\'s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...) she had a relationship with Muhamed Sacirbey, who was soon arrested on charges of having embezzled large amounts of United Nations and Bosnian government funds. Reportedly Mabel was also a target for kidnapping by Servian intelligence in this period in order to put pressure on Sacirby. She sure knows how to pick \'em.</p>
<p>Surely Mabel would have made an ideal CIA honey trap, but, let\'s face it, there is no evidence that she ever was. With internships at Shell, ABN AMRO, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and finally the United Nations, she did seem destined for high office very early on. Only one year after graduating in 1993, she founded the European Action Council for Peace in the Balkans, in which Margaret Thatcher and Valery Giscard d\'Estaing became involved. Soon she became a key agent for the Open Society Institute of George Soros, which does little else than sponsor permanent pro-West revolutions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Curiously, one of Mabel\'s Open Society Institute email addresses was found in a Scientology email list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OSI arranged include the financial flows to the national Soros Foundations in various countries, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe, namely Soros is originally from Hungary. These East European activities, a later stage extended towards the Balkans, stimulated that Mabel got an affair with former Bosnian Foreign Minister Sacirbey, who was later charged with a flourishing arms trade with Iran. Mabel was also involved in the foundation War Child Netherlands, among others funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (during the years 2003 -2006 more than 3.7 million Euros).</p>
<p>Given its good relations in the Balkans, it is almost certain that Mabel was a welcome partner of the national intelligence services, and perhaps secret services of other countries.  (...)</p>
<p>On the one hand Mabel tried by supporting its efforts in WarChild in Amsterdam child war victims in Bosnia, while on the other hand, also in The Hague, lobbied for arms supplies to that country, in order to corroborate her boyfriend Sacirbey. A very ambivalent attitude.</p>

These East European activities, a later stage extended towards the Balkans, stimulated that Mabel got an affair with former Bosnian Foreign Minister Sacirbey, who was later charged with a flourishing arms trade with Iran. Mabel was also involved in the foundation War Child Netherlands, among others funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (during the years 2003 -2006 more than 3.7 million Euros).

            Given its good relations in the Balkans, it is almost certain that Mabel was a welcome partner of the national intelligence services, and perhaps secret services of other countries.  (...)

            On the one hand Mabel tried by supporting its efforts in WarChild in Amsterdam child war victims in Bosnia, while on the other hand, also in The Hague, lobbied for arms supplies to that country, in order to corroborate her boyfriend Sacirbey. A very ambivalent attitude.

            False stories, eh?  And how has that been determined?  The description of her life's activities seems to fit very nicely into the pattern of psychopathic predators who position themselves as protectors of the vulnerable upon whom they secretly prey.

            The Netherlands is at the dark heart of global satanic pedophilia operations, in addition to the global drug and oil cartels. A trusted friend sent me links to the exposure of their vast organization and the “evil” being done to control those at the top. Be advised: if squeamish, hearing about the evil of the world, do not listen. These things CAN open a dark portal, if not protected at the astral/etheric/psychic levels. Here is the email from the UK with the links that we won’t hear in the states. Best, Zany This will, eventually, be revealed.

           <p>
            Well, yes. This is the kind of stuff that people really go into denial about, isn’t it. It is just so horrific that it stretches our sense of credulity. If I mention the Jimmy Saville affair again, I would say that it is an example of how the public CANNOT go into denial about it, because it burst out into the media (at least initially) before the Elite could put the lid back on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That lid is back in place (temporarily, at least), so the massive political, international and ‘royal’ connections to it, have only partially been revealed.
But the big problem for the Elite is that they were caught ‘off guard’, and a certain amount was revealed to the public. Enough for most people to see the connections and link the dots. Unfortunately for them, all their attempts to conceal and lie about this, after the event, ARE NOT WORKING !
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they are now hoping that given enough time, the public will simply forget about it. There is this tendency in society, to lose interest in something, especially if the media (television in particular) bombard the public with other stories to distract them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This really is a big problem for them, because the same horrific situation is now coming to light in the Netherlands. In fact, some of the researchers consider that the situation over there may be even worse (though I doubt that).
           </p>
           <p>
            Because this stuff is international and highly organized and linked, they risk the falling domino effect, and that really would be a nightmare for them.
If you feel strong enough, take a deep breath and listen to the Dutch speaking about the situation in their country
( It’s in English, by the way )
