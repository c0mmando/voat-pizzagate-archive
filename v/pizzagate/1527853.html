<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btekjv0ytyY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btekjv0ytyY</a></p>
<p>Let me warn everyone by stating these videos are kind of creepy the first time I watched them. I don\'t really know what any of it means but the choices of music and films are really really bizarre. </p>
<p>It points out that Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer worked for same production companies that produced Simpsons and The Critic. At the same time Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer worked on Spiderman and Batman franchises. Okay so nothing is strange about that... but then when it gets into Batman it somehow connects Jack Nicolson Joker scene &quot;toys line&quot; to Toy Story Tom Hanks saying &quot;Toys&quot;....then from there when the Toy Story doll comes out the voice is slowed down it sort of sounds like REDRUM which then of course shows clips of Danny from the film playing with Toys on carpet that looks EXACTLY the same as the carpet in Toy Story.</p>
<p>I seriously don\'t understand how Toy Story or The Shining would even connect to Batman (other than Jack?), Danny Elfman or quite frankly pizzagate/Hollywood at this point if you are reading this wondering why I am posting this here. However, it was the next video from the uploader that shows severals clips of nude/sex scenes of every single actress that ever appeared in a Warner Bros batman or superman tv show. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln5gUHvjiP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln5gUHvjiP0</a></p>
<p>It appears every single star from the 70s to today from any Batman or Superman project has appeared nude first...Even Margott Robbie who has become more popular as Harley Quinn had to do a few sex scenes as I was looking into this.</p>
<p>The reason I think this may be pizza gate related that the uploaders name is &quot;C Roskilly&quot;. So I googled Roskilly and Batman and found out that &quot;Charles Roskilly&quot; played &quot;Young Bruce Wayne&quot; in the original 1989 Tim Burton Batman film. Why would he or someone upload this with that name and what is the point of uploading this video earlier in the year with the most bizarre what seems to be out of context clips? What are they (or he) possibly trying to explain? There is some number format to and  a lot of subliminal-like pictures I cannot decipher.</p>
<p>Didn\'t want to post this on Reddit since every conspiracy seems shady there now.</p>',

            The Moon Landing could connect Toy Story and the Shining besides the carpet. There is Buzz as the astronaut and then Danny's shirt having Apollo 11. Not sure how Batman fits yet.

            Gotta say that yes every single portion of reddit is royally fucked. I had somebody in
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            the other day telling me I was reading too much into hr 5181 and that I was being paranoid about all of this anti-russian propaganda.
            <br/>
            that being said can you edit your post to establish more relevant to the pizzagate investigation. Also for narrative purpose I would flip the last bit to the top and then use the rest as supporting evidence otherwise people are sitting there for 75% of your post going "what the fuck is this guy talking about"
            <br/>
            If you cannot establish relevance I suggest you repost this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             /v/pizzagatewhatever

              Just remembered this. Pittsburgh or Philadelphia has the oldest Masonic temple. George W supposedly went there for a secret meeting after winning the presidency. He was a member of Skull and bones, their number is 322. Dark Knight Rises was filmed in Pittsburgh.
