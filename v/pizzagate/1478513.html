<p>Take a look at some of this stuff. It shows exactly how the shills operate. From it we can predict their responses on our subverse or any other platform. </p>
<p>By the way, CTR just means \'Correct The Record\' which was designed during the election to defend the Clinton narrative from counter-narratives (Trump, the alt-right). It was used heavily on reddit and fortunately we\'ve documented their behaviours from it.</p>
<p>If you read the first link then you can ascertain that <strong>their prime tactic is to incite an emotional response from us in order to discredit us or make us appear dangerous to the undecided mainstream audience</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the key. They will say all sorts of irrelevant but potentially sensitive things in order to take us off-topic and make us engage with them <strong>logically</strong>. By doing so they will try to control the narrative and damage our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO TAKE THEM HEAD-ON</strong>. Don\'t have a logical discussion. It\'s not worth your time, you can focus on more productive efforts then have your energy drained by these people. </p>
<h1><strong>Voat Example</strong></h1>
<p>Can\'t confirm for certain if this guy is a shill or not. However, his behaviour was definitely suspicious. Lots of off-topic conversations and rhetoric. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476442/7159768">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476442/7159768</a></p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/1202017/comments">https://voat.co/user/1202017/comments</a></p>
<p>If you check out all of this conversation and then the rest of the thread and then his comments, you\'ll get a good idea of what to expect from them.</p>
<p>Note how he will use emotional rhetoric by \'supporting violence\' and using angry-mob language. Then out of nowhere, he\'ll come out with a calm, understanding response apologising for his \'anger\'. Then later on he suddenly starts flaming about Jews.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/tIKF35">https://sli.mg/tIKF35</a></p>
<p>This erratic behaviour is designed to destabilise our efforts. They\'ll pose as \'us\' one minute and then say things completely nonsensical, emotional and off-topic, all to confuse you and make you slip up.</p>
<p><strong>As soon as you get frustrated and write back emotionally (in their frame), the MSM will look at it as a weakness and use it in their stack of \'evidence\' to discredit us. The investigation will be disrupted. They want us to veer off-course from productive conversation. That is their main agenda.</strong> </p>
<p>Avoid this at all costs!</p>

<p>That\'s it. It\'s as simple as that. Call them out or upvote someone who already has and downvote the shill.
<strong>DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THEM LOGICALLY OR ACKNOWLEDGE ANY IN/VALIDITY OF THEIR ARGUMENTS!</strong></p>
<h6>Pizzagate is NOT a political movement. We have NO ideology. We have NO philosophy. We DO NOT support anyone or anything. If someone says we do then they are a shill, EXPOSE THEM!</h6>
<p>REMEMBER:</p>
<h3><strong>Our sole purpose is to end the evils of child rape and murder carried out by our elites.</strong> That is all. Our scope does not extend to anything else. We just want the kids to be safe and get these disgusting animals jailed.</h3>
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>As long we keep calm and continue our progress, we nullify their effect. Call them out and then ignore them. They\'re  the internet version of mosquitoes, just get under a net and they can\'t do anything. </p>
<p>Yes, they may buy upvotes but don\'t let that discourage you. Their money will dry out if their work is ineffective. They can\'t sustain an attack like this for a long time, it ends up becoming very costly. So, do not fear them!</p>
<p>Their individual goal is to post as much bullshit as possible <em>in order to get paid</em>. Their livelihoods are based on this and if they don\'t get results quickly then they get fired. Unlike us, they do not operate under a collective vision. They have more to lose out of this than us, which puts us immediately at an advantage. </p>
<p>I\'ll leave you with a quote from the Art of War by Chinese general, Sun Tzu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know ourselves and we know them. We know what they are capable of and we know what we can do to stop them. Don\'t let them discourage you, we\'ve come so far already! Keep moving forward!</p>

            It would help if people new here, i.e. who came from Reddit or other are not automatically suspect when they comment or participate, then are put on a "known shill" list. It is counterproductive. Edited to add: GREAT post.

             Yes. Someone called me a shill because my account was made 1.5 years ago and pizzagate is the first time I'm interacting. With all the investigation~ skills~ in here, can no one put together that 1.5 years ago (june 10) was the time reddit banned a ton of subreddits? So yeah, I made an account that day but never used it until pizzagate got moved to voat. So suspicious.

            The jews have a long, long history of being both involved in pedophilia and child sacrifice. This has been a major reason for them being expelled from so many countries. Google sabbatai zevi and yakob frank. The satanism involved in pizzagate is run by khazars aka "those who say they are jews but are not" asthe bible so eloquently puts it. Also a lot of these shills are israeli intelligence operatives. You can tell because they cant grasp english like a native speaker would, and they always flame whenever anything critical of jews is posted.

            Dismissing investigation because it could involve jews seems counterproductive though. They see us as cattle, use our women and children as sex slaves. Harvest us for organs. Want to wipe us all out eventually. You don't want to hurt their feelings?

            It's what happens when they decide to shut something down.  And they usually succeed.  But this time too many researchers are wise to their tactics and too many people are really, really pissed.

            The shills will fail because I think that there are enough experienced internet researchers on this board who can recognize and deal with them.  This post is very useful for new researchers who may be less aware about co-opting tactics.

            I share this with a poster from Spain earlier today and I believe it applies to all members on Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for your efforts and believe me when I tell you that most American's are sick of the criminality in governments worldwide as well. Most of the truth seeker's here on VOAT simply want to see a return to the rule of law in our democracy. Sadly, it appears that Voat has been overrun by shills. I am going to share a piece here about who is spreading the whole "fake news" and Russia meme. At this point in America I think it's important we adhere to our Democratic principles and give the properly elected next Administration the ability to finish the investigations that so many worked hard on here on Voat and Reddit. Per the FBI Anon the leaks were from good members of our government who were not in a position to prosecute. Please tell our friends in Spain and Europe that President elect Trump will be inaugurated on 20 January 2017. It's important that ALL begin to refer to Donald as PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP. After President elect Trump takes office all of us here in America will call on our congress critters to investigate the "knowns" in Pizzagate which I see as follows:
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton Foundation is entirely corrupt global "pay to play" operation. If Bill and Hillary turn evidence we will leave it to the proper authorities to do the follow up work. We on Voat and Reddit will demand a proper investigation and hopefully, accept the the findings. It won't be swept under the carpet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anthony Weiner sexted a teenage girl in another state. To my knowledge this violates many statutes in both NY and NC therefore it becomes "intrastate" and a Federal crime (I'm not a lawyer). Those concerned on Voat should write their Congress critter's to demand Weiner be investigated and if he turns evidence let's see what he turns. We should accept what is investigated and it appears that Weiner should see jail time as anyone else who did this (where I live anyways) would be imprisoned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta owned and displayed nude photograph's of teenage girls in his suburban VA home. This is indeed child pornography (yes it's rather tame but it is kiddie porn). Once again to my knowledge this is illegal and should be investigated. Statutes of limitation should NOT be adhered to here (once again I am not an attorney). There is a politburo approved WAPO article which discusses this as fact and it should be investigated thoroughly. Tony Podesta should see jail time because once again anyone I know here in Virginia would see jail time for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's important now is a proper transition of administration. Shill's on here should take note that all former military and current law enforcement to my knowledge back President ELECT Trump and we take our oaths very seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks to all who did a lot of good work here. God bless. The forces of light and logos appear to be winning right now.

             What I see on Voat is a ton of dumb fucking bots. There are paid hasbara-shills, but that be the mod's running sub.

            <p>
             All these doc's about 'shills' is right out of Cass Sunstein Hasbara-Shill, Inc.

             People talk about Pizzagate, when you lower yourselves to talk about the hasbara-shills, then then PEDO's win.
