<p>SOMEthing needs to be done about what\'s happening here, and the mod team is small and limited in resources and time.

            Ok so I'm no researcher but a long time lurker.  This is all very shady imo from both sides.  The people who back jem are so fucking cryptic in their posts and are "its right in front of your face".  Well just fucking tell us.  And the mods.....  Brand people.  This is supposed to be a platform of free speech.  If you get led off course by one of these fags your not really helping the cause anyway.  Sorry but I'm gonna say it I think the mods and the jem crew are all in it together.  Divide and conquer.

That's why I don't research, it is legitimatly a waste of time the only thing that will stop this is a total collapse of the system we live in today.

               Then why are you even commenting here?  Is it because you're a paid shill here to try and reinforce the idea that the mods are somehow bad people when one mod pings the other so they all know what's going on?

                   Go for it.  Faggots like you are nothing but a boost in motivation to destroy faggots like you.  It's a vicious cycle.

                      You having fun?  I mean this must really get exhausting.  Anyone you disagree with you slander and name call.  All I ever did was voice my opinion.  Why did you get so upset?   Honestly if you're not doing exactly what I said it shouldn't have bothered you and your cronies.  I think I sode with Jen's crew now.  Thanks for helping me make my mind up.

                        Name calling, finger pointing, and all around faggotry.  That's all you have.  I stated my opinion.  I don't post and this is why.  Truly dude, I'm not on their side I just wanted to let people know what I thought was going on.  But, why are you so defensive?

            Unfortunately, I think tags will be ascribed to people whose (sometimes and/or often) valid opinions are disliked. It's a form of shaming and social stigmatizing, as well as public humiliation.  If you want to shut down any dissenting opinions, that is the perfect way to do it.  Forcing users to carry labels is pretty much the way it was done in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter">
             The Scarlet Letter
            </a>
            . I'd like to think we've moved on a little since then.

            Yes, I made that comment to Vindicator. But I've not had any run-ins with him/her and have accepted whatever ruling he/she wanted to make.  And I've had a hell of a lot more accusations leveled at me.  I don't care though.  I know who I am; I know my principles. As I've said before, I'm a nobody on the other side of the world. I have no horse in the race. I ask for, and take, no money.  I am here simply because I want children to be protected. I am labelled a 'nut' by some for believing in pizzagate, but I've been here since the beginning and know that something is really wrong in Washington DC. Still noone knows what happened to little Caris. Instead of all this infighting, we should be thinking of the innocent children like her and the horrible things they're forced to endure.

             This is why I don't believe a word of what you say.  You JIDF/MediaMatters shills always try to shoehorn in some kind of heartstring-tugging anecdote to make yourselves sound human.  You're not.

               There is clearly one rule for the mods, who can and do call users 'cunts', and another rule for users, who get some of their pretty pertinent and relevant threads taken down.

             If we choose not to go with flairs, I've half a mind to gather this kind of evidence on

              First the mods spread false claims that Jem777 was not Jenny Moore.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the mods spread false claims that Jenny Moore was not dead.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the mods spread false claims that Jenny Moore was a CIA disinformation agent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the mods spread false claims about Jenny Moore's history and relationships.
             </p>
             <p>
              They claimed she was not a whistleblower. They claimed she was not injured in an attack.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jem777 was banned from posting here. She then posted as Mej777. She was threatened along with others and finally gave up on Voat to travel and partner up with George Sweigart in an attempt to meet with others in real life and share The Truth with a wider audience.
             </p>
             <p>
              She knew the risks she was taking. She was more courageous and brave than most of you here will ever be.
             </p>
             <p>
              She returned to Voat in a frantic attempt to meet another user who ALWAYS TOLD EVERYONE THE TRUTH.
             </p>
             <p>
              She met them and Knew The Truth. She continued investigating extreme crimes and met with many victims of abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Months later after increasingly dangerous missions and disagreements with George Sweigart, she is dead.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jenny is not the only one who was threatened, slandered, doxxed, attacked and murdered for knowing The Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jenny knew a lot more than anyone here is giving her credit for. She also believed in Jesus Christ.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               The mods ran hit pieces on Jem777 and Jenny Moore to slander and attack her when she could not defend herself.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Worse, they began targeting anyone who stood up for Jenny Moore and The Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              You in particular called both Jenny Moore that very word multiple times in the hit piece another mod created after she was killed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even

              </a>
              was called this word by mods for even attempting to Right the Wrongs and stand up for Jenny Moore and The Truth. She was not the only one called names, threatened, lied to, and manipulated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whether you agreed with Jenny Moore when she was Jem777 or not, or believed that she had been attacked or not, or threatened or not, or doxxed or not, or murdered or not, she was still a member of this community who ended up dead while investigating and reporting on extreme criminal corruption, trafficking and abuse among high level officials and others involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who does that?
             </p>
             <p>
              You then continued piling on and calling others names, launching wildly false accusations, attempting to dox other users, threatening other users, wrongly calling multiple people "Sarah" or claiming they worked together, downvoting comments as Mods to hide The Truth, and discussing ways to ban users.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now you are adding flairs to users who you have Exposed you as Liars. Either you are Corrupt, or Evil, or Absolutely Ignorant.

              None of you can answer the questions we have posed in recent days since you launched these attacks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of these are easy questions if you have been paying attention.

             <p>
              Is it possible that none of you really know much of anything and have been caught up in too many lies and school plays?
             </p>
             <p>
              The newest strategy is to add labels, call for backup and make sure to get 4 downvotes to hide anyone who exposes them and shares The Truth, ignore all questions and comments they cannot Dispute, and attack those who they can bully and threaten.

              WE EXPOSED ALL OF YOU, AND YOU ARE DESPERATE TO HIDE AND SILENCE THE TRUTH.

              We know many people involved directly, including Jenny Moore. She will always be a Good person.

              Do any of you realize what is really at stake and how dangerous this is?

              If you are NOT Corrupt or Evil, this is your Opportunity to FIX THIS AND UNITE WITH THE TRUTH.

                 Maybe you just have horrible timing.  I'm done putting up with it for the time being, and had you done this before the Jem incident, I wouldn't have been around to care, most likely.  The other mods are MUCH nicer than I am, and would shrug off your accusations and attacks for quite some time before pinging me to weigh in; that's when shit hits the fan for you disgusting shill fucks.

                 An apology is not just "Sorry."  That's a petulant child's attempt at
                 <em>
                  not
                 </em>
                 properly apologizing, and it certainly shows no remorse or even an ounce of giving a fuck one way or the other, so I'm not moving the goalposts at all.  I didn't want "Sorry." I wanted an apology.  Even Jewgle has a decent bead on what an apology is:

              for finally solidifying the pattern of it as a likely COINTEL playbook tactic that is used by shills to make them sound human.  I don't think the rate at which this tactic is employed

               Crensch, I don't know you. It's only in the last few days you've pinged me, which is interesting because I've never interacted with you on pizzagate.  And you've pinged me to call me a 'cunt' and tell me you're going to destroy me, without knowing me at all.

                I can honestly say you live in a bubble, and have not seen what I have seen.  Many of the "good people" users here are

                <em>

            Happy middle ground suggestion:
           </p>
           <p>
            This idea is MUCH more democratic, thus more "abuse proof" and promotes trust and bonding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Put it up to a vote by the users themselves BEFORE putting up the user flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            We could use this system for nominating users for a positive flair. Only in this case, its the USERS themselves who nominate X user, then BOTH the users and the mods would vote before putting it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mods job in this proposed system would be to nominate X user for the flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's put this suggestion to the test with our first targets: pieces of shit that EVERYONE here hates. Auralsects (make a "Sand Nigger Shill" flair for him), AWS (make a (((Shill))) flair for him), and DeathToMasonsASAP (make a "Blackpill Shill" flair for him).

            The comments below were posted on Vindicator's other related post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that it was Vindicator who banned Jem777.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that Jem777 was Jenny Moore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that Jenny Moore was threatened, slandered, doxxed, attacked, and Murdered for The Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that the mods orchestrated hit pieces on Jenny Moore after she died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that the mods Betrayed Jenny Moore just as Judas Betrayed Jesus Christ.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that the mods worked together to downvote, lie, make false accusations, and attack ANYONE who stood up for Jenny Moore and The Truth.

            Read the exchanges on these posts and be sure to see the ones the comments they were so desperate to Hide.

            We knew Jenny Moore directly.

            We know George Sweigart.

            We know more than all of you combined.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why can none of the mods answer any of the questions posed to them recently including some in the comments below?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The Truth should not be Banned. The Truth cannot be Disputed. The Truth will Never Go Away.

             Why can't anyone here answer the questions posed over recent weeks?

             Are you still going to argue that Jenny is still alive?

             Are you still going to argue that Jenny is a CIA disinformation agent?

             Are you still going to argue that Jenny was not murdered?

             We ask questions to find out who really wants to know The Truth.

            <p>
             We ask questions to find out who actually knows The Truth, and who pretends to.

            <p>
             We ask questions to expose those who LIE and DECEIVE.

             We asked Jenny Moore many questions directly.
            </p>
            <p>
             She answered them honestly, and some she did not know, but did not pretend to either.
            </p>
            <p>
             In basic terms, she found The Truth, and she gave her life for The Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why are those who Betrayed Jenny Moore so desperately afraid of The Truth that Jenny knew?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did the hit piece created by those who Betrayed her garner over 750 comments? What were they ones they were most worried about hiding?
            </p>
            <p>
             Who were George's exes, employers, and deep contacts?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why are so many including all of the mods here ganging up to attack and slander Jenny Moore and call her names that no one should ever be called? Why are they lying, attacking, downvoting, calling for backup, slandering and threatening any who stand up for Jenny Moore and The Truth? Why was a special tag created by corrupt mods to falsely label those who defended Jenny Moore as disinfo agents? What were the mods accused of by those they falsely labeled?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why were the mods spreading lies, falsely accusing users of being other people, and portraying themselves as victims?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why was Jenny Moore not the only one who was threatened, doxxed, attacked and murdered for The Truth?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did Jenny think of Defango, Unirock, Lift the Veil, Jason Goodman, Trish Negron, and George Sweigart and some of the other characters involved?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did Jenny know that none of them knew? What did Jenny believe that none of them believed?
            </p>
            <p>
             What was Jenny's focus? Who did she meet with? What was her end game?
            </p>
            <p>
             Who were George's exes, employers, and deep contacts?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did she say about the Clintons? What did she say about Donald Trump? What did she say about Agenda 21 and Sustainability?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did she say about 5G artificial intelligence, and how it connects to child trafficking, corruption, abuse and tyranny?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did she say about Paul Ryan, John McCain, Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Podestas, Emanuels, Ashton Kutcher and some of the others intimately involved?
            </p>
            <p>
             What did she know about secret societies, corruption, blackmail, public-private partnerships, and fake religions?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is SoberSecondThought so interested?
            </p>
            <p>
             What does he know about Lies, Threats, Murder?
            </p>
            <p>
             Q has told you some Truth, but so have Defango, George Sweigart, and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             When will ANY OF THEM finally reveal The REAL Truth?

            I don't post much here, so I don't expect anybody to give this much credence.  I do, however, encounter this behavior quite often while fighting the good fight offline.

            You need to ban these users.  They are purposefully tampering with your jury pool and you must take back your control.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're here to sow the seeds of doubt.  They're here to make you question your belief systems, your integrity, your intelligence, your rationale, your logic, your capabilities, and your foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            You feel the need to defend yourselves, and that response was triggered, calculated, planned, and expected.  Walk away.  Anything less and you're feeding into the psycho-social game being played here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that you're unsure of yourselves and pondering a solution is an excellent example of how they operate.  You know what to do.

              Its your ballgame. Your aptitude and understanding for the duality of the occult world will determine the results. I truly believe, that you believe, in free speech and that you are attempting to uphold the Voat Spirit and uphold free speech.

            I think flairs and bans is a good idea. Also an effective combo. Anything making it easier for new users is always a good thing in my mind.

             So yeah, you're definitely paid to be here.  Why else would anyone act like such a pillock in posts full of info outing pedos?  Unless..... omg, dude, are you a pedo?!

              Being over the target is nonsense language designed to stop critical thinking and to increase motivated reasoning.   It's very good brainwashing.
              <em>
               Someone's criticizing me, therefore I must be right.
              </em>
              .  It's very effective because that's our natural instinct.

              I am not paid to be here and since the forums I go to are dedicated to silly all encompassing conspiracy theories it prevents them from doing anything actually useful again pedophiles.   They prefer their witchhunt and to attack democracy itself and the rule of law in their withchhunt.  These are objectionable in and of themselves to my non pedo self.  The idea that people who disagree with you are corrupt is a hallmark of cults and conspiracy theories.

              Are you using that as a way of avoiding thinking? Of avoiding engaging in discussion?

              I just read your post on Gothamgirl.  DRA-MA.   I still lead towards mental health issues.

              As a critic and skeptic on here,  I'm seeing this with a bit of distance.   From where I am  sitting,  this seems like the fights of true believers.  Ever notice how religions and cults end up in schisms?  Like minded people all of a sudden have an irredeemable split?  It happens all through human history.

              There's a certain baseline of paranoia on these boards to begin with.   It's not unusual on here to believe multiple ancient global conspiracies connect every scandal in the modern world.  And in fact you can trace these scandals back to the ancient conspiracies in an unbroken line of succession.  That attracts a certain kind of thinker.  Paranoids lash out when challenged.  Even close friends can become ONE of them.  If this is a place that feels like home to them, crticism from someone close to them would sting much more than criticism from an outsider or a normie.

                 First, a couple of paragraphs is not "insanely long," and second, what is it with you people and pretending not to remember things? Does that work in the courtroom? "Your Honor, I don't recall anything about murder charges against my client. Weren't we discussing a parking ticket?" So lame!
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're a lawyer working for the Clintons, maybe paid by the Clinton Foundation, or maybe out of some other pot of money. It's not rocket science, just fairly elementary listening skills. When you confine yourself to short, witty retorts you could be mistaken for a public-spirited skeptic trying to calm down a paranoid conspiracy-fest (which of course Voat is, much of the time). But when you argue anything more complicated, then both because of the subject matter you get most engaged by, and because of how you approach it, you sound uncannily like a lawyer assigned to refute allegations against your client.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've said this before: It's not the crime itself, but the cover-up that generally causes the most problems. If you came and went erratically, if you got pissed off and emotionally engaged in what you were writing, or if you had ever offered a credible alternative motivation for the hours you put in, I might believe you were just one more guy arguing with strangers on the Internet. But you're (a) relentlessly professional and (b) always here. That kind of dispassionate attention to detail bills out at a substantial hourly rate.

                  Your theory was wrong, struck me as bizarre and I forgot about it.  I don't focus on people's screen names too much unless you're one of the handful whose personalities I got to know.....usually if they got personal with me     Frankly, I confuse you with another user.  Your theory is still bizarre and wrong the second time around.   Have you heard? I'm some guy named Kamil on Medium.

                It's completely plausible that Jem was mentally ill and being manipulated by handlers to cause chaos and fear here.

                as a long, multi-account history of attempting to ((( Correct the Record ))) here, often with partial information used as "evidence". The Jem disruption forum attack would not have been possible without his weird provocative comments to her 10 months ago which she took as death threats, then repeatedly referenced to other users as "evidence" that mods were corrupt and not to be trusted.
               </p>
               <p>
                That drama then lay dormant like a land mine until two weeks ago when George Webb, who has admitted to being Mossad, claimed she died in a DC hotel. The news posted here triggered a chorus of "AWS murdered Jem" with threats to dox him. Throughout that mess, AWS made several odd requests of mods -- to post and sticky a thread for him so he could respond, since his CCP is too low to make submissions (we did not), as well as DMs to me suggesting mods were opening Voat to legal liability.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is still not clear to me what is going on, but I think it wise to consider the possibility AWS played an active role in helping instigate the forum disruption while wearing the victim mantle. He may well be telling the truth when he says he
                <em>
                 knows
                </em>
                Jem had mental health issues.

                 Are we sure seems like a correct the record person or someone with insider knowledge he kind of reminds me of Kamil Beylant actually.
I really don't think George Webb is Mossad but I think he might be FBI. one of his recent videos he explained that he claimed to be mossad very short term as a way to get mossad people to talk to him. Seems like an FBI kind of thing to do not saying I trust the FBI at all

                 George Webb is a goof.  (Took me about 45 seconds.)  EDIT:  Wow you bring up Webb in your theory.  Is DarkMath still around? Go ask him my thoughts on Webb.  I was first introduced to Webb because folks on the PG board got all hepped about him.  I visiting his channel and found he was making a completely bonkers claim Eric Braverman was missing because he hadn't posted on twitter.  The PG forum used on wait with baited breath for his videos like people do for Q drops these days.  Took them many, many months to sour on Webb.

                 The pizzagate list of "code words" is fake and didn't exist prior to Podesta's emails coming out.

                <p>
                 True Pundit is fake, his specific report on the Weiner laptop a straight out hoax.  A hoax that had been circulating for several days before his report.

                 The Jeffrey Dahmer case has nothing to do with Pizzagate, nothing to do with Louis Bourgeois, her Arches series was started before Dahmer was arrested and she discussed her actual imitation many times.

                 The claim that Hillary Clinton had a long interest in Laura Silsby is false and is based on a document a State Department employee found on the website of Silsby's church after she was arrested.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The claim the Bill Clinton intervened diplomatically is contradicted by the contemporaneous records AND the newspaper that made the claim, dropped it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The claim that Alefantis can be connected to Silsby is false and relies on the word of her fake conman convict lawyer and there's no evidence whatsoever she went to an orphanage connected to Alefantis's friend Max Maccoby.  And there's plenty of evidence of which orphanages she actually did go to.

                 Voat has a button to report  "Content contains or links to content that is illegal." It seemed to me that Voat was not enforcing this.

                 Given the false claims that I was a murderer, given that this claims found their way onto Reddit and YouTube, the calls to dox me and worse, had shit spiraled out of control, yes, I could see legal liability for leaving these false claims up.  I'm not a lawyer and don't know how that would play out, but if my personal IRL life got affected by some joke on an internet board I would want my day in court.*

                  Libel requires a real person be damaged, AWS, as I'm sure you are well aware. How can an anonymous online persona completely unconnected to your real life identity, livelihood, and social network be libeled? Also, it's in the Voat User Agreement that users may not profit in any way from Voat; therefore there is no material damage that could be claimed.

                   Because as you just pointed out..   "AWS, Aas I'm sure you're aware"....I'm not completely anonymous.  I have a consistent pseudonyms  and I'm pretty sure courts have held, you can libel a pseudonymous person.....

                   Well Vindicator, as you definitely aware, there were calls to dox me on the same page as the libel.  That would tend to kick things up a notch and there were active doxing attempts.   I was accussed of being a specific criminal on some fully anonymous part of Voat.

                   A thread seemed reasonable to me.  Especially if I needed on link to point to to non Voat users as this did spread beyond Voat.  And I did ask regular users who had questions to start a thread.

                  <p>
                   That point on the user agreement just seems weird.  I'm not profiting from Voat.  Recovering damages is not profiting.    Also it would be up to the court to determine if Voat contributed to the damages.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   After looking into it, I think the law protecting website's from the illegal content of written by their users is the stronger shield, but in this case we had a combination of factors, the libel, the call to reveal my identity meaning the libel would be connected to my real life identity and livelihood and the calls for revenge.  Given that we had these combination of factors, and Voat's moderators were aware of them, would Voat still be protected?   I don't know the answer to that.   Also if things did get out hand, I would probably need to subpoena IPs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Voat and you did eventually step in about the doxing which I do appreciate, but that was a bit delayed.  The first thread still has a post saying I was involved in her death call to hack me. And my guess is that delay was because it involved me and because this crew had "worked over" the refs before.

                    You need only ten CCP to submit a post on Voat, using an alt. It would have been easy to accrue these points in no time, and do a post yourself.

                  It is still not clear to me what is going on, but I think it wise to consider the possibility AWS played an active role in helping instigate the forum disruption while wearing the victim mantle.

                 Yep. And strangely enough, the RIPJem shill that showed up accused us mods of helping AWS IIRC (which we didn't) - so I think he might well be connected to this group of shills / trolls.

                I was refuting an argument she made and she went off the rails and claimed I threatened her with death.
               </p>
               <p>
                It escalated so fast, it took me complete surprise.  My criticism and mocking of her was a threat to her ego, no different from a threat on her life.
               </p>
               <p>
                I personally think the stories she told were lies, -like being in witness protection, but she believed them.

                 Your "death threat" is a hallmark of the same type of threatening behavior anyone with your level of experience would use. Smart enough to skirt the law on technicalities. Not really coming off as innocuous there.

            It should be noted that there are many creative ways that username flares could be deployed, including some positive ones like a gold star or something for people's favorite researchers. People should think about this and share any ideas they have.

             As I said elsewhere, I don't think we should flair users. I don't want to give the impression that mods decide who is a 'good' user, and who is a 'bad' user.
            </p>
            <p>
             People like Donkey are hated by almost anybody here anyway, and most people have figured out that DeathToMasonsASAP is a troll, who has been attacking the sub from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
             And other users are highly respected anyway, with or without 'gold stars'.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't want to see the sub turning into a 'who-get's-the-prize-for-best-essay' site, and I don't want users here being afraid that they might be labelled 'shill', only for disagreeing with mods or other users.
            </p>
            <p>
             People here are more sensitive than on other Voat subs. Many who come here, or read as lurkers, are survivors. I would like to see them feeling as comfortable as possible, and the constant fear of getting labelled would lead to them being afraid to speak their minds imo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I don't want to see the - perceived - gap between mods and users who are not modding getting deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
             We should continue with our ban policy as usual. Bans are given only for violating the rules, not for comments (except for spam, doxxing or posting incriminating material). Imo this should stay this way.

              where are you on this now? Seems like the other users are slightly against it overall, and that's not including the
              <abbr title="Well, the ones I know, anyway.">
               known shitstirrers
              </abbr>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm more or less ambivalent, and would probably lean towards not using them if I had to choose.
             </p>
             <p>
              Introducing the flairs is a great way to add extra variables to this shitstorm equation, and multiple vectors of attack for the shills.  I LIKE the idea in an idealistic kind of way, but the reality is that it will very likely be used against us.
             </p>
             <p>
              I introduced an alternative to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Piscina">
               @Piscina

               here
              </a>
              , and
              <em>
               anyone
              </em>
              can call out a username like that.  Maybe some of the other users will take up that particular baton and help out when they see one of them posting.
             </p>
             <p>
              As of this comment, removing all the flairs currently in effect.  Will reinstate if the discussion takes that kind of turn.

              I really like the flair idea and would have blindly accepted its implementation until I read this comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              You make a good point and I don't think it would be that much of a stretch to assume that the same users claiming the mods are bad/shills/agents/etc would also claim that the mods use flairs as another form of censorship or misdirection etc. Furthermore, it does actually open up an avenue for control with malicious intent—operating under the assumption that everyone can be compromised, that is.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I do think it would be funny to see some big red warnings over the incredibly irritating trolls.

             I don't know if we should highlight the prominent researchers. I have always thought that pizzagate is more about what is said than who said it. I don't want pizzagate to be like regular news media where people think, "CBS said it so it must be true." I don't even want it to be like many conservative circles where people pick their favorite talking head (Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, Lauren Southern, etc) and defend them against other conservative criticism no matter what. I want users to have about the same level of critical thinking and skepticism on a post made by a new user as on a post made by someone who has been here since the beginning. Look, I know if you flaired popular researchers, I may be included as one of the good guys. However, I have had to retract stories in the past. See
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2594197">
              here

             and

              here
             </a>
             . I don't want people to blindly believe what I say if I am wrong. Also, I don't want my previous mistakes to taint other's opinions when I do get it right.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Had to change one of my retraction links. I guess that is an example of what I was referring to above.

              One reason the flairs are being considered is because of the Jem777 thing. For some reason, no one seemed to remember the comments I made numerous times before, during and after I had to ban her exposing the lies she was telling and suspicious behavior she was exhibiting. A flare for that kind of thing next to her username while it would have been met with anger, would at least have allowed us to have a conversation that critically examined the situation. Instead, everyone forgot about it and she went on and on and on off platform apparently fooling Robyn Gritz and a lot of other people. We still don't know what is really going on with Jem. The flares would trigger more critical discussion of suspicious contributions and help prevent sleeper shills from taking people for a ride.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, depending on how it's used, this could increase the controversy and drama here and have a chilling effect on research. That's why we need to discuss it.

                i understand the reasoning for adding the user flairs and was at first glance supportive of it.  but after some thought and reading some of the objections here, i'd like to go on record to say that I also am against the flairs.  i feel the negatives (creating drama/chilling effect on research) would outweigh the positives.

              not particularly tasteful. i know im a mouthy cunt but you dont often see me having standing rows with anyone about anything important.
             </p>
             <p>
              im more inclined to just tell someone to suck a cock and get on with life afterwards. some people would have seen me spit the dummy at them one day and have a laugh with them the next. im not bipolar, i just dont give a shit whether someone likes me or not and i take each comment or post as it comes do as i feel accordingly, sometimes a quick fire piss take comment, sometimes an in depth commentary.

               But will it alert normie users to subversive types that would otherwise draw them in and mislead them?
              </p>
              <p>
               The alternative is banning, and just banning anyone that exhibits the behavioural patterns of the offender.  That's how it was dealt with before.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bottom line:  Something needs to be done, or this place will get hammered by sliding and misleading shills until it is completely useless.

             Wonder where she came up with the name Gothamgirl. It sounds Elsagatey.

               well that was "fun." Yes, those comments were from me. But the thought of someone wanting to impersonate me for Voat points was kind of a new concept.

                 Over the past couple of days I had 3 or 4. QTard  &amp; IWorshipQAnon, aimeejamey from this phone due to new account comment limits. I'm not recalling the name of the one or two I made on hubby's laptop but I don't know why it didn't save the passwords.  Now that I have my laptop charger and access back to using my own computer I have access to my main account. 
I used to have only one account. amyrebeccajames. I got banned right off the bat by Millenial Falcon for "spam" when I posted about PP &amp; baby parts. From there I created a new one,  it was Shillary GregChism and then AmyJames for a while until finally wiping my hard drive due to over 30 malware apps and many viruses.

                 Honestly after all the bullshit I've gone through over Pizzagate your comments pale in comparison. Guess you are having a bad month but whatever. Have a great weekend. after all JOHN MCCAIN IS DEAD. DING DONG.

                I did not attack EYJP for misunderstanding things. I questioned a shitty comment she made and pointed out she might be misunderstanding things as she has done in the past.

                If this is really you, I suggest you stick to a single username. We have a botnet going around spamming comments, making snarky-named alts attacking mods and other users, including making death threats. If you don't want to be lumped in with that group, get your shit together with your password.

                 ! No, it's me I'm not a bot. Also I should have my charger tomorrow and I will never use my husband's laptop again. also if I was trying to farm CCP I would probably spend more time on those accounts and remember my passwords, but I don't even know what any of them are at this point unless the browser remembers the password for me, which it doesn't seem to be doing, on his laptop anyway. So you don't remember anything about me complaining about Gothamgirl to you?  When I get my charger back I'm going to go see if it's in my f you John podesta account. I'm afraid it might still be on the Greg Chism account or maybe a former account. But it was in a private message maybe you can find it yourself. I realize some of the mods here don't like me and that's fine I just don't want to end up with one of those stupid flares because I'm not a disinformation shill. I don't know what it would take to prove it to you guys anyway but most of you guys are Anonymous on here whereas I'm the only one I know who uses her real name all the time on here. It seems like I'm getting hate because I don't like Q
