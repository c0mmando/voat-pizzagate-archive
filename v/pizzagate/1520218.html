Another Grameen chaired position by Yunus was Grameen Research, which donated $25K- $50K. </p>
<p>Yunus first met with Clinton in 2009 and six months later USAID partnered with Grameen Foundation run by Yunus, thereby, giving Grameen a $162 million commitment to extend micro-financing concept abroad.  USAID began to provide loans and grants to Grameen. </p>
<p>By Sept. 2009, Yunus started complaining to Clinton\'s top aides about poor treatment by Bangladesh\'s govt.  His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian govt. aid money.  A charge Norway later dismissed as baseless.   (Interesting to find out back story on this.) By mid-May 2011, the Bangladesh govt forced Yunus to step down from the bank\'s board. </p>
<p>Clinton met with Yunus in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka in May 2012. Clinton came after Bangladesh authorities moved to seize control of Grameen Bank\'s effforts to find new leaders.  Clinton warned Bangladesh government at a townhall meeting, &quot;we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in operations of Grameen Bank.&quot;</p>
<p>I believe there is a lot more to this Norway story with Yunus and Clinton. She obviously believed the bank needed to continue without Bangladesh\'s input on picking its new leaders. If people are looking for something to research this would be great lead to look at. Remember FBIAnon said to look at Yunus.</p>

            These damn people. I understand that it's nice to have money and think you are a baller. But why do they have to hit children and suck the blood from the poorest of the poor?
