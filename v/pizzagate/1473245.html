I would say that at this point I\'m pretty convinced something weird is going on and that it <em>is</em> connected to occultism and pedophilia, but I remain somewhat skeptical about <em>some</em> of the evidence that people are citing. If this thing is real then it\'s vitally important that it is revealed and stopped, but if that\'s going to happen (if it\'s true), I think it\'s also vitally important that those investigating this issue try themselves to debunk or eliminate any apparent evidence that doesn\'t truly belong within that larger growing body of circumstantial evidence ... or that may at least have a better, more likely and less sinister explanation.</p>
<p>For example, I\'ve seen several people draw a lot of attention to the Instagram pics showing digging / construction in a basement. They have floated the idea that Alefantis and friends are trying to connect the pizza restaurant\'s basement to underground tunnels in D.C. Perhaps, but does this really seem likely?</p>
<p>I just want to put on my Devil\'s-Advocate hat here for a second. If they were trying to do that, and for the nefarious purpose of trafficking children, is it really likely that they\'d post pictures of the work on Instagram? It kinda looks like they\'re breaking up the foundation to possibly deal with some plumbing issues (though I have no idea). If this is in the basement of one of these restaurants, then given their apparent size based on photos of the exteriors, it does look like a door is there to another unit, but that door doesn\'t exactly look makeshift given the clean edges and supports. Now, if this is one of the restaurants, like say Buck\'s, and Comet is through that door, and if we were to assume that they made the door, there could be a legitimate reason for connecting them, given that Alefantis\' apparently owns both places. Also, with regard to his claim that Comet Ping Pong doesn\'t have a basement, some have pointed to a previous interview where he says that they store a bunch of organic tomatoes for pizza sauce in &quot;the basement&quot;, which makes it seems like Alefantis is lying about this, but I\'ve seen someone else post a different article on the same subject where it says that the tomatoes are stored in the basement of Buck\'s, not Comet Ping Pong. This seems like a bit of a double-edged sword. If Alefantis is storing tomatoes/sauce and other produce for Comet in the basement of Buck\'s then that would offer a legitimate reason why he might want to join the units, but it means he was lying about Comet not having a basement. Of course, in my opinion, the fact that the restaurant he owns next door has a basement makes his denial of a basement at Comet entirely disingenuous, even if true. Who cares if Comet doesn\'t have a basement if his other restaurant next door does?</p>
<p>The other big question here, though, is whether or not this is one of the restaurants at all? Do we have much of a reason to think so other than the &quot;overtime&quot; comment? Someone else in the comments asked where the picture was taken. A friend commenting on Alefantis\' Instagram page might be likely to recognize the location if it was Comet or Buck\'s. Also, the complete lack of any stored produce makes me think this is probably not Bucks (according to the article they were storing <em>tons</em> of it down there).</p>
<p>If it is not Buck\'s or Comet, this opens up a couple other possibilities. Could it be Besta Pizza, which that pizzaunderground video posted earlier (whatever else might be said about its merits ... or lack thereof) shows exists? If so, that would seem to show a close connection between Alefantis and Besta (it would seem odd for him to be around for that kind of work if the relationship was casual). Another possibility is that it is a completely different and unknown location. If that is the case, then it makes more sense that it might be posted as a message to those \'in the know\' even if it was for nefarious purposes ... because documenting secret construction work for an easily discerned location on a public site would seem pretty stupid. But then I come back to the fact that it just doesn\'t look that nefarious to me. It doesn\'t really look like tunnels, per se, unless it is for people to crawl around in ... though I guess one could argue that they\'d be a pretty good size for children, which is a disturbing thought. But I see no indication that they would be for the purpose of connecting to preexisting tunnels. If someone were trying to do that then it seems more likely they\'d take the manhole approach and create a single hole with a ladder. In that sense, I\'d say that this pic seems more consistent with that theory: <a href="https://archive.is/LAWVh">https://archive.is/LAWVh</a> .  Of course, someone commented there saying, &quot;mine has been filled in for quite some time now.&quot; So does this suggest that this person commenting is also digging some tunnel to connect with other tunnels? If so, why would he &quot;fill it in&quot;? Maybe there\'s a good answer to this, but at the moment it seems to me that this digging is probably a lot more mundane than current theories seem to be suggesting.</p>
<p>Moving on from those &quot;tunnel&quot; pics, I\'ve seen another pic of some metal room where I believe someone commented with &quot;#murder&quot; or possibly &quot;#killroom&quot; or something like that. Some have speculated that this is supposed to be some kind of dungeon. My first thought on seeing the pic was that it was intended to hold produce and possibly be used as cold-storage. I worked at a restaurant for a while a couple years ago and I think the cold storage seemed similar, but I haven\'t had a chance to look at the pic closely again. What I do recall is that someone commented on the pic with &quot;#wwdjd&quot;, and Alefantis responded with with &quot;Good question&quot;. When someone on youtube asked what this stood for when they saw the comment in a video, someone else responded by saying it stood for &quot;What Would Disappointed Jesus Do?&quot;, seemingly seriously. This is incorrect. It actually stands for &quot;What Would Donald Judd Do?&quot; (or that\'s the most likely meaning given the picture). Donald Judd was a minimalist artist. He did simple and clean designs and objects featured in open empty spaces (do a google image search for his name). This again is a bit of a two-edged sword, particularly in Alefantis saying, &quot;good question&quot;, because if he\'s to be taken seriously then it suggests that room really was intended for some kind of personal use where aesthetics would be important rather than something as simple as a storage room, and given his propensity for displaying and hosting modern art that seems to have a theme of pedophilia and/or child murder, that again is troubling, since it doesn\'t exactly seem like a normal room one would set up for relaxation time. But, honestly, seeing this room as part of the pizzagate affair seems to me like the result of confirmation bias. It\'s possible of course, but it seems like a less likely interpretation and seems more likely to discredit the investigation than help it or convince people.</p>
<p>Personally, when it comes to the Instagram pics, I think it\'s more important to focus on the pics that seem to have a clear message of pedophilia (like the man holding the baby while wearing the yellow beads and the comment of &quot;#chickenlover&quot;), or the ones that have a dark implication of that when taken in the larger context of this whole affair (like the young girl with her hands taped to the table). I think it should also be kept in mind that it doesn\'t actually matter at all if that girl with the taped hands is totally fine, can be identified and if nothing bad ever happened to her, because <em>if</em> something is going on here, I think a picture like that would be much better understood as a wink to those in the know rather than as some kind of document of someone who was abused ... which would be really dumb of them. I also think it\'s worth noting that in the pic of the bathroom &quot;art&quot; with a man ejaculating on the ping pong table and the words &quot;shut up and f@#k&quot;, it looks like it was liked by the official Comet Ping Pong account, which seems exceedingly odd to me and speaks to the mentality and atmosphere of the establishment. I can\'t imagine any restaurant I\'ve gone to \'liking\' a social media picture of that kind of graffiti in their restrooms. I also think focus is best placed on the kind of art they display / have displayed in the restaurant and the kind of acts they host there, which seem to traffic in occultism and make jokes about pedophilia and post-birth abortions. These things all seem to have a common theme, which reasonably and objectively suggests something about the mental state and inclinations of the management. It also seems to me that maybe a little more focus should be put on Besta Pizza and the other places that seem to be displaying pedo logos more blatantly and prominently than Comet (the ping-pong paddles are a bit of a stretch, or at least would seem like more of a stretch were it not for the &quot;Play - Eat - Drink&quot; [i.e. PED] tag across them).</p>
<p>Anyway, those are just random thoughts from me as a person who is somewhat skeptical (though open-minded) about some of these current theories while being pretty convinced that this whole thing is true in its broad strokes, particularly with respect to Podesta\'s involvement and the strange content of some of his emails.</p>',

           Alright, so this is my first post here. I've been following this issue off and on since it started, mainly on youtube but partly here. I would say that at this point I'm pretty convinced something weird is going on and that it
           <em>

           connected to occultism and pedophilia, but I remain somewhat skeptical about
           <em>
            some
           </em>
           of the evidence that people are citing. If this thing is real then it's vitally important that it is revealed and stopped, but if that's going to happen (if it's true), I think it's also vitally important that those investigating this issue try themselves to debunk or eliminate any apparent evidence that doesn't truly belong within that larger growing body of circumstantial evidence ... or that may at least have a better, more likely and less sinister explanation.

            Perhaps. Or perhaps they were just joking because it was an empty metal room at the time the pic was taken and shows like Dexter and Criminal Minds are part of the public consciousness. Did the person who made the comment even work at the restaurant or is there any reason to think they might be involved in this whole affair apart from that specific comment? I can't recall. I mean you could be totally right, but given the nature of this thing and the potential for totally justified outrage
            <em>
             if it's true
            </em>
            , I think we need to be
            <strong>
             <em>
              very
             </em>
            </strong>
            careful about confirmation bias. The mere fact that some picture or comment
            <em>
             can
            </em>
            be interpreted in a way that is consistent with this pedophile ring idea doesn't mean that it really
            <em>
             should
            </em>
            be interpreted that way. It's very easy to start interpreting anything and everything as supporting something we already believe to be true, so the more we believe it to be true the more judicious and skeptical we should try to be in deciding what truly counts as legitimate evidence. I would say that a good rule of thumb is to ask if some other mundane explanation for a given fact is plausible. If it is, it's in the best interests of this community to accept the mundane explanation and set the fact aside until/unless some other fact(s) cause us to reevaluate the plausibility of that explanation. This will keep people focused on the strongest evidence and show anyone following along that the community of researchers are not quick to accept as evidence just anything and everything they can possibly find that can even remotely be made consistent with the theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, even with the Besta Pizza logo being essentially identical to the Boy Lovers logo shown by the FBI, if that fact stood all on it's own, the most plausible explanation would be that it was an unfortunate accident. But that explanation becomes MUCH less plausible when a number of other establishments in close proximity all seem to have other pedophile logos and when some or all of them can be connected in some way to Clinton and Podesta given the content of Podesta's emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise, when the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center, the most plausible explanation was that some horrific accident had taken place. When the second one hit that explanation ceased to be plausible.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is conceivable that some future fact will come to light that makes that metal room and the associated comment seem like a legitimate piece of evidence, but as it stands right now, at least from everything I've seen, it's a distraction and best set aside for the time being.

             I'm not sure whether or not it was definitely the same thing, but someone showed a picture of what was supposedly that same "child sized coffin" from a different angle and it was actually a coffee table of some sort, not a coffin at all. As I recall, the pictures of what appear to be a small coffin are all from directly above with what appears to be a closed lid, which only gives a two dimensional shape/perspective. The other picture is from the side or kind a 3/4 angle and shows that it just has metal legs ... again, assuming it really is the same thing.

              I have read it before.  If you'll notice, though, the definition of abortion did
              <strong>

               I agree. I only used the term because in the clip I heard from the show at Comet Ping Pong the person seemed to be joking about killing a baby immediately after birth and even before the cord had been cut. The term "infanticide" could refer to killing a child of pretty much any age.

                 Yeah, as I recall the cord was mentioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for "infanticide" only referring to the murder of a baby within the first year, I saw one definition that stated that, but most definitions don't seem so strict:
                 <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infanticide">
                  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/infanticide
                 </a>
                 . That meaning is suggested in the legal definition but the medical definition seems significantly more broad.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In any case, at this point we're
                 <em>
                  literally
                 </em>
                 just arguing over sematics :)  I think it's clear now what I was referring to when I mentioned "post-birth abortion" while we agree that such a thing has not actually be folded into the meaning of "abortion".
