            Another editorial by Lotsof, defending a Native American man, who - due to an unfortunate upbringing, and his aversion (
            <em>
             allergy
            </em>
            ) to
            <strong>
             working
            </strong>
            - is homeless, jobless, and living in the streets. Because this man has had
            <strong>
             multiple arrests for urinating in public
            </strong>
            , he's also been charged with
            <strong>
             multiple offenses of indecent exposure, which will likely require him to register as a sex offender.

           </p>
           <p>
            The reason I've linked THIS editorial is to show how Lotsof uses this story as another opportunity to refer to
            <strong>
             (whitewash) child pornography

             <em>
              Let’s ask some questions: Why do we have a law that makes a person a sex offender if he really isn’t a sex offender? ... Why do our laws prescribe terrible penalties for any crime that has even a

              I have been reading some of the comments on your listener's survey. I think you should be able to sell a boat load of advertising to area psychologists and psychiatrists. It appears that there is quite a client base here in Benson for them.

              One big question, why do all of your editorials have to be negative? You have the distinct privilege of being the only radio station in Benson. You are a big part of the community, whether you like it or not. ... Always being negative makes me wonder if you have a hidden agenda. By owing a media outlet you have the privilege of have a platform to express your views. This privilege comes with a great deal of responsibility.

              You are not going to like my comment but I think it needs to be said. I think with all the negative things that come out of your editorials and comments it is no wonder why many of the local businesses don't want to advertise with you. It is one thing to share your opinion and another thing to imply that everyone else is stupid if they don't agree with you. Your latest editorial tells the story. You got mad because SSVEC threatened to cut off your electricity because you didn't pay the bill. ... How many other businesses in the Benson area have you driven away?

                I'm concluding that the surname
                <strong>
                 Lotsof
                </strong>
                , if not fake, is certainly
                <strong>
                 RARE
                </strong>
                . Almost, but
                <strong>
                 NOT QUITE, as rare as THIS one
                </strong>
                :
               </p>

                  This guy is a lying sack, and a just sack of shit in general. I wouldn't doubt for a minute,  that

            So their excuse is they didn't know? For two years? And people need to complain before they stopped? Is that how it works? You do something that helps someone evade the law and it's only when people complain that there's a problem? What world are they living in?

             That's pretty lazy. “In many cases the penalties for possession of pictures is worse than the penalty for murder. You should understand your Internet service provider could report you to the police if they catch you looking at a website featuring naked juveniles. The police then enter your house and seize your computer,” the PSA said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “If you have such material, you can save yourself and your family a ton of grief and save the taxpayers of Arizona a lot of money by never storing such pictures on the hard drive of your computer. Always use an external drive and hide it where no one will ever find it. Likewise, never keep paper pictures, tapes or films of naked juveniles where anyone else can find them. A public service message from the CAVE 97.7 FM.”
