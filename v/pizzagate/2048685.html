<p>I didn\'t really mean to put this in but after looking at Haiti all morning and how so many companies and people were down there after the quake, they say they were there for philanthropy but nothing got done and the iHaitian kids...? Who knows what happened after the quake.
 I had seen some videos that break down language but, GLOBAL PROGRESS is this pedo groups message, at least the same wording. And Ben Silbermann CEO of pinterest,  had gone to the conference, I was looking at owners of the big photo stock companies, and who all went to haiti, like Mike Fischer at Alamy they gave  Haiti solar lamps after the quake. Getty stock photos are owned by the xarlysle group anyway..those stock photo companies, and their key words. Alamy uses a great big spiral very stragely in the center of pictures. Thats a weird message. Also, it seems like you could go deeper and deeper into some laborynthine order system. In the Alamy stock photo website I chose DREAD as my key word search after having searched CHILD and this image popped up. Though it says unhappy boy that was not the search. This childs eyes have heavy dark circles or rather bags.. <a href="https://ibb.co/fTdKra">https://ibb.co/fTdKra</a></p>

            I can't even get past the sad victim music !! They need to have interviews with REAL victims of these pedosatanist , homo manifesto creating, offspring of vipers, that they are! They blatantly take the rainbow that God put in the sky as a symbol to never ruin the earth and it's willingly sinfull inhabitants by global flood again ! It's like a slap in the face to God the way they wave that rainbow flag around ! 
Jesus didn’t encourage his followers to accept any and all lifestyles. Rather, he taught that the way to salvation is open to “everyone exercising faith in him.” (John 3:16) Exercising faith in Jesus includes conforming to God’s moral code, which forbids certain types of conduct—including homosexuality.—Romans 1:26, 27.
✔ 
Most people (including homosexuals) have some ethical code that causes them to deplore certain things perhaps fraud, injustice, or war. The Bible prohibits those behaviors, it also draws the line at certain types of sexual conduct, including homosexuality. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. Do I hate gays? No I hate their conduct . Why? Because God also hates their conduct . I listen to God not humans .

            These people are complete degenerates....   and that thrills them to no end.  I had to turn it off when they included 'zoophiles' in the groups they were advocating for.  Take one guess what that is.  Yup,  beastiality.   Where's PETA?
