<p>The project has been the subject of a stop work order since December, a spokesman for the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources told The Post.

<p>Epstein is building a complex of buildings on the island that include an amphitheater and an “underwater office &amp; pool,” the Virgin Islands Daily News Reports, which will all be linked by a private road.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure it was in the papers a couple of years ago that Great St. James was sold to Epstein, via local female realtor, by the Danish gentleman who owned it.

<p>[More about that in another post.. Let\'s get back to St. Thomas and USVI...]</p>
<p>So what about that Abi Beach Bar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[DPNR Investigating Abi Beach Bar Development](<a href="https://stthomassource">https://stthomassource</a>. com/content/2015/08/04/dpnr-investigating-abi-beach-bar-development/ </p>
<p>The V.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources is investigating reports made by concerned residents that permits issued to Sanctuary Holdings LLC in 2014 for the construction of Abi Beach Bar may have been violated. </p>
<p>The beach bar, located near Green Cay on the South Shore of St. Thomas, was accessible only by boat when it opened in January, but land access has recently been opened to the site. The area is also a nesting ground for endangered sea turtles.
DPNR media relations coordinator Jamal Nielsen said construction at Abi Beach Bar is now being investigated, but the department has not yet determined whether or not the business is in violation.</p>
<p>But a source close to DPNR said that Abi Beach Bar appears to have exceeded the amount of development permitted by the department’s Coastal Zone Management division. The source said that CZM approved only the pouring of concrete slabs on which the beach bar would place removable “cabanas” for shade, and also the placement of a mobile food truck and portable toilets.</p>
<p>A building permit posted at the Abi Beach Bar property lists approved construction of a “mobile bar/restroom/self-containing septic” at an approximate cost of $70,000. Development projects whose structures are valued at over $75,000 require a major CZM permit, which involves a public hearing. </p>
<p>Currently Abi Beach Bar has a permanent bar structure, a food truck, a shipping container gift shop, nonportable restrooms, a wooden concert stage, a volleyball net, rows of beach chairs, and three cleats on poured concrete for visiting boats to tie up to. Neighbors of the property have also reported substantial clearing and cutting of roads in the hillsides around the area.
Requests to view records made to DPNR’s permitting office had not been answered as of Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>...Residents of St. Thomas’s South Shore also expressed concern and confusion that some of the construction and clearing at Abi Beach Bar appears to match parts of a master plan for a major <strong>St. Thomas development called Sanctuary Cove</strong> posted on the website of Leisure and Recreation Concepts Inc., a Texas-based research, design, consulting and management company.
<strong>The five-phase project by LARC</strong> includes plans for a water park, a miniature golf course and an aquarium. The plans can be viewed at www.larcinc.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems the bar closed in November 2018... Now the only mention of Sanctuary Cove can be found on this page as a project listed for architect George Slavik <a href="http://www.larcinc">http://www.larcinc</a>. com/george-slavik2.html </p>

Neighbors of the property have also reported substantial clearing and cutting of roads in the hillsides around the area.
Requests to view records made to DPNR’s permitting office had not been answered as of Tuesday evening.

             A charity connected to convicted sex offender and Harvard donor Jeffrey E. Epstein gave tens of thousands of dollars to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 and a non-profit linked to a Harvard professor, according to tax filings obtained by The Crimson. .. Epstein served as president of a private foundation called Gratitude America, Ltd. in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gratitude America operates out of the United States Virgin Islands, where Epstein lists his permanent address. Its 2014 filings list Epstein as the president and Darren K. Indyke and Erika A. Kellerhals as the treasurer and secretary, respectively. Tax filings from 2015 to 2017 still list Indyke and Kellerhals as employees for the charity, but Richard Kahn replaces Epstein as president.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kahn and Indyke have also worked on the boards of previous charities tied to Epstein. In addition to being Epstein’s longtime lawyer, Indyke served as vice president of Epstein’s previous foundation, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation.
The Daily Beast first reported Epstein’s connections to Gratitude America in an April 16 article. The foundation has also donated to MIT, the Crohn’s Colitis Foundation of America, and Friends of Elton John, according to its tax filings.

              Herschend Family Entertainment (HFE) is a privately owned themed-entertainment company that operates several theme parks and tourist attractions within the United States.
Founded by Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Missouri, in its early years HFE was simply known as Herschend Enterprises. In the 1980s the name was changed to Silver Dollar City Inc., and in 2003 the company gained the current name. HFE is currently headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.
             </p>
             <p>
              HFE traces roots back to Hugo and Mary Herschend from Chicago, Illinois along with sons Jack and Pete. The family vacationed in Missouri’s Ozark Mountains region and fell in love with the nature the area offered. In 1951 Hugo obtained a 99-year lease on a Branson, Missouri area attraction called Marvel Cave.
             </p>
             <p>
              The company also co-owns and co-operates with partners Dolly Parton and her company The Dollywood Company, the dinner and theatre company Pirates Voyage Dinner and Show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina[1][2][3] and Dolly Parton's Stampede (formerly Dixie Stampede).

              He was said to have sponsored a Lebanese politician, Michael Aoun, whose party is in political coalition with Hezbollah, a terrorist organization. 
..Chagoury's trouble with American security officials began in 2010, when he was pulled off a private jet in Teterboro, New Jersey, and questioned by Homeland Security officials for four hours because his name was on the no-fly list within the United States, the report said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Later, he was said to have received a letter that said his name was taken off the list and he was then considered a ‘selectee,’ meaning he was allowed to fly, but would be subjected to extra scrutiny.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..As part of the benefit of Chagoury's donations to the Clintons, it was reported that last summer, US diplomats selected a 9.9-acre property at Eko Atlantic as the preferred site for a new Lagos consulate.

"But Alefantis, who turns 40 this year, has worked in restaurants since high school, including a stint in New York working at a Bobby Flay location. Prior to opening Buck’s, he had served two years as the general manager of Johnny’s Half Shell in Dupont Circle."
             </p>

               https://archive.is/OzwA6

              shows the following on their page, at bottom:
"213 4th Street East, 4th Floor #437 • St. Paul, MN 55101 • 617-559-1032 Copyright 2017 Care 2 Communities, formerly Containers 2 Clinics. All Rights Reserved."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Containers 2 Clinics (C2C) seeks to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality rates in the developing world by providing access to high-quality primary healthcare for women and children. We deploy shipping containers converted into clinics to areas with inadequate facilities and collaborate with local organizations and governments to provide clinical, laboratory, pharmacy, and health education services."
So the restaurant that Alefantis managed is linked to a maternal / child organization, that operates in Haiti and deals with shipping containers.

            <p>
             Family and friends will gather Nov. 9 aboard the sailing vessel Heavenly Days to celebrate the life of Andre Webber. He died at home on St. Thomas on Sept. 11 after battling brain cancer for three years. Webber was 54. ..Webber was a founding member of the V.I. Marine Economic Development Council and worked to ensure that marine tourism and commercial marine industries were an integral part of the community and could provide much needed job opportunities for the territory’s youth.
             <strong>
              He was a founding member of the Reef Ecology Foundation
             </strong>
             , an organization that advocated for preservation of St. Thomas’ reefs by placing recreational moorings in the waters surrounding the island.
            </p>
            <p>
             Webber was a dive master, boat captain and licensed submarine pilot. Over the years, he worked with numerous film projects and commercials shot in the Virgin Islands as a diver or grip.
             <strong>
              During one of these shoots he worked with magician David Copperfield, who then invited him to join his crew. Andre toured the world with Copperfield’s show for two years in the 1980s.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Born in New York, Webber moved to the Virgin Islands 34 years ago and began his marine career. He started as a deckhand with Armando Jenik on the M/V Goldilocks, a diver at Coral World and a diving supervisor at the University of the Virgin Islands.
Webber then moved to Atlantis Submarines as a submarine pilot, captain, diver and finally operations manager during the 1990s. He worked on the assembly of two submarines for the company.
            </p>
            <p>
             For many years, Webber was also a boat captain and diving instructor at St. Thomas Diving Club, a business he would come to own in 2008.  Webber served on various government committees on fisheries and marine industry economic activities.
