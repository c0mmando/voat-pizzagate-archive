<blockquote>
<p>These people knew too much about the <strong>drug deals and financial dealings</strong> at the Rose Law Firm where Hillary Clinton was a partner. Even two young boys who witnessed the <strong>Mena, Arkansas, drug shipments arriving by train</strong> were murdered, in order to protect these dark secrets. The dark secrets followed the Clintons to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Shortly after Bill Clinton took over the presidency in 1993, questions were raised by The New York Times about the <strong>Whitewater Development and Madison Guaranty loan scandals</strong>. The Clintons had invested in the project (at a &quot;loss&quot;) and it was learned that the bank had used its influence to hand out political loans amounting to $3 million with deposits of only $300,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New York Times story had precipitated an investigation into Whitewater by the U.S. Justice Department... was now going to investigate a law firm, a bank that illegally loaned money to politicians, a real estate entity that was a &quot;shell&quot; corporation created by attorneys and a former governor of Arkansas who had become president of the United States.</p>
<p>To thicken the plot, former White House Deputy Counsel, <strong>Vince Foster submitted several delinquent tax returns for the Whitewater Development project</strong> in June, 1993. In July, 1993, Foster &quot;committed suicide&quot; in Fort Marcy Park in Virginia—so the &quot;official&quot; story goes. After a conflict of interest was determined in the appointment of Robert B. Fiske by Attorney General Janet Reno, Kenneth Starr was appointed by a panel of three judges to head the Whitewater investigation in 1994. There was even an investigation into the murder of Vince Foster, who had worked with the Rose Law Firm alongside Hillary Clinton. Although several improprieties by the Clintons were discovered, Foster’s (timely, untimely?) death was ruled a suicide and only James and Susan McDougal received jail time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now hold on...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1993, Ambassador Leo Emil Wanta met with Vince Foster in Geneva, Switzerland. Foster had traveled there to make a special pickup of a disbursement that had been formally requested by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton. According to Wanta, he had been working on &quot;Seal projects&quot; and had been requested to transfer $250 million to an account that was retrievable by Foster. The account was destined for the &quot;Children’s Defense Fund,&quot; hardly a &quot;Seal&quot; project. Wanta arranged for three payments, approximately $81 million dollars each, to be made and converted to U.S. Treasury notes which were given to Foster, who then gave them to Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>The &quot;Children’s Defense Fund&quot; was a pet project of Hillary Rodham Clinton. It would be revealing to track the $250 million &quot;appropriation&quot; from Switzerland to its final destination. Congress usually handles such appropriations, which are mandated by legislation. Congress did not authorize the briefcase pickup of $250 million from Geneva, Switzerland—by deputy White House counsel-turned-bagman. If the &quot;Children’s Defense Fund&quot; is actually a CIA operation, then one must also conclude that Hillary Rodham Clinton is a CIA operative.</p>

            The "Children’s Defense Fund" was a pet project of Hillary Rodham Clinton. It would be revealing to track the $250 million "appropriation" from Switzerland to its final destination.
