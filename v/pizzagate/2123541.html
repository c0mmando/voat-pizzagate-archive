The <a href="https://calvinayre.com/2011/03/02/business/sec-scrutiny-effects-sands-china-shares/">SEC</a> also investigated Adelson in relation to these charges.</p>
<p>Now let\'s turn to the case of Steven Jacobs, who sued Adelson for wrongful termination because he was <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/ex-sands-exec-alleges-prostitution-191218912.html">fired</a> after refusing to help Adelson run his blackmail operations. Were the allegations bullshit? No, Jacobs settled for an unheard of $75 to $100 million.</p>
<p>Why is this settlement important? Let\'s start with his <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/22/former-sands-macau-executive/">contract</a>&quot;Jacobs was hired to run Sands’ Macau gambling and hotel operations in May 2009 at an annual salary of $1.3 million plus bonuses under a three-year contract, the suit says.&quot; Total salary under the contract is $3.9 million.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with contract law knows you\'re generally suing for the benefit of the contract ($3.9 million) and maybe a little extra (punitive damages) for your trouble. The US Supreme Court usually doesn\'t like punitive damages of more than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages#United_States">single digit multiplier</a> of the regular damages. So, $39 million would be pretty extravagant for a jury award, not likely to hold up on appeal.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic worst-case scenario for Adelson is a $39 million judgment, but he settles for $75 million. Given the allegations (Jacobs wouldn\'t allow prostitutes to operate in the casinos, and China accusing Adelson of running sex blackmail operations), it becomes crystal clear that this is hush money, and there are rich, powerful people who want this covered up.</p>',

             I'm not HLI, but US Senate Anon named Sheldon Aldelson as the leader of a blackmail ring, and in this context the blackmail would be for entrapment of elite pedophiles using trafficked children. Senate Anon seems laser-focused on elite pedophiles. Adelson's activities are worth digging into, but a challenge since he's a multi-billionaire with George Soros-level security and evasion techniques.
