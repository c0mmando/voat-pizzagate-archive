            Thailand is a hot spot of sex trafficking, children, and adults.
Bangkok and Chiang Mai are the main hubs.
Tons of Child Porn and tranny sex exploitation comes from this region too.
The situation with 4chan and specifically R9K but also the other boards and the Trapgate exposure of "glow in the dark" compromised hackers who were recrutied into NATO's arms is sources and evidence here.
Julius Kivimaki, Vinnie Omaria, and Paige Valencia.
All 3 are apart of a syndicate brainwashing and luring/blackmailing adults,teens, and children many ina  state of emotional distress/highly influencable and weak minded because of their states of life(drugged, handcapped, akward whatever be the case specifically the young ones) into compromising positions sexually and "confessions" wise into a state of blackmail to take HRT and join a onlie(but also IRL) real life se cult that worships Reiko. They engage in massive cyber crime, threats, doxxing, swatting, false accusations, and blackmail. As well as drugg running and procurement in IRL of setup individuals for human trafficking/organ harvesting. They have disappeared confirmed 4 people for exposing the truth/or to be trafficked. Specifically the boy who went buy Azuna/Asuna on the internet.

            Glad I am used to reading translated news everyday. I can still only stand so much at a time. This is interesting because I have never heard of this particular angle. Animal is a beast, no? Wish we had someone in the area willing to pay for some junkies fix to get more information. It works both ways because dopers just want the drugs. The only downside would be if these guys were the main source of the horse, then the junky would not give that up. I had an interesting conversation with a crack addict who stayed at a drug house in St Louis. He told me that he could stay there for free, but never go in the basement. They instructed him on some kind of multiple scam that all the addicted use to earn money so that he could come back to buy the drugs. Most of the blood collected nowadays comes from addicts, so try not to go to the hospital.
