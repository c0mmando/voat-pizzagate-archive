<p>Just tell Podesta to invite them over for some pizza, I am sure they will be able to come to terms. </p>
<hr />
<p>We deliver to Saudi, so say\'s Besta-Pizza.</p>
<hr />
<p>DOJ cover for Saudi assets</p>
<p>The most perceptive insights on VOAT are focused on Arab-Saudi ownership of the entire city block underneath Comet Pizza and a nearby pizzeria called Besta (not Basta, the Italian word for enough or too much), operated by Abdul Hamade (Abdel Rahmann Hammad), who is also owner of the Boli pizza chain) and Samir Sbitan. Besta, as in bestiality, has for its logo the “Boy Lovers” symbol, a triangular spiral. Are there any sheep out back?</p>
<p>The entire lot under Besta and Comet is owned, on paper at least, by attorney Andrew J. Kline, a graduate of the Kennedy School at Harvard. To disguise his government work at the Department of Justice, Kline hides behind a front business, the “Veritas” law office located on Dupont Circle and with a field office in Chevy Chase, near Comet Pizza. Further pursuit by online researchers showed the same curly-haired lawyer Kline to be a Bill Clinton appointee in the Department of Justice (DOJ) Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit, when Janet Reno was Attorney General.</p>
<p>The junior partner at Veritas is Stephen J. Whelan, who worked previously at Metro (the D.C. Transport Agency), an interesting coincidence with the controversy over the old Red Line Tunnel under Connecticut Avenue, mentioned in a John Podesta email.</p>
<p>Kline’s employment with Justice causes some befuddlement among Pizzagate hunters, as it raises the question of whether Comet Pizza is an FBI honey trap to nab international child-smugglers. My educated guess is no, based on my work in an undercover journalistic probe into the secret activities of the human-trafficking bureau at Justice and the State Department.</p>
<p>Despite its pretense of stopping people smugglers, the human trafficking program does the exact opposite, organizing and facilitating the transport of, say, North Koreans and Chinese Uyghurs into Thailand and onto the US territory of Saipan. U.S. consular officers provide money and fake passports to “snakeheads” from China and, more recently, Turkish traffickers who transported Mideast and African migrants by boat to Greece and onto Germany since the summer of 2015. The human trafficking officers aid and abet the flow of illegals, and often prevent immigration and Border Patrol from detaining their live cargo.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Podesta brothers would not be assigned to a honey trap, as that would compromise their intelligence roles. The large property in Chevy Chase has to be part of a political bribery deal between the Arabs and the Clintons, now being protected by the Obama administration.</p>
<p>IOUs from the UAE</p>
<p>It is a common practice for foreign-owned properties to be administered by a proxy registered “owner”, like Kline, on behalf of a foreign company like Dhs.CON.N.E.B. Let’s examine this curious company name, with a little help from my past experience in the Gulf States. First, Dhs in this case does not refer to Department of Homeland Security. It stands for Dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). CON is short for Construction and N.E.B. stands for National Engineering Bureau LLC (limited liability company).</p>
<p>This Dubai-owned property group, likely to be financed by the Saudis, has owned the lot for longer than a decade. The primary motive for the property does not appear to be rental income but instead is a vehicle to provide funds to the Clintons. The blog Lux E Tenebris has been so kind as to provide a map of the Dubai-owned lot on either side of Connecticut Avenue.</p>
<p>The storefronts are occupied by Comet Pizza; Bucks Fishing and Camping restaurant (also owned by Alefantes); Besta Pizza run by Arabs; Politics and Prose bookstore owned by Lissa Muscatine, a senior speechwriter for then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her husband Bradley Graham with The Washington Post. Across the street is Beyond Borders, a Clinton Foundation-funded NGO involved with promoting the European refugee crisis; and Terasol Bistro, whose website is decorated with the pedophile trapped heart symbol.</p>
<p>By now, with so many facts vetted and verified, Pizzagate is clearly not fake news, Congressmen, and you’re going to have to face the facts and nothing but the facts.</p>
<p>High-class Brothels for Small Vices</p>
<p>Next question: What do the rich Arab investors get in return? As this question spun around in my brain, the image that popped up out of the memory banks was of a naked prostitute standing inside an upright steel coffin, that image being from the cover of of the second edition of Len Deighton’s 1967 potboiler “An Expensive Place to Die”. Here’s the jacket blurb:</p>
<p>“A \'clinic\' on Paris\'s Avenue Foch designed to cater lavishly for multiple perversions, staffed by a group of sexually and intellectually high-powered girls and equipped with devices ranging from an Iron Maiden to psychedelic truth-drugs that\'s the set-up operated by the enigmatic Monsieur Daft.
“Naturally, it has a hidden purpose: to compile dossiers of tape and film on influential political clients from East and West. Into this twilight world of decadence and hidden motives come the agents of four world powers. Are they after Datt\'s pornographic blackmail dossiers? Or is their purpose, altogether more deadly than a trip to the blue movies?”</p>
<p>Fact being stranger than fiction is something I can attest to after 30 years of investigative journalism. What if your wealthy and powerful target has already tried everything, including Vegas hookers, Dallas lap dancers, Asian massage, Castro Street bath houses, Thai transvestites and foxy Euros on Avenue Foch, what else is new? What about sex with a 10-month-old blonde German girl, like the one advertised by Alefantes? Or a boisterous white American boy of 7 who’s just now learning about the wonders of erectile tissue? In a decadent world of cosmetic surgery and boob jobs, innocent children are caviar to the connoisseur.</p>
<p>For the jaded sheikh or defense minister, who’s seen and done everything, it’s no great thrill to watch naked lads sliding down the handrail of a staircase, a scene of degraded commercialized sex in the male brothel scene from Marcel Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past. Instead of overt sexuality, what if your guests were invited to an informal pizza dinner at your home and discovered “the neighbor’s kids” skinny dipping in the heated pool? What more could you offer as a token of friendship than an invitation to a master bedroom with its own jacuzzi for each of the guests to share with a little companion?</p>
<p>Welcome to the family, make yourself at home. Help yourself to wine and the pantry and the kids. Oh, phone. Darn, there’s noise from the human rights crowd about Yemen, but another few million on top of the F-18 contract should be enough to handle Congress. We’ll deal with it in the morning. Ain’t she as cute as a doll? Wish I had a daughter like that. Enjoy the late night show, buddy.</p>
<p>Would the foreign dignitaries spot the hidden camera and microphone? Or are they too tantalized to notice? And that’s why intelligence services are pressing Congress crack down on fake news to protect their dirty little secret. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton agitates for children’s rights. It would be a comedy of hypocrisy if little kids were not being traumatized and dumped into landfills.</p>',

             Rense has been doing investigative journalism for 20 years, and note the bots are attacking the messenger and not the message content.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, if you bothered to read their report you would see that 100% of their finding came from Voat, they simply scrubbed voat and issued a conclusion.

              If Rense is so reliable, then why do they keep posting the same debunked info about Andrew Kline over and over?
