<blockquote>
<h1 id="md-marketing-controversy">Marketing controversy</h1>
<p>An early theatrical poster for A Single Man featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work\'s gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film\'s original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were a shot of George staring into a male student\'s eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student, shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, and shots of George and Kenny running nude into the ocean.[9]</p>
<p>Speaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed.[10] However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, &quot;I don\'t think the movie\'s been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that\'s pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can\'t have naked male buttocks. You can\'t have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn\'t an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie.&quot;[11] Conversely, Colin Firth said, &quot;[The marketing] is deceptive. I don\'t think they should do that because there\'s nothing to sanitize. It\'s a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is.&quot;[12] <strong>Harvey Weinstein would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, &quot;Brokeback Mountain did pretty well. Midnight Cowboy did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There\'s an audience for it.&quot; When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, &quot;I\'m good. You got enough. Thank you.&quot;[13] Peter Knegt of Indiewire suggested that The Weinstein Company &quot;de-gayed&quot; the trailer to better the film\'s chances of receiving Academy Award nominations.[9]</strong></p>

            Marketing controversy
           </h1>
           <p>
            An early theatrical poster for A Single Man featured a close-up shot of Colin Firth and Julianne Moore lying side by side, their arms and shoulders touching. This led to speculation that the work's gay content and themes were being deleted or diminished in its marketing materials to improve its chances of success with a wider audience. A new poster with Moore relocated to the background was issued. The film's original trailer placed more emphasis on the relationship between George and Jim but a re-cut trailer omitted a shot of George and Jim kissing while retaining a kiss between George and Charley. Also deleted were a shot of George staring into a male student's eyes, while keeping a shot of George staring into the eyes of a female student, shots of George meeting hustler Carlos outside a liquor store, and shots of George and Kenny running nude into the ocean.[9]
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking of the controversy, Moore said that director Tom Ford expressed concern that the original poster made the film appear to be a romantic comedy and that he ordered that the poster be changed.[10] However Ford, noting he does not see the film in terms of gay or straight, said, "I don't think the movie's been de-gayed. I have to say that we live in a society that's pretty weird. For example, you can have full-frontal male nudity on HBO, yet in cinema, you can't have naked male buttocks. You can't have men kissing each other without it being considered adult content. So, in order to cut a trailer that can go into broad distribution in theaters, certain things had to be edited out. But it wasn't an intentional attempt to remove the gayness of the movie."[11] Conversely, Colin Firth said, "[The marketing] is deceptive. I don't think they should do that because there's nothing to sanitize. It's a beautiful story of love between two men and I see no point in hiding that. People should see it for what it is."[12]
            <strong>
             Harvey Weinstein would only say, when asked about marketing a gay romance, "Brokeback Mountain did pretty well. Midnight Cowboy did pretty well. If you know how to market, you can market. There's an audience for it." When pressed about the poster, Weinstein cut off the interview, saying, "I'm good. You got enough. Thank you."[13] Peter Knegt of Indiewire suggested that The Weinstein Company "de-gayed" the trailer to better the film's chances of receiving Academy Award nominations.[9]

             Apparently the next on the list was 33 year old Fahim Saleh. Copied from a comment. "10 June when INTERPOL forces in Dubai captured Nigerian criminal money launderer Raymond “Hushpuppi” Abbas (Dubai officials now claim credit for the capture)—
            </p>
            <p>
             a capture followed on 25 June when Nigerian criminals began sending out emails asking of help to access money hidden by Jeffrey Epstein—
            </p>
            <p>
             that was followed on 29 June when the US became the first nation to publically announce that Raymond “Hushpuppi” Abbas had been captured—
            </p>
            <p>
             that was followed on 2 July when the US announced it had captured Ghislaine Maxwell—
            </p>
            <p>
             that was followed on 3 July when the US announced that Raymond “Hushpuppi” Abbas had landed in America and was formally arrested and charged—and most critically to notice
            </p>
            <p>
             was followed on 12 July with INTERPOL announcing it had captured an additional three more Nigerian money launderers belonging to this international cartel—critical to notice because it’s an obvious sign that Raymond “Hushpuppi” Abbas is “singing like a bird” to US prosecutors and is giving up everyone he can—which makes it more than understandable why the “message murder” of Fahim Saleh was sent out yesterday."

               1 Nigerian Naira = .0026 USD. It would take quite a bit of business to afford a $2.25 million full floor two bedroom apartment in NYC. Who knew buying a bunch of cheap Chinese motorcycles and leaving them in the hands of third world employees could be so profitable? They are third in the World for people under 18, behind India and China. He did create kickback apps, notably textr. If he claimed that these communication were secure and somehow they got cracked by authorities, well that opens up a new can of worms. He might have even helped authorities with some phones ...
