<p>First off, <a href="https://voat.co/u/ESOTERICshade">@ESOTERICshade</a> is <a href="https://voat.co/u/rarepeeks">@rarepeeks</a>. <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/2773684/14340703">This</a> is <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/2773684/14346779?=2">not a joke</a>.  Yes, there are loads of archives and image backups that will never be deleted, should he disappear or delete.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem? <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152766.png">Manufacturing consensus</a> and vote manipulation.  Other users never seem to push ESOTERIC\'s narrative, just his alts.

<p>You know how the pedophiles we all want dead <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152770.png">mock those around them</a> by hinting at what they\'re really doing by admitting to something smaller?</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/Puttitout">@Puttitout</a>, please see the above paragraph.</p>
<p>You\'ll also notice <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate/2131817/10517964">BOTH Esoteric</a> and <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/pizzagate/2131817/10518235">his smurfy69 account</a> commenting in this concern troll thread by <a href="https://voat.co/u/ArtificalDuality">@ArtificalDuality</a> -- both claiming to have suffered torture from directed energy weapons.

You\'ll also find twistedmac11 joining in there.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/twistedmac11">@twistedmac11</a> seems more than a little <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152786.png">invested</a> in ESOTERICshade <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152787.png">keeping his good name</a>.  And he <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152788.png">always</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152789.png">always</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152790.png">always</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152791.png">always</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152793.png">JFC always</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152794.png">fuck</a>... shows up to defend or agree with ESOTERIC.  No, that\'s not everything.  That\'s a very, VERY small fraction, yes, it\'s all archived and saved.</p>
<p>How much of what you see here has been shaped by him?  Does <em>any</em> legitimate user really agree with him, or does he just groom new users into being his cheerleaders when he and his alts do their dirty work?  
</p>
<p>Here\'s <a href="https://voat.co/u/DeathtoMasonsASAP">@DeathtoMasonsASAP</a> <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152798.png">somehow finding a deeply-nested comment to respond to</a>, and has that typical ESOTERIC-style <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152799.png">Vindicator</a> <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152800.png">hate</a> found on a verified alt <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152801.png">here</a>, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152804.png">here</a>, and <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152805.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here\'s ES <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152806.png">lying</a> again about him thinking the rest of the mods are &quot;cool&quot; while attacking one.  It\'s usually either that, or thinking all the mods are awful except one.  Never really seems to commit one way or the other.  Always has to pretend to be on the side of one of the mods, like this <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/2773684/14339426?=2">cringey</a> shit where he tries to brown-nose kevdude.</p>
<p><strong>I\'m sure everyone now knows that the colloquially known <a href="https://archive.li/8eLqe">&quot;Donkey&quot; is also @auralsects</a>.

No, ES did NOT respond to that on the correct username at all, even after the fact.  And who in their right mind would say <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2512977/12559950">this</a>?</strong>  Here he is talking about <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2101804/10363085">Donkey\'s JOB</a>; who in their right minds would say THAT?</p>
<p>There are more usernames being researched, but what do you all see in these links?</p>

<p>Feel free to ping all those users you know that are friendly to this pedophile-protecting D&amp;C shill.  I fully intend to put every single one of them under the microscope, along with <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/3e3e393c77/152808.png">anyone that attacks my mods.</a>  
</p>
<p>This is why you have a MASSIVE asshole as an [O] mod.  THIS is why I\'m not nice to you.  THIS is why I don\'t do daily mod duties here.  THIS is why your mods want me where I am.  THIS is the avalanche I created just by picking a fight with your loudest blowhard member that almost none of you called out.  THIS IS WHAT I DO.  And to all of you that <em>even look at my goddamned mods sideways without a VERY good reason</em>:</p>
<p>No more Mr. Nice Crensch.</p>
<h1>EDIT</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/twistedmac11">@twistedmac11</a> got flustered and lied about never supporting anyone trying to destroy the subverse, prompting <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2608242/13143338?=20#13142050">dig this one up</a>.</p>
<h1>EDIT 2</h1>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> made the comment below about ESOTERIC\'s bullshit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/TE9Hz">Here</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/u/EsotericShade">@EsotericShade</a> claims he\'s so ignorant of technology (a &quot;retard&quot;) he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.</p>
<p>But eight months ago, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system</a>. Doesn\'t sound too tech ignorant here, now does he? </p>
<p>Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren\'t made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">three of them talking to each other</a>, pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives. </p>
<p>There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people\'s names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It\'s rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.</p>

            claims he's so ignorant of technology (a "retard") he had to make all these alts because passwords are too hard to remember.
           </p>
           <p>
            But eight months ago,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11925786">
             here he is having a conversation about how to use VPNs to game the voting system
            </a>
            . Doesn't sound too tech ignorant here, now does he?
           </p>
           <p>
            Incidentally, that thread shows him using multiple alts to try to take over a rule discussion, voting multiple times via different accounts and even bitching when Crensch missed votes that weren't made as top level comments that would be seen in his notifications. Lots of brigading, too. Here are
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2394933/11926463">
             three of them talking to each other
            </a>
            , pushing the idea the mod team is run by intelligence operatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are multiple comments by him in that thread as ES, rarepeeks, twistedmac11, dragonkiller and others concern trolling the idea that the rule discussion is some kind of trap created by Crensch to get people's names on a hit list -- he simultaneously votes multiple times and tries to scare other people away from letting their voice be heard. It's rather appalling how glaring it is in this thread, actually.

            If we put both of those in the same sub pizzagate would be 2% of the conversation and have looked like a random shell that washed up on the beach, every now and then, and pizzagate would have gotten washed away by the Q stuff. That can't happen to pizzagate. Pizzagate needs to be a specialty topic because its HARD to understand and it needs dedicated specialists.

            wanted to put Q and pizzagate into the same ocean. That would have been the end of pizzagate specialty. I just couldn't let that happen because I have too much time invested in child abuse specific topics.

           <p>
            If pizzagate were to survive, these topics had to be SEPERATED. It had to be that way. I'm as sorry as anybody that Qanon didn't put everybody into GITMO as you are but didn't happen, won't happen, and ITS NOT PIZZAGATE SUB MATERIAl.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            PIZZAGATE IS DEDICATED PEOPLE DIGGING INTO CHILD ABUSE and most of these good dedicated diggers understand the occult aspects of this difficult topic.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Q didn't become qpizzaqanon and it had to be that way. That is my opinon and i'm damn sure time has brought that to bare. I don't hate you vindicator, but it just was not a good idea. You do have a lot of good ideas, but a Q pizzagate wasn't one of them.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I love ya vindicator because I believe you are dedicated to the cause. I just had to cut that last big idea off at the root.

            ive finally scanned though this flood of bs after  its been pushed in my face for months. I see mods who think they are pizzagate. I see mods who think they or pizzagate existance is somehow threatened by trolls. I see a bunch of cry babies who have little interest in being on topic, they just want to play internet-fight-game. In other posts, i see mods smiling like trolls, and talking about "shekels". I think pizzagate is great, and is doing great.  I think voat-pizzagate-mods are lame and desperate to shoot stuff, but settle for trollling stuff. siding with people who call me out as a jew and faggot, when im neither, probably doesnt help their rep much.

            List each rule and explain how using an anonymous source like the full of shit Qanon meets each rule and how it deserves its own sticky thread. I'll wait, forever, and so will you, because using a piece of shit source like an anonymous 4Chan "Nostradamus" that can't even predict the weather breaks every rule in the sidebar. You fuckers almost ruined pizzagate with that horse shit. If you would just stick to the rules in the sidebar, and stay the fuck out of pizzagate, none of this would have happened.

                         Mods made it too toxic for me. I wasn't here to play, I was here to contribute and educate. Me and about two or three dozen other people left because of it. I stuck around longer than most and my mission was to fight off the Q invasion into pizzagate because it didn't belong here. Period.

                         It seems to have evolved a "little bit" because I noticed some deeper information coming across the board. I decided to contribute bits and pieces.

                         I'm doubting that :) I probably won't ever be back as a regular contributor. The fact that the Q stickies are gone and Q is not used as a regular source means this:&gt;&gt;&gt; I was correct and some seriously butthurt people were incorrect. Their little voting brigade pounds my sand everytime I try to contribute.

                         That is a serious sign of a lack of intellectual and emotional development and I ain't got time for it. I have branched out and contribute in other ways in other places.

                           mmmmm....one in particular pitched a HUGE bitch because I was adamant that "Qanon" and pizzagate are not the same thing. Ya know, like the lead mod. I would say that qualifies.

                           I made the offer many times for them to show us all where having these Qanon stickies meet the rules in the sidebar. Actually it was a challenge. So far, they have just sidestepped and they just scurry into the shadows and don't even attempt it.

                             Nope. Perfectly sincere. Just, more knowledgeable than most around here. Think about what that means? vin derides me for blasting Freemasons and Jesuits, which means he is not being "mendacious" but he is certainly uneducated. And since he is not at my level he TRIES to make me look mendacious. I still think he is a good guy, just not all that advanced, yet, but here is still hope. He didn't start doing this 25 years ago like me, so I don't fault him for that. He could certainly tone his Q temper tantrums down tho

                   It took me over a hundred thousand hours to learn the stuff I know. Unfortunately a lot of the stuff I know is creepy, but it is what it is... 16 hours a day, or more, for many, many years. I don't know how interested you are in the hidden meanings behind the facade we live in but if you don't like Jake Morphonios you can try Adam here. This is a short crash course on whats behind what we see everyday. Jake and Adam might not be pretty but they are smart.

                 The guy in the video gave me the creeps, couldn't watch. Baggy-eyed individuals are hard for me to trust, knowing how they possibly could have gotten those bags, I tend to verify before trusting.

                          I look good; sounds like you're projecting, and considering that you're on a health sub obssessing over eye health suggests that you're the one with facial issues, not I. Just pointing out that your weird obsession with one's eyebags as a measure of one's character makes you full of shit.

            The jew (crensch favorite term) and crensch knows...mmmmm....jack shit about Talmudism. (somebody give crensch a dog biscuit and keep him quiet so that I can teach Plato's Republic)
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The Jew in this Vid says this is the "single most famous passage in the history of Western Philosophy."

           <hr/>
           <p>
            hmmmm.....He is teaching THE KNESSET STUDENTS......too...  the Knesset. Don't ya fuckin think you might want to understand how these Jews think about injustice versus justice and who gets some of both or none? The Talmud says us "white folk" get no justice, but I digress.....
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            (pause while crensch feverishly looks up "knesset" and "jesuits" so that he can at least make a snarky comment. On second thought, fuck you crensch, just stay out of this learning experience for the sake of everybody ok? So, moving on...I hate Morons like you that shit on the beach)

            have beat me up almost a dozen times because I study the enemy's books like the Talmud. The Talmud says pretty much, "kill, steal from, abuse, cheat, fuck their kids, etc...the white man and everybody else."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I read that shit because i'm white. Why? I want to know the game plan. Its like reading Sun Tzu Art of War. Copy? If the Talmud wants to take me down i'm gonna read the Talmud. Both crensch and vindicator "accuse me of reading the Talmud"....fuck yeah, I do read that. Its a game plan to slit the throat of the white man....you dumb fucks.....I lost patience with you two...
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            These two ignorant dumb fucks, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;crensch and vindicator, that won't read our enemy's game plan, but I will and fuck them both, and I will teach what I learn to the rest of the white population.

            harasses me regularly because I have problems with Zionism, Freemasonry, and Jesuits. And crensch defends all this bullshit.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Nuff said. These two people are either stupid or they are not on our side.
           </p>
           <p>
            (go trump maga maga maga)......hmmmmm....i dunno...read....maybe?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            This is type of education that Jews get that we never got. It took me THOUSANDS OF HOURS to over my life to arrive here. While crensch and vindicator make up stories about George Soros being in Gitmo.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            We will be "outgunned in the mind" as long as idiots like crensch and vindicator don't understand basic principles, and they oure our "leaders" pray tell?

            Its awesome. This is the hammer and forge Mother Nature uses to shape humans, trees, butterflies, dragonflies, the earth, dolphins, whales, fish, bushes, rocks, apes, gold, silver, water, air, fire, earth, and you fuckin name it....

            This IS the RATIO that gets INVERTED and used AGAINST humanity, our culture, our biological growth, our families, our way of life, our physical surroundings, and all that is that we commonly experience as reality. This is creation. THE PERPS turn it backwards against us.

            Alinsky does the same thing to us on a cultural level with the "Alinsky Tactics" and crensch, you are using Alinsky Tactics 101. Don't do that shit if you really care because you are tearing down a sub, a culture, and everything you "say" you care about. Copy? Don't that shit ok?

            I ask because of the many people I have met here, next to myself, you probably understand the estoteric better than most here. That means I respect you, and earning my respect on this esoteric plain ain't easy bro :)

             No one but you has the brazen disregard for the people of this sub to think they could run a crew of sock puppet accounts to brigade and deceive them and then get away with pontificating about the Allegory of the Cave which warns against deceivers who lull the ignorant with mere shadows of the truth cast on the walls of their prison.

              I have done more this sub than the Imposter In Chief ever did for this sub. There is a correct and incorrect side of this situation and a line down the middle that marks that. Right now, you are, about 100 times more valuable to Pizzagate than crensch has EVER been because you provide a crucial function and service.

Until you do, you are part of the disinformation team. The Rothschilds, the people that print money, are not going to GITMO. If you can't get that through your head, you are not reachable.

                    and my family, but for you I will make an exception. Will you please explain this TTT thing to me? If you are worried that I will reveal what you say in private, I understand. Please just tell me what the hell is going on with you and this larper. Why the hell do you let it lie all the time without calling it out? I care about the information not being shrouded in a bunch of lies, don't you?

                    I ain't sure what the fuck that is, the quote above. I think this is first time I ever saw that. What thread did that come from? You need to understand that I don't keep up with Voat like I once did and I don't always immediately understand what yall are doing around here. Okay?

I DO RESPECT private messages an nothing you send me would be put into public knowledge but myself, personally, I have no need for secrecy. If you send me something by private message, It will stay private, but I have ZERO need to speak in secrecy. I won't tell YOU anything I won't tell other people, so, ya know...........

                   I'm pretty sure you can get hooked up tomorrow with some microwave activity at your own house. I like you and I don't want that to happen to you. This shit is not a joke. There is a new satellite system that will be in place in less than two years. You are a good person and I would anything to help you. You are smart, you mean well, and I like you. I cannot protect you from what is coming. I am usually ten years ahead of the curve of what is coming because I KNOW what is getting to happen. Five G is real.

                      I'm pretty sure you can get hooked up tomorrow with some microwave activity at your own house. I like you and I don't want that to happen to you. This shit is not a joke. There is a new satellite system that will be in place in less than two years. You are a good person and I would not want anything bad to happen to you. I will help you.

                       He thinks I'm much too stupid to have any serious convo w/.  I even offered to talk to him in DMs. He really hates me evidently.

                       Should I be jealous that I'm the only girl he won't talk to in private? I would just love to pick his brain.

             Czeslawa Kwoka, age 14, appears in a prisoner identity photo provided by the Auschwitz Museum, taken by Wilhelm Brasse while working in the photography department at Auschwitz. Czeslawa was a Polish Catholic girl, from Wolka Zlojecka, Poland, who was sent to Auschwitz with her mother in December of 1942. Within three months, both were dead. Photographer (and fellow prisoner) Brasse recalled photographing Czeslawa in a 2005 documentary: "She was so young and so terrified. The girl didn't understand why she was there and she couldn't understand what was being said to her. So this woman Kapo (a prisoner overseer) took a stick and beat her about the face. This German woman was just taking out her anger on the girl. Such a beautiful young girl, so innocent. She cried but she could do nothing. Before the photograph was taken, the girl dried her tears and the blood from the cut on her lip. To tell you the truth, I felt as if I was being hit myself but I couldn't interfere. It would have been fatal for me."

            If you deny the Holocaust, you must be extension deny the Warsaw Ghetto; the rounding up and killing of 1.5 million gypsies, the partisans, the French Resistance and the freedom fighters; Anne Frank; the experimentation carried out on the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            What can be argued is the number of Jews killed (six million) during the Holocaust, which even some Jewish scholars dispute.  But denying the Holocaust is something done only by dim-witted imbeciles who're happy to be shown up as the ignorant morons that they are.

              Have you heard the saying, 'Whoever pays the piper calls the tune?' Leuchter was hired by Ernst Zündel, who was being tried in Canada for publishing works of Holocaust denial, to investigate and testify, for a fee of $30,000. Leuchter did not examine the walls of the gas chambers until 50 years after they had been used; it would have been virtually impossible to discover any cyanide at all using his method.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tell your comments to every family who lost a husband, a brother, a son, a father in Europe fighting the Germans. Tell them to every family member of a French resistance fighter; to every family member of an Italian partisan tortured, killed.  One of the photos I have provided is of a CATHOLIC little girl, so not all were Jews.  The Nazis were paranoid and threw anyone they suspected or weren't sure about in to a concentration camp, even lots of innocent people.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said, you can argue about the figure of six million Jews, and even Jewish scholars question that figure, but to say that there wasn't a mass extermination by the Germans is simply false.  If you look at the photos, you will see the pits and the dead bodies in the ovens ready to burn.   These people were not always killed by gas. They were often exterminated through labour (as in Mauthausen). The muselmenn (those too starved, too emaciated, too exhausted to work) were shipped out to 'euthanasia centres' to be shot, gassed or killed by lethal injection.
             </p>

              Arguing that the Holocaust did not take place because there is no proof of gassing, is like saying that Ted Bundy is innocent because you can't find the rope he used to strangle his victims.

              The Germans threw resistance fighters (and anyone they suspected of being a 'rebel') down bottomless pits, they shot them in the back, they loaded them in the back of trucks with ropes around necks and then drove off, leaving victims hanging.  Some were tortured before they were killed. Others were shipped off to concentration camps forced to dig the side of a mountain until it collapsed on top of them and killed them.  No, they weren't Jewish, but you didn't have to be for the Germans to imprison/kill you. The Germans would have succeeded if it were not for the US coming in. Tell your thoughts to all the US servicemen who freed Europe from Nazism and Fascism. Tell them to all the Jews with numbers tattooed on their arms.

               <p>
                Leuchter was hired by Ernst Zündel, who was being tried in Canada for publishing works of Holocaust denial, to investigate and testify, for a fee of $30,000. Leuchter did not examine the walls of the gas chambers until 50 years after they had been used; it would have been virtually impossible to discover any cyanide at all using his method.

               When you answer that for yourself, why do the delousing chambers show that particular characteristic, 50 years after they were in use?

                What is the I-94 Project, why did Chris Kutcher and others back out of it, and who accidentally confessed to years of raping and assaulting their step-children and others? What is Chris' favorite hat, what religion does he practice with Madonna and Hillary Clinton, what did his friend Danny do, what religion does Danny and the other 70's show cast members practice, how old was Mila, where was the show set, what club was Demi a member of, and why did Chris wink at John McCain?

                Why did the Speaker of the House, past mayors and so many other officials suddenly resign, die, attempt suicide, get an undeserved promotion, or end up in the river? What are judges working overtime to cover up, and why did so many officials violate the Hatch Act to ensure Complicity?

                Why was Q created as a False Prophet to Hide The Truth, and why did Q flood Voat?

              The issue is not whether someone posts 'wonderful' anything. The issue is that mods are now threatening to kill someone.

               This is the question I keep asking you, you don't answer me or inform me, you downvote me and ingnore me. Why?
              </p>
              <p>
               TTT is a big psycho, and is most certainly capable of finding the words to defend themselves. After all there are several of them running that account and only one crensch. Are you one of the people running that account, or do you think they are lying when they refer to themselves in the plural?

            Pretty shocked that the mods are making spiteful and denigrating comments about a dead investigator who's not here to defend herself. Because she was passionate about defending children you are calling her a 'drama queen'? Trying to discredit her and the work she did by attacking her personally doesn't work; it just makes you look bad.  Play the ball and not the man or you're just discrediting yourself.

            is Jem describing Mohamed Yunus as the most dangerous man to investigate.  Noone can deny that Yunus is a dirty, corrupt and dangerous man. Yunus invented micro-credit, offering small loans to people so poor that they cannot repay any, even the minimum of, loans. Then Yunus sends his cronies after borrowers putting pressure on them to sell their organs in order to repay the debt.

            is an academic paper on why microcredit does nothing to lift people out of poverty and actually increases sex trafficking. Yunus is, in effect, knowingly complicit in sex trafficking.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When the NGOs came here to collect money from me they harassed me and said bad things, things which cannot be repeated, said Mahmuda. She received 250,000 taka for her kidney after an operation in March. Though it helped eliminate her debt, she now regrets having the operation. I heard from the neighbors that if you donate a kidney you can make some money, she said. I feel like I had to sell it because I was under too much pressure.  According to Fazlul Karim, the police inspector who led the investigation into the Joypurhat organ-trafficking ring, the network was headed by a local man named Abdus Sattar.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clinton’s aid to Yunus also included 18 grants, contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations, the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America, according to USASpending.gov.
The awards, totaling $13 million, were issued by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the development arm of the State Department, beginning when Clinton became secretary of state. Another $11 million in federal funds went to organizations allied with Yunus.

            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1517306">
             Yunus stole aid money from his bank Grameen and transferred it to his private companies

            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "allegations surfaced in a recent Norwegian documentary that in the 1990s a portion of $100 million in aid money from Norway and other countries was transferred from Grameen Bank, which Yunus founded, to one of 30 companies he controls in order to avoid Bangladeshi taxes. It was also alleged that Grameen used aid money to benefit other bank operations unrelated to micro-finance." Norway did an investigation in 2011 but the $$ was traced saying the issue was resolved. WEIRD! Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also accused him of "sucking blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation". 
Yunus has donated 125k-300k to Clinton. According to David Brock's org Media Matters, they don't think it's a big deal or a conflict of interest.

             Your desire to defend that, and Esoteric who groomed users to get leverage over them he could use to force them to delete their accounts has shown your true colors, Piscina. It casts everything you've ever posted in a questionable light. One of these days I will find the time to do a deep dive on just how many of the bullshit shill narratives you've pushed. Disgusting.

                  I gave Amy 200 dollars because I felt sorry for her. From that one act of kindness you have spun a wholleeee huge yarn about "esoteric grooming users." I did a good deed for somebody that was having a rough time in life because I could afford to do it. From that you have made up all sorts of wild shit you can't back up.

               Well, Donkey, I can't tell you things that have been reported to me in confidence as several people have done. But if you lurk his comment history and cross reference it with SearchVoat submission histories of users who have since deleted or abandoned their accounts, it's pretty obvious. He didn't just do it with female users, of course. But he did succeed in getting more of them to leave.
              </p>
              <p>
               Given his extensive use of deceit + flattery, and the Protocols as "evidence" against me, Trump, and others he was interested in smearing, several of us who take defending this board seriously believe he is JIDF.

                 Well, Donkey, I can't tell you things that have been reported to me in confidence as several people have done. But if you lurk his comment history and cross reference it with SearchVoat submission histories of users who have since deleted or abandoned their accounts, it's pretty obvious. He didn't just do it with female users, of course. But he did succeed in getting more of them to leave.

                 Given his extensive use of deceit + flattery, and the Protocols as "evidence" against me, Trump, and others he was interested in smearing, several of us who take defending this board seriously believe he is JIDF.

                For a while you went around telling people that me and Donkey were the same person. I guess you have up that stage play because it wasn't playing well for you, huh? YOU ran off the old pizzagate regulars when YOU FORCIBLY invaded this sub with Qanon.

               <p>
                Instead of looking in the mirror and realizing your mistakes you have taken to either deluding yourself or making up outright lies on purpose. I think its a combination of both. You used to be a good influence on this sub. Every since you tried to forcibly invade this sub with Qanon you have been a destructive force.
               </p>

               <p>
                Not only did you run off a lot of pizzagate regulars with Qanon, but now you guys have run off some more by dragging them into this little freak show you have maintained. (this thread) Congratulations....

                A lot of them left because you tried to invade this sub with Qanon. Dude, you have become quite the fairy tale teller haven't have you? Actually, just a butt hurt liar. Grow up. I smoked crensch for being a snot nose internet bully and obviously I did a great job because he is still butt hurt many months later and has wasted many hours of his time on it. You have made up so much shit I have lost track of it.

                LOL!  Since any real researcher knows the Protocols' authenticity is in dispute, your repeating of the Official History that they aren't is obviously for the benefit of the naive.  What I don't understand is why you even try to pull this shit when I've told you so many times it is beyond transparent and you are beyond awful at it.

                   forcibly invaded this sub with Qanon and this sub has not been the same since. A lot of the top notch regulars quit over that invasion and Vindicator is looking for a way to blame that on me, even going so far as to suggest that I groomed them and forced them to delete their accounts. He is delusional out of his mind or just a terrible liar.

                        pissed off all the smartest pizzagate brains and now pretends they went to the greatawakening sub. Reality shows us that those user names are not there. The weasel even implies that I somehow blackmailed them (or something) into leaving or deleting their accounts. I used to have a little respect for vindicator because I thought he tried to be honest, dumb but honest. He has turned out to be a serious liar instead. He is either knowingly making all this shit up or he is delusional. He claims to believe that Q is real so he might just be delusional, I can't say for sure.

                       <p>
                        He defends Jesuits, Freemasons, Jews, and pretty much everybody that is destroying our world, so regardless, he is worthless to the cause. He needs to stick to being the janitor for the sub, keep his ass parked in the sidebar, and stay out of the way.

                        So you don't care or have an opinion about a  team of people using an account to shit up submissions and mislead users?  I see it as an attempt to get them to waste their time down a useless rabbit hole, kind of like Q and Seth Rich were.

                         I have not been paying attention to this thread or Voat for a pretty long time. I am behind on what all is going on around here. I don't know as much about all that as you do.

                         I am talking to you. I just don't know enough about it to have an opinion on it. TTT seems to have a strong opinion about Jem but that has nothing to do with me.

                I have never said mods get paid. I just out foxed you and gave your snot nose internet bully ass a good gut punch. A well deserved one. I think its hilarious that you have spent so many months being so butt hurt about it and wasted so many hours twisting in your own made up fairy tales.

                lol. I get it--all that pent up internalised rage because you're stuck in your mom's basement with your little tweezers searching, searching, searching for the micro-peen. So much anger, with only Voat members to take it out on. Do you feel like a big man now?
               </p>
               <p>
                You've never contributed to pizzagate.  All you've ever done is distract, create dramas and pull 'facts' out of your arse. You are a pathetic little nobody.  When is poor little baby going to call in his little goon squad so that you can all voat brigade? Any second now I bet.
               </p>

                If mods could be voted off here, you'd be the first to go. Noone likes you. You're like a diarrhoea-spurting bothersome tiny troll who is good for nothing.

You are saying that if you were not here, this place would fall apart and would die.  How do the other mods feel about you saying that their work is basically useless?

             Yep, it appears this place is a disaster. How did mods-on-the-take get the upper hand in this sub? Thank goodness for 8chan. Did you see yesterday's file dump there? Quite impressive! I came here to see if it was posted and, of course, it wasn't. Now I see why.

                He is at least partly a bot. Obviously, they forgot to re-program him, so what he says often doesn't make even sense.

                  The mods pushed it daily in here. We are winning! Trump is unsealing the indictements soon. Tribunals and mass arrest! So do you still think Trump had the CIA arrested? So when are the mass arrest? 2020? You can't run away from it now, you guys promoted that bullshit since this sub opened. So whats the new timeline for the mass arrest?

            That dude made entire threads claiming ES was me BASED ON "SHARED BEHAVIOR."

            So I saw a blatant example of how we don't share behavior and pointed it out, in a clearly different text style than the ES account you're claiming I thought I was using at the time.  Far from a slip-up, I have done that many times because it makes sense to.

              List each rule and explain how using an anonymous source like the full of shit Qanon meets each rule and how it deserves its own sticky thread. I'll wait, forever, and so will you, because using a piece of shit source like an anonymous 4Chan "Nostradamus" that can't even predict the weather breaks every rule in the sidebar. You fuckers almost ruined pizzagate with that horse shit. If you would just stick to the rules in the sidebar, and stay the fuck out of pizzagate, none of this would have happened.
