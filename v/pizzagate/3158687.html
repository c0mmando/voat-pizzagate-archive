<blockquote>
<p>Police in the Dominican Republic have arrested a Haiti orphanage founder who\'s accused of molesting boys in his care.</p>
<p>National police spokesman Col. Frank Felix Duran Mejia confirmed Saturday that Michael Geilenfeld was taken into custody. He did not say whether any charges had been filed and declined to specify whether Geilenfeld would be extradited to the U.S. or another country.</p>
<p>Seven men have accused Geilenfeld of sexually abusing them as boys.
Geilenfeld is a U.S. citizen who contends the assertions have ruined his reputation, cost the Hearts with Haiti charity several million dollars in donations and led him to be falsely imprisoned for 237 days.</p>
<p>An abuse survivors group said Friday that Geilenfeld had fled to the Dominican Republic to avoid arrest and prosecution in Haiti.</p>

              Reviewed June 1, 2014 I stayed there pre earthquake. And vowed never to support it again. The feeling that the kids were "paraded" all over the states to sing and dance essentially for their keep is uncomfortable. Also once these kids stop being cute then what and how do they make a living? No trades are taught. No important life skills. Also have a feeling that the scent of abuse is there. Having been abused. One smells or feels the icky vibe. For those oblivious. It's probably enchanting. For those with eyes. Not. When in doubt as I was. I chose an accommodation that didn't have that vibe.

             ..Seems in 2013 Embassy officer Brian Yee Hoyt was dispatched to 'investigate' but apparently did nothing (I havent read the court documents yet) seems to have been a Clinton appointee and has worked in twice Haiti and the Balkans under Hillary-hand Victoria Nuland (who covered up an adoption fraud in Ghana and the Belgian pedo-ambassador with Patrick Kennedy iirc)

            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            A federal appeals court has ruled against a Raleigh-based charity and the founder of an orphanage in Haiti who together had won a defamation lawsuit in New England, only to see that ruling reversed on appeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Hearts with Haiti and Michael Geilenfeld won a $14.5 million verdict in 2015 against Paul Kendrick of Maine.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Kendrick began an internet campaign in 2011 accusing Geilenfeld of sexually abusing children in his care at facilities operated by his organization, St. Joseph Family. Hearts with Haiti acts as the U.S. financial wing of St. Joseph Family, collecting donations on behalf of the organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            But last summer, a federal judge ruled that Geilenfeld lacked grounds to sue in the United States because he wasn’t living in the country when he filed the lawsuit. A federal appeals court in Boston upheld that decision last week, reaffirming the dismissal of the defamation lawsuit and the order that Kendrick pay damages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alan Stone, the president of the Hearts with Haiti board of directors, called the court’s decision disappointing, but says it doesn’t change the jury’s decision that Kendrick defamed the charity and Geilenfeld.
