<p>has an enviable reputation as the CEO of Indian politicians.278 Naidu</p>
<p>has carefully groomed an international image as a businessman–</p>
<p>statesman, who governs Andhra Pradesh via his laptop, while making</p>
<p>Andhra Pradesh’s capital city, Hyderabad, into “Cyberabad,” an</p>
<p>international center for information technology (“IT”).279 Naidu’s</p>
<p>reputation stemmed from his advocacy of a certain kind of</p>
<p>globalization for Andhra Pradesh, whereby the workings of</p>
<p>government would be modernized through the use of IT, and the</p>
<p>government would nurture the growth of a globally-connected,</p>
<p>private IT industry. **Naidu has associated himself with major Western</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We also hear from David Smolin, who is featured in the Mother Jones story because he adopted children from India who were not orphans. Their mother was tricked into giving up her rights to the two girls. Eventually they told David and his wife they were not orphans. So the Smolins traveled to India and found the girls\' parents. Now Smolin, who teaches law at Samford University in Alabama, is an advocate for adoption reform.</p>
