<p>In a study of 57 ritual abuse cases it was discovered that 97% of perpetrators fell into four large occupational categories; 35% were professionals, either doctors or lawyers, 25% were teachers, 22% priests and ministers, and 15% were police officers. These professions have one thing in common - they attract people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</p>
<p>Narcissism, while it may have a genetic or cultural component (i.e being taught from an early age that they are superior), usually develops in childhood as a coping mechanism due to an adversarial environment. It’s very likely that these people suffered some form of abuse themselves in childhood/ adolescence. To mediate tensions cause by their environment while growing up they developed a FALSE SELF. A bit like a child who thinks they can fly to the moon, is God like, or all powerful, these people live in a fantasy world divorced from reality where their fake concocted personality called the “False Self” reigns supreme. In essence a Narcissist always remains as a malformed child in an adults’ body.</p>
<p>The &quot;False Self&quot; is based on feedback from others, kind of like a hall of mirrors. They need constant feedback from others to maintain the false beliefs about themselves, and their mental stability. Attention (known as &quot;Narcissistic Supply&quot;) is an essential component of the Narcissists personality – without it they would collapse. Narcissists are addicted to attention, adulation, affirmation, applause, obedience, or even notoriety and being feared.</p>
<p>Narcissists are clustered and concentrated in the teaching profession, among the clergy, medical profession, politics, law enforcement and the judiciary. They gravitate to these professions in order to garner Narcissistic Supply. Narcissist seeks to interact with people from a position of superiority, from a position of advantage, from a position of authority.</p>
<p>All Narcissists operate within what is known as a Narcissistic Pathological Space. This is a geographical area in which they derive Narcissistic Supply (adulation, accolades, fame &amp; celebrity) used by the narcissist to regulate his or her sense of self-worth. They gravitate and migrate towards certain professions in order to construct these self-enclosed spaces, where they are divine, god like figures and they have a coterie of fans, admirers, followers and devotees.</p>
<p>They are addicted to Narcissistic Supply and like a junky, they don’t care if they’re liked or hated so long as they get their fix – in this case “attention”. Being an addict the narcissist tends to peruse an ever larger dose of narcissist supply. He seeks more adoration and even bigger fix of attention while gradually loosing what’s left of his moral constraints. The people who place these predators in a position of power act as though they are Co-Dependants stuck in a cycle of abuse.</p>
<p>Through time the Narcissists &quot;False Self&quot; supplants the real self - the ego/ super ego in a health individual. The False Self replaces the executive function carried out by the EGO in a normal person which mediates between the inner landscape and the outside world. Because the False Self is a concoction, a fake construct, it is not grounded in reality it fails the reality test. Hence, it fails the Narcissist – it’s not working most of the time!</p>
<p>Dehumanization and Objectification (Abuse)</p>
<p>People have a need to believe in the empathic skills and basic good-heartedness of others. By dehumanizing and objectifying people – the narcissist attacks the very foundations of human interaction. This is the &quot;alien&quot; aspect of narcissists – they may be excellent imitations of fully formed adults but they are emotionally absent and immature. Abuse is so horrid, so repulsive, so phantasmagoric – that people recoil in terror. It is then, with their defenses absolutely down, that they are the most susceptible and vulnerable to the narcissist\'s control. Physical, psychological, verbal and sexual abuse are all forms of dehumanization and objectification.</p>
<p>Child abuse occurs because Narcissists are “AUTOEROTIC” in other words they are primarily attracted to themselves. A child who is a blood relative is the closest thing genetically to themselves and hence seen by the Narcissist as an extension of themselves. Because narcissists view others as mere extensions of themselves, like another organ or limb, when they have sex they are essentially masturbating inside another person.</p>
<p>Malignant Narcissism is a syndrome characterized by a narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), antisocial features, paranoid traits, and egosyntonic aggression (criticism which goes against their Ego ideal self-image can result in them becoming angry/ punishing and vindictive). Other symptoms may include an absence of conscience, a psychological need for power, and a false sense of importance (grandiosity). Essentially they have the GOD complex – Omnipotent (unlimited power), Omnipresent (everywhere), Omniscient (all knowing/ all seeing eye).</p>
<p>Malignant Narcissists require constant attention to validate themselves and are pathological liars because subconsciously they are always lying to themselves. The “False Self” is adapted to whatever Pathological Narcissistic Space they currently inhabit. Question them about something bad they did in their past and they will react with disbelief/ indignation, because that’s the actions of a different “False Self” which operated at a different time/ in possibly a different pathological space. This is why they appear to have been taken over by entities, or been &quot;body snatched&quot;, but in reality it’s just a psychodynamic of Narcissism. They rarely accept responsibility for their actions (&quot;alloplastic defenses&quot;). This often leads to antisocial behavior, cover-ups, and criminal activities on a mass scale.</p>
<p>A high level of Narcissism often overlaps into Psychosis. Aliens/ Entities/ Religion/ Satanism are just a way to rationalize it. Psychosis is when a person experiences a hallucinogenic episode while awake, due to the spontaneous release of a naturally occurring chemical in the brain called DMT (Di-Methyl-Tryptamine). DMT is produced by the Pineal gland but is normally heavily buffered to prevent release. DMT is released at times of birth, at death and near death experience (NDE). But also high stress can break down the &quot;security system&quot; and allow the production of DMT. Religious chanting, satanic ceremony or a major life event/ trauma could cause this to occur. People who have experienced a spontaneous DMT trip, or who have smoked DMT, have reported seeing all manner of entities, aliens, spirits, gods, patterns and processes at a cellular level. They usually report the experience as being more real than real, which is a giveaway that it’s not. They usually believe that what they experienced was REAL. It’s likely that they are just experiencing a powerful Hallucination who’s primarily function is to ease the passage of death.</p>
<p>Hitler was remotely diagnosed as having Narcissistic Personality Disorder by Psychoanalyst - Erich Fromm. Malignant Narcissists are intrinsically irrational and dangerous (especially to children). By comparison Psychopathy, which is genetic in nature, is a cold logical state, where the motivation is the best logical outcome from any given set of parameters (except when threatened or not in control). A Psychopath views children as mini-humanoids - small human robots. Children don\'t work, have limited knowledge and aren\'t sexually mature - so essentially they are useless to a Psychopath. Psychopaths like Money and to an extent power but are not interested in attention. Psychopaths are not narcissistic unless being so makes it easier to achieve some goal. Psychopaths are not interested in people unless they have some purpose for the Psychopath. &quot;Either you\'re of use OR you\'re in the way&quot;. Whereas Narcissists NEED people and their attention to mediate their precariously balanced &quot;False Self&quot; personality.</p>
<p>The Malignant Narcissist have a desire to destroy and hurt people that goes way beyond any logical benefit/ gain to themselves. In fact, as Dr Steve Pieczenik states Hillary and Co are &quot;very self-destructive people&quot; - they almost want to be caught and punished. The narrative runs &quot;If I were not so special, people would not persecute me so.&quot; and &quot;Persecution is evidence of my uniqueness.&quot;</p>
<p>Gill Stribling-Wright an ex-BBC producer who worked with Jimmy Savile over 30 years said: &quot;I once had the conversation with him (Savile) about the perfect crime. And he said, the problem is it’s not a perfect crime unless you can get the Kudos for having committed the perfect crime, but the second you get the kudos for having committed the perfect crime i.e. by telling somebody, it’s then no longer the perfect crime.&quot; Gill Stribling-Wright goes on to say: &quot;I sometimes wonder if he was teasing the world in an effort to be discovered.”</p>
<p>I HAVE SEEN THE ENEMY &amp; IT IS I</p>
<p>It is believed that Narcissists exist in a permanent state of internalized RAGE, but are unaware of it. And that this rage is all-consuming, pervasive, unrequited and diffused.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen the enemy and it is I - and this should be every Narcissist motto. His rage is self rage, his hatred is self hatred. And his denial of his self-aggression is what makes him such a menace to others. He has to displace these self-destructive very dangerous emotions - by torturing others he avoids torturing himself.&quot;

            It was an example. My point is valid that being sociopathic or not is not black and white, but shades of grey. Mother Theresa's life is irrelevant. I was using her as an example. I could have used fictional charterers and the point would have been the same.

            Exactly what I was thinking, this is not relevant. Instead of trying to understand our enemy (there evil, calculated, sick, yes we know this, thats enough), lets get to the fucking point and hunt these fuckers, and people may argue that well you need to understand your enemy to catch them, ummmm no you fucking dont. You need to follow the crumb trail, digging.

            Right. Did someone pee on your cheerios this morning? You are not an imbecile and can do your own research. I can provide the relevant papers but why should I as you are more than capable to fetch them yourself. Don't know about rule #2 but you just broke the Wheatons Law. Does it get tiresome to polish that shining armor of moral righteousness? Does it?

            I believe that sociopathy and altruism are opposite ends of the same spectrum. Everyone falls somewhere on the spectrum. If you put Mother Theresa on the altruistic end and Hitler on the sociopatic end, everyone else will fall somewhere in between. Most people would help a friend, or family member who was in need. Some would help at the expense of their own needs, but some would only help if it did not hurt them. The former are towards the altruistic end and the latter are toward the sociopatic end. Both would probably be considered normal in psychiatric terms. People who want to be admired or who think that they should lead while others follow are further toward the sociopathic end and probably outside of the normal range.

            Nice piece, though the DMT-angle is BS. Narcissists are generally scared shitless by the DMT-experience, as it shows them how incredibly insignificant they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have the hypothesis that narcissists are actually less-evolved humans, as they lack empathy. They are still functioning mostly in lizard-brain-mode (Timothy Leary would call that the 2nd circuit), which is mainly pre-occupied with group hierarchy, mammalian tribal politics and ritualized thinking. This explains their obsession with power. As human beings become more evolved, their ability to show empathy increases as their interest in power wanes. The paradox is that the "lesser" human beings, because of their lack of empathy and hunger for power, are still very much in control over the "more evolved" human beings, as they lack the inclination to "top" the lizard-brain.

            Really feels like you nailed something very important there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember reading about a similar thing called "Autogynephilia" in trans people. In fact it's kind of the dirty secret of the clear separation between the classic "X trapped in a Y's body" cases and what everyone feels to be the sexual perversion or "kink" version of it. The latter cases deriving some sexual excitement from being perceived as female, but still having cocks and still wanting to fuck actual females. I bring this up, because during Gamergate, several well known SJW "women" were actually this "perverse" type of Trans person, and were outed with having either pedophilic tendencies towards little girls or had raped female allies who felt compelled to go along with the assault due to SJW conditioning that "marginalized people" must never be judged or held to account for their anti-social behavior. I thought it added an extra layer of camouflage for the pedo myself, as within our culture it is less taboo for an adult "female" to have attraction to female children, than a grown man, still possessed of big hairy cock and balls to have a similar bent. But your description seems to tie it into the narcissistic state more completely.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anybody cares: the two creeps I can name off the top of my head are Sarah Butts and Lorelei from the anti-Gamergate side of that particular shitfight. Their presence, and the tolerance shown within that community, was my first exposure to how progressives will aggressively provide sanctuary  for out and out predators, while damning regular guys for any and everything. Butts is the open pedophile. There are more of them in the progressive ranks though, receiving safe harbor.

             This is a good point, but I think what really makes it effective camouflage is not that people see them as women but because they are trans. If you are trans for SJWs you are literally
             <em>
              the
             </em>
             most oppressed, anyone who criticizes you for anything must be a horrible person. As you saw during pizzagate, if you call a dude who says he's a woman a pedo (even when you have proof) the immediate response is HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT TRANS WOMEN ARE PEDOPHILES?! BIGOT! There are feminist news sites (one in particular) that have written long and glowing pieces about trans inmates in male prisons and how awful it is for them, what a violation of their rights etc - without noting the crime for which they were imprisoned, often sexual assault and in one case at least
             <em>
              the rape and murder of a little girl
             </em>
             . People literally make the argument about trans pedos and rapists that "even if he did it (which generally SJWs won't even entertain unless there's concrete proof), it shouldn't be discussed because it will encourage transphobia".

            Pedos are pedos because they were molested and/or raped as kids themselves. Their innocence got taken away. There for the only thing that excites them is taking away innocence of others.

                      Ok. Satanists took over the Church somewhere along the 1400. All satanists take orders from the jew elders. Who will all be dead in 20 years at least.

            I have often said that anyone who wants to be in the public spotlight, (actors/entertainers, politicians, sports figures, religious leaders) must have sociopathic tendencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are the people who we hear about being involved in things like this. Now, I do realize that 100's of "average Joes" are pedos too and we just don't hear about them being arrested, but the percentage of public figures who are probably pedos seems to be much higher than average.
