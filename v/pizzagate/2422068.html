<p>First,
I DIDNT LINK TO  this voat post bc it\'s archived but it\'s:
Found PEDO SYMBOLS in the movie &quot;Daddys Home&quot; starring Will Ferrell who we know was at the cannibal dinner!! Feedback please??</p>
<p>It only had three upvotes. It was observant post , talked about the movie DADDYS HOME full of pedo symbols and a CHARITY CALLED </p>
<p>Courage Hearts</p>
<p>Back to TWITTER</p>
<p>Now trending today on Twitter is a bunch of different things as Usual like Wednesday wisdom and id rather walk over Legos... For whatever reason..
Legos= kids 
Walking on them = pain 
Legos also being  brightly colored</p>
<p>Im finding they go together as</p>
<p>it\'s Also trending in Google that Will Ferrel said Democrats like Bush and war more  now., something like that, Ferrel specifically said &quot;Dick Cheney\'s Heart is made of Legos...&quot; Ok 
<a href="https://ibb.co/eOMV5x">https://ibb.co/eOMV5x</a>
Heart transplants
Heart progress</p>
<p>btw question which one had the hunting accident?</p>
<p>Now what\'s Also trending on Twitter , is DICKS SPORTING GOODS  and that purports to be about guns and the NRA.</p>
<p>I say read what you want to read. Keeping in mind. Dicks sporting goods sounds like HUNTING.</p>
<p>Associate words
DICK = penis
 Dick = dick cheney</p>
<p>Pizza Hut = pizzagate, all of it from the CHILDREN TO THE blood drinking to the harvesting of organs TO the real MONEY</p>
<p>Capital Hill  now trending... A message to DC</p>

<p>That was earlier.
This Theory Twitter Trends are Message to different factions as Q tweets are messages to patriots .</p>
<p>I think it ( this ccommunications ) does move fast and you would have to be current to be in the info war/battle so to speak, 
Maybe this is part of why the heavy censorship</p>
<p>To prevent real 
Answering even just real commenting  on the current trend 
which is the current message . </p>
<p>But like the alphabet has only 26 letters, these current Twitter trends have to have a cap of surreality, after that they seem fake to everyone. </p>
<p>This bothered me before  because  Twitter is sancuary to activist pedos who other voat posters say are avressive in going after happens children, thru Twitter, I believe things like Winnie the Pooh  day hashes are used to the pedos afvantage. Not to mention Winnie  the POOH Symbolism. </p>
<p>Things you would never pick up on till JAMES ALEFANTIS was exposed in turn exposing  alot of the bad going on in the world .</p>
<p>This post idea hit me as Yesterday was trending on twiitter, Pancakeday which I didn\'t think of </p>
<p>I hadn\'t really gotten solid on this perspective yet </p>
<p>till getting a follower that made my skin crawl.</p>
<p>All the recent follows I\'ve gotten seem so fake that I check every one, cause it\'s inorganic compared to how it used to be. </p>
<p>This idea occurred to me yesterday but has been irking me since the bannings and shadow bannings. </p>
<p>I noticed the girl in thie account photo (here)  is a child with a padded bra. This is a screenshot only :
