<p>I didn\'t think Alefantis acted the role of Majestic Ape because I thought he was fit and his body didn\'t match the body of the dumpy female character that is Majestic Ape. Now check this video taken in 2015 at 14:33 - a picture I\'ve never seen before. Alefantis body looks a whole lot like Majestic Ape\'s body. <a href="http://thekojonnamdishow.org/audio/#/shows/2016-11-30/pizza-propaganda-the-local-fallout-from-fake-news/92750/@00:00">http://thekojonnamdishow.org/audio/#/shows/2016-11-30/pizza-propaganda-the-local-fallout-from-fake-news/92750/@00:00</a></p>
<p>Now check out these close ups of Majestic Ape\'s mouth - gosh it rings a bell. close up, it doesn\'t look like a woman\'s mouth after all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZkojrcD_0IYouTubeYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZkojrcD_0IYouTubeYouTube</a> This video also states J. Comet is 5\'6&quot; tall, 160 pds. No supporting documentation, but if true a small stature could account for how Majestic Ape looks like a sort of &quot;dumpy&quot; female when covered in loose clothing while J. Comet looks more fit.  Also many of his fit photos I\'m realizing are older. With awkard clothes and a bra I suppose his drag could transform him into a dumpy broad pretty easily. He is partial to heavy crocheted pieces and flats, which really don\'t do a thing for his figure.</p>
<p>Voice - here is a recent radio interview with both Alefantis and Kleinman. Hearing Kleinman\'s actual voice and comparing it directly with Alephantis\', he sounds a lot more like the voice, speech pattern and accent of Majestic Ape in the notorious &quot;He Likes Children - Every One Has Preferences&quot; video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbAYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbAYouTube</a></p>
<p>You can stop the action right at the begining of this video to see Alefantis\' mouth and compare it to Majestic Ape. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbAYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbAYouTube</a></p>

            I'm revisiting this thread in sharing it after quite some time pungent weed;   I have to say the way you characterized U THE ONE I WANT writing "like put the kid on acid and play this song/video as
            <strong>
             a taunt from a demon coming for their soul
            </strong>
            -your soul is the one i want" has actually never left me.  Also your concise
            <strong>
             "do not love, just violate" for I NO LUV
            </strong>
            .  These are the true and succinct summations of the evil wearing the trappings of this "art".

             Look at the bigger picture.  It isn't a person, it is an entire culture centered around DC.  Everyone is a powerbroker on some level, even the low levels.  They all trade in corruption - trafficking, money laundering, drug running, and the bribes and favors that make the system go around. Even if you are just an office worker, you see the paperwork and by not coming forward you are implicated.  The restauranteurs play host to a depraved audience of high rollers and know who sits with who.  All the lawyers, the accountants, bankers, hoteliers and even hairdressers are implicated by keeping quiet about what they know. The artists show the depravity and it is celebrated.  This was for this millieu an edgy comic routine at a dive place that was also a hub of power.  49th most powerful player in DC ran the place - the slums of power.

             It is US who have been blind to this reality for so long, that it has fourished to this degree.  If an outsider came in and beat up Maj A, another would replace.   This is the reality.

              I can't remember. By time I was ready to post that information, I had already forgotten. I vaguely remember getting from this forum, though.

            Here is an extra tangential thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            On that Flickr page, I read the caption, and looked up information on the art show. It wasn't super revealing, but all of the images that I saw had the same vibe that we have seen so far. The most interesting photo was of a weird fake animal. It was made up of a golden human mannequin arm. This is just more evidence that shows us what James A. is attracted to.

            I'll read the post again, but you've mixed up the first and third link, I think. Shouldn't they be swapped?

             thanks for alerting me - I checked and you are right, the links are all mixed up.  I have to say that is weird because I am meticulous and have posted that more than once and it was ok.  So if the links get mixed up again...  Anyway this should be better.  I ditched the video which I couldn't find right away and just put in a picture from the same event instead.

            Consider Alefantis' so called movie "Automatic..." (something, can't remember) that may replicate the basic idea of Marquis de Sade's "Justine" as well as his involvement in some documentary about the internet kid that cried for Britney Spears (an alleged mind control slave).  If these other productions went against the MK Ultra grain, I'd point that out.  But they don't, they build on the picture.

            Hi - thanks very much for your thoughtful reply.  The clear MK Ultra aspect of this whole thing is what initially terrified me into wanting to say something.  If Alefantis is indeed the same as Majestic Ape or usually is except for an occassional sit in by "beard" Amanda Kleinman, it is very signgificant because we know he is definitely speaking and making art about pedos.  That goes very contrary to his public image of just a philanthropic guy that runs a local gay and kid friendly community hub.  That would also influence the perception of CPP as just an innocent pizza place where some "punk" bands play.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis has called himself an artist, and I believe he is the producer of the Apes videos, which is the cover for an MK Ultra production facility.  Tell me if you see any of this snapping into place.  Therre is a video of Majestic Ape sitting at a big executive desk, running things in an "undersea"/underground bunker.  Many of the videos are used to "normalize and seduce" politicians who may or may not have the proclivity into taking the plunge into the type of activity that will both compromise them, and open their careers up to the benefits of being on the inside.  Also they are used to condition and sexualize the children.  Also pedo parties have to have music, and I think they really vibe off of the terror, fear and decadence of the videos.  Majestic Ape sitting at an executive's desk in an underground (undersea) bunker illustrates his own view of himself as one of the top 50 Most Powerful People in DC.

            If you watch that video closely, the closeups of the face reveal a very masculine set of lips, with possible facial hair shadow.  Shots a little wider show a more feminine "Ape", especially when you look at the neckline.  The hands look like two different hands in the video.  Entirely unproven.  Just what I'm seeing.

            Here is a theory - what if Alefantis is bi-whatever-pedo?  Maybe he is banging Amanda Kleinman and their "schtick" is to swap in and out of the role of "Majestic Ape."  Maybe the whole abortion thing wa their story. Why not?

            Listening to the nightclub performance, even through all the voice scrubbing, it still doesn't sound like a woman processed to a man.  Something about.

            And in other weird news - The Apes.  I can't tell man/woman:

            That'd be big because he'd be talking about himself using this 'character' and said Jimmy likes children.
