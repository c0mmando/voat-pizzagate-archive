<p>TOYFREAKS VIEWERS SAY “ALLAH AKBAR” Comments seem Pizza Related - References to Barcelona Terror, &quot;Selling P***y&quot;, $8 million and Weird Meetings <a href="http://www.readwipedandblew.com/2017/10/06/toyfreaks-viewers-say-allah-akbar/">http://www.readwipedandblew.com/2017/10/06/toyfreaks-viewers-say-allah-akbar/</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uOF0YImgur">https://imgur.com/a/uOF0YImgur</a> Album</p>
<p>I had the displeasure of finding last night several more weird comments on the video he posted last week. Please see the previous 10 or so articles and screenshot dumps on the website. There are numerous other threads on Voat that are related to this investigation. Just search for them or look at my account history. I am posting these here because they seem terror related, and creep me out badly. Seems that a lot of Arabs are attracted to those girls. Is he selling them to Arabs?? Or are they just really into  child porn or do they just like looking?</p>

<p>This is related to Pizzagate / Elsagate because the children are for sale, they are doing SRA on the kids and pushing it on our kids. I believe the missing girl Lisa Irwin is the younger of the two girls on the videos. </p>
<p>Someone on the video I posted above posted in Arabic Allah Akbar, then they said congrats on the $8 million, then they said Rochelle degenerate Barcelona hairs, something about selling pussy and embarrassing himself, and meeting with his mother and father. </p>
<p>It\'s all very strange and I have already reported him multiple times. These comments about Barcelona (where there was a terror attack) made me feel uneasy.</p>',
