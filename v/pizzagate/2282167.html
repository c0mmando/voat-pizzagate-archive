            One of the first thing Scientolonuts do is separate children from parents.  LRH had no relationship with some of his children.

             Leah Remini talks about how she went to get her child from the children's quarters at Scientology, where the children looked undernourished, dirty, dishevelled and she had to get that child out of there.

            All Scientologist are insane lunatics who give all of their time and money to a fucking cult. The people at the top know it's all bullshit; it's just a cover for them to be protected by the veil of a "religious organization" while they do MK-Ultra on members and rape children according to their Thelemic/Talmudic belief structure.

            Scientology most likely has connections to MKUltra and peodphile rings.
            <a href="https://ia800206.us.archive.org/14/items/DavidMcGowanProgrammedToKill_201603/David-McGowan-Programmed-to-Kill.pdf#page=150">
             Dave McGowan documented in
             <em>
              Programmed to Kill
             </em>
            </a>
            that L. Ron Hubbard was an occultist and likely a spook, whose Church of Scientology was built on the same principles as Aleister Crowley. Both Charles Manson and David "Son of Sam" Berkowitz had affiliations with Scientology; Berkowitz even had the phone number of the Scientology training center at Clearwater FL in his possession. A breakaway group from Scientology, the Process Church, also had an important role in the Manson and Son of Sam killings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also interesting is the fact that Greta Van Susteren, an infamous Scientologist, was the lawyer for Henry Vinson, who ran the DC escort ring that was busted in 1989. Vinson provided escorts to Craig Spence, and in doing so, he learned about the Franklin pedophile network that Spence was operating with Larry King in Omaha. He accused Susteren of selling him out: encouraging him to take a deal with the government to stay silent, and then not even attending his debriefing with federal investigators.

             I don’t know how they cover it up but I know how my abuse was covered up. They always have doctors lawyers judges people work in the court houses, people that destroy records. They are very very intelligent people you’re dealing with. I was abused in two cults...one generational and one was the Roman Catholic   Church. Generational meaning I was born into it

            Given LRH's close association with Crowley, Parsons (Satanists) = cannibal cabal
and the unwillingness of local and federal authorities to DO anything about their criminal and tortious behavior,
does it not stand to reason that Scientology is an open MK-ULTRA type (or actual) project and the cabal gets a big cut of the $$$?

            If you haven't watched Leah Remini's show, you should.  She focused on child abuse this season.  The shit that's happened to children in this cult is horrifying.  Not just the sexual abuse, but the daily mindfuck that's laid on both children and parents.

             Leah's show is great but I can't help but think that Hollywood has an agenda allowing scientology to be exposed. Perhaps it's to deflect away from the ancient Jewish kabbalah?

              That would make sense. They definitely can't have the masses finding out that fake "Jewish" mysticism is the basis of almost all of this Satanic mind control shit. Because "Jews" are victims, remember? That's all they are; they're
              <em>
               never
              </em>
              the perpetrators of evil deeds.
             </p>
             <p>
              It must be nice to be a Fake Jew. You can literally do whatever you want and just use the real Jewish people as a never-ending shield to hide your depravity from the world.

              If you are worried about my feelings, don't.  I have read just about everything you can think of.  After the  SRA Victim that posted on here this weekend I read it all, not to mention the pineal glands of the penguins that they are now using.  Blach!  These Zombies (I can't call them human) are like those in The Night of The Living Dead.  They are programmed to do sick evil things and need to be eradicated from this earth.

            I have read about LDS being connected to Scientology.  They are both cults and I have read that Mitt Romney is involved in some way.  If he is then I wish someone would do a post on it.  That would really bring out the shills.  Yes, they will be on here like cockroaches.

             CIA heavily recruits from LDS. From what I was told, it's because Mormons can keep secrets.

             LDS also has their fingers into the Boy Scouts. I think shining a light in their direction could be beneficial.

             Yes, the LDS, but moreso I think, the FLDS, with their illustrious nutcase, jailed and convicted leader, Jeffs.

              Yes, Warren Jeffs is evil.  And so is Mitt Romney.  His family goes way back within the Mormons.
