<p>If you were a normie would it be weird if I connected them? Like say your favorite YouTube channel out of the blue did a Pizzagate video and linked to Voat. Would it seem strange? Curious and would like an opinion. Operation Containment means alot to me as I have many fans that have followed me for years. However I keep getting the desire to redpill them. Would you be angry or how would you react?</p>
