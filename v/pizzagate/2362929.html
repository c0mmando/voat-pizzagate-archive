<p>Everyone know by now that Stephen Paddock was the “manager” of Paradise Ranch 21 LLC</p>
<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/v/79221/B844B428-825D-4DE9-A">https://imgoat.com/v/79221/B844B428-825D-4DE9-A</a></p>
<p>And further digging, anyone can see there are MANY Paradise Ranch LLC..with numbers like 1-25+ Not sure how many and if they are all connected, but it seems kind of odd</p>
<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/v/79222/607DC99B-1F8C-4747-A32">https://imgoat.com/v/79222/607DC99B-1F8C-4747-A32</a></p>
<p>Here’s an older thread pointing this out as well with various “managers”. I believe if we dig through these, many of these businesses seem very vague as to what they do and the people involved may also be agents or managers of serveral “vague” companies</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210017">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/2210017</a></p>
<p>I also noticed an agent of many of these is Incorp Services, INC. when searching in the Nevada registery, normally if you click highlighted names, it redirects you to info of that person or company. Strange when clicking on Incorp, you get this “server error”</p>
<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/033ab37c30/79817.pngPNG">https://imgoat.com/uploads/033ab37c30/79817.pngPNG</a></p>
<p>So digging further into Incorp, it shows them an agent a ton of companies in many states, some with addresses back to Nevada and same “location” as Paddocks Paradise Ranch 21 registered address. Maybe they are all a bunch of satillite offices, who knows. But look through these and notice how many are registered to the same Nevada address yet located all over the US</p>

<p>One guy i found has three of these LLCs. Not sure who he is or if anyone has come across him yet. If so, please share the info</p>

<p>Some how I landed in a search in Indiana, mainly because I kept reading people saying Indiana is a hub for trafficking/CP activity. It lead me to some guy that is a lawyer/agent for another Paradise Ranch but it didn’t have a number like Paradise Ranch 1 LLC just plain Paradise Ranch</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiana-register.com/person/robert-nice">https://www.indiana-register.com/person/robert-nice</a></p>
<p>I almost closed that search but noticed he is a treasurer for Primus Telecommunications, INC in Toronto? Why would a lawyer in Indiana be the treasurer for a company in Canada. I also noticed he was an agent for many odd ball companies. Reminded me of the Andrew Kline deal for CPP. Anyway, I decided to see what Primus was.......its nickname.......P.I.E We know another P.IE. pedophile information exchange. And it appears, you need passwords to enter. I have a very strange suspicion, if dug deeper, Primus would be connected as well to 88-90 Hampstead servers where CP was found during the jewelry heist. I don’t know that but my gut is telling me this.</p>

<p>So...further looking, I came across this page</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiana-register.com/337411-primus-telecommunications-inc">https://www.indiana-register.com/337411-primus-telecommunications-inc</a></p>
<p>If you look at “related companies” there’s many that have Prince Albert, Prince Alexander and many “royalty” names. We know Canada is British so there’s that.</p>
<p>I then looked at Michael Nowlan and this came up- both Primus and Lingo, Inc</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiana-register.com/person/michael-nowlan">https://www.indiana-register.com/person/michael-nowlan</a></p>
<p>Lingo Inc-again Indiana and Canada ties. I know this can be the case for many companies.</p>
