<p>Mari/<em>Ghislaine Maxwell</em> has evidence. Proof. Receipts.

<p>A country whose ruling dictator/<em>Hugo Chavez</em> (and his protégé/<em>Nicolas Maduro</em>) happily took bribes to look the other way as drugs, rapes, and crimes went on — many involving young, poor, local boys and girls. None of whom had a voice to fight back or stand up. When “wranglers” would round up these boys and girls for things like “casting parties”, “pageants”, or just part-time jobs — the parents (if any existed) and social services officials were paid off. They were told it was “just a little part time work so take the ridiculous amounts of cash, and shut up”. If they didn’t? Well…they had already heard stories of “THAT place”.</p>
<p>But a strange thing began to happen that upset the parties at the foreign compound/estate. First, their pal — the dictator/<em>Chavez</em> — passed away in March 2013. Followed by much upheaval in the country. It would be a while until the protégé dictator/<em>Maduro</em> came in to settle things down (somewhat) in April 2013. Then, some reporters and investigators began asking questions. Nothing specific, just noticing things — and people, visiting. The cover stories of humanitarian work and environmental work were very thin. But bribes helped them cover up a lot. And when nosy people began “disappearing” there? That helped them too.</p>
<p>So around the time the Monster/<em>Epstein</em> began facing legal trouble in America, his foreign place/<em>Venezuela</em> was locked down. It would be quite a while until Mari/<em>Maxwell</em> could return without attention.</p>
<p>When she did, however, she noticed that the security guards had abandoned the estate. It was unprotected, and had been broken into. Worse for her, she soon discovered a LOT of missing items. Not just valuables, but an ENTIRE SAFE. Removed from a permanent location built into the house. Someone had removed the entire unit. In it were things that Monster/<em>Epstein</em> and Mari/<em>Maxwell</em> had counted on for protection, blackmail, or to help preserve themselves if they ever got pinched. Mari/<em>Maxwell</em> could not even tell Monster/<em>Epstein</em> for a long while. But she knew it could spell the end for them, and many others.</p>

            But a strange thing began to happen that upset the parties at the foreign compound/estate. First, their pal — the dictator/
            <em>
             Chavez

             Venezuela

            was locked down. It would be quite a while until Mari/

             Maxwell
            </em>
            could return without attention.

           <p>
            When she did, however, she noticed that the security guards had abandoned the estate. It was unprotected, and had been broken into. Worse for her, she soon discovered a LOT of missing items. Not just valuables, but an ENTIRE SAFE. Removed from a permanent location built into the house. Someone had removed the entire unit. In it were things that Monster/

            had counted on for protection, blackmail, or to help preserve themselves if they ever got pinched. Mari/

            for a long while. But she knew it could spell the end for them, and many others.

             I think she will end up dead as well. If you are a Prime Minister or leader of a Middle Eastern country, to what lengths will you go to? She is disposable just like Epstein. Much like my ex wife( disassociated mind control victim) she has no great big WOW factor or any charisma and I don't see all her supposed friends wanting to help her at this stage. WHO IS BEHIND MAXWELL is the question. Now we get into Rothschild's and others that pull all the money strings.Shit , maybe Satan himself if he/she has managed to acquire a human body at this point (through DNA and transhuman manipulations). Not entirely serious but who knows?

            This is one of those stories that you have to put in perspective.  This falls into the gift that keeps on giving category qhich makes it highly suspicious. I am convinced Epstein is MOSSAD and haven't once in the last few days, really believed that he is dead. I'm actually pretty surprised so many people bought into his demise, arguing about whether he died by his own hand or was murdered.  Not too many have brought up the possibility that he might not be dead at all.
