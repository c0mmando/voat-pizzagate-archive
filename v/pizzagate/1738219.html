This trace hit me accidently while I was watching an episode of Arrested Development (S2/E6) called &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; and it lead me to a Podesta Connection I hadn\'t been aware of before. </p>
<p>At around 12:20 uncle and niece are singing &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; in a duett. Later in that same episode, aunt and nephew repeat the same stupid thing. 
This song was written 1975 by Bill Danoff. He wrote it at a Restuarant in Washington, D.C.. It was one of the very famous <strong>Clyde\'s Restuarant Group</strong> locations. The song is about sex in the afternoon and inspired by the Happy Hour Menue of Clyde\'s called &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;
Because of the fact that this took place in Washington and was used as a reference in a pedophilia scene in this episode (6 !), I felt the need to check out this restaurant group. </p>
<p>First, I\'ve checked their <a href="http://imgur.com/0hZlhbD">logo</a> which happens to have three sixes in it. Maybe a coincidence. And mybe it is even coincidentally that if you backmask the word &quot;Clyde\'s&quot; it sounds like <strong>Steak</strong>.</p>
<p>Cannibalists refer to human meat as &quot;beef&quot; or steak&quot;. 
You can check this out by reading <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Albert_Fish_letter">the Letter to the mother of Grace Budd</a>, which lead the police to the infamous Albert Fisher (from Washington D.C.!!!), known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and The Boogey Man.</p>
<p>Then there is the case of Amin Meiwes, the german cannibalist (who, by the way, had a <strong>hudge Collection of Disney Movies</strong>), who got internationally known for killing and eating another man. What shocked people the most were the facts that he ate the man\'s penis and that he described it somehow romantically and called the meat &quot;Steak&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I decorated the table with nice candles,’ he said. ‘I took out my best dinner service, and fried and piece of <strong>rump steak</strong> – a piece from his back – made what I call princess potatoes, and sprouts’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there is <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/human-flesh-looks-beef-taste-more-elusive-180949562/">this disturbing article</a> about taste an cosistance of human meat.</p>
<p>Next cannabilistic coincidence:
Clyde\'s Restaurant happens to be connected to The Washington Nationals (Baseball Team). This is <a href="http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/mlb/images/team_logos/social_media/og_1200x630_image/was_1200x630.jpg">their logo </a></p>
<p>Of course, it is just a &quot;W&quot;, isn\'t it? </p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/JmwwUHl8QNw">this Youtube video</a> explaining why the &quot;w&quot; or two interlocked &quot;v&quot;s are a symbol for cannibalism. At around 8:10. </p>
<p>At their staudium the <a href="http://dcbeerfestival.com/">D.C. Beer Fest</a> took/and will take place. Organized by <strong>Dan Silberstein</strong> who I haven\'t researched yet. But I watched the video and found <a href="http://www.badabingdc.com/">Bada Bing Cheessteaks and Spiedies</a>. Their food truck caught my attention because there are so many spirals in their logo. Childlover Logo??? And it\'s all about cheese and steak. Don\'t know … </p>
<p>This whole Washington Nats Thing may be missleading. So, back to Clyde\'s:</p>
<p>Founder: Stuart C. Davidson &amp; John Laytham (1963)
Key People:
Sally Davidson (Chairman)
John Laytham (CEO)
Tom Meyer President</p>
<p>I searched the Podesta mails for them and found <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/54341">this mail from Winsome D. McIntosh</a>, mentoning <strong>Sally Davidson</strong> as a board member of <strong>Rachels Network</strong>. Their logo is a green leaf, which is one of the older symbols for pedophilia. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spTUa41pzoY&amp;list=PLrbLt75to24_ZtJe8tjabf272GPXgVDP4">The Lolita Riddle</a> for details).</p>
<p>In the invitation, McIntosh sends to Podesta, we can see that another person invited will be Nancy Pelosi. The politician who <a href="https://conservativedailypost.com/someone-forgot-to-delete-staff-list-pizza-shop-being-used-for-enemy-front/">runs the Goat Hill Pizza</a>.</p>
<p>Clyde\'s has donated to the Hillary Campaign and they are friends with so many other networks and ngos. They seam to perfectly fit into the pattern. </p>
<p>What do you think? Shall we take this rabbit hole or won\'t it take us anywhere? I suggest investigating: </p>
<ul>
<li>the people behind Clyde\'s</li>
<li>Rachels Network</li>
<li>Winsome D. McIntosh</li>
<li><a href="http://youthfortomorrow.org/">Youth of Tomorrow</a> (being supported by Clyde\'s since the ninties)</li>

            sorry, just checked my libary again. It is from his book "Magick in Theory and Praxis" and it is called the Law of Reversal.I quote the wikipedia Backmasking article now:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist Aleister Crowley, who suggested in his 1913 book Magick (Book 4) that an adept "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed".[5]&gt;

            First it is important to understand that it's not aboout technology. It is about learning to do this, like automatically. My grandmother was part of a cult and she spoke backwards a lot. She had been trained since she was a little girl So she was able doing so, even with the right sound of breathing and popping and klicking between the words and letters. It was scary. She tried to train me but my Father saved me from thoose things. If you watch a documentary about ritual abuse, you are likely to see some pictures painted by victims of the occult. Often thosse pictures have words or sentences written backwards on it.

            And secondly, it was more easy in the old days. You just needed to turn the vinyl the other way around by hand. It was mechanically. Much easier than today.

            What an interesting collection.  Some nuggets here worth looking into.  (Badabing cheesesteak logo is concerning with that puppeteering reference).

            Jonathan Keck is to be avoided in general, but I don't disagree with his W stuff.

            The "beef" reference by Fish is isolated.  PORK is the usual reference because human flesh supposedly looks, tastes, smells, and has a texture similar to pork.  That's why it's been called "long pig" for eons and is also why pork consumption is banned in conventional Judaism.  (Roasted child meat was sold after their holocaust/human sacrifice ceremonies.)

            I agree with the other poster about the reverse audio.

            is for those of you that doubt cannabolistic affects. Having an awakening of something that is incomprehensible is difficult.
           </p>
           <p>
            When something horrific happens, as modern thinkers, we focus on the why and the particulars of the villains not the true humanitarian aspect. Not focusing more on the victims than the reason whys of the villain makes it where we have created our own filter and unable to think with an open mind.
Thank you OP for posting. I am also in tune and will not let this go. Someone else mentioned to write about pizzagate on money and those little ideas keep truth seeking alive.

           <p>
            I think if any of this turns out to be true many Americans will descend on Washington DC with barbecue equipment and utensils and may literally start killing and eating any politician that in any way was ever related to any of this in the History of the Universe. Does that count as cannibalism? It seems in that case cannibalism would be justified.
           </p>
           <p>
            More importantly though, I don't own a barbecue nor plan on travelling to DC if the aforementioned is true. However I think Lowe's is having a sale on propane tanks and I might be willing to sponsor anyone with a barbecue and doesn't mind taking their vacation days early this year. Just sayin'.

            You know, some of this is interesting but you lost me at Clyde's backwards sounding like Steak and then a loose connection between a German Cannibal who referred to some of his 'food' as steak [meaning English isn't even his first language, being German myself I know we often talk crap like :'Do you have a Fire' instead of a light!, so you can't base anything on whatever this guy said and take it as evidence]. That is right out of far-far away land.
I am all for new leads on this paedo stuff, good solid stuff, but in order to be taken seriously by the broad masses, we have to refrain from coo-coo stuff that makes us look like lunatics. 
Keep going with your investigation but please forget about this backward sound thing. It's as weak as it gets.

              backmasking has to be taken seriously, because of the fact that it is a Thelema Practise, recommended by Aleister Crowley in his Liber Al vel Legis (the book of the law) and Thelema is indeed practised in those circles. Search the word thelema in the Podesta mails and you will see, Thelema is their thing.

              thoose are indeed the craziest facts anyone has ever been forced to deal with, but we should always search with open eyes and an open mind for anything we won't believe exist. IMO

            I say dig dig dig.  This is full of so many possibilities I don't know where to start.  I put nothing past these people.  They are great at hiding things, but now we are catching on.  We now know that they are hiding, but if we stop to look long  enough they are really in plain sight.
