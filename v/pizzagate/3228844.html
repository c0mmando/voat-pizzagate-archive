<p>A major British charity handed huge sums in foreign aid by the Government is alleged to have overseen the hiring of prostitutes for staff, donors and guests attending official functions.</p>
<p>International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), the world’s biggest sexual health charity, is also accused of offering young volunteers to adults at events in Africa.</p>
<p>The court documents add: ‘Young volunteers within the region were being offered to invitee guests during African gatherings and functions for sex or sexual pleasure.’</p>
<p>The revelation comes as IPPF, which employs 30,000 staff and is backed by £132 million of British aid, is embroiled in a crisis threatening its future.</p>
<p>Top staff have quit and dozens of national associations have broken away, while governance concerns have sparked threats from an international donor to stop funding.</p>
<p>The furore follows a series of abuse scandals involving leading aid charities such as Oxfam, Save The Children and World Vision, which have also seen allegations of the use of prostitutes, harassment and trading of aid for sex in relief zones.</p>
<p>The claims against IPPF emerged after The Mail on Sunday revealed in January that the charity was struggling to oust its Africa regional director, Lucien Kouakou. Whistleblowers raised fears over expenses fiddling, faked invoices and a £1 million land purchase in Nairobi. </p>
<p>There were also claims that Kouakou sent a ‘witch porn’ video featuring a snake and naked woman to a senior female colleague to intimidate her.</p>

             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1563735">
              Princess Mabel of Orange Nassau, her relationship with Arpad Busson, and her ties to Soros' OSI.
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              OSI arranged include the financial flows to the national Soros Foundations in various countries, with an emphasis on Eastern Europe, namely Soros is originally from Hungary. These East European activities, a later stage extended towards the Balkans, stimulated that Mabel got an affair with former Bosnian Foreign Minister Sacirbey, who was later charged with a flourishing arms trade with Iran. Mabel was also involved in the foundation War Child Netherlands, among others funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (during the years 2003 -2006 more than 3.7 million Euros).
             </p>
             <p>
              Given its good relations in the Balkans, it is almost certain that Mabel was a welcome partner of the national intelligence services, and perhaps secret services of other countries. (...)
             </p>
             <p>
              On the one hand Mabel tried by supporting its efforts in WarChild in Amsterdam child war victims in Bosnia, while on the other hand, also in The Hague, lobbied for arms supplies to that country, in order to corroborate her boyfriend Sacirbey. A very ambivalent attitude.

             At home, the White House has already attracted a political who’s who, from U.S. Senator Patty Murray to Mayor Ed Murray (his first mayoral fundraiser was there) to Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. In August, the state’s entire Democratic House delegation is expected to show up for a “New Dems” soiree. Nyhus also puts on a regular “CEO Salon” series and ensures that a plethora of nonprofits, from local arts and parks to global health initiatives, benefit from White House events. For example, the South Lake Union–based, globally focused PATH organization. “It’s a great gathering spot,” says PATH CEO Steve Davis. He compares the house to D.C.’s famous social circuit. “There’s usually a dinner at a very elegant home in Georgetown with a mix-and-match of people. The conversations are quite interesting because you’re sitting next to somebody who’s an ambassador from X, as well as some congressman, or some scientist working at the NIH. Roger’s house has that same feel.”

             I just finished reading Forrest Marready's
             <em>
              The Autism Vaccine
             </em>
             , which just came out after narrowly avoiding a ban by Amazon (it was saved by a petition campaign). Compares the histories of the development of vaccines and the rise of autism (as well as autoimmune disease and other neurological disorders). It's got a massive bibliography and footnotes. TL;DR vaccines don't work at all unless toxic aluminum salts are added to them to trigger a massive immune reaction. They know this, and they know how toxic aluminum is, because they use it to induce disease in research animals. You've got to read it.
            </p>
            <p>
             One tidbit I found was that the orphanage in Tuam where all the little bodies were discovered in the septic field? It was one of the institutions recruited for experimental aluminum-added diphtheria vaccine testing, after English parents refused to allow their children to receive dangerous immunizations. I shit you not.

             WaterAid is an international non-governmental organisation, focused on water, sanitation and hygiene. It was set up in 1981 as a response to the UN International Drinking Water decade (1981–1990). It operates in 34 countries as of 2018
            </p>
            <p>
             The organization was first established by the UK water industry on 21 July 1981 as a charitable trust at their main office premises in London, and established first projects in Zambia and Sri Lanka. In 2010, it became a federation[1], comprising As of 2018 members in the United Kingdom, USA, Australia, Japan, Sweden, Canada and India, and regional offices and country programmes in 27 countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia[2]. Activities involve providing people with clean water, safe sanitation and hygiene behaviour change, and advocacy with governments and water utilities. Its income has moved from £1 million per annum in 1987 to £102 million in 2017-18.

             Its president is Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, since 1991...In 1993 WaterAid began work on their 1000th project, and also agreed to fund the Hitosa Gravity Scheme in Ethiopia. The Hitosa scheme was the largest single water supply scheme implemented in Ethiopia at the time, reaching 50,000 people...

In 2006 the festival's founder Michael Eavis and his daughter Emily visited WaterAid's work in Mozambique and by 2007 130 WaterAid volunteers helped at the festival. In 2011, there were around 200 WaterAid volunteers present.[citation needed]. In 2016, by which time there were over 500 Wateraid volunteers at Glastonbury, the charity introduced Talking Toilets which gave out information voiced by celebrities such as Cerys Matthews and Brian Blessed...

He left UNICEF in June to join the newly formed U.N. Appeal for Children, which he managed and developed in fourteen European countries in 1947/48. When the Appeal was brought to an end, he became a full-time director of the Bank of London and South America. During 1948–1959 he travelled each year throughout Latin America, visiting the bank's branches.

             In 1960, he was asked to be the Executive Deputy Chairman of the Peruvian Corporation, a British company which ran the two major railways of Peru, later living in Peru in 1965-1968.  In 1968, Lubbock returned to Canada to create the Canadian Association for Latin America, a centre of research, information and guidance to Canadian companies and others wishing to develop their interests in Latin America, and a growing link with Latin American governments and businessmen. He was its Executive Director until 1976.

            <p>
             He married, first, Diana Beatrice Crawley, daughter of Henry Ernest Crawley, on May 1929 and had 5 children: Jeremy Michael Lubbock b. 4 Jun 1931, Judith Caroline Gurney Lubbock b. 4 May 1934, Jessica Rose Lubbock b. 23 Dec 1937, Joanna Lubbock b. 29 Jan 1941, John David Peter Lubbock b. 18 Mar 1945. They were divorced in 1956. She died in 1976. From 1938 to 1940 he had a romantic affair with Lady Alexandra Metcalfe.

             The main thrust of Baba's later life was her tireless efforts for the Save the Children Fund, a commitment that lasted for more than 40 years. Lady Alexandra joined the Save the Children Fund in 1950 and was very active in fund-raising in London. In 1955, she and her husband divorced and she became a member of the fund's governing council. Later she would become chairman of the Overseas Relief and Welfare Committee, which controls all overseas work of the fund. In 1974 she was elected vice-president.

                RACINE, Wis., March 24, 2017- More than four billion people occupy the base of the world’s economic pyramid and live on less than $1,500 dollars a year. These families lack access to basic goods and services, where everyday challenges can be as simple as finding clean water. Given this scale, SC Johnson, the worldwide manufacturer of trusted household consumer goods, has been supporting these communities for nearly two decades, by providing sustainable business models to raise the standard of living and provide opportunities for a better quality of life.
               </p>
               <p>
                ..SC Johnson has teamed with The Coca-Cola Company, Solarkiosk, and Society for Family Health Rwanda as a part of the EKOCENTER program, which provides safe drinking water, sanitation, solar energy, and wireless communication. EKOCENTERS are modular retail experiences, run by women operators that provide commerce of basic goods including OFF!® mosquito repellent lotion, Baygon® mosquito coils, and KIWI® shoe polish. EKOCENTERS also offer a place for community gathering and for entrepreneurs to set up business.

                , said the mobile phone industry succeeded in "cracking the BOP code." Over 2.5 billion people now have access to the phones because of industry innovations like pre-paid phone cards, which gives them access to the service regardless of income.

                Prahalad believes these examples are just the beginning. He told the WorldWatch Institute, "There is an opportunity here, but it’s not yet fully understood.... This is all about imagining the world differently. If we can not imagine a different world, we cannot create it."

K. Prahalad and Stuart Hart. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), a global coalition of 175 companies committed to sustainability, furthers the case with the recent release of a report on 14 member projects (of 66 in the works) making advances toward achieving the MDGs.

The CEE BankWatch Network, an NGO with members from 10 Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries, has compiled a laundry list of reports finding fault with the pipeline, for example potential human rights abuses in Turkey and environmental threats to sturgeon stocks in the Caspian Sea.

                  In August 1921, 39-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the time a practicing lawyer in New York, joined his family at their vacation home at Campobello, a Canadian island off the coast of Maine. As former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he had spent two weeks in mid-July in Washington, D.C., giving testimony to a Senate committee investigating a Navy scandal.[1]:247–248 On August 5, Roosevelt sailed up the New England coast with his friend and new employer, Van Lear Black, on Black's ocean-going yacht. Among those at Campobello when Roosevelt arrived were his wife Eleanor, their children, his political aide Louis Howe, Howe's wife, and their young son...On August 10, after a day of strenuous activity, Roosevelt came down with an illness characterized by fever, ascending paralysis, facial paralysis, prolonged bowel and bladder dysfunction, and numbness and hypersensitivity of the skin.[3][2]:47 Most of the symptoms resolved themselves, but he was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down...

It was an agency of the U.S. federal government created to coordinate scientific research for military purposes during WWII that also had been heavily infiltrated by Frankfurters.[28] The OSRD was also interested in psychology and psycho-acou stics — topics that were precisely in tune with Adorno’s research and area of expertise.

                Meanwhile, Hart and his colleague Erik Simanis at Cornell University's Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise advance another approach, one that focuses on the poor as business partners and innovators, rather than just as potential producers or consumers. Hart and Simanis have led the development of the Base of the Pyramid Protocol, an entrepreneurial process that guides companies in developing business partnerships with income-poor communities in order to "co-create businesses and markets that mutually benefit the companies and the communities".
                <strong>
                 This process has been adopted by the SC Johnson Company[8] and the Solae Company (a subsidiary of DuPont).

CHK’s Faith United to End Childhood Obesity will identify and organize Wisconsin faith leaders from a number of diverse faith congregations. The effort will equip and empower these community faith leaders to convene health councils and implement the five pillars of Let’s Move!: Creating a healthy start for children, empowering parents and caregivers, providing healthy food in schools, improving access to healthy, affordable foods, and increasing physical activity.

                  In 2017, SC Johnson renamed its flagship insect science research center, in Racine, Wisconsin, to honor Gene. The SC Johnson Institute of Insect Science for Family Health was established in 1957 and has grown to be one of the world’s largest private, urban entomology research centers. Researchers there have studied and advanced the sciences of insect biology, physiology, ecology, behavior and toxicology.

                <strong>
                 In August of 1961, Dr. J. Galba Araujo, a Fortaleza physician,
visited the Johnson Foundation with a proposal to convert
Villa Johnson, H.F.’s home in Brazil, into a school for the
impoverished children of Fortaleza. Dr. Araujo had known
H.F. from his many visits to Brazil to oversee the company’s
wax processing operation. They had even worked together
to establish a maternity clinic in Fortaleza.
                </strong>
                After looking at the
plan, H.F. did not feel that the villa was a good fit to use for
this purpose but was sympathetic to the idea of providing
basic education.
               </p>
               <p>
                Curtis Pringle, Managing Director of Companhia Ceras
Johnson in Fortaleza, suggested that a portion of the
company’s building could be converted and used as a school.
By 1962, the company committed a portion of its building and
a grant of $8,000 to convert the warehouse space into a
proper school complete with classrooms, kitchen, dining area
and even a clinic to provide much-needed care to the children.
               </p>
               <p>
                By the time of the school’s official dedication ceremony in
February 1963, 300 children who previously had no access to
education were enrolled at Escola Johnson. The students were
provided with a versatile curriculum, nutritional meals, and
access to the school health clinic where they received periodic
examinations and inoculations.
               </p>
               <p>
                1963–1971: SC JOHNSON SUPPORT - 
Escola Johnson was the first public elementary school in Fortaleza. It was estimated that Fortaleza, a city
with high poverty and illiteracy, was home to about 10,000 children who had no access to education or
health services. It moved the local community that a company would step up to support such an initiative for
the city and, over the years, Escola Johnson would become a model to which other Brazilian schools
aspired.
               </p>
               <p>
                1973–1978: NEW MANAGEMENT &amp;
PARTING GIFT - 
During the mid 1970s, there was massive inflation in
Brazil, and the company knew it could not maintain
the same level of support for the school as it had in
the past. The Department of Education for the State
of Ceará had taken interest in the school’s unique
programs. Escola Johnson was held in high standing
and became something of a teacher training center
for educators all over Brazil. The Department took
responsibility for the school and Escola Johnson
moved into a new building.
               </p>
               <p>
                In 1978, fourth-generation leader Sam Johnson
visited the school and saw that the facility needed
some upgrades. As a “final” gift, the company
donated $35,000 ($130,000 by today’s standards)
toward the construction of an illuminated sports
playground as well as the remodeling of the library,
cafeteria and bathrooms. This helped the growing
school, which was now up to over 1,000 children and
nearly 40 teachers and staff including a physician,
psychologist, social worker, and speech and
occupational therapists for handicapped children.
               </p>
               <p>
                1998: THE CARNAÚBA EXPEDITION
In 1998, Sam and his family returned to Escola Johnson as part of the
Carnaúba Expedition recreating H.F.’s 1935 trip to Brazil. This time
SC Johnson people banded together, raising $23,500 through the
sale of expedition merchandise. This money provided the school
with a roof for the sports court so children could play out of the sun.
SC Johnson also donated funds to fully stock the school’s three new
science laboratories.
                <strong>
                 Winnie Johnson Marquart
                </strong>
                , one of Sam's
daughters, was on hand to present these gifts to the school. Her
parting words were, “We care about the children of Escola Johnson.
We care about their education, and we care about their future.”
               </p>
               <p>
                2002–PRESENT: A RENEWED PARTNERSHIP
In 2002, Escola Johnson celebrated its 40th anniversary. Ceras Johnson in Brazil sponsored a celebratory
event attended by teachers, students and guests. Students used this event to showcase art they had made
as well as perform dances for attendees. In 2004, fifth-generation leader Fisk Johnson made a visit to the
school and was warmly received by students and faculty.
               </p>
               <p>
                SC Johnson’s subsidiary in Brazil continues to be a great support to Escola Johnson, sponsoring a mobile
dental office that provides students and the Fortaleza community with much-needed care. Ceras Johnson’s
commitment to health costs over R$100,000 annually.
                <strong>
                 The company is also working with the United Way
                </strong>
                to
potentially provide future grants to the school for renovation projects.

                What began as a small community gathering rapidly evolved into a community-wide movement in the fight against modern day slavery. Out of these meetings, Racine Coalition Against Human Trafficking was created and a partnership with RPD developed through Chief Art Howell’s leadership.

He was brought from St. Louis to Milwaukee specifically to cover up Pedogate and work with corrupt religious, business and community leaders to unite all faiths for their common corrupt agenda. They are using the homeless, elderly, disabled, abused, veterans, women and children to create programs for initial buy-in and acceptance like Racine Interfaith Coalition, Coalition for Peace and Justice, and Social Justice League campaigns for Sanctuary Cities, and are aligning with corrupt, ignorant and complicit law enforcement and media to control the investigations and the narrative.

The world needs to know the truth about Timothy Dolan, Racine, and the root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

               </p>
               <p>
                Dolan served as the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 2010 to 2013 and was granted the titular position as Cardinal-Priest of Nostra Signora di Guadalupe a Monte Mario (English: Our Lady of Guadalupe of Mount Mario) in Rome...He previously served as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 2002 to 2009, preceded by service as an Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis from 2001 to 2002.
               </p>

                While noting that the "Church has weighed in" against the war in Iraq and capital punishment, Dolan defended his silence regarding

               <p>
                In 2002, Archbishop Rigali assigned Dolan to investigate Roman Catholic priests accused of sexual misconduct in St. Louis...In a 2003 letter to Joseph Ratzinger, requesting that the process be expedited for the laicization of priests accused of abuse who he believed were "remorseless and a serious risk to children", Dolan wrote: “As victims organize and become more public, the potential for true scandal is very real.”[66] In May 2012, the New York Times revealed that the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, then headed by Dolan, had paid some abusive priests – although already dismissed from their priestly duties – up to $20,000 to leave the priesthood immediately rather than force the church to initiate time-consuming and expensive laicization proceedings against them.[67] The archdiocese noted that the "unassignable priests" were still receiving full salaries and would continue to do so until they were formally laicized;[67] and that the payouts were a "motivation" so that the priests would not contest being defrocked. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests sent a formal protest asking,
                <strong>
                 "In what other occupation, especially one working with families and operating schools and youth programs, is an employee given a cash bonus for raping and sexually assaulting children?"
                </strong>
                [67] Dolan responded to accusations that he had given "payoffs" to protect accused priests as "false, preposterous, and unjust"....
               </p>
               <p>
                ..Dolan visited Ground Zero, the site of the September 11 attacks, on the following April 24.[72] After reciting the same prayer used by Benedict XVI during his visit to the United States, Dolan remarked, "We will never stop crying. But it's also about September 12 and all the renewal, the rebuilding, hope, solidarity and compassion that symbolized this great community and still does."

                Undoubtedly because it's a wall-of-text with zero sourcing from the previous account of the Racine spam bot, who constantly shits up other people's submissions with useless, demoralizing, discussion-sliding, repetitive crap instead of responsibly making sourced research submissions like a legit PG subscriber.

               <p>
                People don't appreciate having their comments buried by this LARPer, or their submission discussions diverted by his off-topic lies and attacks.

                ..They aren't the only celebrities with links to Racine, Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Ashton Kutcher is also linked to Racine through the Clintons, McCain, Emanuels and a group called The Fight to End Exploitation (real name Chris - Freemasonry and Kabbalah elite). Some of those involved in that organization are known to be involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, with ties to Penn State University and Tom DeLonge of Blink-182. Racine has close ties through Haiti, Brazil and other hubs involved, that LInkin Park was involved with also. Linkin Park and Blinkin Park were going to have shows together until Chris Cornell and Chester died.
               </p>
               <p>
                Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker (LDS - Mormon) are closely tied to Chester Bennington and John Podesta. Peter Lavenda, who co-authorized Tom DeLonge's book, is a leader in OTO circles and linked to Jack Parson and Aleister Crowley. Others closely linked from LDS include Even McMullin and Mitt Romney, who made a deal for Paul Ryan to be VP (Roman Catholic - ties to mafia, Boy Scouts and secret societies). There is a partnership between Jesuits (Catholics), LDS and FLDS (Mormon), Kabbalah (Jewish), OTO (Thelema), Scientology and others with the mission of a one world Luciferian religious interfaith coalition.
               </p>
               <p>
                Racine has a fully controlled International Airport and harbor, and has a massive data center that Quinn Michaels also corroborated as being a major link in Racine County. About the Arena deal, it is part of the racketeering scheme in Racine that is linked to the Clinton Foundation, Rotary International, and many, many others. That RICO case was railroaded by the mafia and corruption in the FBI. Loretta Lynch was personally involved in obstructing the RICO investigations in Racine, and it coincided with Paul Ryan being on the plane with Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch for their secret meeting.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are going to use the arena for their own events and lure more children and families to the area. There are tunnels throughout Racine, and it is also tied to the Underground Railroad up to Canada and the ratlines from Chicago that go over to Minnesota, North Dakota, Omaha, Iowa, and Missouri. The arena is a pay back along with Machinery Row, an amphitheater, the harbor and airport, tax fee everything, control over the district and media, and control over the water supply. Racketeering in Racine goes a long way, but it is deeper and darker. It is also tied to Pizzagate, murder, organ harvesting, blood transfusions, bone marrow, abuse in schools and detention centers, abuse of foster and family services, and all other steps toward the gross reality of extreme corruption, tyranny, abuse, torture and enslavement.

              Bill Gates, who recently bought 500,000 shares of Monsanto stock, is reportedly funding the approval of genetically modified mosquitoes. It seems that not only will genetically modified salmon enter the environment along with unforeseen changes, but a new self-sterilizing mosquito may be joining them...

              <strong>
               Biotech company Oxitec
              </strong>
              submitted a draft of its plan in March to release thousands of genetically modified male Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes into the area. This is the species of mosquito that carries and transmits Zika, dengue, and other nasty diseases. But Oxitec's version of these mosquitoes come with a genetic twist: a gene that wipes out any offspring they produce with wild female mosquitoes before the baby mosquitoes reach reproductive age.

              . We inserted Gal4 into the doublesex (dsx) locus of Drosophila melanogaster, allowing us to visualize and manipulate cells expressing dsx in various tissues. In the nervous system, we detected differences between the sexes in dsx-positive neuronal numbers, axonal projections and synaptic density. We found that dsx was required for the development of male-specific neurons that coexpressed fruitless (fru), a regulator of male sexual behavior. We propose that dsx and fru act together to form the neuronal framework necessary for male sexual behavior. We found that disrupting dsx neuronal function had profound effects on male sexual behavior. Furthermore, our results suggest that dsx-positive neurons are involved in pre- to post-copulatory female reproductive behaviors.

To date, the best strategy to prevent the disease remains insecticide-based mosquito control....Alternative control technologies are in development, including genetic control such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). The SIT is a pivotal tool in integrated agricultural pest management and could be used to improve malaria vector control. ..The removal of females is an essential requirement because released females can themselves contribute towards nuisance biting and disease transmission...The doublesex (dsx) gene is one of the effector switches of sex determination in the process of sex differentiation in insects.

              The ethics of wiping out a mosquito species Posted: 3rd October 2018 10:54am PDT by Christopher Preston
The announcement from a new genetic technology had successfully eradicated a carefully contained population of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes grabbed headlines last week across the world. It not only indicated an incredible piece of science. It also opened a Pandora’s box of complicated ethical questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              The technology works by creating a disruption to a particular gene found in the sex cells of mosquitoes. By manipulating something called the “doublesex” gene, the researchers were able to ensure a stream of female descendents possessing a biological mix of both male and female mosquito parts. These “intersex” mosquitoes are both genetically and phenotypically revolutionary.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...why are some people hesitant about the technology?

             Nnimmo Bassey of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation in Nigeria is concerned about Africa becoming a “testing ground for a technology that has not been proven.” There is no airtight guarantee about the safety of gene drives.

             <p>
              An intervention into an ecosystem intended to extinguish a species raises a number of precautionary red flags. Ecosystems are complex with the various dependencies between species are not completely understood. New, potentially more voracious species could fill the gaps left by those that have been removed. In the midst of any engineered changes, evolution will continue. While the particular modification the Imperial College scientists made to the mosquito was chosen specifically to minimize the possibility of a natural resistance evolving, the potential for movement and mutation of genes between populations makes people nervous. Even the research scientists themselves appreciate that wild environments don’t behave as predictably as laboratory ones.

                Company Cofounded by Paul Pelosi Jr. Charged with Securities Fraud
               </a>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged a company cofounded by Paul Pelosi Jr. with fraud on Wednesday after learning that two convicted criminals were running the business.
               </p>
               <p>
                Paul Pelosi Jr., the son of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), was the president and chief operating officer of Natural Blue Resources Inc., an investment company he cofounded that focuses on "environmentally-friendly" ventures.
               </p>
               <p>
                The SEC charged four individuals with fraud, including former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya, and suspended trading in the company’s stock. Pelosi owned over 10 million shares in the company in 2009.
               </p>
               <p>
                The SEC said Wednesday the company was "secretly controlled" by James E. Cohen and Joseph Corazzi, both of whom had previous fraud convictions. Corazzi violated federal securities laws and was barred from acting as an officer or director of a public company. Cohen was previously incarcerated for financial fraud.
               </p>
               <p>
                ..Pelosi cofounded the company in 2009. The SEC said Natural Blue’s mission is to "create, acquire, or otherwise invest in environmentally-friendly companies, including an initiative to locate, purify, and sell water recovered from underground aquifers in New Mexico and other areas with depleting water resources."
               </p>
               <p>
                According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Pelosi served as president and chief operating officer of Natural Blue Resources, Inc. until January 11, 2010. Joseph Montalto is listed as the current president.

             "The Sherman’s were heavily involved in philanthropy, which is where their paths crossed with the Clintons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barry Sherman’s pharma company Apotex was involved in the supply of generic pharmaceuticals under contracts with the Clinton Foundation most recently in Haiti and Rwanda. In September 2014, in response to the spread of the chikungunya virus in Haiti, Apotex struck a deal with the Clintons’ Direct Relief organization donating more than $2.2 million in medical aid to the country saying in a statement:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Apotex is in a position to help (in Haiti), and we are delighted to work with Direct Relief…”
Additionally, Apotex worked with Direct Relief in Haiti, who was a “particularly active” member of the Clinton Foundation/Clinton Global Initiative community, supporting post-hurricane “relief efforts.” The pharmaceutical giant airlifted vaccinations and medical supplies into Haiti that was funded through charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation and other connected charities."

               In 2016, Direct Relief, in partnership with International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR), Batey Relief Alliance, and others, committed to launch a multi-national response to the current Zika outbreak across Latin America, the United States, and the Caribbean. The multi-faceted response will focus on reproductive health and family planning, prenatal care, and the prevention of transmission through the distribution of essential commodities empowering communities to take preventative actions and make informed decisions about their health. This response will take the form of Zika Modules designed to protect against the transmission and the potentially devastating consequences of the virus. Direct Relief will distribute up to Zika Modules to partners involved in comprehensive, community-based Zika response efforts in Argentina, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, the United States (specifically Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas), and Venezuela. Modules will include: insect repellent, biodegradable mosquito traps, digital thermometers, ultrasounds, fetal dopplers, and contraceptives.

              <p>
               Located in Racine, Wisconsin, the SC Johnson Institute of Insect Science for Family Health is one of the world’s largest private, urban entomology research centers. It was established in 1957 at SC Johnson’s corporate headquarters and in 1960 moved to its current 30‐acre complex in Racine. In 2013, SC Johnson expanded its research operations globally, opening the first of its kind, 300‐square‐meter research facility in China.
For nearly 60 years, the Institute’s researchers have developed products and solutions consumers can trust to protect them and their homes from household pests, including mosquitoes and diseases they may carry.
The Institute houses about 20 species of insects, including six species of mosquitoes, including the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (species of mosquitoes that have the ability to transmit the Zika virus, dengue fever virus and chikungunya)..."
