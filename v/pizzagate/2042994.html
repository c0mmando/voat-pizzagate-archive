<p>But what could possibly go wrong in this scenario?  
</p>
<p>Let’s examine the case of one sponsor, a Michigan Christian radio host named John Balyo who in 2014 was arrested and eventually imprisoned for raping children.  When police broke into his rented storage unit, they found a bondage kit with handcuffs, rope, tape, zip ties, chain, and rubber gloves:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UnNn7I1wflk?t=4">https://youtu.be/UnNn7I1wflk?t=4</a>  They also found children’s socks, a padlock, clippings of missing child reports, and child obituaries:  <a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian.radio.host.john.balyo.arrested.for.child.sex.abuse.wife.asks.for.donations/38479.htm">https://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian.radio.host.john.balyo.arrested.for.child.sex.abuse.wife.asks.for.donations/38479.htm</a>  
</p>
<p>During the trial, the prosecutor presented photos seized at the scene showing Balyo “pointing a handgun at a boy-sized mannequin tied to a post before he used the mannequin’s feet to masturbate.”  “He kept the anatomically correct mannequin, with a blond wig, tied up in a dog crate, authorities said.  The series of photographs ended with Balyo wrapping the mannequin in a carpet or tarpaulin, as if to bury it,&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney Tessa Hessmiller wrote in court documents.  <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/11/john_balyos_fetish_new_details.html">http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/11/john_balyos_fetish_new_details.html</a>  
</p>
<p>I hope this clears the heads of those who argue that providing pedophiles with baby mannequins for sex will keep them from raping children.
Anyway, I bring up Balyo’s unspeakable crimes because before his arrest he is reported to have visited a child that he sponsored through <strong>Compassion International</strong> in Uganda.  While there, he was apparently videotaped being interviewed for a Christian radio program.  In the video, now scrubbed from the internet as far as I can determine, a question was put to him:  
</p>
<p>“John, I have to ask you.  You’ve just met your sponsored child.  What are you gonna do next?”  His answer:  “I tell you what, this is a whole lot better than Disney World.”  <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1310247/christian-radio-dj-john-balyo-charged-with-criminal-sexual-conduct-involving-minor/">http://www.inquisitr.com/1310247/christian-radio-dj-john-balyo-charged-with-criminal-sexual-conduct-involving-minor/</a></p>
<p>My point here is that mixed in with the good Samaritans are people like Balyo who are eagerly sponsoring and gleefully accepting the invitation from grateful caretakers who just want to say thank you for the money.  It’s a recipe for atrocity.</p>',

                No, I don't think there are "specific" organizations that arrange but I've lived in developing countries for over 20 years and most local schools don't do any background checks. Also, a "white" foreigner can easily offer "free" English lessons to locals, who are eager to learn. I'm not sure why you want to research this, but it is a serious problem. Some countries have tried to put in place more requirements but there are always local schools that don't check ANYTHING.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is a serious problem in countries like Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. I'm sorry but there isn't anything you can do about it, it takes the will/time/money for schools to check and most poor schools lack all.

                 Thanks for the explanation.  I was thinking that if an international aid organization or the State Department or something like that was arranging it and thus enabling child abuse, it would fall under the scope of the research we're doing here.

            After telling one person about child trafficking and charities/orphanages etc. they relayed a story told to them by a person who had sponsored a child in another country for 9 years (from birth).  They (it was a couple) decided it would be nice to meet the boy and have him stay with them. They contacted the charity to arrange it, but they were taken off guard that the 9 year old boy was sent alone on the airplane and didn't speak any English.  Fortunately for the kid they were legit sponsors but it's disturbing to think how easy child trafficking could happen by evil people setting up bogus charity fronts and having pedophile

             It's hard to believe that was legal, even when done by a legit organization.  I hope they at the very least required a background check on the couple--not that those are very reliable given the number of pedophiles we see being cleared to work around children these days.  Do you know or can you find out which organization was involved?

              Next time I see that person I'll ask if they remember the name of the charity. Since the couple had been sending money for 9 years, had correspondence, and it was a Church related support, perhaps it didn't occur to the charity.  It was more disturbing to the couple that the charity would let the child fly unaccompanied, not knowing the language.  It's odd, did they assume the boy would have a chaperon?

               The thing is, even if the couple was trusted because of their long-term commitment and church connection, it can't be legal to just ship a child to unrelated people in another country with no charity-associated chaperone.  If it is legal, the laws are completely inadequate.  Pedophiles often spend years grooming intended targets, so long-term commitment most definitely does not equal safety.

                I don't know the situation about the legality, but as far as the implications you're correct, and as we know, most 'orphans' are not even true orphans, some are lured away from parents, or outright abducted and sold to orphanages.  And certainly Church connections are NOT by any stretch, infallible proof of safety.
