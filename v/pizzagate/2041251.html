            It's is neither inspred by or an homage to Bourgeois is based on a French novel from 1984, a one minute search of wikipedia would have told you this.  The book was published as Tarantula. Bourgeois's first spider sculpture appeared over a decade after the book came out.

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             'Jeffrey' not 'Jeffredy'. And your comment is incorrect. We know that the Arch of Hysteria is specifically depicting Dahmer’s victims, not just someone suffering an ailment, because the statue has been decapitated, just like Dahmer’s victim was.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the Dahmer victim that was posed in this manner was subjected to a trepanning operation, and muriatic acid was injected into his brain in an attempt to turn him into a mindless sex slave, it seems likely to me that the victim took this pose naturally, while he was still alive and suffering from the surgery. Dahmer then decapitated him (as we see in the photo) and placed him in that position again as a reminder of that.
            </p>

            <p>
             The installation piece is entitled
             <em>
              Maman
             </em>
             . During the first act of the four-day show on July 27, 2017 the
             <em>
              Maman
             </em>
             ,  the monstrous spider ensnared the statue of Our Lady on top of Notre Dame Cathedral in Ottawa.  It does not require a genius to figure out that it was a symbolic act pretending the Devil triumphed over Our Lady.  As the spider entrapped Our Lady, eight men ran back and forth toward the spider as if they were baby spiders running in its web. Possibly a reference to the Sons of the Widow, another name for Freemasons.

             'Inspired' not 'inspred'.  And again you are incorrect. Several serious art critics have stated that the film either paid homage to or was inspired by Louise Bourgeouis.  For example,

              The Skin I Live In was inspired to a significant degree by Louise Bourgeois's work ... A number of pieces by Bourgeois ...  are highlighted.

              Vera stitches together fragments of cloth to make faceless (defaced?) figures inspired by Bourgeois’s sculptures.  Like Vera, Almodóvar explores therapeutic suture (the piecing together of cloth, skin, and celluloid), making it a trope for psychic fragmentation but also reconstruction. One quote pencilled on Vera’s wall diary is said to come from a book by Bourgeois: “Art is the guarantee of health.”

               your comment is incorrect. We know that the Arch of Hysteria is specifically depicting Dahmer’s victims,

              You may "know" this but it is completely false.  She did a series of arches of hysteria and her first work on this dates to 1989

             <p>
              This is years before Dahmer was arrested.    And there's no evidence that the Dahmer crime scene photos were available to the public at the time of his trial.  The earliest example we have of the photo of that Dahmer victim a textbook on murder from 1996.
             </p>
             <p>
              She has talked often about who and what her inspiration for her Arches of Hysteria and it's not Dahmer.  It's Jean-Martin Charcot.

               because the statue has been decapitated, just like Dahmer’s victim was.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This is pretty poor art criticism.  For one, the legs and arms are nothing like Dahmer's victim. Also a sculpture that has never had a head is not decaptiated.

              are not the victims of violence.  They have not had their arms and legs and head cut off.  A Bust is not a head cut from a body.

             <p>
              Also her first "Arch of Hysteria" scultpture which was part of one of her cells has no head and no arms.

             <p>
              So your evidence for you quoting a ridiculous theory is to quote a separate ridiculous theory? 
You are aware that the four day show you talk about is NOT Maman?   and has nothing to do with Louis Bourgeois?
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that The Skin I'm In has a whole section on Bourgeois, but it's based on book.

            Also
Louise Bourgeois is being promoted 
In a new international publication
Called Women in Art 278  along with
Many other dark and nefarious artists
