<p>I have happened to notice that Bedford is ALWAYS in the news for child pornography and frequently for child molestation. This is not the case for the surrounding areas. I can tell you that not many people live there and there isn\'t much of a reason to drive through it. It\'s not en route to anything important.</p>

            This is alarming.  When you have so many in one area in a short period of time, and the whole nest isn't identified and destroyed, you have to think of law enforcement involvement. It's like that World Bank dude who got arrested for molesting a hotel maid;  you can be a pervert for 40 years, but when they want to cut you lose, they set you up, or rat you out.
