            I had been looking for his possible involvement with refugees or Vietnam orphans being brought into San Fran after his overseas duty.  I began reading anything I could find on him in 1978 when he was still connected with LaVey, it didn't surprise me when the allegations blew up in the 1980's. Since he was mentioned by Paul Bonocci and mentioned in connection with the ring in Oklahoma, I have tried to also find any connection there might be with the Jacob Wetterling kidnapping case in MN, and any other references with the Johnny Gosch case, besides Bonocci. Michael Aquino is a difficult man to research.

            ETA: Another character from this time frame who is interesting is Kenneth Anger. I'm not positive but I believe he arose out of the whole Laurel Canyon/LSD bunch in the 60's. Film maker, Thelemite, and member of the Thelemic organisation, the Ordo Templi Orientis. You would think he would have some Washington D.C. connections.

            I'm an older gal, some younger people who have better research skills and tools than I need to jump on some of these names I've dropped. I used to do all this research from print material at the public library. Aside from google, which I hear is being scrubbed anyway, there has to be a better way to find out more.  Thanks for even posting Aquino's name, nobody else seems interested as they are focused on all this newer stuff but it's becoming known now to younger people that this type of stuff has replayed over and over.

             I agree that there must be more out there. When I started working for Lockheed Martin iseveral years ago my entire "profile" on Google was scrubbed. There were few lingering stories of grad school accomplishments, etc, only the best were left for people to read. Colleagues didn't believe me, but to this day I know what some of them are up to, but you can't find a lick about them on Google.
