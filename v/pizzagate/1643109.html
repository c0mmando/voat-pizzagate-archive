He has done nothing for the community, nothing for research. He has contributed zero research. He twice gave us breaking alerts, insider info tells him arrest to made with days or hours. Now he says he has done &quot;an enormous amount for the community&quot;.</p>
<p>OP:
You know, I\'ve wanted to make a thread here outlining one of the major problems with this entire <strong>Pizzagate</strong> issue but have refrained because I did not want to have it deleted for VOAT\'s strange and unusual thread posting parameters. </p>
<p>But if you think about it, <strong>Wikileaks</strong> is the \'organization\' that initiated all of this inquiry shortly before the presidential election last year, <strong>AND EVER SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING</strong>.</p>
<p>I know that this seems like a pretty inane observation, but it just happens to mean quite a bit. See, once <strong>Wikileaks</strong> released this information into the public domain there was no choice but for the inquisitive, especially when there is a threat to children, an altruistic, sensitive person will only inevitably pick up that yoke themselves as some kind of civic duty to society to want to help in some way.</p>
<p>By that token <strong>Wikileaks</strong> has taken the safety and freedom <strong>AWAY</strong> from the American people by giving them the impetus to bury themselves. They have irresponsibly used the American trust in a way that has forever damaged the institutions of freedom in this country by betraying our sense of security and trustworthiness in our government. The worst part is not that they disseminated the material in the first place, that may or may not have been a prime motive, the worst part about all of this is that <strong>THEY DID NOT FOLLOW UP.</strong></p>
<p>I do not blame <strong>David Seaman</strong> for acting the way he is acting. It is easy to see the progression of paranoia that has swept through him as this investigation has unfolded. It is not easy for any of us to uncover this material. Not only does it shock you to the very core of your being but you sincerely experience a similar effect to Kubler-Rosses Death and Dying Process. And, in fact, this is all part of the plan. This world and the design of all the horrors that we are now being awakened to are part of our \'alchemical enlightening\' - in other words the masters of this plan believe that this shock is good for you.</p>
<p>Not only is there a very real intended spiritual shock being implemented on you there are also very real considerations of safety when involving oneself in their occult matters of manipulation, because it has been proven that if you dig too deep you will be eliminated. Many of us are afraid of a gestapo like police force coming to clean up \'dissidents\' who advocate that these underground practices no longer persist, a true hallmark of a fascist regime bent on hiding all the secrets at any cost. Is it really coming to this again? All I can see is a complete replay from the template that was used on prewar Germany, used exactly and as precisely as it was used then except ten times bigger.</p>
<p>I didn\'t ask to be born into this bullshit. I didn\'t WANT to have to uncover what I have. But the fact remains there must be a reason why I have.</p>
<p>But <strong>WIKILEAKS, you NOW HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE WORLD AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC</strong>, you have to take some of the pressure off of the citizens. You have placed a great burden on us by releasing this information. You have placed thousands of people that have been interested in this in danger **without following through with YOUR INFORMATION. **</p>
<p>David Seaman is right, IT IS TIME FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO HELP IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND IT IS TIME TO GO BACK TO THE SOURCE, WIKILEAKS.</p>
<p><strong>WIKILEAKS</strong>, <strong>YOU</strong> decided to become \'whistleblowers\' and release information to the public that they themselves took up where you failed. <strong>You</strong> have not followed up on your material and have led the American public into a quagmire of confusion. It is now time for <strong>you</strong> to correct what you have started instead of jeopardizing the safety of the citizens of America with your silver haired mk psyop and <strong>release what else you have or make a public statement.</strong></p>',

            I don't have any issue at all with David. I'm sure he's being constantly inundated with hate from all directions, and although sometimes he's gone a bit sideways, he won't get any from me. The brigading alone will make a person paranoid and defensive.  I don't think we should take any "leaks" of a pending arrest(s) seriously since that's not something you announce ahead of time with engraved invites, so no way I believe they're real or accurate.

            I agree to a certain extent. Wikileaks made a point of soliciting info in regards to Trump taxes,  Obama admin doc potentially being destroyed, etc. They could have put out something in regards to the pizza related emails..a call for victims or anyone with trafficking info, etc.

              I also called out Dr Steve, who said he the one representing the intel folks who decided to leak to Assange "in a controlled release". And I told him, as a survivor of child abuse and pedos, I am furious that they decided to do a limited hangout that was limited in such a way as to prevent outright arrests, but enough to start this citizen investigation. So a lot of people are triggered, but the children are still screaming, underground. We're all traumatized and some of us in danger ( like Ryan ) - was that their plan? How can they sleep with themselves knowing they are holding back information that would save children? I tweeted this to him.

            All you people may need to research what the Targeted Individual material is about. Seaman looks like and acts like a classic case. True, some real nut jobs claim to  be Targeted Individuals but they are few and far between. New York Times did a hit piece on the T.I. community this past summer, just as many people were coming to understand that yes, whistle-blowers and others are actually targeted in a number of ways. For many it is Cointelprp type targeting and others, it is directed energy or microwave assaults.Then, a couple months ago, what else did the New York Times do a hit piece on. Pizzagate!! By the way George Webb, yes, he claims to be a Targeted Individual, long before he embarked on his series on the Clinton Foundation

            So Wikileaks should help us out? With what exactly?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if they have nothing else? No other material? Wikileaks didn't write the material we're working from, Podesta, Hillary, Stratford and the DNC did. What can Wikileaks do, apart from what they did, which was release them for the PEOPLE to decide what to do, and in order for people to BE AWARE.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its not their fault that you decided to redpill on the info and awake from slumber.
It's not their call to do anything more than they have, imo. 
If they have more information, I do hope they release it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Complaining to the red pill dealer that you wish you could go back and that they owe you something, isn't gonna work.

             That's such a circular argument by the way with your new age lingo and that redpill, slumber diatribe. Why is there any friction about this matter at all, Wikileaks implied onimous conections between Podesta which provided many instances of him and James Alefantis together, thus implicating Comet Pizza and the 'influence' he held sway over Wash. DC according to GQ, BUT THEY ONLY IMPLIED IT AND LEFT THE REST UP TO THE PUBLIC, and this VOAT subverse is a testament to the wild theories than can arise from the imaginations of the uninformed. There are alot of very real aspects to this sex trafficking ring that I believe the general public cannot grasp due to the enormity of the issue. To simply believe that there is a witches coven of satanists sacrificing children in dungeons is a meme that will simply pass through the psyche of the non observer. To understand the reality of sex trafficking and it's use in government as an extortion tool is much more believable, but wikileaks has not made those connctions and has left that up to the masses, which generally DO NOT have a good track history of making decisions en masse. Wikileaks owes it to the American public to clarify the issues.

              My mama promised me a chocolate bar but didnt deliver. Grow a pair bro, things happen which mean people have to renege on promises. When exactly did they 'promise' more material anyway, and if they did, was there a time line on that, and were you expecting this material to save us or something?
