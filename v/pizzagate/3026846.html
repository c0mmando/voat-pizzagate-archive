<p>Is transgenderism wrong?  Yes.  It goes against nature.  It goes against Christianity.  But none of that matters.</p>
<p>The number of sex-reassignment surgeries in the U.S. increased four-fold from 2000 to 2014 as more public and private insurance plans began covering the procedure.  Over the study period, diagnoses of transsexualism (TS) or gender identity disorder increased more than three-fold, from a rate of 3.87 per 100,000 patients in 2000 to 14.22 per 100,000 patients in 2014.  Among those patients, the researchers found 4,118 - or 10.9% of such visits - involved sex-reassignment surgery.  A sub-analysis showed genital-only procedures accounted for the majority of all sex-reassignment procedures, and that the share of genital-only procedures rose from 72% of all sex-reassignment procedures from 2000 to 2005 to 83.5% from 2006 to 2011.</p>
<p>As far as insurance coverage, in 2014 Medicare lifted their coverage ban on transgender surgeries - it increased from 25% in 2012-2013 to 70% in 2014, representing a three-fold increase over the three-year period.</p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act offers guidance to those who seek insurance to cover sex reassignment surgery, providing access to many available plans, stating that transgender health exclusions may be deemed as unlawful sex discrimination, and that if you believe a plan unlawfully discriminates, you can file complaints.</p>

<p>In 2015, a pediatrician wrote the following that appeared on the American College of Pediatricians website:</p>
<p>&quot;Driving in this morning I began to wonder.  Why isn\'t the movement of LGBT not the PLGBT movement: &quot;P&quot; for pedophile?&quot;  When I look at the origins of the transgender movement, I find John Money and Harry Benjamin, both bisexuals, who failed to condemn pedophiles and freely associated with them.  When I look at the data from Donald Paul Sullins taken from the Add Health Survey, I see a 7 fold increase in child sexual abuse when lesbian couples get married, compared to when they stay unmarried.  Incest is a form of pedophilia.</p>
<p>When I look at sexual minorities studies examining for a history of childhood sexual abuse, I see rates as high as 75%.  They were victims of pedophilia.  Some of them do engage in pedophilia.  In addition, we know that victims of child sexual abause engage in same sex behavior at higher rates, averaging 4x, but up to 7x higher than their non-victimized peers, depending on the study.</p>
<p>When I look at criminology data on adult or juvenile sex offenders, I see many of them were childhood victims of pedophilia or incest.  Juvenile offenders that sexually abuse minors preferentially select the sex of the victim to be the same as the one that sexually victimized them.</p>
<p>When I look at sex education in schools, I see Alfred C. Kinsey and his colleagues, and I see pansexuality and an embracing of pedophilia, along with bestiality.</p>
<p>Child pornography exploits children.  It is the worst sort of exploitation in the age of the internet and storage of images.  If pedophilia becomes the new norm, the explsion of exploitation will be unparalleled.</p>
<p>In one sense, it could be argued that the LGBT movement is only tangentially associated with pedophilia.  I see that argument, but the pushers of the movement, the activists I think, have pedophilia intrinsically woven into their agenda.  It is they who need to be spoken to and against.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acpeds.org/p-for-pedophile">https://www.acpeds.org/p-for-pedophile</a></p>
<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement in 2017 which essentially rubber-stamps the &quot;gender-affirmative&quot; approach.  It reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The American Academy of Pediatrics stands in support of transgender children and adults, and condemns attempts to stigmitize or marginalize them.  We believe transgender individuals are not a \'disruption.\'  They are members of our families, our communities, and our work force.</p>
<p>As pediatricians, we know that transgender children fare much better when they feel supported by their family, school and larger community.  Shaming children based on their gender identity or expression is harmful to their social-emotional health and may have lifelong consequences.  This includes public discourse that de-legitimizes the contributions that transgender individuuals make to society.</p>
<p>The AAP supports policies that are gender-affirming for children - an approach that is supported by other key professional organizations.  In 2016, the AAP joined with other organizations to produce the document, &quot;Supporting &amp; Caring for Transgender Children,&quot; a guide for community members and allies to ensure that transgender young people are affirmed, respected, and able to thrive.</p>
<p>We urge all the leaders in our communities to use language that inspires and empowers children, adolescents and young adults.  Our nation\'s future success depends on them.&quot;</p>

<p>On a final note, transgender is no longer classified as a mental illness by the World Health Organization (WHO).  
</p>
<p>&quot;Gender incongruence is now classified as a sexual health condition.  For example - a person who was born with a penis and is biologically male but identifies as a female... For the transgender community, the WHO\'s decision is seen as a step toward acceptance in a society that often discriminates against it or fails to understand what being transgender means.&quot;</p>

            Most Drug OD's are not accidental. What is the drug abuse rates among the gender broken? 
Back in the 80's I dabbled in hard core detox in a Conservative city and found that Bi-sexual (or fake Hetero's in the closet) seem to not only fall of the wagon like clock work, but had a history of suicide attempts. Not all of them unsuccessful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most family members literally threaten the medical examiner with lawyers if they imply suicide. Guilt and denial makes the statistics much worse than the Climate Change numbers game.

            For anyone reading this, grow your own food. The food and water we  eat and drink are all poisoned.   A friend of mine has a sibling who works for a well-known member of the British royal family.  The royal family do not eat any food grown in their own personal organic vegetable and fruit garden. They know.

            I know what im gonna say is not going to be popular.  I think in many or most cases there is a biological reason for transgender.  Our meat and dairy is pumped full of artificial hormones and destabilize people's hormones, including pregnant women. Ubiquitous toxins such as BHT in plastics cause artificial production of estrogen. We live in an increasingly toxic world.  Even natural stuff- like spearmint for example, highly effects hormone levels. It could be that a woman carrying a male fetus while drinking spearmint tea everyday could dramatically alter the child's natural hormone levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont think its as simple as "biologically male" or "biologically female." The fetus could be male and then the pregnant mom consumes an inordinate amount of hormone disruptors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stats also show that 1 im 100 babies arw born intersex aka having ambiguous genitalia.  I dont think gender is a purely black and white (male vs. Female) thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think science will be uncovering more and more to make sense of this.  Most people who report feeling "in the wrong gender body" do not choose it. It causes incredible emotional pain, social and familial rejection, etc. The sexual assault and suicide rates are through the roof. Most children and teens growing up transgender would give anything to not be that way and "to be normal."
           </p>
           <p>
            My opinions are not political. They are based on science and medicine.

             Thanks for your post. I absolutely agree with everything you say, and have been thinking the same thing myself. The frogs were the canary in the coal mine when it was known years ago that chemical hormone disruptors were changing male frogs into females. Instead of "science" interpolating that fact as to why there is such a proliferation of transgenderism in people when even 40 or 50 years ago it was exceedingly rare, they simply normalize it.  They use the rich and famous like Celine Dion to shill ugly satanic genderless clothing lines for babies,  and their toxic media quotes people like Kate Hudson talking about how she doesn't know what gender her newborn daughter will identify with. Not to mention the increasing assortment of "celebrities" parading their little girls around dressed as boys and boys dressed as girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             The proliferation of gender bending is no different than the proliferation of autism, I believe that 99% of it is chemically created.

             This. Yes I definitely agree with the role of our food being absolutely toxic and riddled with hormone inducing chemicals. Soy is literally in everything and it is GMO and severely messes with estrogen levels in both sexes. Men are pumped full of estrogen and more feminized and women have huge surges of estrogen causing more cancer and medical issues. Wheat and grains are so GMOed people can barely eat the stuff without gastro issues. Pregnant women are at huge risk I totally agree and have you noticed there are so many more female babies compared to male babies?

            We've been conditioned over the past few decades to hear about zombies.  That IMO, is what we will see in the near future.  Disembodied souls, ungrounded, unstable and turning very ugly in many ways.

            We are declining spiritually as a species, and transgenderism is a part of it.  The Hindu Vedas say that there are four ages and that we are currently in Kali Yuga, and age of evil and decadence and the age of hypocrisy, when bodily strength decreases as does memory and lifespans. There is a decrease in religion.  When the evil of Kali yuga reaches its zenith, God will come on a white horse and destroy the earth through fire (the last time it was with water). Not all will die. Those few left will start again.  Then the ages start ascending, and we move into the age of the two-legged cow until we reach the Golden Age where the cow has four legs. This is just a few things that happen in Kali Yuga:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'Cheating will be the order of the day in business relations; satisfaction of sexual pleasure will be the only consideration of male or female excellence and worthiness'. Womanliness and manliness will be judged according to one’s expertise in sex
            </p>
            <p>
             'Celibates (priests) will cease to observe their vows of study, purity and celibacy …
            </p>
            <p>
             '...men will abandon their parents, brothers, friends, and relatives. They will occupy high seats (and pulpits) and will (pretend to) preach religion'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rulers will no longer see it as their duty to promote spirituality, or to protect their subjects: they will become a danger to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             People will start migrating, seeking countries where wheat and barley form the staple food source.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lust will be viewed as socially acceptable and sexual intercourse will be seen as the central requirement of life.
Sin will increase exponentially, while virtue will fade and cease to flourish.
            </p>
            <p>
             “In Kali-yuga, wealth alone will be considered the sign of a person’s good birth, proper behavior and fine qualities. And law and justice will be applied only on the basis of one’s power.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “the people of Kali Yuga are stimulated by the lowest instincts. They chose false ideas and concepts over the authentic ones, they have no hesitation in persecuting the wise, the envy torments them, negligence, disease, hunger and fear will spread.
            </p>
            <p>
             Uncultured men will accept charity on behalf of the Lord and will earn their livelihood by making a show of austerity and wearing a mendicant’s dress. Those who know nothing about religion will mount a high seat and presume to speak on religious principles. -Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.38
            </p>
            <p>
             a husband and wife will remain together because they like each other, but as soon as there will be some sex difficulty, their affection will slacken.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think transgenderism is all about men's entitlement to push their fetishes on the rest of the world. If white people dress with 'black face' we understand that it's not okay to appropriate a culture and fetishize it. Yet when men make a mockery of women by putting on makeup and high heels we laud them as being 'brave'.

            God and nature don't matter when it comes to why they're pushing the transgender movement? You can't be serious.

              One shouldn't have to read between the lines. You came close mentioning pansexuality, but ended with this being a moral dilemma. Sure, morals are involved, but laying it out in black and white is necessary. Beating around the bush and alluding to things is exactly what brought us to this point and what the Satanists count on for it to go even further. If people would start discussing this subject matter as it needs to be done rather than putting it in clinical terms, maybe we could put a stop to this and help people see that the Satanic Panic was a bunch of bullshit to pull the wool over everyone's eyes and help the demons get away with what they did and do more damage, which is exactly what we're seeing today.

              Maybe, but that's not the way it sounds to me since Op goes directly into the scientific aspects of it and never readdresses the Satanic agenda, which is the unifying factor that ties all of this together.
