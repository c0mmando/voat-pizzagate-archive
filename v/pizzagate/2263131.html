<p>You have probably seen this sub before you might even visit it frequently. Many of us do. Lets ignore that for a minute. Around this time last year a fledgeling member of that sub came to the mods with something really juicy.</p>
<p>A purpoted image hosting server, just for them. This was around the time when all the posts being hosted on other image servers were being taken down and censored.</p>
<p>This person offered a safe place to keep all the memes and other things safe from all the meanies.</p>
<p>we will start here with a simple whois search.</p>

<p>Last update of whois database: 2017-11-28T04:08:42Z</p>
<p>now lets get a little more specific. Here is the ip address for the thinimg cloud rackserver</p>
<p>ip address 104.130.158.85 port 1799</p>
<p>it is located in san antonio tx. we can find that here</p>
<p>now if we plug that info into the web we got <a href="https://www.ipaddress.com/websites/thinimg.com">https://www.ipaddress.com/websites/thinimg.com</a></p>
<p>Registered to an address in panama. Using free service of Whoisguard that comes when you first purchase server space with this hosting company. Thing is these guys operate a little outside the law of the web. What they do is instead of registering you with ICANN as the domain registrar they put in their info instead and provide a proxy you know to keep you free of spam and stuff right. But they really just change your info a little bit. To their nearest server farm for example.</p>
<p>Like the one owned by these guys <a href="http://goethalsconsulting.com/pathways/">http://goethalsconsulting.com/pathways/</a>. Hey look they recently hosted a conference too in Panama. Now who the fuck is hosting this Widening the Pathways To open societies event you might ask.</p>
<p>Hosting a popular subreddits posts on a server Owned by a secret invidual in oh shit where is this? Panama P.O. box. wait that cant be right lets dig even deeper. Yeah actually it is panama. But who owns it right thats what we all want to know. Who the fuck is widening the pathways to open societies? Goethals Consulting Group. Sounds familiar. Let me check something here. John Allen Bennett Novey president. Widening the path ways to open societies. Open society Foundation of george soros. Fucking Hilarious. An offshoot of the Open Society Project has successfully gotten thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people to use an image server hosted by one of their front companies to host their shitposts. By doing so everysingle person who posted something thru their site has given up their identity. I wonder if that could ever be useful. Probably not.</p>
<p>To top it all off the person who suggested this new image hosting service is now a moderator of this community with full access to everything on the subreddit. If you think this is the only example out there you are mistaken. I will not be taking questions. I encourage all free thinking people to start looking around and doing their own homework and uncovering things like this going on around them, being sponsored by shady consulting groups linked directly to the Open Society Fund.</p>
<p>Here is a cool link to a conference they held its long and boring but very telling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL12Cn7tGnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL12Cn7tGnk</a> it will probably be gone in a matter of hours once i post this. I do not have a mirror and have not ripped it.</p>

            can confirm something is very fishy. I think some of the users are masquerading as supporters. If anyone posts anything about pizza gate or the calm before the storm Q info from /pol/ then it gets taken off or buried or the shills start coming in pretending support Trump but telling the OP to "get this crap off the Donald". And the_donald has just become an echo chamber of sorts for the most vapid of posts. BORING and stale if you ask me, been a reddit/the_donald reader for over a year now.

             mods are compromised, personally I doubt it.  It's possible that one or two moles have worked their way in, but if the majority were moles, I think we would see the sub being actively sabotaged.

              The thing is, there has been something wrong with T_D, I used to be a frequent poster there, would even have good conversations with people, ever since O_S was booted, it has changed.  Add to the fact they are suppressing Q stuff?  Come on, the real T_D of old would be all over the fact that their GET is communicating with them via secret channels and needs them to help take down the whole cabal.  THEY BE ALL OVER IT.  T_D, the victor in the great meme war and big advocator of HC being a child eating rapist with JP, they are busy memeing over transgender people, and supporting Roy Moore, rather than helping their GET defeat HC and all the wicked people?

              I think this ties together nicely the resistance to PG and all the happenings over the past few weeks since Trump left for asia and why we haven't heard shit from T_D about it.  Controlled Opposition.

               There are major red flags in the stories of the only two who have accused Moore of illegal behavior, and there is allegedly an organized campaign to pay people to make these accusations, so it is reasonable to defend him against unproven accusations.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for Q, a lot of people think it is a LARP and a wild goose chase.  Personally, I still lean toward it being legit, but I can understand people thinking otherwise.  It's even possible that Q doesn't want the posts on T_D (he said they chose /pol for a reason).  If Q is real, censoring would have no point, anyway, because he said it's too late for the Clowns In America to stop anything.

                It doesn't really matter to the peds I knew, what matters is that it COULD be true and Trump COULD need you to spread the word.  That's all it would take.  I've seen the old peds get riled up by stuff with far less evidence.
