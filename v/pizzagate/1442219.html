They were attended by numerous politicians, musicians, celebrities, and elites, continue to receive funding from these sources, and currently host many of their children. I\'m not sure that they are connected to Pizzagate, but would like to get whatever information may eventually connect pieces out into the collective knowledge of those trying to figure out just what the hell is going on here. 
I worked at one of the boys camps, and, from the first day, was immensely disturbed by some of the activity that was going on, but what disturbed me most was what we called &quot;Pizza Night.&quot; Pizza Night started during the night following a massive inter-camp association dinner (hotdogs and hamburgers), dance, and fireworks show. The dance itself was oddly sexualized, and felt wrong from my view as a member of the staff. The children would gather in a gym, the staff would sit on the bleachers, and the children would court, dance, and kiss on the floor below. I noticed that it was not only staff in the bleachers, but mostly people who I had never seen before, who I assumed were some of the children\'s parents, though some looked much older. I did notice one of my senators, giving me the impression that it was family of the kids. The gym was full. The final song was open to everyone for a dance. I decided to stay on the bleachers, but most of the adults went down with the kids. The only other counselors who stayed up seemed to have found their own &quot;courtship,&quot; and were all making out as everyone below swayed back and forth to the music. It was sufficiently awkward enough for me to walk out &quot;for water&quot; and stay outside until it was over. By then, it was about midnight, and I expected to take my campers back to the cabin and for everyone else to do the same, and for the adults to go home. The adults, however, stuck around. They had a separate breakfast the next morning. I have no idea where they slept. Anyway, to my surprise, there was a fireworks show by the lake that went well into the hour of 1am before the girls and boys from other camps were shuttled back to their own campuses. I got my kids back to the cabin by 1:30, and they were all asleep by 2:30, and I was well on my way as well, until my cabin door swung open and the counselor from a neighboring cabin shook me and told me that I needed to get out of bed and run down to the nearby woods, that there\'d been an emergency. He stressed to leave the kids where they were, and that &quot;the gods&quot; would watch over them while I was out. I was dazed, and wasn\'t thinking too logically, but was still concerned about my kids, and wouldn\'t want to leave them alone in a cabin on a mountain for any reason. But my coworker insisted. We ran, I was following him, and I noticed that as we continued running, more staff came from the woods running. Finally, we got to a clearing that looked like something out of a horror movie. There was a large pile of wood, and in the middle was a small scarecrow-like effigy held, or rather embraced by a carved wooden statue of some sort of demonic creature. The staff that were there had red painted on their faces in the shape of triangles. It struck me that the effigy looked a lot like a camper: it was wearing swimming trunks, a camp t-shirt, and a camp hat. The staff approached us who had just arrived and painted our faces as well. Once everyone arrived, we were asked to lock hands in a circle around the pile of wood to begin praying. Our director was there, and said that the gods were vengeful, that they had observed the thoughts and behaviors of &quot;certain inhabitants&quot; of the camp and that a sacrifice was due so that they could be appeased. Somehow, I didn\'t see how, the wood burst into flames and the director began praying. That\'s when I heard some sort of scream from up on the mountain. By then, I was in tears. I was absolutely confused, and remain so to this day. What I do know is that we stayed down by that fire for near an hour. I was crying the whole time, because I had no idea how else to react. I\'m not really a crying type, but I was consumed by dread. The screaming continued, along with what sounded like a heard of beasts running through the leaves, until the fire died down and the effigy was gone. The carving of whatever the thing holding it was was still there, but there were small flames still around it. The director said that the gods had heard us, and that the camp had been cleansed. We were told not to speak of this to anyone, especially not to talk to campers about it, and to only make reference to one another by the words &quot;Pizza Night.&quot; For instance, if we needed to overcome grief associated with the event, we were supposed to say to one another, &quot;I still can\'t get pizza night out of my head,&quot; or &quot;What do you remember about pizza night?&quot; There was no pizza involved, so this always confused me, but through the term I learned that this is a ritual that occurs every year, directly following the dance, from 3am to 4am. Breaking the rules, the following morning at reveille, I asked all of my campers if any had heard or seen anything the night before. All of them said that they slept great and that they didn\'t think anything was weird, but one, the son of an actor in It\'s Always Sunny (sorry, I don\'t watch the show and have can\'t recall which actor), said he saw another counselor take me away right before he saw someone &quot;tall&quot; walk in after us. I continue to have flash backs to that night, but can\'t recall anything else. The only word that can capture my feelings for it are &quot;dread.&quot; When I read about pizzagate and what pizza might refer to, I began crying again. I cannot shake off the thought that those people I had seen at the dance were up to something sinister, that the entire camp was up to something sinister. When the politicians, musicians, and elites arrived to pick up their kids at the end of the session, I did not stick around for any autographs. I did not even say goodbye to my kids. I packed up my bags, loaded my truck, and drove far away. I never went back, and I removed all of the other counselors from my contacts. Like I said, I don\'t know if this has anything to do with pizzagate, but I wanted to get it out there in case anyone has any further connections to it. I don\'t feel comfortable talking about it beyond what I\'ve said, but there were 200 staff in this session alone, so I\'m hopeful that others who have experienced it throughout the years might find this and add their own thoughts and observations. I\'ve kept the name of the camp and its association anonymous for my own protection, but will say that it is perhaps 5-7 hours drive from DC in the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>',

            Hmm when I was drugged and abused by someone who went on to be elected to office, it was at summer camp. Nothing about pizza was involved, though. Danny DeVito (Always Sunny actor) appeared in a film connected to all this:
