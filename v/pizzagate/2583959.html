<p>It\'s about 20 miles from the supposed child-trafficking camp, which lies essentially on the 33rd parallel in an area called Drexel Heights: <a href="https://kek.gg/i/4z4J9H.png">https://kek.gg/i/4z4J9H.png</a></p>
<p>The area is named for the daughter of the founder of banking giant Drexel, Morgan and Co. (ie JP Morgan), who left his fortune in a trust to be passed to the Jesuits after the death of his daughters.  The daughter, Katharine, was a nun beatified by John Paul II and used to financially support poor kids in the area. <a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-generous-nun-the-namesake-for-drexel-road/article_61043ec2-9e2b-5ba7-ac24-bbdfa23a6c65.html">https://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-generous-nun-the-namesake-for-drexel-road/article_61043ec2-9e2b-5ba7-ac24-bbdfa23a6c65.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Former Arizona senator Dennis DeConcini became a strong supporter of Amity, and soon federal grants began trickling in. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, not only is DeConcini a board member of ICMEC, but he was along with John McCain (whose namesake human trafficking &quot;institute&quot; is just north in Phoenix at Arizona State) one of the Keating Five -- legislators who most enabled the financial fraud of Charles Keating in the 80s S&amp;L crisis (the biggest before 2008).</p>
<p>Keating\'s fraud was mostly through the firm Drexel-Burnham-Lambert under the infamous &quot;junk-bond king&quot; Michael Milken and his army of 100% Jew shysters, many of whom I have confirmed went on to start their own pizzagate-related firms.  <a href="https://kek.gg/i/3NbJ9K.png">One example.</a>  I consider this firm a nexus point and in fact I have pointed it out many times here in the past. </p>
<p>Lambert itself is the <a href="https://kek.gg/i/3Y4dvL.png">Belgian Rothschild branch.</a></p>
<p>Drexel is a known CIA-affiliated firm, observe this testimony from a member of the <strong>CIA\'s Pegasus Unit</strong> that implicates future Clinton FBI head Louis Freeh: <a href="https://kek.gg/i/66gCDK.png">https://kek.gg/i/66gCDK.png</a></p>

<p>..of course, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1994235">I pointed out a year ago</a> that pizzagate is obviously from Jewish Kabbalah (and only secondarily from its Christian offshoot spelled Cabala/Hermetic occult offshoot spelled Qabalah), including the <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NB9mZdVML._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">Pegasus codename</a>, but lead kike-shill <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> simply deleted it because &quot;Pegasus is Greek mythology not Jewish&quot; and publicly labeled me shill ever since.<br />
