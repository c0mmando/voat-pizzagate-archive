            ABC has retracted this story.  Zero Hedge makes it clear that the direction to contact Russia was as pres-elect not as candidate.  :)

             Now that makes a HUGE difference. Not collusion. Just a new prez reaching out to Russia. I didn't realize that ABC was so scummy as to blast a fake news story all over the airwaves and internet. Took away from the Steinle acquittal. Distraction. Should have known. I hate the propagandists we have serving as news organizations. How can they simply tell LIES and then retract it as if no damage was done? And this wasn't even a story where they couldn't get the facts straight.

              but it is frustrating how slowly this is all dripping down. I think there is a lot more hollywood and msm that needs to be gutted first. This is playing out in "our" favor, only very slowly.

               I was upset by this news! It would have meant collusion. Are you kidding me? I would have been devastated if our POTUS were so charged! After all the work and headway we've made? It would have been an unbelievable set back and been grounds to launch a long attack and legal proceedings.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, it was all FAKE!!!! I amended the OP to reflect that, but I'm not deleting this post. You know how things disappear, and I want there to be evidence that this occurred. No going down the rabbit hole. I'm a major contributor to that phenomenon. Someone brings something up, and I'm like, "Oh, yeah! That did happen, didn't it?" So it stays!
              </p>
              <p>
               I just couldn't understand why no one else was getting more upset, but there you go! I actually read things ...screw me! But sometimes it helps. Did you read the Jack Posobiec tweet about Obamacare and the tax plan? We all heard about the eradication of an individual mandate. Translated it means:

               <p>
                Remember when you all claimed Obamacare was a tax? Trump is set to repeal it in the tax bill Played!

            Sorry, not buying your story. Flynn is going to sing all about the bullshit he found and endured under the Obama Admin. Remember they fired him for speaking out and wanted to silence him.  I believe the entire Cabal has been played.  If I am wrong I will pass out in disbelief, but I don’t think that is going to happen. ABC = Project Mockingbird, peeps.  #TheStorm has arrived.

               But the fake news outlet ABC stated that he was directed DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. That's what I was reacting to. It would have been a game changer and no matter what he testified to it wouldn't have mattered because that would have been grounds for collusion. But that was FAKE I understand that now that a correction has been made.

              There was no collusion with Russia. He was directed by Trump After the election to speak to Russia. It did not involve the election. Flynn is taking one for the team to bring down the Cabal with his testimony.  It will be brutal. Mueller will pull the plug on Deep State. If I am wrong I will apologize to you, but I think I am very right.

                Flynn to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with Russians: Report

               <ul>
                <li>
                 Former National Security Advisor Gen. Michael Flynn is reportedly willing to testify that President Donald Trump and Trump transition officials directed him to make contact with Russians
                 <strong>
                  during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign
                 </strong>
                 .
                </li>
                <li>
                 Flynn has pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI, a felony that is believed to be part of a deal to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Trump has vehemently denied that he ever had anything to do with Russia.
                </li>
               </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Flynn is not taking one for the team. He is giving evidence that can be used to prove Trump colluded with Russia since this was during the campaign. This is disastrous. Why do you think I'm going so crazy?

                 This isn't about Flynn being in trouble. The whole point is that his charges aren't noteworthy. The problem is what he will testify to! He's going to testify that he was directed to contact the Russians DURING Trump's 2016 Campaign! This will get both Kushner and Trump. This is what the dems wanted. They needed proof of collusion and contact and this is it and Flynn is selling out the POTUS for a menial crime.

                 does someone who pleads guilty still testify? Seems that the plea negates the opportunity to present evidence, what is the procedure for Flynn in regards to guilty plea?

                  In his plea agreement he will offer testimony to the Special Counsel, thereby, telling what he knows. Something tells me he has a lot to say about the prior admin as he was in intel. He knows plenty. He is pleading only to lying to FBI not anything else.

                   So basically he can say whatever he wants and then gets sentenced? I would expect at that point Trump pardons him anyway.

            It's absolutely ridiculous that he's pleading guilty and mainstream media is eating it up. Yet, there's still that Satanic wench Hillary signing her lame books and running her mouth. I'm so sick of these people getting away with everything.

            I don't think we should come to any conclusions yet. It's hard to say what will come out in Flynn's testimony. Remember this article:
            <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/02/14/flynns-son-who-pushed-phony-pizzagate-blames-dads-downfall-on-disinformation-campaign/">
             https://nypost.com/2017/02/14/flynns-son-who-pushed-phony-pizzagate-blames-dads-downfall-on-disinformation-campaign/
            </a>
            and this one:
            <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-flynn-tweets-hillary-clinton-2016-11">
             http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-flynn-tweets-hillary-clinton-2016-11
            </a>
            . Does anyone else remember reading that Flynn had the names of politicians involved in CCP and trafficking of children?

             What makes you think these questions will be asked? This is about Russia, not CCP and trafficking children. Mueller isn't going to bring it up, so there's no cross possible. And it wouldn't be admissible as a defense.

            This is silly. Theater. Trump instructing Flynn to speak with the Russians is nothing more than instructing him to do his job. The conversations that Flynn apparently "lied" about both occurred in December, as I understand it. AFTER THE ELECTION, this has nothing to do with Trump or Russian meddling in the election.

             Yep, they took the bait, but Holder ( his tweets to DOJ in July telling his peeps to remain vigilant and duty, honor, country bullshit) and Pelosi (even with her newly acquired Alzheimer’s) realizes this and want a NEW Special Prosecutor. It will work out.

             No, this is NOT nothing. It means testifying against Trump which will lead to a whole new round of indictments.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why else would Comey chime in? I called out in another comment that it was the testimony to the FBI and Comey that prompted this whole fiasco! If I hadn't been right on that, Comey would have never chimed in tossing out Bible verses. BIBLE VERSES!!!! That sack of shit!!!! And his new book is entitled, "A HIGHER LOYALTY!" I believe he's talking about his pledge to Satan!!!! Good luck with that, Mr. Howdy Doody-faced Comey!!!!

              I don't doubt that they are
              <em>
               trying
              </em>
              to pursue this narrative to impeach him, but like all their previous attempts, this will turn out to be an epic fail that will backfire spectacularly (it always does). The problem for them is they have nothing and they know it! The Trump/Russia story is a fairy tale and it is not possible to file indictments over a fairy tale. If they truly had something on Trump, it would have been all over a looong time ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              They're desperate. But it's all over for them. Trump ain't going anywhere.

               This is enough to continue investigation, indict, and cause the administration to be thrown into defending itself. It's not nothing ... it just is not.

               There had better be a countercharge against Mueller. Something needs to happen to derail this. If Assange doesn't come through, this is going to be disastrous.

             BULL F*CKING SHIT!!!!! Crokin defends these whores each and every time!!!! She defends the shill Feldman. You've been redpilled, but not all the way!!!! Crokin is a disinfo specialist!!!! She LOVES PedoWood and the people that make it what it is!!!! She's been seduced.

             And you can call me anything you want. It doesn't bother me. I'll let me posts and words speak for who and what I am. You don't see any of my posts lauding Mueller and misleading you into believing that Trump and Mueller worked out some kind of deal.

            Not sure I believe this. The son has shared Trumps tweets,  like the day before yesterday. So if his dad flipped, I really don't think he would be doing that.

            There's quite a bit  of misinformation in the article linked, tiny details that make a big difference. For example, the article asserts that Trump told Comey to let this go. No, he didn't tell him to let it go.

             There is no proof of what was said.. We are believing what Trump said. And plus this is a news item, not what Mueller would use.

              The article quotes Comey's memo and spins it. "I hope you can let this go" is not an order. This is not Trump telling Comey to drop it.

               It's VERY open to interpretation. But Comey, I believe, if I'm remembering correctly, has already stated he didn't interpret this as an order in testimony. So thank goodness for that IF I'm not misremembering.

             It isn't illegal, but it is in this case. This is enough to bring a charge of COLLUSION and have the whole of Trump's presidency fighting this charge!

                   I can't stand Equineluvr. I thought it was funny because the original poster is always going off on people. She will tell people they are vile and that she's blocking them. So I thought the comment was funny. Equineluvr hasn't been around in a long time and we hate each other. His alt is still here tho but under the profile name

                Just 1? Okay he said Obama was spying on him and tapping his phones. That was true. There are more, but I don’t feed trolls. Flynn now has the immunity he needs to roll on the previous admin. Read the details of his plea. He is working on a covert deal per the plea. Also per the plea, he will likely get 0 jail time and only 9,500 in fines. Also per the plea, nothing he did with regard to Russia was illegal. That whole Russia thing was a nothing burger. He was there for uranium one. Like I said, let it play out. Honey pot set.

               That's the problem. And if you notice Trump has really been pressuring his lousy son of bitching GOP'ers to rein in Mueller! Why do you think that is? Because he has a deal with Mueller? NO! That isn't what somebody with a deal does!!!! And now Mueller is going after somebody else whose name I can't remember because I'm so f*ckng upset!!!! He's going CRAZY AND NO ONE IS STOPPING HIM BECAUSE HIS JOB IS TO BRING DOWN THIS ADMINISTRATION!!!!

              Don't be Silly man. That is not even close to being enough to charge Anyone With Collusion... If anyone connected to trump, including trump, Gets charged... it will be because Trump Wants that to happen. You can't Charge Anyone in the Trump administration because
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                There is nothing to charge him for.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                There are countless people Who can be charged based on clear cut evidence of Collusion as well as every other crime Imaginable. So that's why I say, If anyone is charged, It will Be because Trump admin wanted to be "fair".... But again, there isn't anything to actually charge him with.
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              There is no situation In which Trump Can be attacked within the guide lines of the law, Or frankly, In any legitimate manner.  Simple as that. They can make up whatever they want in the MSM, And It only strengthens Trump.  There are no Legit Angles to attack trump, Hence "Grab them by the pussy gate"... which we all know ended Up being one of the most satisfying Deep state back fires in the last year or two.
             </p>
             <p>
              They only way to stop Trump- Is to JFK him... Even threats, Or attacks carried out against his family wouldn't be enough.  They all knew what they were getting into. But That is not going to happen Under any circumstances.

               I can Say that confidently because If I'm wrong than Who cares- We're fucked.

              Trump is prepared for anything and everything.

              Ah so decent people who care about children being abused are going to come here and see commentators like yourself use words like fuck, cunt, retard.  I presume many decent people will take one look and leave this site in horror.  But perhaps that is your intent, to discredit the site.  I am hoping that the mods will start applying the rules in a consistent manner as that will give the site more credibility.

I know that is true about Flynn.  I assume the moderators wrote the rules because new people posting on the site might not know that about Flynn.  A faggot is a male homosexual.  I am neither male nor homosexual.

                The mods are clearly using the rules against some people and ignoring their own rules for others.  Hmm isn't that what the elites do - write rules for us common folks while ignorning the rules themselves.  I understand the need for rules.  I accept that several of my posts violated the rules, frankly because I thought I knew the rules based on what was submitted and not deleted.  So I decided I had better go read the rules again, slowly and carefully.  And to my surprise I found that the mods were not following their own rules.  How can we call the elites to task if mods here write rules and then don't follow them?

              Rule 3 states that all titles must ...establish direct relevance to pizzagate.  Rule one says "Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities."  The submission fails to point out how Flynn's plea is relevant to the Pizzagate.  It may well be from past information.  But the submission does not make that clear.
              <br/>
              I am pointing out such things to be sure that the moderators delete all posts that don't meet the rules, not just the ones they don't like.

             This. I know I'm preaching to the choir for posting this as a response to your comment, but it's for others to read, as I want to piggy back on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the other (more likely) narrative that people have yet to understand. It will "force" him onto the stand, by which the U1 deal and hopefully the human-trafficking side of it, etc, may be revealed.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's just as likely that his threat to plead not guilty was a holdout - while negotiating how to proceed - in regard to the Mueller investigation. It seems to serve as a sign that they secured the the deal, which is to say, they made sure that they had all of the required things in place, to do what they had planned all along: get him on the stand, not to defend his actions, but to make him the scapegoat (in the good, useful, tactical sense of the word) that connects the investigation to the real purpose: exposing the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             My speculation derives from the notion that this is consistent with the expectation that everything is continuing to go as planned, as it has been. Add to that the continued mainline ignorance of the preponderance of facts regarding the "other" real and actual investigation into the U1 deal, and how that hasn't been factored into public opinion as of yet, and won't just go away as a non-player, especially if the current WH is truly "up against the ropes". It seems that the best way to attack is to force the hand to have been put there, in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the arm-chair prosecution being waged by everyone on social media and news outlets that are enthusiastically opining
             <em>
              yet again
             </em>
             that this is the death noll for Trump, are yet again doing it with full ignorance, disbelief, or non-disclosure that there is a real case that connects all of the investigation to a bigger scandal - and not one of Trump's involvement, but one that involves a cabal that is, matter-of-factly in the process of being dismantled in front of the public's eyes, as evidenced by the high profile figures involved becoming embroiled in scandal, in the mainstream, and yet not acknowledged as relevant by the ignorant or complicit masses.

              I hope you're right. We are seeing very small picture. There are all kinds of things going on behind the scenes that we aren't aware of. As passionate as Flynn jr is about pizzagate, I can't imagine that his father would fold that easy. We need to keep an eye on Flynn Jr's tweets.

              glad to have you on board, piggyback away !  Great comprehensive analysis for the fence sitters and chicken littles, and I can't add anything more. I see the WAPO ( clowns in action ) is holding back this story, which shows extreme nervousness about it's meaning.

              While your post is reasoned, just look what happened. COMEY CHIMED IN!!!! It was the Flynn statement that he made to COMEY AND THE FBI that's the lynchpin! I called this correctly and have already responded about this even before Howdy Doody face CHIMED IN!!! I added it to the original OP and will add it here:

               Everything on both sides is and will be a theatrical playing out of chess moves, as both sides continue to look as many moves  ahead as possible and have contingencies for all possibilities. Not much is off-the-cuff, but rooted deeply in political game theory, all my speculation of course, and not to be believed as more than my opinion.

               So, interesting times, indeed nevertheless. My purpose, for myself, and in the assistance of others, is to remove contradiction of thought as possible by bringing lesser considered information to light, first. And then I have a base from which to philosophize and make claims, not trying to prosecute the case. That's happening on its own. I'm trying to help build awareness, by helping people look deeper. So that's what I do :)

                Understood, but this is not nothing. Nor is Mueller on Trump's team. He is a with Comey, Killary, Pedosta, and the rest of them. Surely gamesmanship makes you identify players and what team they're on? Well, Mueller is NOT on Trump's team. NOT. I don't care how many unicorn pronouncements are made.
               </p>
               <p>
                My gameship theory? There has to be something big coming down the pike. Something that either Trump will use (not likely) or come out from a source friendly to Trump (most likely: Assange ...) It's too much to ask for the GOP'ers who are on Trump's team to rein this in. Mueller is now going after someone else. Why do you think Trump would be making this plea? Because Mueller is out of control! He's on a mission ... think Terminator.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's my read. Something needs to happen. A big something to derail this. Goddamn Assange for not releasing what he has on Killary, but him I will give a pass to and see his delaying the evidence is part of the game and something that will help Trump. Both their futures of well-being are entwined. P.S. I almost fell over when Pamela "the honey pot" Anderson tried to get to Pence!!!! If he does trap him into meeting with her, you know there'll be sex harassment charges against him.
