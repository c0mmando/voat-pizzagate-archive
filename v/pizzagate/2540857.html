<p>She is affiliated with the Corcoran School of Art, which has deep ties to the Luzzatto\'s, good friends of the Podestas and Alefantis. Transformer Gallery has held their auction galas there, among other places. </p>
<p>Francis Luzzatto, related to Alefantis friend Tamera Luzzatto, was once the head of the gallery. They are closely tied to the Council on Foreign relations

<p>After leaving the OSS at the end of World War Two, and before entering the diplomatic field, in 1948-1949 David Bruce was with the Economic Cooperation Administration which administered the so-called Marshall Plan.

<p>What\'s weird is that a single company own Uptown Pizza LLC and The Trustees of the Corcoran Gallery, a possible funnel for art auction revenue. So let me get this straigh:. A gallery with PROVEN CIA/OSS links just happens to be owned by the same people who own an objectively low-budget pizza place with nothing to do with art. Okay. </p>

<p>Klagsbrun is part of the art therapy movement that emerged from Tavistock during the 20th Century. With its roots in Freudian and Jungian psychological studies, the art therapy program helped study the effects of trauma and abuse on mentally-challenged patients at various UK hospitals. <strong>This also extended to research into the diagnosis and recognition of disease and trauma <em>based</em> on visual symbolism appearing in artwork. Melanie Klein (MK) was a tavistock doc and pioneer of trauma splitting.</strong></p>

<p>This latter detail is extremely important, because it means that the art can &quot;reveal&quot; traumas, some of them concealed from the public eye, on canvases that experts can then use to confirm certain types of abuse and violence. This is still a working theory, but one thing worth thinking about is if this is possibly one facet of the operations of a larger global pedophile ring. With this technique, Rothschilds can confirm acts of abuse without actual documented &quot;proof&quot; of it occurring. </p>

<p>The preface to this paper shows that the methodology used for art therapy, including those later adopted by Miriam Rothschild, derived by Sigmund Freud and his daughter, Anna. I could go on for hours talking about the corrupt practices of the Freud family, be it the involvement of Sigmund in the coverup of abused children in Vienna, or the insidious actions of Clement Freud following the disappearance and assumed murder of Madeline McCann. Oh, and that he\'s a notorious pedophile. It\'s all connected. </p>

           This latter detail is extremely important, because it means that the art can "reveal" traumas, some of them concealed from the public eye, on canvases that experts can then use to confirm certain types of abuse and violence. This is still a working theory, but one thing worth thinking about is if this is possibly one facet of the operations of a larger global pedophile ring. With this technique, Rothschilds can confirm acts of abuse without actual documented "proof" of it occurring.

           The preface to this paper shows that the methodology used for art therapy, including those later adopted by Miriam Rothschild, derived by Sigmund Freud and his daughter, Anna. I could go on for hours talking about the corrupt practices of the Freud family, be it the involvement of Sigmund in the coverup of abused children in Vienna, or the insidious actions of Clement Freud following the disappearance and assumed murder of Madeline McCann. Oh, and that he's a notorious pedophile. It's all connected.

            tl;dr for now. But I remember reading on 4chan that there are doctors called The Visionaries that manage a group of artists by keeping them sedated and properly fucked up so they continue to create art that have occult meaning and are sell-able in the art market for laundering money. The artists he showed were catatonic.

Alejandro Jodorowsky  is someone I bring up time to time, to remind. Someone told me that if you want to do something illegal, just go to a place where it is legal. Not lawful, just legal.

            Uptown Pizza is located (not a real pizza place) at the address of the Bath Fitters.  It looks like Andrew Kline owns it.  Did Voat ever track him down in detail?

            Do you have a hypothesis?  I think we all know the entire art world is corrupt and perverse.  Art has always been traded as currency.  Pedo art for rich pedophile big dollar museum donors.  Makes sense. Sickening.

             you'd really love to think so, but like so much you say that is ignorant bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             art was once a serious profession in which the products could be objectively valued by their adherence to established techniques and artists studied under masters of established schools of style.:

            <p>
             it only became an easy laundering tool when Jews used their media monopolies to mainstream
             <a href="https://kek.gg/i/4-GMYd.png">
              "modern art"

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             recognize any of these jews?

            <p>
             since jews are known the world over for financial manipulation AND bizarre, low taste in art and entertainment, it should be funny to hear your attempt to refute the fact that the entire art angle is 100% Jewish, as i exemplified here:

               that's your "tell" for getting utterly owned: inane "loser" jokes.  i'd retort that when you play poker you probably leave without even the clothes you came in, but it's surely gay strip poker anyway

            Freud's wife has also been accused of pedophilia by a 16 yr. old boy.  Lucien Freud is painting artwork on the Rothschild Wine Bottles.  OK a wine bottles are small evidence but naming a child after someone? I think there are much more interesting connections with the Freuds and Rothschilds.

             Gunderson notified Sessions too. I think either Trump forced them to complete the investigation or Mueller is a complete stooge for the establishment. Don't really trust him IMO.

              I know. Tragic. Not one but BOTH sons turned out gay and one photographs his mother in provacative pics, same with his sister. The daughter, now a young teen, is basically being raised by a nanny and attends regular Kabbalah meetings. So tragic as she is such a lost little soul...
