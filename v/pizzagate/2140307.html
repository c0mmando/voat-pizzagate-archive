            Please, nothing for ChildFund.  The execs make outrageous salaries, just like Red Cross, American Cancer Society and American Heart Association.  These NGO's have used the government model to pick the carcass dry.  If you see someone starting a foundation, figure that they have learned it's an easy way to get money easily and without having to pay taxes.  Sorry, feeling really cynical today.

            this is an excellent topic.  knowing what we know now, it's increasingly difficult to put our support 100% behind
            <em>
             any
            </em>
            of the big-name child rescue organizations (and likely alot of the smaller ones as well.)  a new organization that we all trust will eventually be needed sooner or later (ideally after the mass arrest of the pedo elite) that could verify rescue groups' by giving them their 'this-company-is-not-trying-to-steal-your-money-and-rape-your-kids seal of approval.'  the sad fact is that this will need to be done with any organization or business that that focuses on kids:  entertainment agents, daycares, orphanages, charities, toy companies, video game manufactures, clothing companies, Hollywood/TV producers, and online content creators (I'm sure I'm leaving quite a few out.)
           </p>
           <p>
            This topic actually hits quite close to home for me.  Last fall (pre-#pizzagate), I founded a mobile application startup that focuses on children's educational and charitable apps.  Needless to say, the revelations over the past 10-11 months have broken my heart, sunken my soul, and decimated my faith in just about every institution, all while naturally causing significant delays with my startup.  But there has been a least one positive thing to come out of all this ...it has strengthened my resolve to build the safest, most secure product possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            but, back to the topic at hand, who do we trust that could help launch an anti#pg certification organization for us?  The Hagmanns perhaps?  i'm having trouble thinking of a single person/group who we all trust completely, with everyone being accused of being 'a shill' at one point or another (Sawyer, Honeybee, Seaman, AJ, Wayne Madson, Steve Pieczenik, etc, etc, etc... even Yoichi Shimatsu, who has apparently been fighting pedos for decades, was called a 'limited hangout ' early today.)
           </p>
           <p>
            so gang, who to trust??

            I
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1770744">
             posted back in April
            </a>
            about Operation Underground Railroad and how Glenn Beck funded it with $1.5 million. My inference is that the June 2013 whistleblower that Beck mentioned and then went silent about, related to Pedogate -- and that Beck then eased his conscience by funding rescue of trafficked children in Haiti. He approached fellow Mormon Tim Ballard and within just a couple of months, O.U.R. was underway.
           </p>
           <p>
            To be fair, George Webb has said some negative things about founder Tim Ballard and O.U.R. There was a discussion
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1665348">
             here on v/pizzagate back in February 2017
            </a>
            that you should look at. However, I have not seen any negative chatter since then, and George Webb has been spectacularly wrong about a bunch of things. Keeping in mind that Beck did not fund an existing child rescue group, but asked a friend to create one, it would be hard for the pedos to corrupt it. So I still consider O.U.R. as being on our side.
           </p>
           <p>
            You might also consider funding Selah Freedom, the rescue and support organization in Sarasota, FL.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2140225">
             I posted about this earlier today
            </a>
            . Again, nothing is ever certain, but Elizabeth Melendez-Fisher, a Republican socialite, married to a realtor named Scott Fisher, was new in Sarasota and wanted to set up a charity that dealt with issues "no one was looking at". The annual budget is over $1 million, it's pretty transparent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, I confess that in suggesting these two choices I have an ulterior motive. I'd like your money to indirectly advance the research we are doing here. If O.U.R. is legit, then I think it follows that not only Beck, but Tim Ballard and possibly others involved in that group have knowledge of the whistleblower episode. The pedos have to know that, and yet O.U.R. has survived. It wouldn't hurt to have someone from Voat reach out to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise with Sarasota. Obviously all we can do right now is speculate, but it's interesting that a national anti-trafficking organization has its headquarters literally just down the road from where we think the head of SOBIB has his international smuggling operation. One would think that sooner or later, tips or clues or threats would surface at Selah Freedom regarding the goings-on at Sarasota Airport.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, you may want to go in an entirely different direction, and put your money far away from such flashpoints as these. But these are both interesting options, I think you must agree.

            You can check on the legitimacy of an organisation by clicking on its 'Affiliates', 'Funding' or 'Organisations that support us'.  If any of these name George Soros, Open Society, Amnesty, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, HRW, UN, UNESCO, it's dirty.  If it doesn't support anti-trafficking legislation and its says that child sex workers and vulnerable women are 'empowered' by legalised or decriminalised prostitution, it's not legitimate.  It is known that the only way to curb sex trafficking is by ending demand.
            <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453">
             Decriminalisation and legalisation of brothel owners, pimps &amp; sex buyers increase trafficking
            </a>
            .  The majority of sex trafficked women are lured into prostitution from third world countries like Romania, the Ukraine and Asia into first world countries with decriminalised prostitution such as Netherlands and Germany, where there are not enough local women to fill demand and crime gangs traffic young girls who are then kept in debt bondage, their passports confiscated and their families' lives threatened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those organisations not seeking to end demand are not serious; in fact, I'd go so far as to say that some of them may be profiting from trafficking (as proven in Italy when it was found that George Soros's NGO had been in communication with traffickers).   Assume that any NGO set up by George Soros is dirty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any group that supports the Nordic Model of prostitution and seeks to end demand is legitimate.

            I can't say for sure, but what about Potter's Village?
            <a href="http://thepottersvillage.org/">

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The decision to establish The Potters Village was based on the realization that for many children in Africa, the future is uncertain and the reality of childhood is different and bleak because they are denied education, parental care, love and protection. Many of them suffer neglect, violence, exploitation and all kinds of abuse and therefore have to abandon their homes and roots to end up on the streets. Unfortunately, women who are the builders of our homes, responsible for raising children to become responsible adults, are least appreciated and mostly abused and neglected by their husbands and even sometimes the society in which they live. This underscores the need for a concerted effort from all stakeholders in maintaining the health, emotional and socio-economic wellbeing of women, as well as children.
We at The Potters Village believe that the survival, protection and empowerment of vulnerable people in society, especially women and children, should be our primary focus because they are the future of the nation. That is why The Potters Village is committed to helping women and children to reach their full potential and to have fulfillment in life.

             Also seems legit, but no history there. I know there are a lot of startups but I'm leery of those since there is nothing to judge on but the "pitch".

            Gary Haugen is the founder. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have both commended IJM for its work. During International Women's Day on 12 March 2004, Bush extolled the work of an IJM official in charge of anti-trafficking operations. Bush went on to state that the U.S. government would stand by IJM's mission to end sex slavery.[47] In 2012, Obama said International Justice Mission was "truly doing the Lord's work" during the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.[48][49]   He also received money from the Bill and Linda Gates Found.  Hmm.  I would hold off and do a little more research on the IJM.

             That's just the problem I guess. How much is enough? I've known one lawyer who worked for IJM personally and it seems pretty legit. They have been around a while and have quite a large number of cases that they have successfully prosecuted and rescued. They are also large and I'm sure there could be a few bad actors in there.

              Unfortunately, they have been infiltrated at the top.  I am sure there are many good people in such a large outfit, but knowing where and who they are, is tough.  I have a feeling the money is being controlled by the top tier.  The rest of the people at the bottom are a mix of right and wrong.  There are many good players that don't know what the bad actors are doing.  They have imo, concocted a good plan, but not perfect for that is how we are uncovering them.  Good.

             Just saw this . Haha. Wow I cannot stress enough how shady most , if not all foundations catering to woman and children are! You would be far better off throwing your money in the street ! By that I mean , go help people yourself .  Otherwise your really just giving your money to an idea that you like .( save children and woman )

              Good advice. I'll look for opportunities locally. At least then I can sort of keep tabs on what's going on. I don't think there is a whole lot of trafficking going on in my community though.

              Yes, my friend (a former nurse) and I have been doing small things to help a pastor with the homeless.  We help him with supplying first aid kits and socks.  This is a small thing, but you would be surprised as to how much a help this is.  It is way on the other side of town, but we drop off the supplies every two weeks to the pastor.  We have friends and relatives that help with the supplies.  It really is a small operation and takes very little work.  There are so many things people can do.  Just ask.  Find out in your town where help is needed.  You can watch the local news.  There are homeless everywhere and they have children. Women's Homeless Shelters.
