            , I'm giving this the "Accuracy in Question" flair. It's fake news. The archbishop was not endorsing pedophiles as the article claims. He was defending the Seal of Confession. Priests who break it are automatically excommunicated. They are required by virtue of all the vows they take to go to jail rather than break the silence of the Confessional.

            God supports justice. There is no way to logically put the confession ritual over God’s own feelings and desire for justice. Imagine explaining that to God’s face. This is a false doctrine, IMO.

            "Hart insisted that sexual abuse was “a spiritual encounter with God through the priest” and was “of a higher order” than criminal law." This sentence makes no sense - it is not what he is arguing. What he is saying is that the sacrament of confession is "a spiritual encounter" etc. The argument is that disclosures made during confession should be privileged. You may disagree with that, but there is no point in misrepresenting him.

            This specifically about confessions.   Here's how the Gaurdian reported it
           </p>
           <p>
            Melbourne archbishop says he'd rather go to jail than report child abuse heard in confession
Denis Hart says ‘communication with God is of a higher order’ after child sex abuse inquiry calls for failure to report to become a criminal offence
           </p>
           <p>
            This doesn't preclude them turning over pedophiles in other cases.  And, of course, this is not new.  Other crimes like murder can be confessed to as well.  I wonder if turn yourself into the authorities can be part of the penance.

            Catholics are a disgrace. They do absolutely nothing about this. They just keep their heads down and keeping giving the church money. I make a point to call them out and shame them whenevr I can.

            Not to mention advocating for bringing in people who dont belong in civilized society from Africa, Asia, Central/South America, and Middle East...

             All religions have this issue.  Catholics and Muslims definitely have the biggest problems with pedos as best as anyone can tell.  All other religions seem to have a representative number of pedos, but not disproportionate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Vatican and Catholic church has been a haven for pedos, even recruiting them.  Pedophilia is endemic into the Muslim culture.  Within Muslim majority countries, it's impossible to determine.  I know from my own personal experiences that almost every Pashtun I've met (a lot) has homosexual tendencies and are generally terrified of females.  Fucked up culture.

              You forgot to mention judaism which promotes the rape of children throughout its "holy book", the Talmud. Freemasonry is much the same since it is founded on jew mysticism.

                  I don't belong to the NSDAP of the 20s to 40s, no, but I'm very sympathetic to their cause and their holy war against world jewry, to whose ranks you belong. I would join a similar organization in a heartbeat. I relish the prospect of ridding the world of jew poison, stuff like your Talmud, which promotes child rape and every other atrocity imaginable.

                  Also, you didn't answer my question. Where in the Bible is child rape promoted, as you claim?

                      So since everyone raped back then you think the Bible is saying " hey look everyone raped back then " so it must be condoned by God? Wth? Please explain if I'm off here .. those real stories in the Bible are there as a warning for us . Rape kids? You will be destroyed eventually if you don't change your ways , pretty simple . Just like Sodom and Gommorah

                       TL;DR: All religions, cultures, nation states have used rape in all forms as a method to control and as a spoil of war since the dawn of man. Rape as a tool and spoil has been tamped down to a minimum, largely thanks to the modern exchange of information as well as positive evolution (though many may disagree).  The UN expose shows where the poorest are completely at the mercy of Modern Man.  It still occurs.

                       The bibles, koran, talmud are all just a sliver in the history of mankind.  Shit, the fucking Mayans raped and slit open children as a public sacrificial offering. That is proven fact.  Let's go after them.  Genghis Khan?  That raping and pillaging mofo spread his seed as far west as Finland.

                    You're a good oven dodger, but not good at dodging questions. C'mon jew, humor me, what passage in the Bible allegedly condones child rape? Cause none of those passages talk about it.

                     You are aware Nazis were known for their promiscuous homosexuality as well as their drug addiction.  Maybe you should back off on the Pervatin before you pop a vessel.

                     Look, as fun as you were to play with, I have no lingering interest in fucking with you.  You are nowhere remotely an intellectual equal.  That is evidenced in both your writings and your responses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You can claim faux victory, call me a Jew, whatever.... It really has no bearing on anything which has to do with me nor do I give a flying fuck what you think.  The best you could do is ignore the passages and the obvious.

                     You are nothing more than a paid employee of the lowest sort.  The guy that cleans the jizz out of the peep shows actually ranks higher than you.  You are a conscripted scribe.

                     <p>
                      Wow, you kikes really are disgusting. Stuff of nightmares.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Typical things kikes do:
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        Falsely project their own perversion onto others, as you do in the first paragraph.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        Falsely claim self-perceived intellectual superiority over others, as you do in the second paragraph - you're stupid, though.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        Even when called out as a kike, which you very, very obviously are, you still refuse to own up to being a kike, you shapeshifting demon. Also you never answered the question, but just slinked off like the liar you are.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        This is one is interesting and very typical of kikes, as well. Kikes are obsessed of financial gain and positions of status. They, like you do, will seriously try to insult someone by suggesting that they may be of a lower socio-economic background as if this would be an insult to anyone who actually has a functioning soul.* Then you finish it off with once more suggesting that I'm poorer than, what, you, a usurious greedy kike? Don't worry, my "squalor" is quite manageable, but you know, no amount of money can buy you a good soul.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>
                      *Also, this is the double whammy; the kike combines his hinting at my alleged poverty with yet more disgusting sexual imagery. This really is the cherry on the top. But no, I don't work at such a seedy establishment, that's the kind of place kikes hang out at.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Behold the archetypical, eternal kike in all his baseness.

               Christianity doesn't have a problem with child rape since it is never promoted in its teachings in the first place. Hurting children is a grievous sin. Christianity does not condone such atrocities. Catholicism is not Christian, but heavily infused with paganism, and more recently, I am sure, occult beliefs from talmudic judaism. Islam has a child rapist as its prophet. Child rape is even more ingrained in talmudic judaism. Also, all these religions "didn't star with judaism", as you claim. Rabbinic, talmudic "judaism" came into existence around the first century BC while Christianity had been around for well over a millennium before that - the religion of the Israelites is largely the same as that which developed after Christ, so I conflate them. However, Islam may just be inspired by talmudic judaism. There are rumors about Mohammed's origin...

                I dont get how you think christianity was a thing BEFORE Christ?... If you think the religion of the Israelites is Christian that is misguided no? All these religions DID start with Judaism, more specifically the Babylonian religion... They share much of the same symbollogy with the black cube and saturn worship...

                 Christianity and the belief system of the ancient Israelites are very similar, to the point that they could be called earlier and later developments of the same religion. Both believe in the trinity of one God, called Yahweh in the Old Testament. Both have the same moral principles and worldview. The Israelites knew of the coming of the messiah, the Son of God, Christ, who fulfilled the prophesies of old. Etc etc. Only changes in ritual behavior occurred during and after Christ. The spiritual core was the same. One could call the religion of the Israelites proto-Christianity, and it would be a correct description.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Talmudic judaism came into existence around 200-500 AD in Babylon although it was based on earlier pharisee beliefs, dating to the first century BC, more or less. Christianity obviously has nothing to do with any of this and stands in stark opposition to everything taught in the Talmud. It is misleading when people speak of Abrahamic religions. There is only one Abrahamic religion, that is, Christianity and the proto-Christianity practiced by Israelites. Islam and talmudic judaism are cheap knock-offs, mockeries of Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I of course agree with you on the occult practices found in Islam and especially "judaism", the black cube, saturn and all. These things don't concern real Christianity though, which something like Catholicism is not.

                  Proto Christianity, IS Judaism lol. There werent separate people practicing Judaism and Proto-Christianity....It is Judaism....If you arent from the desert, why follow a religion of dirsty desert dwellers? Christians certainly observe many of the things in the OT like dietary restrictions and observing the sabbath on Saturday right? Oh you dont?....funny.... Christianity was never officially a thing and established until council of nicea...Just FYI.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The proto  Christianity you speak of was used to describe the pre-orthodox Christian movement in teh 3rd century.... Christianity COMES from JUDAISM.... It is NOT a correct description because you never had any Jews worshiping differently in what could be considered Christianity until CHRIST came around, then there was a split.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The only  authentic Abraham religion there  is JUDAISM because that is what Abraham started and Christianity and Islam are direct offshoots of this. You cant play this cherry picking game and rename something just so you can feel better about worshiping a Jewish God.

                   What on earth is the "war god Yahweh"? There is simply Yahweh, our Father in heaven. There is only one God in the Bible, Yahweh, with whom many Israelites made a covenant. Some Israelites went rogue and worshipped false gods that don't exist. What of it?

                   ^Ok so you're into some pagan garbage. I see. Well I'm not interested in any of that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Proto-Christianity is the religion of the ancient Israelites. Judaism is a common term used for the pagan religion that fake jews practice. I wouldn't confuse the two. I'm not from the desert and neither were the ancient Israelites. They lived in the fertile crescent, an area that could yield up to three crops a year. To say that they lived in a desert is tantamount to saying that Europeans among the Mediterranean live in a desert. Interesting fixation you have with climate and vegetation. Either way, Yahweh is the Creator and God of the whole world. His presence is not restricted to Canaan or the Armenian Highlands (whence Abraham came), or any other corner of the world for that matter. You have some serious materialism issues, not to mention your bizarre preoccupation with climate and vegetation, which is funny since you expose yourself to have no grasp of geography.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you weren't ignorant, the New Testament tells us that we no longer need to follow all the rules of the Israelites since a new covenant has been made with a different people. Read up. Having said that, I see no problem with the prospect of following the OT dietary laws. If God tells us that some things are better for eating than others, I can't think of a better authority to dictate a healthy diet. Problem?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Aha, so Christianity did not exist before 325 AD. Is that what you're saying? Wow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you weren't ignorant I wouldn't have to give you this lecture, but I'm nice. Have you heard of a thing called the Talmud? If you had a look at what the Talmud says, you would know that kikes don't follow the Bible. The Talmud spits on the OT constantly, making a mockery of all of God's laws and the key biblical figures. Kikes follow their own pantheistic deity they call Ein Sof, but in reality kikes worship themselves as gods among mere mortals since they believe they can best channel this pantheistic Ein Sof. Does that sound like acceptable behavior towards Yahweh our Father? Does this sound like something biblical? Better if you don't answer that since you neither understand the Bible nor seem to have even heard of the Talmud. Either way, kikes openly admit that they follow the ORAL TORAH (Talmud) and that its authority supercedes that of the Old Testament, which in reality they don't regard at all. I know you're not familiar with the Bible or ancient history, but the New Testament goes to great lengths to warn the world of the FAKE JEWS to come, the synagogue of satan, the second beast.

                  <p>
                   Also, Yahweh is the God of this whole world, not just one people, and he most certainly is not the God of kikes. Furthermore, I have no problem worshipping the God of ancient REAL Jews/Judahites. Many among their ranks were great human beings and hold a special place in human history. As for kikes, the fake jews, I don't worship their Ein Sof and I definitely don't worship THEM since kikes ultimately only worship themselves.

                    Israelites were canaanites! El is the original god of Israel.

                    You need to do more research. The Israelites initially worshipped Yahweh alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah and Baal... 
Yahweh is a typical ancient Near Eastern "divine warrior", who leads the heavenly army against Israel's enemies;

                    Like I said, Id rather give my energy to more positive beings than ones that are derived from Egyptian mythology, something rooted closer to my racial soul.

                    EDIT: You dont even have any evidence to back up your proto Christianity bullshit. Just your cognitive dissonance to feel better about worshiping the god of the Jews.  It was JUDAISMThere was not proto Christianity unless youre taking about Christianity after/during Christ leading up to council of nicea which solidified many of the traditions and beliefs of Christianity. You adhere to the Nicean creed dont you...All Christians do, if they arent then they arent christians.

                     Throwing kike garbage at me is not going to work, you realize that, right? I'm well aware of what kikes say about this topic. I'm not surprised that you cling onto disinformation and kike poison for dear life. The Bible makes it very clear that Yahweh was all along the one and only God. Just because some Israelites went pagan doesn't change this fact. Try a new tune.

                    <p>
                     I just told you about the prophesies concerning Christ, didn't I? Is this truly so difficult to understand? What gives? There is the evidence for "proto-Christianity". I have no cognitive dissonance in worshipping Yahweh who was also worshipped by true ancient Jews. But if you are trying to tell me I'm worshipping the god (ein sof -&gt; kikes) of kikes, then you are retarded beyond any description. But you do love kikes, don't you? Your shared hatred of Christianity truly brings you together.

                     What is this your obsession with the Nicean creed? What exactly is it that you want to say? I don't give a damn about some Nicean creed, I only care about what the Bible says.

                         Sure. Abraham descended from Shem through Arphaxad, as did Assur, Elam, Lud and Aram. So Abraham was a Semite in that sense, but he did not speak what is today linguistically called a Semitic language. He probably spoke Hurrian, but learnt the linguistically Semitic Canaanite language as he moved to Canaan, hence the origin of the Hebrew dialect of Canaanite. Note that Elamites did not speak a linguistically Semitic language either, nor did Lud, from whom perhaps the earliest Indo-Europeans, Luwians, descended. Assyrians may not have originally been Semitic speakers either, but may have spoken Hurrian or a language similar to it. Arameans, as far as I know, have historically always been speakers of a linguistically Semitic language.

                    If you think Pagan religous system are evil youre retarded. Catholics adn Christians killed millions of white pagans for no reason. I am areligous.

                    You dont even know the history of what Yahweh is. Youre a fuckin retard if you call proto Christianty a different thing than Judaism. How do you have christianity WITHOUT Christ? YOU DONT. It's JUDAISM.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You keep feeding a war god, Yahweh, who Israelites KILLED for, many millions of people dead, on teh whims of Yahweh a war god. Thats what it is.

                   <p>
                    I know all about the talmud, ok? Its not really relevant in this conversation because you seem to think Christians existed before/with Jews. Judaism is Judaism is Judaism, there was never a split ideologically  or otherwise until Christ came along, unless you can prove it which you cant!
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I dont know why you think following a religion that does not come from your people is a good idea. If you arent semitic, dont follow a semitic religion its not good, that simple. You keep cucking for Christ and accept all those non whites into your living space because youre a good goy.

                     Pagan religions are first and foremost retarded because they are built on lies. But sure, you could call them evil too as they remove us from our Creator. Catholics did some bad things, sure, but then again, they're not Christians. I condemn their crimes. However, this pagan meme about "muh millions of white pagans", that's a myth, and I'm pretty sure that if you look into the background of this myth, you'll find an antichrist kike pulling the strings. Don't get fooled.

                     I just told you how proto-Christianity (the religion of the ancient Israelites) is different from kike judaism. What exactly is so hard to understand? I can't type it any slower, you know. The religion of the Israelites is PROTO-Christianity because various ancient Israelites prophesied the coming of Christ, for example king David in the 1000s BC, a thousand years before Christ came in flesh. Got it?

                     What is this "war god" stuff? Is that what your kike professor has told you? You soak up everything but common sense, it would seem. Israelites obviously did not kill millions of people, wtf. Yahweh however did and will do again in the future (end times). Yahweh created humanity, he gets to destroy it if he wants to. Humans must physically die if they were born in the first place. What, are you going to cry about that too? However, we each have a chance to prove ourselves worthy before God and preserve our souls after the physical body fails.

                    <p>
                     You clearly know nothing about the Talmud, compiled around 200-500 AD. So if talmudic judaism has its roots in the first century BC, then what to you was the religion of the ancient Israelites? If you say it was something parallel to talmudic "judaism", you've already lost the game and prove that you know nothing about the Bible nor the Talmud. If you think the two are equivalent, you truly are retarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There were plenty of splits from proto-Christianity into false religions throughout the ages. Pharisaism, that is, proto-talmudic judaism, was one of these. Pharisaism is interesting, however, in that I believe it was brought on by Edomites who were not Israelites to begin with, but were assimilated into Judea in the 2nd century BC. So kikes have been mongrels from the beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I follow a religion that comes from my heavenly Father. Unlike you, I'm not a materialist who clings to the false religions of my deceived ancestors just because they were my ancestors. In the beginning and in the end we belong to our Father only. My Father created me and my ancestors stretching back thousand of years. Unfortunately they went astray and forgot about their Creator. I'm not going to make their mistake. What is a "Semitic religion", anyway? Not that I have anything against the Semitic language family or collectively its speakers. Most "Semitic religions" were polytheistic false religions like those in Europe. Christianity is unique, and also, "founded" by Abraham who was not originally even a Semitic-speaker. Anyway, work on your issues with materialism and don't get so hung up on linguistics.

                     Why would I accept hostile pagan non-whites into my living space? I certainly don't nor am I good "goy". Goy usually means pagan, I'm not a pagan, people like you and kikes are.

                      You have no historical documentation to prove Judaism is proto christianity. You arent using words correctly. Semitic religion=desert religion, exactly what Judaism is. Do you not remember in the bible when yahweh told the Israelites to wipe out entire races of people? All to appease him? Dude, youre so full of your own shit. I would respect you if you could ackowledge these wellf ounded historical truths, but you keep throwing around proto christianity like it means anything in this context.

                       What historical documentation is needed to prove that the religion of the ancient Israelites, dating to a time before there was even a tribe called Judah, was proto-Christian? I already told you  about the prophesies regarding Christ, written down over a thousand years before Christ. When are you going to address this? Stop squirming like a slippery kike and address my question.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Yeah, Yahweh told the Israelites to wipe out several populations. Good riddance. Yahweh created humanity, if he tells you to destroy one wicked, child-sacrificing segment of it, you better do as he commands. What are you, a retard? But of course you can't fathom such a thing because you're an atheist, on the level of an animal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Exactly what "historical truths" am I not acknowledging? You're like a kike, as soon as I answer something, you jump into something else. Half of the time I don't even know what you want me to answer. You're all over the place. You're a mess. Get a grip.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I know what "goy" means, it means "people/foreign people/pagan" - usually means foreigner with a pagan connotation. Kikes are not Israelites and they most certainly are PAGANS, like yourself, so yes, they are goyim.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I don't love my true enemies, you are an antichrist and I certainly don't love you. If you were more cultured, you would understand what Christ means in that passage. The Greek word used in that passage indicates a familiar "enemy," an enemy of little significance, say, an estranged friend, or a neighbor you have a dispute with. It does not include truly wicked people. Stop parroting kike lies. I respect true Christians whatever their race, but that doesn't mean that different races should share a multicultural society nor that different races should interbreed. God created different races, nations and boundaries for a reason. Don't be stupid.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Christianity is the true faith of all humanity, including the white race who are known to be its foremost practitioners. Or they were until kikes came and destroyed Christianity in the West. But you're sure happy about that, aren't you? You sure love your kikes, don't you? Together destroying Christianity together. You are filth. And then you end your miserable post by putting words in my mouth like the spiritual kike you are. I just told you I don't want non-white refugees in my country yet you still push your lies. You know what, I'm starting to think that you might actually be a bonafide kike. You lie with such ease.

                        Look at my post history faggot I am certainly not a kike. You are a paranoid christ cuck, who cant provide any historical documentation for this proto-christianity theory and how it was DISTINCTLY different from Judaism at the time. It wasnt!
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I cant fathom how the pantheon of Israelite gods and mythology have anything to do with Christianity. I am also confused how you talk about proto-christianity and that would be Old Testament, but you contradict yourself saying that with Jesus all of that is irrelevant ?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I am just trying to discern how proto-christianity and Judaism were two different things at the time, when there isnt any evidence to back that up.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You seem to think that Israelites were into the trinity and worshiped it. That is completely wrong because they only worshiped ONE God. The concept of the Trinity is something that come FROM Christ, starting Christianity. This is one of teh biggest differences in religious dogma and doctrine.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        n Judaism, God is understood to be the absolute one, indivisible, and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence.
The worship of multiple gods (polytheism) and the concept of God having multiple persons (as in the doctrine of Trinity) are equally unimaginable in Judaism. The idea of God as a duality or trinity is heretical in Judaism – it is considered akin to polytheism.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        God, the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of series, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity. (Maimonides, 13 Principles of Faith, Second Principle)
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I dont know where you have the historical documentation to show that proto Christianity was a thing, because without teh Trinity aspect, there is no DISCERNIBLE difference in JUDAISM and "Christianity" before the time of Christ!
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The earliest records of Christianity, teachings of Christ, come from mid first century after Christs death....I dont know how you have teachings of Christ BEFORE Christ ever came into our Earth... You dont have any evidence to back up your proto-christianity.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Just because they prophesied about Christ, doesnt make Judaism proto christianity because they certainly werent phophesizing the advent of a NEW religion( Christianity). Christianity is an offshoot of Judaism with the teachings of Christ and concept of the Trinity. The trinity which was never a thing until Christ came about.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So like I said, come up with some good evidence besides your fee fees and your ad hominems. If I was a kike, I wouldnt be lampooning and making fun of the Alt Kike! spencergate.wordpress.com

                        Goy means non-jew, simple as that. Also Yahweh was part of the canaanite pantheon which included multiple gods. Before it was called yahweh it was called EL or El Shaddai, a canaanite god, sharing the god-sphere with baal and the rest of them. This is very clearly laid out in the bible that the israelites were polytheistic until 6th century BC after babylonian exile, which is when other gods were denied and Yahweh was seen as THE creator, incorporating all the other positive aspects of the gods and goddesses in the pantheon.

                        You need to do some more reading. Dont bother replying if you dont have any evidence to disprove what I have said or back up your foolish hypothesis of proto-christianity...Youre just embarrassing yourself at this point

                         I sure hope you actually are a kike because you are kiked beyond any redemption. It is a massive shame to be spiritually so akin to a kike without even being one. Enjoy your days, antichrist. Christianity was a direct descendant of the true faith of the Israelites while it was pharisaism, aka rabbinic talmudic judaism, that was a heretical sect that splintered off from proto-Christianity. But of course you will go with the kike narrative, I wonder why... You claim to know the talmud while claiming that it is a descendant of the OT. Either you are too ashamed to admit that you know neither, or one of the other, or you lie brazenly like a kike. The talmud is the diametric opposite of everything found in the OT, but you will perpetuate the lie because, I wonder why?

                         "You need to do some reading". Sorry, but I'm not interested in what the kike academia has to say about anything. Your little theories about the Israelite religion all go back to kike intellectuals. It genuinely boggles the mind how infused with kike poison you are. I bet it's already coming out of your ears.

                          Wow you are so dumb, you just ask me questions but dont have anything of substance to back it up. Truly unremarkable. Go talk to a rabbi or a priest about the concept of the trinity and how that would fly in Israelites in the OT.

                          Elohim are the collective gods that were synthetsized into Yahweh you fucking moron. There is no ALLEGED pantheon of Israelite gods, it is very well documented.
                         </p>

                          You seriously have no idea what you are talking about because you cant even provide anything else than your own opinions and failed hypothesis! I actually linked textual sources that are backed up, granted they were through wikipedia, but the footnotes referenced are correct...

                           Why would I go talk to a filthy rabbi kike when they don't even follow the Old Testament? What would a filthy rabbi scam artist know about the OT when all they read is the Talmud, Zohar and other assorted pagan garbage. You are a disgrace to end up so badly hoodwinked by kikes. You keep alluding to the idea that kikes would follow the religion of the OT, but I think even you know full well that this is a lie. So why perpetuate the lie? If you have evidence of their following the same religion, then please provide your evidence. The kikes readily admit themselves that the Talmud nullifies the OT completely. Most priests are poor Christians themselves and usually extremely ignorant about their alleged faith. I don't subscribe to these scam artist authorities.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           No, fool, Elohim is not the collective gods. If you had ever read the OT (which you clearly have not, or at least you understood NOTHING), the Israelites fanatically call upon Yahweh as ONE SINGULAR GOD. Do you really think they would retain the plural form throughout the OT, a work of some thousand years, if it actually indicated polytheism? Do you not understand the inherit problem in your retarded logic? But of course, as it has been established before, you are an MATERIALIST ATHEIST. You do not believe in a higher power so you read the word "elohim" literally as meaning multiple gods without catching the true significance beyond the merely literal, "material" word. The word elohim is always treated as a singular throughout the OT. You parrot every new piece of shit hypothesis that dribbles down from kike academia. But you will buy it and do your best to use it against your own Father because you are an antichrist reprobate mind, on par with kikes. Anything you can use against God you will use.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           What textual sources besides kike academic nonsense? What is "well documented"? I have read all those hypotheses. They are arbitrary attempts for this or that philologist or theologian to justify their failed careers. Here's an example of their pathetic thought process: people in the Kingdom of Israel (Samaria) committed apostasy and went pagan, as the OT itself repeatedly records(!), ergo once upon a time, until c. 500 BC or so, all Israelites were polytheists pagans, yay! Does this sound like sound reasoning? Does this sound like something that should actually come out of an adult's mind? These people have nothing to offer so they just try to tear everything down without any use of actual evidence whatsoever. They are not proof of anything. But you will buy it because you hate God. Also, I'll have you know that "biblical criticism" was started by KIKES in the first place. Strange of these people who supposedly follow the OT, hmm? Not strange at all since it is not their holy book, but that of Christians, whom they hate as much as God.

                           I couldn't care less about what school you went to. Clearly you learnt nothing to discard your Father like some filthy rag. And why? Because you were too weak to resist kike mind poison.

                             Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

                 No, I had no clue.  Gimme a break.  Yes I understand what it means.  And I am saying you can try and tack it to Semitic religions, but it is ALL religions.  Islam is by far and above the absolute worst both in rates of incidence and quantity.

                  Percapita not so, its probably worse among Judaism because there are less of them. Of course Islam is more destructive because there are more of them.

                  Lots and lots of scholarly articles.  Not so much with other religions.  Just sayin'....don't ignore the pedohadji in the room  Unless you are a defender of Islam.

            As the law currently stands, clergy are not legally obliged to report crimes to the police and disciplinary proceedings for criminal activity by members of the Catholic Church are handled internally by Canon law, which operates independently of the regular legal procedure.  THIS Needs To Change.  NOW.  Was he ever protected by Pell?  He sounds pretty confident.

              YES and the Canon Law needs to Be Abolished.  Many priests hide behind it.  Here is something very worth reading about Canon Law  and was very Shocking to me.  Secret Marriages

              What is meant by a Secret Marriage and who is allowed to take part in one.  Why is it so hidden away as well.  Secret Marriages between Whom?

               Is this the right link? Secret marriages was something I’m looking into as well alongside the SRA survivor tale from the under tunnels; unbelievable

                So Sorry.  This is the correct link.  I think last year I discovered that the church married gay priests centuries ago.  I wonder if that would fall under this Canon Law and that the marriage documents were kept in the Curia.  I am also very interested but have not been able to find anything on the internet as of yet.  I am sure they have scrubbed a lot.  Please ping me on anything you find.  Want to get to the bottom of this.  Thanks so much for your interest.
