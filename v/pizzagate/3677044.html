Springora  was groomed by  83-year-old prizewinning novelist, essayist and predator, Gabriel Matzneff. Springora met Matzneff at a dinner with her mother when she was 13 and he was 50. Matzneff then pursued her and, at one point, moved into a hotel with her to avoid the police.</p>
<p>Matzneff talked openly about his \'relationships\' with children and teenagers on tv shows and in novels and diaries. He talked about his visits to the Philippines for sex tourism. In 1977, Matzneff signed an open letter calling for three men on remand accused of raping boys aged 13 and 14 to be let off. Others who signed included famous writers and intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.</p>
<p>Anneke Lucas, an adult survivor of elite sexual abuse writes on her fb page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new French book “Consent” by Vanessa Springora has finally thrown the ugly conversation about overt pedophilia among the Western European elite on the table for all. The perpetrator in the book is a famed French writer who was celebrated and able to openly speak and write about sex with young children and teens. He has likened persecution of pedophiles to the persecution of the Jews in the 2nd World War. This is the environment and culture in which my abuse took place. Finally, there is a change happening in a country that still does not have statutory rape laws, that legally considers children 6 and under to be too young to consent. Thank you Vanessa Springora for your courage.</p>

            The French are obsessed with middle aged men having sexual relationships with teenage girls. So many movies have it as a main theme.

            He did write about life in the Philippines, where he regularly had sex with as many as four boys at a time in his bed, ages 6 - 14....

            <p>
             His family raised him in a refined cultural environment, rubbing shoulders with such famous French figures as Léon Chestov and Nicolas Berdiaev. It is here he discovered literature and religion. Matzneff spent a year attending the Gerson private Catholic school (1943–1944), two in Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague (1944–1946), then moved to a school in Tannenberg from between 1946 and 1952, and from 1952 attended Lycée Carnot. In 1954 he commenced his studies on classical letters and philosophy at the College of Sorbonne. After completed his military service in Algeria from between 1959 and 1960, Matzneff returned to Paris in 1961, enrolled in Russian at the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales and began a career as a journalist.[3].
            </p>
            <p>
             He met Henry de Montherlant in June 1957 and remained his friend, in spite of quarrels, until his suicide on September 21, 1972. On the nights of March 21st and 22, 1973, Matzneff dispersed the ashes of Montherlant with the 'executor of the latter, Jean-Claude Barat, on the Roman Forum and in the Tiber'.[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             He began to keep his diary on August 1, 1953 but did not publish it until 1976. In the first volume, he drew himself the face of a "réfractaire" – an individual opposed to modern customs. He wrote at the time that "I was Athos, the great misanthrope lord, secret, different...".[5]

            Not sure how relevant this post is to Pizzagate. In France it’s widely understood that the media attention to the Matzneff case is a diversion. Matzneff seduced 14 -15 year old girls then bragged about in his books. There’s no Statutory rape under French law, so the creep got away with it until one of his victims came out with a book. Disgusting and immoral as it is, Matzneff’s case is a very far away from the organized satanist practices and the despicable horrors of Pizzagate. The perve  Matzneff acted always alone and never hid what he was up to. French society tolerated and even rewarded his vice. Organized pedos are something entirely different. They act in secret and as a network. They are part of a system. They are the system. Matzneff is finishing his miserable existence in a small Parisian studio, broke, sick, remorseful and alone. Perhaps deservedly so. In the meanwhile, France as most EU countries is run by an evil worshipping, children trafficking and babies raping pedo elite. No books about those are ever allowed.

             I do think it's relevant to Pizzagate, because we don't know all the circles he traveled in, or if he corresponded with global pedo culture of PIE and PAL (maybe even authored stories under a pseudonym) or other networks/clubs/societies, with members lists that went missing.
            </p>
            <p>
             And from what he's admitted to, chances are there's plenty he hasn't.  Or things, that even if he didn't do, he knows those who did, so of course they wouldn't mind his public capitalization on his pederasty memoirs, because the number of those who like even younger than that were part of the culture/activism of pedophilia that increasingly saturates history the longer and closer we examine at it.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              PARIS (AFP) — French writer Gabriel Matzneff said in an interview Wednesday that he “regrets” his trips to Asia to have sex with children, claiming that at the time “no one ever said it was a crime”.
             </p>
             <p>
              He told French television in the 1990s that “a very young girl is rather sweeter, even if she becomes very quickly hysterical and just as crazy as she will be when she is older.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “An adult should turn their head away and resist the temptation. Naturally, if I did something that was not good I regret it.
             </p>
             <p>
              “You are there a traveler, and young boys and girls were trying to pull you in the street and jump on you under the benevolent eye of the police.”
             </p>
             <p>
              “At the time,” Matzneff added, “people talked of inciting a minor to debauchery, or indecent assault… But nobody ever spoke of crime.”

              Point taken. But compare with the case of Frédéric Mitterrand, nephew of France's late president François Mitterand. Frédéric Mitterrand admitted in his autobiography that he travelled to Thailand in order to have sex with boys as young as 11. He also publicly joked on national French TV that "sex with anyone over 14 is disgusting". Despite some mild and quickly muffled criticism in the media, the pedo Mitterand remained a prominent public figure and even became French Minister of culture in the Sarkozy's government.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or the curious affair of another former minister of culture, Jack Langue, who was caught in an orgy with young boys by the Moroccan police. Langue was extradited and given a sinecure government job. Or the case of another chosenite the Franco-German green party lieder Daniel Cohn-Bendit who once raved (on national TV, no less) about the joys being undressed by a 5-year old girl. The list goes on and on. Elite pedos in France are protected as a rule. Every once in a while the masses are thrown a bone (pun not intended) such as this poor looser and girls rapist Matzneff. A sacral victim, whose function is to distract and channel public outrage. It's understood that the scapegoat should be 1) goy 2) not gay.

               It is true, the elite big fish are protected under after they are dead, then it's almost bragging rights when the public finally finds out all they got away with.

            This doesn’t shock me at all. Artists of all sorts have always been protected in France. Their disgusting pedophelia  has been swept under the rug for ages. This is the country harboring Roman P for decades. Idk if this ogre will be arrested but I don’t hold out much hope. I will say it again. The PM Macron was pursued by his teacher who asked his parents if they could be married at 16. Thankfully the made them wait til he was 18. She is his present wife. So here we have  a PM who is married to a pedophile. My heart ❤️ goes out to the author. She seeks nothing but is  letting her country know it is time to call out and punish these
