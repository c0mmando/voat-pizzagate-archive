            Jasun has written in more depth about his brother here:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I am one of two people still living (along with my sister, a psychotherapist) with close inside knowledge of the forces that drove my brother to self-destruct. As such, one thing is painfully clear to me: whatever “message” my brother conveyed, via his life and death, it is not a true message but a fiction: a cover story that covers a legion of sins. Ironically, it covers them not with an illusion of virtue, as in the much more famous case of Jimmy Savile, but with a dandy’s parade of glamorized vice. It’s my belief that Sebastian Horsley’s “art” was not self-destruction but the elaborate concealment of the social, cultural, and domestic forces that made his destruction inevitable. I think it shows how the abused is programmed by abuse, not only to protect his abusers, but to perpetuate the abuse.

            lol that part about woman is rather violent. Sure I consider if I'd fuck them but it seems like he kind of think they're objects. Im happy I can't say I'd actually mess with or sew 2 human beings to make it more pleasureable for my fucking and then not even give them a life. Maybe it's not misogynistic if he thinks woman can think the same about men? That's quite a bold claim for him to make

            How very, very sad. It has been some years that i've come to suspect  those very upper echelons are filled with miseries greater than the rest of us. The brother's use for women is just tragic and seems to allude to the mind control tactics/" pizzagate art" that is used with child slaves. Knowledge of good &amp; evil. Our knowledge of evil has been exponentially increased in the last year. He questions the redeemability of the pizzagate survivors.  That's def not something we have had time to consider. Even his own knowledge by association seems to have scared him into not allowing his imagination to fly. So that, the initiated are, in a way, victims.  A vicious cycle that is snowballing through our societies. We are precious that remain untainted. God help us all.

             That's not quite what I got.  I think he was laying out all possibilities, which is good mental exercise and wise to do from time to time.  It helps us to know -- not just feel -- that we are on the right track.

            <p>
             I don't think he was claiming anything, ultimately.

             Is that what's going on.  I have excessively strong dyslexia, and quite honestly bored while reading.  The author isn't making arguments or interpretations.  Honestly, did not pull anything meaningful out of this.  (Numbers, Code, Math, and Economics is more my game, not linguistic analysis.)

            We are all brainwashed to a degree by the media we ingest.  It's important to break down one's internal biases while actually doing the homework.  If something makes you uncomfortable, ask yourself why.  Ask yourself if you could possibly be wrong.  Find media outlets that you trust, but be wary of confirmation bias.  Nobody is right about everything.  And what people DON'T say is often as important as what they do.
