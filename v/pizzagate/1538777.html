            GoPluck was a MOD on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
             /V/Pizzagate
            </a>
            , he made a comment that investigators should be investigating Y-Combinator for it leads to the Peter Thiel ownership of VOAT and the Pedophilia racket of Bohemia Grove going back to the 1960's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today Peter Thiel is the USA representative of Bilderberg USA Chapter. Thiel's job is to feed MENSA material children to Bohemia Grove, and Y-Combinator is the vehicle.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Mod was Yanked for going "Rogue" by
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/KevDude">
             @KevDude
            </a>
            , all that GoPluck did was mention "Y-Combinator" and they executed him.

            According to how it was explained to me (I did not verify as I don't really care) there was an amalek attack or some crap going on across the site regarding Jews and Thiel or some bs like that.
The whole point of my post was to illustrate the relation between reddit and voat and the company that funded both of them. (still no verification of whether or not the funding to voat was a grant)
That was it. I will be coming back to a mod position over at
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            here soon most likely. I am as far as I'm aware amicable with all of the mods as of now. I just took the opportunity of not being a mod for a minute to go take care of some IRL stuff I needed to.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kevdude">
             /u/kevdude
            </a>
            basically reoffered me the mod position back immediately and I told him not to remod me for now.
edit: also get this shit out of pizzagate if you want to connect the stuff that I posted to this then do so. properly cite it and shit otherwise this is a meta post which belongs in

            Why is this topic banned? Then? It seems that owner ship of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            is relevant to the investigation? It seems that given the same person that funded Voat&amp;Reddit, being the same person who owns DynCorp &amp; Palantir is relevant?

            Yep, with zero traffic, a real 'free speech' zone right on voat, sort of like beating your dick in the wilderness, nobody around to lick up your cum
