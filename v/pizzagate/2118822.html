<p><strong>Here are some interesting facts from the Chapter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The killings did not all fit one pattern as the public was led to believe. Many victims who did not fit pattern were left off list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all of the victims were kids.  Many were adults</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Killings of blacks continued after capture of Wayne Williams, who was eventually convicted of the murders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorities failed to follow substantial leads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A suspiciously weird phone call made about taking a kidnapped kid across state lines made it a federal case and brought in the FBI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vice President Bush visisted Atlanta to show his \'support\' for the residents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locals took note that unidentified white volunteers showed up for the searches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye witnesses saw one of kids sodomized and  beaten to death by a known  laundromat owner who was wearing ceremonial robe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witnesses say that known pedophiles were involved  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local authorities did not want to charge Wayne Williams , but FBI pegged him as guilty before any evidence surfaced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The was no strong evidence to show that Williams committed  any of the murders, but he was probably involved in a pedophile ring and made an easy  patsy </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witness Shirley McGill said her it was a cult  involved in drug trafficking, child pornography, and Satanism; and it was composed of members in both Georgia and Florida. One of the leaders was her part-time lover, Vietnam veteran Parnell Traham.  Police were involved in cover-up</p>

<p><strong>McGowan believes that stirring racial tensions may have been one goal for the murders.  However, he  believes a more sinister theory

             Seeing that Traham was a Vietnam veteran made me think of the Phoenix Program, the CIA's assassination and psychological warfare program in Vietnam which many researchers (like Mae Brussell and Dave McGowan) have connected to the phenomenon of serial killers in the US.

               . Mae Brussell, in light of the SLA/Patty Hearst case and other mass killings meant to terrorize the public, made the observation that:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                What we are now experiencing is the importation of the dreaded ‘Operation Phoenix’ program into the United States…Through various created and manipulated acts of violence, the only ‘solution’ to ‘chaos, anarchy, and senseless violent acts’ will be a police state…We can expect the planned terrorization of the U.S. population to escalate rapidly

                Programmed to Kill
               </em>
               outlines many Phoenix Program connections to serial killers, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, an Army intelligence officer who affiliated with the Church of Satan and later started the Temple of Set, worked in psy-ops division in Vietnam, and thus most likely was part of Phoenix
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 A major rash of serial killings in Northern California (Herb Mullin, the Zodiac, Richard Chase, etc.) occurred in 1967-73, corresponding with the years the Phoenix Program was in operation
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Donald DeFreeze, the leader of the Symbionese Liberation Army, was held in Vacaville Prison and was most likely part of an MKUltra experiment involving Colston Westbrook, a Phoenix operative
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Richard Ramirez's older cousin Mike served in Vietnam as a Phoenix operative, bringing back a collection of human heads and Polaroid photos depicting his massacre of the Vietnamese people. Mike shared these souvenirs with Richard Ramirez, while telling him stories about his exploits in Vietnam.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Arthur Shawcross, another famous serial killer, was almost certainly part of the Phoenix Program as well when he served in Vietnam
                </p>
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Dave McGowan doesn't mention this in his book, but I also find it interesting that F. Lee Bailey, the famous lawyer who McGowan implicated in framing Albert DeSalvo as the Boston Strangler, defended Ernest Medina when he was put on trial for the My Lai massacre. (On a deep politics wiki that I run, I have a
               <a href="http://cavdef.hopto.org/w/index.php?title=F._Lee_Bailey">
                page on F. Lee Bailey
               </a>
               that documents much of Bailey's spook-friendly career.)

                 Hope you do get a chance to read it. The serial killer phenomenon is connected to so many aspects of deep politics, and I was surprised to see the Phoenix Program coming up again and again as I read McGowan's book. You might also be interested in my wiki that I linked to you, which covers both election fraud and other deep political topics.

                  Two brothers who were journalists -- one happened to run for office at that time
in order to report on the experience --- noticed the coming of the hack-able computers...
and the very odd and unbelievable right wing results they were reporting.
They were very experienced in researching ways to steal votes and rig the machinery.
This is way back as the first computers came out - - 1967.
Large computers landed at MSM 1965.
                  <br/>
                  The continued to research it into the 90's at least -- and their kids
keep the website going -- you can read the book free there.

            One of the overriding reasons for this "false flag" event would very definitely
have been to increase racism and white fears of blacks.

            Certainly racism was an added issue.

            Population control. The only alternative left was to increase the death rate,
no one wanted to pick people out of a crowd and line them up for execution,
neither did they relish the possible consequences of an enraged public upon
discovering that they were being systematically murdered. A very short but
very deadly global war was contemplated. Something else had to be done that
would absolve the decision-makers of guilt, something that could be blamed
upon Mother Nature. The answer, a synthetic biological agent, an agent that
does not naturally exist for which no natural immunity could have been acquired.
The United States population was infected. The vaccine was administered by the
world health organization. Whatever causes AIDS was in the vaccine
I'm the first in line with a sentence on deathrow
Take a look around and feel the wind blow
And to those motherfuckers who decide our fate
Annihilate, come together and kill their hate
Cut their heads off and put 'em on a stake
Stuff their bodies in a barrel and throw 'em in the lake
Let the leaches feast on their own
Motherfucker you're wrong, your on your own
           </p>
           <p>
            We all go to fight for our rights

            Over population is the most serious threat to the whole future of our species.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rip their arms off from limb to limb
Make them regret they thought they would win
Cut their tongues out to stop spreading lies
Their poisonous venom has kept me blind
Open your eyes don't you realize
Come together, it's time we rise
Population Control

             As far as vaccines are concerned -- and in present evidence -- if you want a Mind Control
program then vaccines work to destroy not only our brains but will also break down your
gastrointestinal system and pretty much destroy your body.

            To	translations@ stratfor.com BBC Monitoring Alert - BULGARIA AIDS BENGHAZI “Earlier in the day the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry issued a joint statement of the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and Croatia in which they said they recognized Libya's Interim Transitional National Council (TNC) as a legitimate representative of the Libyan people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi thanked the EU and Bulgaria as its member for averting a possible bloodbath in Benghazi, by launching the air strikes.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We perceive the ties with Bulgaria as friendly," TNC representatives said. The participants in the meeting commented the case of the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian intern who were charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children's Hospital in Benghazi, Libya.
           </p>
           <p>
            The six were sentenced to death twice and eventually released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues. On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian president and they were freed.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the Tuesday meeting the TNC representatives said that new facts are to come up concerning the case, which will show that "it was staged by Gaddafi's [Al-Qadhafi's] regime."”

             In 1997, there was a massive outbreak of HIV in Benghazi’s El-Fatih Children’s hospital. More cases occurred in the years after. In total, 426 children and 18 mothers were infected with the deadly virus. “We buried the 73rd victim last week,” Ramadan al-Faytouri tells RNW. “A little girl named Aisha Zeyyeni. Her mother had died earlier.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Doctor El-Hojouj and five Bulgarian nurses working in the same hospital were accused of deliberately infecting the children. Following a highly politicised trial, a Libyan court sentenced the medics to death in 2004. The death sentence was upheld on appeal but eventually commuted to life imprisonment by the Libyan Supreme Court in 2007. Following the intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy, the then-president of France, the medics were then extradited to Bulgaria and released.

             -Hiv Trial in Libya-
            </p>
            <p>
             In April 2001 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi made a speech at the African summit on HIV/AIDS. He told the conference that the world AIDS epidemic started when "CIA laboratories lost control over the virus which they were testing on black Haitian prisoners"
            </p>
            <p>
             He called the HIV crisis in Benghazi "an odious crime" and questioned who was behind it."Some said it was the CIA. Others said it was the Mossad Israeli intelligence. They carried out an experiment on these children." He went on to say that the trial would be "an international trial, like the Lockerbie trial.
            </p>
            <p>
             The prisoners were sued by several Libyan police officers for slandering them with the allegations of torture. However, on 27 May 2007, the prisoners were acquitted of these charges and the plaintiffs ordered to pay the legal fees.

            <p>
             Revealed the brother of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , Leader of the Libyan Revolution for the Libyan children have been exposed two years ago the city of Benghazi to the worst crime known to humanity when some of the nurses by injecting foreign women these children AIDS viruses during vaccination. Gaddafi said in his speech at the closing session of the work of the summit The African Union for Combating AIDS and Infectious Diseases held in Abuja over the past two days that Libya will put the full file of this crime against the World Health Organization, and the various international organizations concerned but the world knows the size of the plot that Her trauma of the Libyan people, which did not Tschn children.
            </p>
            <p>
             He added that some of Gaddafi is likely to be the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or Israeli intelligence (Mossad) behind this crime, stressing that some of these children , Have been transferred for treatment in Europe, And that the European health departments fully aware of this issue , while handling other children with a number of Libyan clinics .. Gaddafi stressed that this work is characterized by nationality and Inferiority can reveal the ugly face , which introduced the AIDS virus to Africa lassitude forces and the depletion of its funds in attempts to contain it Africa is becoming a consumer market for medicines and medical preparations that treat AIDS, and global monopolies seek to prolong the spread of AIDS for as long as possible so as to double their profits from the sale of drugs and preparations to mitigate the effects.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gaddafi said that international medical circles said more than once it was able to isolate the AIDS virus , which means it has made great strides on the way to control it , pointing out that the medical laboratory can access to a complete cure for this disease , as well as the possibility of reaching a vaccine is protective of it, But the capitalist transformation of large corporations without realizing it in order to profit huge. He pointed out that Gaddafi smallpox , which the World Health Organization announced the disappearance of the world is still a virus to now trapped in the CIA laboratory, and asked Gaddafi , why does not America handed over to the World Health Organization , stressing that the goal is to use it within biological warfare, and said that Libya will give rise to this humanitarian issue in international forums, and that it should adopt the peoples and governments a decisive stance on these issues concerning the fate of peoples.

            The timeline makes no sense for AIDS whatsoever.

           <p>
            Also white men would be more likely to have access to healthcare and thus easier to track their progress than black children in 1980.

            How does this theory even work?  None of the children died of AIDS, how does asphyxiating children test AIDS?

               Agree -- It became clear rather early on that the public wasn't going to run scared of 
AIDS and wasn't going to turn back from supporting civil rights for homosexuals -- in fact,
the AIDS epidemic which seems to have been injected into the homosexual community
purposefully probably created more awareness of the lack of civil rights for homosexuals
and more awareness of their oppression by the heterosexual community.
              </p>
              <p>
               The paranoia and hysteria shown by a few Americans seemed quickly rejected by the public.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't know what the final figures were on the loss of homosexual lives.
              </p>
              <p>
               And trust that the outcome is more positive recently.

               they were testing the transmission of the disease from one person to another.  Many of the kids had syringe marks in the genital area.  They would not be able to explain an isolated group of black kids dying from aids when it was a white MAN'S DISEASE..  They had to be killed before that happened.

                Syringe marks in the genital area? So the guy writing about this lunacy doesn't even know about how AIDS is transmitted.

                The murders predate the CDC even knowing about AIDS.  The murders started in 1979.

                    Did you ever see the CNN Special Documentary on the Murders and Murderer?  I have seen it twice.  I have not seen it for about 5 yrs. and don't have cable anymore.  The person railroaded for the crimes (although he was a pedo as you say) was a perfect choice.  He was super creepy thus making the whole story very believable.  Was CNN already a vehicle for the Alphabet Agencies then?  Maybe.

                  Because there's a well established history of the beginnings of AIDS in the US, a book and an HBO movie have been made about it.  AIDS itself doesn't kill you, other diseases do.  These diseases were not killing people in 1979. By 1981 they were killing people and doctor's were starting to make connections.

                  The first cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were reported in Los Angeles in late 1980 and 1981. And the CDC published it first report on them on June 5 1981.  And since I know what to search for I'm looking at the CDC document right now.   A month later, the NY Times writes an article about an outbreak of a rare cancer,  Kaposi's Sarcoma, in homosexuals.  And they didn't know what was causing it.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Doctors in New York and California have diagnosed among homosexual men 41 cases of a rare and often rapidly fatal form of cancer. Eight of the victims died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The cause of the outbreak is unknown, and there is as yet no evidence of contagion. But the doctors who have made the diagnoses, mostly in New York City and the San Francisco Bay area, are alerting other physicians who treat large numbers of homosexual men to the problem in an effort to help identify more cases and to reduce the delay in offering chemotherapy treatment.
                  </p>

                  One of the early AIDS deaths in NYC was from a disease that mainly affected cats.

                  AIDS wasn't even called AIDS until the middle of 1982.

                   Does  your research say exactly where AIDS started? a)Africa where both eating and having sex with "bush meat" is the norm was the common theory at the time. Spread to Europe &amp; US by airline stewards. b) Intentional attempt to kill of "undesirables" in the US by developing another bio-weapon. c) Strain of known killer of pests destroying crops that mutated when in contact with humans who already were weak and had a bad cut. d) Other theory? There were so many at the time.

                    Aids started in Africa and they now believe the first case goes back to the early 20th century.

                    The first case in the US was a teenager in Missouri in 1969.  At the time they had no idea what killed him so they preserved his blood and test it 20 years later and found he had HIV

                    From reading the book excerpt, and thanks so much for the link, I would come to a somewhat different conclusion. The man eventually arrested for 2 of the adult male murders with questionable evidence, and therefore implied to be responsible for the many other children of varying ages, was a pro photographer and children's music promoter. After his conviction it was proven he photographed &amp; filmed child porn for a Satanic group.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Never charged was the pubic laundry owner. There were multiple witnesses that he violently raped, choked and beat boys on more than one occasion. Later it was believed he participated in some of the murders.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also involved was a KKK member who wanted to start a race war.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The entire police investigation was a sham &amp; very sloppy with plenty of holes. After the 1 conviction clear evidence of child prostitution was admitted by Atlanta's Mayor. After all child and adult victims came from 1 of 4 poverty stricken areas of the city. Many of the victims knew each other, and were friendly with some of the adults who were killed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Many other details in the story offer a strong case for Satanic rituals and snuff films. Victims were reported with crosses cut into their foreheads and stomachs. Sites of animal ritual abuse were later found. One of the leaders of the Satanic pedo circle was claimed to be a Viet Nam vet.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Still several of the suspected killers who were never arrested died a few years later of AIDS. Karma?
