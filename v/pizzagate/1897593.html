            It is always the 'cleaning' that is the most difficult.  Remember

            Most organised crime will have some form of disposal management company in service - garbage trucks, pig farms, cleaners, landscaping, etc.

            In light of the news alleging that the suspects in the Seth Rich case spoke Spanish we
            <em>
             could

            assume they were from Central America.  The type of people who

            I'm starting to get a feeling that both the DNC and SEIU are just as bad as the Cult of Scientology. I'm also getting that they all might be connected with each other. Clearwater for example and how they have the police there to cover up any murders and kidnappings that the cult commits they also have a lot of influence in Hollywood.

              Damm, now I have to start my Clearwater investigation up again. I wrote a report on Scientology for a class four years ago detailing all the crimes and cover ups they've committed. Pretty much the actions by the DNC and SEIU are mirroring that of Scientology.
             </p>
             <p>
              Operation Freak Out: Agents of the cult tried to destroy the author, Paulette Cooper by framing her with bomb threats and tried to litigate book publishers into not publishing her book,
              <em>
               "The Scandal of Scientology"
              </em>
              . This operation was discovered in 1977 when the FBI raided their offices.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet, today even though we have documentaries such as "Going Clear". Letting the public know what they do, there is no current investigation into it or there is, but since time has past by. That might have given them time to have their own higher-ups in several places within the U.S. Government, such as the FBI to prevent any investigation into Scientology.

            LOLOLOL.    Here's an organization I was unaware of before.  Now here's my BS speculation about it......This allows a convenient cover to bring people into the country and put them into sensitive positions. ............

             so it is very possible that they conspire to have the janitors in the SEIU dispose of evidence............There is a possibility that seth rich was not killed by a doctor in the hospital, but by a janitor ......A janitor is a person who can also get away with destroying evidence too. ......I am exploring possible connections between the SEIU and the Muslim brotherhood......This group is dangerous, and i am convinced that they had something to do with not just seth rich's death, but other crimes as well.

            At least since 2007 George Soros has worked closely with SEIU. The WikiLeaks/Podesta email below was sent out by Soros' assistant to Podesta and others. It was the final draft of the agenda for a high level council meeting on how to influence and orchestrate Obama's selection. The email's formatting made it hard to read so I transcribed it into a graphic so you can see clearly who was invited, what their connection is and what the agenda was. The text in blue is my interjections on what I found out by researching the invitees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the graphic of the text of the email showing who works with Soros at the top level, including SEIU members:

            Sorry, didn't realise it was just one link.  Columbus Ohio.  Route map from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Home Office to SEIU via childrens' hospitals and youth services.  German Village at the end.  A German Village got a hammering elsewhere.

            Seth Rich did not get these emails on his own, nor do I believe that voater fraud was the reason Seth sent them to Kim &amp; Wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voter fraud, was well known throughout Bush &amp; Obunghole's terms. Hell, it was used against Ben Carson in Iowa!
           </p>
           <p>
            The freaking elites do not care that everyone knows about voater fraud, human trafficking, pedos, satanic rituals, pay or play, uranium deals, open borders, organ harvesting,  the sex trade, drugs  or Russia! 
Will they deny it all, of course! Will they spend $ to debunk it, yes!  Kill over it, obviously! Yet, not one of this sick freaks has tried to leave, nor are they panicked.
           </p>
           <p>
            As sick and Evil as all the above mentioned is, there has to be something far worse that these fucks are hiding.

              The legal complaints against Wasserman Shultz include fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and breech of fiduciary duty. The class action suit demands reimbursement of USD 228 million raised by the Sanders campaign along with a share of USD 128 million in contributions to the DNC. The heist by the Hillary Victory Fund, involving money transfers from DNC to state campaign offices and 100 percent kickbacks, is a transparent fraud involving grand larceny, punishable with a long prison term. The Sanders campaign has aptly characterized the hustle as “money laundering”.

            Interesting, OP.  Didn't our researchers on VOAT predict something would happen to distract from Seth Rich investigation and news?  Then the Manchester bombimg occurs.   What if Clinton/ Huma/ Podesta/ Creamer/ SEIU /SOROS decided to sic their radical Muslim terrorists to cause more death/ distraction?

             I looked into this. There are no seiu posts in england that i could find, infact they appear to be a north america only outlet.

             I looked into this because of Rotherham. How does such a massive pedo ring stay secret?

            I have a personal story about a member of the SEIU. I was traveling on an airplane. I had the middle seat, a 15 year old girl traveling alone had the window, and a middle aged man had the aisle. The middle aged man seemed excessively interested in the teen. He kept asking her who she was coming to see, where she goes to school, whether she would need a ride, etc. The girl seemed naive and vulnerable. Thankfully I was in between them so he was at least somewhat limited. The man also struck up a conversation with me. When I asked him what he does he was evasive, saying only that he worked for the Union that employs  cafeteria ladies. I recognize that as the SEIU right away and called him on it, ribbing him about some recent news involving attacks by SEIU thugs. He turned his attention back to the teenage girl. At one point thank goodness he got up to go to the restroom. I told the girl this is a bad guy don't trust him don't let him give you a ride. I don't know what happened after we got off the plane but I can definitely say one SEIU member gave me the absolute creeps.

            I totally agree with you. I think they have been doing "clean up" work from Chicago, LA, Houston, DC, etc.  I remember a movie where someone would be killed and a cleaner would come in dressed as a janitor in a uniform and clean the whole thing up. Just as I have said before, they show you everything in the movies what really goes on out there. Excellent post! Upvoat

               Yes. That was an excellent 2007 movie called "Michael Clayton". It was nominated 110 times including best motion picture. Won 1 oscar for best supporting actress and 25 others.

            All unions are money laundering schemes, too.  The unions collect fees.  The fees are donated to political campaigns.  The candidates vote for union friendly laws and give union contracts.   One big money laundering scheme to fund the democrat machine.

            Has anyone figured out who the 3 people are in the picture FBI anon posted after he told us to look into SEIU?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a picture of an overweight man in the middle of 2 women.  The woman may have been overweight as well. I can't remember.  The picture was taken outdoors at some sort of event - maybe a fundraiser??

              So who is that man? I haven't been loyal to one chat place so I'm getting bits and pieces of things.  I hop between voat, Reddit, 4chan, twitter, and a local political blog

             <p>
              Sometimes my hopping leads to me totally missing important things

            Upvote for all 3 of you then. They have to be amazed at the lightning speed at which info is uncovered by an army of citizens thanks in large part to the principle of openness where researchers can feed off of ech others finds and ideas . This is in stark contrast to the bureaucratic compartmentalization  of data that occurs within our government  and/ or the hoarding of info and refusal to share. The AFL-CIO became so corrupt and violent during the 1960's  and 1970s that it imploded and weakened the entire labor movement. Why should the SEIU behave any differently, and I'm a pro labor kind of person. So depressing.

            Interesting...It's just so wild to be seeing so many layers of this rotting evil onion peeled away and so many parts of our society are cancerous and parasitical. Great research. I hope you find more connections and information on this.

             I suspect that what we are seeing is a "vinn diagram of evil"
            </p>
            <p>
             That multiple evil circles have converged at one point, and that point is the political establishment.
            </p>
            <p>
             However it is a a system, and systems are hard to keep secret, and the bigger the system, the more flaws it will have. I suspect that the SEIU is the missing piece of this puzzle, and because the are such a large organization we will find something.

            Yes God bless us all, for there is an Army that will never give up, we will dig until we hit pay dirt and down to Hell to root Lucifer out.  Once and for all.  We must be very careful though, to not be distracted by misinformation.  I will be open to info, but not from those that wish to deter us and onto the wrong path.  Then we will also be labeled the CTs they say we are.

            I second the kudos for giving the BLUF in a coherent matter.  I wonder what type of "whoopass" SEIU could muster.
           </p>
           <p>
            As OP alluded, think of a known contract killer in the US.  They could bring him right through immigration and land him a nice job as a "cleaner" with SEIU.  Hmmm...wonder if "a cleaner" has it's origins in janitorial services?

             There's probably different levels to it. You could employ a "janitor" for the small stuff but you would probably want someone with a background in forensics for a complicated  job.

              You'd probably want someone experienced in professional killing for a complicated job.  How they botched the hit on SR is strange.  It makes me think (as others have alluded), that it may have been someone he was possibly even walking with, or at least someone he recognized on the street.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I were to plan a hit like that, I don't think I would waste the time with the whole hospital backup plan, VIP room, cleaner, etc.  I'd make sure he was dead the first time.  That's what a contract killer does.  Winging someone with two shots is not the hallmark of a professional hitman.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which leads me to speculate....what if this was someone close to Rich, who was highly indebted to the "DNC"?  The blackmail subject freaked, wasn't competent with a firearm or close quarters combat.  A pajamapedo screws the hit up (beta male, never fired a gun, only been punched in the face).  His "handlers" build a plan to have MPD respond to keep things under control until he can be "stabilized" at the local ER (Medstar).  They call in the backup plan and Rich doesn't survive the trip to the hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which leads me to this last thought - does anyone have time to review homicides in the DMV in the weeks following the SR hit?  I'm wondering if there may have been a suspicious death in the weeks following for the SNAFU hit.  That could be the link that cracks it open.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just another theory...

            I have been constantly down voated all week.  This started when I spoke in defense of the Rich family and Seth.  Then it picked up again when I worked day and night and mentioned things about the union and Podesta and that Seth might have been a victim of organ harvesting.  Also, when I commented that JP had the power to find out which FBI vehicle may have had weapons in the car, thus being able to inform for them to be stolen. They are here and if you are down voated it is more than likely from them, so  that means we are hitting a nerve.  Keep it up. They want to kill this investigation.

             There is not much shill activity today, which tells me that their offices are closed for memorial day.
