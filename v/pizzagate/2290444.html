<p>Q drop 12/13/17:</p>
<p>“Documents from the Obama administration have been transferred to the Barack Obama Presidential Library. You may send your request to the Obama Library. However, you should be aware that under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office.” RAIDED by the GOOD GUYS (per POTUS). Shockingly quiet. No leaks? Presidential libraries are put in place to retain control over self-incriminating c-doc releases. Scam! Review the law. What is different re: Hussein’s PL? Who controls? These people really are stupid. Q</p>
<p>Then this article, which I think someone on Voat discovered when article was published in Oct: <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama-presidential-library-scholars-academics-children/2017/10/10/id/818858/">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama-presidential-library-scholars-academics-children/2017/10/10/id/818858/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Once completed, the library will include a play garden for children, outdoor picnic space, basketball courts and a recording studio. It won\'t have all of the former president\'s documents, letters, and gifts he collected while in office, unlike most presidential libraries, which typically house the early drafts of speeches, legislation and correspondence that researchers and students can sift through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the lack of personal materials, the library could still hold value for historians and researchers, according to the former head of construction and development for former President Bill Clinton\'s presidential library. Here\'s how it will be attractive: through the forums, workshops and programs they conduct,&quot; said James Rutherford, now dean of the William J. Clinton School of Public Service, to the Tribune. &quot;They can host conferences with administration officials, discussions on how Obama approached healthcare, how he developed the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order. That\'s how the center will become a research institution.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Apparently this library won\'t house the usual records, it won\'t be under normal scrutiny or oversight, and according to the article title will be the &quot;Obama Library More for Children Than a Place for Scholars.&quot;!?!? What is this...are (((they))) serious?!?!</p>',
