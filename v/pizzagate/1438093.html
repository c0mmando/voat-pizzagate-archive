<p>I think there might be some truth to his claim. It all fits too well into the Problem-Reaction-Solution pattern they feed us with their everyday lies and PsyOps only to take more of our liberties away. What\'s really odd is the following (and read to the very end please!):</p>
<p>Search for James Alefantis in Google image search and set the date way before the PizzaGate scandal, let\'s say 2012. Try some different dates as well. You\'ll notice that there\'re just a handful of pictures of him mostly on the domain washingtonlife.smugmag.com. Most pictures seem pretty recent (not older than 2-4 years) and Google just pushed them into my face although they are not matching my time frame search criterion. There\'re pics of him on some other domains but none of these are well-known to the public. Anyone heard about georgetowner.com, darrellsees.com or bighomo.wordpress.com, newyorksocialdiary.com etc? It\'s odd that his online past is quite short. Does this make any sense?</p>
<p>So, if he\'s the 49th most influential person in Washington (according only to GQ Magazine online) why isn\'t he on many more celebrity newspapers and magazines domains like TMZ, OK!, People, PerezHilton, Vanity Fair and so on? We were told &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot; is a very trendy location and a hip place to be. Where are all the hipster pics of him then? Additionally, you don\'t become an influential person or celeb over night. It takes years if not decades to build such a reputation. And you can\'t build such a reputation without being visible to the public. Where is the history of that work? Here we have just some strange domains and Wordpress blogs and some other sites that nobody really knows or reads. An intelligence setup? </p>
<p>I also think it\'s really possible that &quot;James Alefantis&quot; is a fake identity. This should be researched!! The translation of his name into French that reads like &quot;I love children&quot; is just too blatant. Remember &quot;Angel Colon&quot; from the Orlando gay club shooting? It seems like a pattern to me. Luckily for the story, the jimmycomet-Instagram post where someone wears a &quot;J\'aime l\'enfants&quot; T-Shirt intensifies my &quot;could be set on purpose&quot; impression.</p>
<p>Another odd thing is that MSM is jumping on the bandwagon so quickly. The label &quot;Fake News&quot; is just another euphemism for Chinese-style online censorship. Is that what this is all about? Remember how long it took MSM to recognize the vast 9/11 &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and how they didn\'t use it to promote any of their agendas because the claims were actually well grounded. Think about it!</p>
<p>Don\'t get me wrong, I have no doubt about that Washington is full of criminals including pedophiles. And I don\'t say that you should stop researching. On the contrary, we need more of it. But most people just react too emotionally to it. I understand the sensibility of the topic but try not to fall into the emotional trap. This is probably what they want. See it like a criminal investigator would see it. Research the history of all persons involved. Who are they? Where do they come from? Do they have a plausible online or paper trail? Does it still make sense after all? I\'m pretty sure they soon will present us their solution to the problem.</p>
<p>**PS: Does anyone own the print issue of the GQ Magazine where Alefantis was named the 49th most influential person? Just so we can rule out that this wasn\'t only online? **</p>',

            It is odd that all the obvious stuff was just laid out for everyone to see, like they wanted it all to be discovered. However, I think it fits into my topic post and shows us the bigger picture.

            Pizzagate or no pizzagate, there is one undeniable fact: PEDO RUNS DEEP WITH THE ELITE
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile - Prince Charles - Prince Andrew - Epstein...
           </p>
           <p>
            If Pizzagate is a psyop...the FINK tanks really fucked up. They have finally pushed the moral majority to revolt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the Boys Town shit, I have been fucking enraged and I don't hold my tongue when telling people how tge elite love their kiddy fondling.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a parent, I will no longer stand back and let these fuckers flaunt their twisted fucking behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more of us on board, the faster they will fall.
           </p>
           <p>
            All we need is to find one little fucking crack and together we can bring their fucking ivory tower down...
           </p>
           <p>
            Then we roll out the guillotines...they will give each other up real quick
           </p>
           <p>
            Pieces of shit like Mike Rivero from WRH.com says it is a shill op to get us all to accuse the wrong people....COP OUT...
           </p>
           <p>
            When BOTH the queef's sons have been implicated in child porn and with all the proof in the world that the elite is fucked in the head, there is no way we are wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that we must thread with caution and do it properly, as per the law. But WE MUST INVESTIGATE and no one site will do it for us. IF THEY ARE UP &gt; THEY ARE IN ON IT.

              The Franklin scandal was NOT a psy ops. The rumors about the place and the stink could not come off the place since WAY before the documentary.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a kid growing up in the 60s, my parents warned me about boys town and the shenanigans. Would not let me go to the Y either.

              The man associated with the institution had a shady past. The children were brought from state to state...
             </p>
             <p>
              Look at how prince andrew protected and stood behind EPSTEIN...a convicted pedo
             </p>
             <p>
              Savile (the biggest pedo in UK history) was not only a SIR but was the marriage counselor to Diana and Charles!!!!
             </p>

              Rolf Harris was another constant presence at Buckingham palace.

              Russell Williams, the decorated Canadian military pilot...a fucking panty wearing serial killer was the personal pilot of the queef of england and several dignitaries while in Canada...
