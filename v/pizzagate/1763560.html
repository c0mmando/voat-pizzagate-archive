<p>&quot;CHILD SMUGGLING</p>
<p>It had been widely speculated that top officials have been involved in the disappearance of children, but actually there are some facts available. The author had met an officer in the Security Branch who had an informer within the Gert van ROOYEN circle. It is a known fact that Gert van ROOYEN was involved with sanction busting together with Pik BOTHA. Somehow MOSSAD was also involved through Moss ESTAR and Ronald TANUR, both being linked to VAN ROOYEN. Both were kicked out of MOSSAD because of their paedophile activities, taking into further account that one of Pik’s closest friends is Les LEBANON of KADETT INVESTMENTS, who also is a known paedophile. Magnus MALAN has also been confirmed through various sources of being a paedophile. Both Pik and Magnus had been linked to the children that had disappeared for apparently sanction busting activities.</p>
<p>A most worrying factor also are the reports of Satanism in which Paul ECON is involved together with above-mentioned people, and Cyril RAMAPHOSA who is also a confirmed paedophile, and TOERIEN (see Annexure 24). The involvement of the DOMA church where TOERIEN was a minister and Gert van ROOYEN, Jaques JOUBERT and Charles NEWMAN were members, show that this group had no borders when it come to their operations. To use a church as a front is not acceptable. But one of the biggest unanswered questions will be if the CCB brothel in ZURICH was linked to the disappearance of the children. Considering that TOERIEN worked hand in hand with Jurg JACOMED, the spy from Switzerland, who was the target at the CCB brothel. How many other people were contaminated by the brothel of the CCB in ZURICH? </p>
<p>The author would like to express that the paedophile link can be confirmed, but not the Satanism link, although various affidavits in this regard had been made and reported at the TRC.</p>
<p>Also confirmed but not linked to the paedophile ring is that Cyril RAMAPHOSA, Roelf MEYER, Magnus MALAN and various associates are homosexual. Important to note is the EAG link with the people mentioned. The ANC recruited Dr. Tertius DELPORT because of his homosexual activities to gather information from him during CODESA.&quot;</p>',

            I remember the Gert Van Rooyen case very well. Six young girls disappeared and were never seen again. When they caught up with this guy, he shot his partner and his wife before they could be arrested. At least, that's what we were told. I never knew there was a link to the authorities but it does make sense.
