<p>​As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called &quot;Specially Designated Nationals&quot; or &quot;SDNs.&quot; Their assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.</p>
<p>Have done a little digging on list. Needs more research.  What I have done so far:  Sanctions List Search &gt; Select Program GLOMAG.  See Entities and Individuals blocked for Human Right Abuses, and Drug Trafficking.  Have not made to explicit connection the Human Trafficking but sure this activity is tangled up in the record of abuses somewhere.  Please dig through this list.  It may be helpful to click on &quot;Archive of changes to the SDN list&quot; where you can see Additions for Trump presidency years, and correlate year to Executive Order.</p>
