<p>Two-year inquiry accuses Albanian \'mafia-like\' crime network of killing Serb prisoners for their kidneys</p>
<p>Kosovo\'s prime minister is the head of a &quot;mafia-like&quot; Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe, according to a Council of Europe inquiry report on organised crime.</p>
<p>Hashim Thaçi is identified as the boss of a network that began operating criminal rackets in the runup to the 1998-99 Kosovo war, and has held powerful sway over the country\'s government since.</p>
<p>The report of the two-year inquiry, which cites FBI and other intelligence sources, has been obtained by the Guardian. It names Thaçi as having over the last decade exerted &quot;violent control&quot; over the heroin trade. Figures from Thaçi\'s inner circle are also accused of taking captives across the border into Albania after the war, where a number of Serbs are said to have been murdered for their kidneys, which were sold on the black market.</p>
<p>Dick Marty, the human rights investigator behind the inquiry, will present his report to European diplomats from all 47 member states at a meeting in Paris on Thursday. His report suggests Thaçi\'s links with organised crime date back more than a decade, when those loyal to his Drenica group came to dominate the KLA, and seized control of &quot;most of the illicit criminal enterprises&quot; in which Kosovans were involved south of the border, in Albania.  During the Kosovo conflict Slobodan Miloševic\'s troops responded to attacks by the KLA by orchestrating a horrific campaign against ethnic Albanians in the territory. As many as 10,000 are estimated to have died at the hands of Serbian troops.</p>
<p>His inquiry was commissioned after the former chief prosecutor for war crimes at the Hague, Carla Del Ponte, said she had been prevented from investigating senior KLA officials. Her most shocking claim, which she said required further investigation, was that the KLA smuggled captive Serbs across the border into Albania, where their organs were harvested.</p>
<p>The report states: &quot;As and when the transplant surgeons were confirmed to be in position and ready to operate, the captives were brought out of the \'safe house\' individually, summarily executed by a KLA gunman, and their corpses transported swiftly to the operating clinic.\'\'</p>
<p>Kosovo\'s Govt. Response</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that someone wants to place obstacles in the way of prime minister, Hashim Thaçi, after the general election, in which the people of Kosovo placed their clear and significant trust in him to deliver the development programme and governance of our country. &quot;Such despicable and bizarre actions by people with no moral credibility, serve the ends of only those specific circles that do not wish well to Kosovo and its people.&quot;</p>

            Thank you for this very well put together heart wrenching information. How many hearts did David Rockefeller get ? We know this is how they prolong their lives . Our children are their supply ! If they can’t use them for an organ they will use them in some other sick way . We are all just cattle to them , to be used as they wish ..

             YW.  I plan on doing more posts connected with this subject.  We have forgotten about posting the horrid crimes perpetrated on those most vulnerable, Our Children.  It is nasty business writing and reading and posting this stuff, but it is necessary if we are determined to stop it.  We can't wait for others to do it for us, for as we have seen, that is why it has continued.  Yes, we are just cattle to them.  But really, we think much less of them.  For we are animal lovers and they are not.  And most important of all, we have souls, and they do not.

              It is nasty business, but who will do it , if we don’t? Your right ! Now when I talk to people , I speak of PG as common knowledge . If they don’t know about it , they most definitely will google it after I’m done talking about it . I direct everyone to voat pg for more info . I’ve shown people proof of being banned for life on twitter for tweeting about Laura silsby and Haiti . ( this opened alot of eyes )The people who scare me are the ones that just look at you and say nothing . ( it’s like they are pedos) . On another note.. I came across a “ Lions Club “ sponsored parade a few weeks ago when I drove into town . It was a freak show of degenerates . There was drunk perverts everywhere with young children running around. There was a live local band playing some degenerate music ( about sex, drugs , etc ) To me it was disgraceful behavior, but to all of them it was normal . I felt like I was in the twighlight zone . I felt deep sorrow and pity for those people that let themselves succumb to that type of life . The Freemasons sure know who to target IMO. They have their own club and I’m glad I’m not in it . It was like Walmart ( employees and customers) all got together and had a parade ! Just thought I’d share , I wish I had been prepared to investigate that day . 😐 next time , I’m taking video ..

               OOH I would have loved to see that!  Yes, people are so stupid, I just can't believe it anymore.  I was at breakfast with a couple this weekend and happened to strongly call out the pope as a pedo supporter and the woman said, Did you hear that, she called pope francis a pedo.  I immediately said, I called him a supporter, please do not change my statement.  She immediately said that we should not discuss politics or religion.  She then asked if we are going to Church.  I was flabbergasted.  She continues to do what she just said we should not. They then continued to talk about so many things I could have commented on, but I could see my husbands eyes getting Really Big.  It takes all I have to shut up nowadays.  URGGHH!

            Another tentacle of the cabal linked to the Clinton Foundation. Serbia and Albania was in the news a lot for human trafficking over the years.

             We have caused such horror in the world.  I feel responsible being part of this country, but they did it without our knowledge.  They are such masters of evil and deceit.  I knew a Serbian woman in the 90's that told me that a lot of horrible crimes were being committed there. I know our posts are hard to take.  It is the only way, to tell the truth.  I will read your link.  Thank you.

            e destruction of Yugoslavia was a CIA-Globalist operation to further break Europe into smaller states that can be easily controlled by the EU and NATO. 
They were becoming a major economic power and were not playing from “global” rules.

               Bill C started setting this up during his reign.  Perfect Scenario and Storm setting for their dirty crimes on Children.  The ones that have no defense.  And also the dirt poor that have no where to turn to.  These are the worst people on this earth.  The Bottom of the Barrel.  The Scum-Bags.  And he and HRC are pictured with Thaci.  Plain as day.

                 I know.  But who in the world would have thought that humans were capable of such horror against their fellow humans, let alone Children.  I wonder what would happen if all of a sudden people started waking up to this.  I

                 to think.  There would be mayhem.  I am wondering if people would take time from binge watching to even riot.

                  I am not sure WHAT is appropriate. I am angry enough to riot... but I think that is a foolish response. I FOR SURE don’t want to put my kids at risk, so that’s priority 1. 2: we all need to keep exposing and redpilling, which keeps us busy and gives some structure and hope to this. 3 I find it critical to encourage others, because I often need that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But what’s next? Where’s the action? How are we gonna fix this? I sometimes wonder... but then I consider that this is God’s battle first. In a way, He is was the first one here, truthing and waiting for us to catch up. When this thing reaches critical numbers, I think we will see a door open. Something will happen and we will know what to do.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I just keep praying about it and try to be cautiously optimistic.

                  Do you remember the post awhile back from someone whose mom was getting extradited back to Albania after trying to escape a pedo cabal? (Maybe it was Azerbaijan...?) I could be reaching, but maybe there’s a connection.

                   I vaguely remember the post.  I was shocked to find that so many countries are SO deeply involved.  I mean I knew this was horrible, but really.   Yes, I agree I don't want horrid rioting because yes, people will stop at nothing, when they are that rabid.  Children are always the ones to suffer the most.  You know, praying has helped me immensely especially while doing the posts.  I too think something will happen, but WHEN?  All I keep thinking of is those poor children.

                    Rioting has become almost like a fad, and people are getting numb to it. Nowadays people accomplish more by speaking out online or with their purchases and votes, etc. When there is a large enough number, then the number of informed people will start doubling.

                   <p>
                    People are out in the street with signs complaining about Star Wars, trans pronouns, vegan rights and voting rights for illegal immigrants. Not that those are trivial (I was mad that they killed Han Solo, but I don’t see any signs for that), but the act of protesting g in this climate trivializes things. We live in a time of the ignorant woke and paid protesters. I don’t see value in being counted in that group.

                     No I do not join in in protests either.  They seem so organized by the wrong people.  The Antifas and BLM.  They are so fake.   Yes, so far I think most of this has spread through soc. media.  That is why they are after our internet rights.  They know we are Waking People Up.

                       There were only a few that were meaningful.  As you well know, they were starting to promote the fake riots and protests decades ago and we had no clue then either.  I don't think there are that many real protesters now, there are many paid for.  I just read that right now there is 39 % for Dems and 39% for Rep.  A toss up.  That is for White  Millennials.  Dems have lost 14% of that group.  They are going to brush up on their Election Fraud or change their message and tactics.  There has to be a wake up call for them.  But their Greed will continue.

               Thank You. Keep up the Good Works too EK.  The more we spread this the more it will get legs.  Idk if you noticed but in one article it mentioned when people and kids started disappearing, parents and others started protecting their kids and spreading warnings on soc. media.  Yes.  They are wising up while we are Asleep at the Wheel.  This is our chance to cut down on this in a big way.  Cut into their profits.  And it really costs us next to nothing.  Time.

             The Arrowhead Trail or Arrowhead Highway was the first all-weather road in the Western United States that connected Los Angeles, California to Salt Lake City, Utah by way of Las Vegas, Nevada. Built primarily during the auto trails period of the 1910s, prior to the establishment of the U.S. numbered highway system, the road was replaced in 1926 by

            All this talk of underground railways and the Clintons made me think of steel and mining companies which the Clinton Foundation also has interests in.  So I google "underground railroad" with Arrowhead trail.  Niagara Falls kept coming up.  That's on the US/Canada border, of course.

The Memorial shows a railroad “conductor” and nine slaves preparing to take a boat across the Detroit River into Canada, where the slaves would be free. A complementary sculpture on the Canadian side of the river shows a Canadian Underground Railroad representative welcoming a male slave giving thanks and a female slave holding a baby. It also shows a small slave girl looking back toward the American side.

             During its early years, the company produced rails for the rapidly expanding railroads and armor plating for the US Navy.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1883, Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler and Secretary of the Army Robert Todd Lincoln appointed Lt. William Jaques to the Gun Foundry Board. Jaques was sent on several fact-finding tours of European armament makers and on one of these trips he formed business ties with the firm of Joseph Whitworth of Manchester, England. He returned to America as Whitworth's agent and, in 1885, was granted an extended furlough to pursue this personal interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jaques was aware that the U.S. Navy would soon solicit bids for the production of heavy guns and other products such as armor that would be needed to further expand the fleet.

             During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, a structure that was designed to make the world marvel received its giant axle from Bethlehem Iron. The world's first

             needed enough steel to assemble a 140-foot tower to support an all-steel wheel, altogether making a 264-foot (80 m) structure. The iron made in Bethlehem Steel's blast furnaces was responsible for the world's largest single piece of cast iron that had ever been made up to that time.
            </p>
            <p>
             From 1949 to 1952, Bethlehem Steel had a contract with the federal government of the United States to roll uranium fuel rods for nuclear reactors in Bethlehem Steel's Lackawanna, New York, plant. Workers were not aware of the dangers of the heavy metals they were rolling and were not given protective equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company manufactured the steel for many of the country's most prominent landmarks:

Construction began in fall 2007; the casino was completed in 2009. The casino had difficulty finding structural steel for construction due to a global steel shortage and pressure to build Pennsylvania's tax-generating casinos. 16,000 tons of steel were needed to build the $600 million complex.[27]

             I can't believe the Guardian printed this.  Amazing.  I was surprised, but should have known.  Everyone with big money is connected to them.

              The article is from 2010, before the total destruction of British Media. I wonder if that reporter is still alive.

               I have noticed that all the articles to be found are from a few years ago.  For they all were taken over and were given their orders.  Would be interesting to see if he is still around, if he is, I bet he's not discussing this subject.
