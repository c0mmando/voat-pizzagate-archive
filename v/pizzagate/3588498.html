            Don't know if it helps but the now old actress Susan George was possibly used the same way, but back in the 60's. She dated Prince Charles. Another thing, what is with the yachts. I mean my ex was also heavily involved with yachts in the south of France. Apparently, huge expensive yachts are cleared to enter any harbor they choose because the ports look the other way. We though it was maybe a child smuggling ring. My ex provided(maybe still does) crews for these huge yachts, out of Nice, South of France.

           <p>
            It has only been for the past couple of decades that the foreign born behind the scenes player was a madam/child rapist. Prior to that, she was someone who created news. Someone who would come up with what they wanted to have happen and then align the pieces to ensure that result. Let me give you an example. Back in the day, a close family member wanted information on the royal family. Enter our madam/child rapist. She arranged for a friend who would yacht from time to time to meet a royal who is still involved with the madam/child rapist today. That friend slept with the royal every chance she got and passed along everything she heard to the madam/child rapist. It was only when the royal family got wind of what was happening that the friend was sent off.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was around this same time that the madam/child rapist was hooking up with someone who was an heir to a middling fortune. Good looking and well connected, he was exactly the type of person the madam/child rapist liked to keep close. He was known for being a playboy and it was limiting his invitations to events because husbands didn't like him close to their wives. So, a solution was reached He would woo the friend/part time yachter and woo he did. They got married quickly. Now, the heir could go back to parties and the friend/part time yachter had no idea she was being used again.
           </p>
           <p>
            The madam/child rapist's family member missed having the inside scoop, so they sent the friend/yachter to meet up with the royal. I mean she was married now so she could meet with him and not have it be a scandal. The thing is, she was not reporting anything back. The madam/child rapist and her family member were upset so they decided to burn the friend/yachter and claim she was cheating on her husband with the royal and was a terrible human. Meanwhile, the one time she did cheat with the royal was recorded. In that recording some things were said which are still being used against the royal today which is why it was no problem for him to come on board the hell bound train.
           </p>
           <p>
            The friend/yachter was divorced and is living a hard life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The heir continues to be best friends with the madam/child rapist and is always providing inside information while always looking for angles they can work together.
