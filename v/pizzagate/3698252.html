<p><strong>Horry County, South Carolina</strong> - Disgraced police detective Todd Cox was charged with 16 counts of police misconduct during his 20+ years on the force, including failing to investigate cases of child sexual abuse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigators say that Cox failed to investigate dozens of cases while serving as a detective with Horry County police. The indictments detail a lengthy list of misconduct. They allege that Cox did the following:</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 1:</strong> Failed to investigate 18 cases.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 2:</strong> Unassigned himself from a criminal sexual conduct case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 3:</strong> Unassigned himself from a criminal sexual conduct case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 4:</strong> Unassigned himself from a criminal sexual conduct case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 5:</strong> Unassigned himself from a criminal sexual conduct case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 6:</strong> He closed an attempted murder case without investigating.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 7: Unassigned himself from a child abuse case.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 8:</strong> Unassigned himself from a shooting into a home case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 9:</strong> Unassigned himself from an overdose case.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 10: He closed a cruelty to children case without investigating.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 11: He closed a kidnapping case without investigating.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 12:</strong> He closed a criminal sexual conduct case without investigating.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 13: He closed a sexual exploitation of a minor without investigating.</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 14:</strong> He closed an armed robbery case without investigating.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 15:</strong> He closed a lynching case without investigating.</p>
<p>- <strong>Indictment 16:</strong> He closed a criminal sexual conduct case without investigating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was offered a plea deal and 15 of the 16 counts were dropped. His ultimate penalty? A $300 fine, and 1 year of jail time - <strong>which was deferred.</strong></p>
<p>3 other members of the Horry County police force were also charged:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Luke Green</strong> entered a pre-trial diversion program and his record was expunged.</li>
<li><strong>Troy Allen Large</strong> died in 2018.</li>
<li><strong>Darryl Willliams\'</strong> charges remain active.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other suspicious events in the department.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then-Chief Saundra Rhodes oversaw Horry County police while the four disgraced officers worked in the department. She abruptly announced her retirement, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family, in April 2016.</p>

<p>The alleged crimes of Detective Large that came to light before his death are also pretty sickening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]llegations of Large coercing women for sex and inappropriate relationships with victims. Large also discussed participating in nude catfighting videos with some of the victims he was supposed to be helping.</p>

<p>[Large] also told her, according to the statement, that a different victim was supposed to &quot;give 6 cop buddies a blow job while he watched.&quot;</p>
<p>“He told her that he wanted to watch her give other cops blow jobs, and if she did, nothing would ever happen to her,” according to the report.</p>
<p>Large told the woman that if she’d fight, he would make sure she could see her children.</p>

            It took an entire lifetime for me to get to the point that I can no longer respect the police. They really are pigs running wild. The problem of growing wild pig populations, in most states, tends to permit year round open hunting season.

             no! I think that we all know who the low I Q person is.  come-on admit it your IQ is below 85.    its easy to see from what you just posted....don't be embarrassed lots of neo-Nazi anti Semites are in the same boat. that's why you all gravitate to believing this shit and fallowing  psychopaths
