            Thanks for filming and posting - this mother knows exactly what is going on. This is terrifying.
Where in Kansas? You can PM me if you don't want to post.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you know the mother - please share this vid w/ her - these are specialists in CA but if she can get in touch with one of them they might be able to refer her to someone in KS. These are experts on the "Child Protective Services system in California, Social Services Veteran Julian Jerry Dominguez and Child Services Attorneys Carin Johnson and Robert Powell - in the video they talk about the situation with Children's Services in California and their deep backgrounds of experiences dealing with the system - a true wealth of information from these dedicated and knowledgeable professionals." It's a long video but pretty informative:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also - here is some info from the late Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer - she was trying to expose CPS corruption when she &amp; her husband were "murder-suicided"
            <a href="http://fightcps.com/pdf/TheCorruptBusinessOfChildProtectiveServices.pdf">
             http://fightcps.com/pdf/TheCorruptBusinessOfChildProtectiveServices.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, she absolutely needs to gather information on Federal financial incentives the State children's services are receiving  that make it profitable to whisk those kids away and diagnose them with psychiatric disorders and drug them up. In some states, depending on the kid and incentives, it can bring $1M in a year. This is serious business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Third, she needs to send that footage and incentives info to every news station and paper in the state and write in to the papers and post on craigslist and  make the largest scene possible.

             I know the woman filming and the mom whose child was screaming.  The woman filming is Jennifer Winn, and she has run for the governorship of KS before.  I think it is the Wichita area....Riley County area maybe.  If you are on FB you can find Jennifer Winn on there.  I and these women know very will about the corruption in CPS and the family court system.  I am fighting the state of KY for my 7 homeschooled children whom they have held hostage for over 8 months.  Most media won't touch these stories.  There was an expose done by a reporter in the very county I am fighting about 10 years ago showing what was going on.  Inspector General did a report.....things are worse now.  It is going to be a We The People movement to change this.  That is why the Pizzagate wave is so important for the families fighting this system to ride.  Hope to talk with you more.  You can find me on Gab, and email me at

             Interested in knowing how you are so knowledgeable on the subject.  Have you been a victim of the family court system and/or CPS?  Thank you for helping to educate on what this agency is REALLY about.

            <p>
             MommyLove check out this history of saudi sex slavery, and note they didn't enslave whites in BULK until they had the oil wealth created by OSS/CIA when modern Saudi was created post ww2
