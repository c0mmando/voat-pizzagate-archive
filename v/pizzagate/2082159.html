This article explains to people, what Donald Trump meant when speaking to the CIA about&nbsp; building them a bigger room without columns. Here&apos;s a quote from the zerohedge article:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A fifth column is any group of people who undermine a larger group—such as a nation or a besieged city—from within, usually in favor of an enemy group or nation. The activities of a fifth column can be overt or clandestine. Forces gathered in secret can mobilize openly to assist an external attack. This term is also extended to organized actions by military personnel. Clandestine fifth column activities can involve acts of sabotage, disinformation, or espionage executed within defense lines by secret sympathizers with an external force.&lt;br&gt;
