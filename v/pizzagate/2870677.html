Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death.
This case has gotten very personal for reasons I do not wish to publically disclose at this time due to personal safety. Maybe when all the sickos are taken down and we all have that victory party (yes, I still haven’t given up on that), then I’ll discuss why.</p>

<p>Timeline: Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. The studio teacher is also suspect.
The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death.
Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
Time: November 7, 1986. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.</p>
<p>Accomplice: Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9p0EMeFUqsU</a> The interview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O\'Rourke\'s skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.
<a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-items-revealed-30.html?m=1</a> If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O\'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin\'s life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw (namely the O\'Rourke skin shoes).</p>
<h2>🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke).</h2>
<p>🚨</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npXwUnfk6Eg</a> Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.</p>
<p>Note: As I deduced regarding the Judith Barsi murder, &quot;The Best Lies are based on a Truth.&quot; seems to also apply to this case. Chrons was likely used as a cover up due to certain factual truths about it. Chrons is more common in females and it is very hard to detect unless you\'re a surgeon.</p>',

The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. The studio teacher is also suspect.
The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death.
Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
Time: November 7, 1986. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice: Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice.

           The interview itself. The exec that tried to molest him refered to his shoes being made from Heather O'Rourke's skin. Note that the original article was scrubbed from the internet within hours of appearing. The fact that this was scrubbed is further evidence that it is real.

           If my deduction is correct, given the above, the Heather O'Rourke story could be the subject of the threats in this blind. I personally suspect that the bad shit in Culkin's life (the drugs) was from trauma due to the horrors he saw (namely the O'Rourke skin shoes).
          </p>
          <h2>
           🚨 Any producer, actor, or director with the red shoes needs to be identified. This subject matter is worth its own thread (maybe it will help me find the identity of the people who have “trophies” of O’Rourke).
          </h2>
          <p>
           🚨
          </p>
          <p>
           Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.
          </p>

           Around the 24 minute mark, seems Heather didn’t have ANY symptoms until 1987. Based on the account of a medic, its highly unlikely for a congenital birth defect in the colon to go completely unnoticed in terms of symptoms for that long.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note: As I deduced regarding the Judith Barsi murder, "The Best Lies are based on a Truth." seems to also apply to this case. Chrons was likely used as a cover up due to certain factual truths about it. Chrons is more common in females and it is very hard to detect unless you're a surgeon.

             Kathleen denies the rapes happened. I suspect threats. Spielberg DOES have mob ties (to the Bronfmans, who are financially tied to the hip of the Rothschilds). Those mob ties are something I discovered while looking into the Judith Barsi murder.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those ties are probably why Spielberg is so powerful. Might be why Enty doesn’t name him directly.

            With that cast list there a lot of suspects. Al Molinaro has an interesting last name once translated into the Latin groups. Hey look, there's a Greenburg!  Kimmel, Baer, Segall, Springer, Hoffmans',Hoffstein, Rothman, King, Cahn, Pearl, Lenox,  Tom Hanks, Foster, Nye, Bloomburg, Nugent, ect. Just a gaggle of Satanists last names. James O' Keefe stuck out because he was associate producer of Full House. (Not the anti corruption journalist.) Off topic, but do you think Jerry Seinfelds real last name is Steinfeld?

            I don't know whether you've ever seen Heather's death certificate:

            </a>

           <p>
            Notice that the problem was actually in her

            intestine, which is where Giardia usually wreaks its havoc.  It can lead to IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).  Crohn's is one type of IBS.

            Heather's immediate causes of death were:
           </p>
           <p>
            A)  Cardio-respiratory arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            B)  Suspected septic shock.
           </p>
           <p>
            C)  Acute bowel obstruction.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bowel obstruction was likely in the small bowel because the other significant condition contributing to death was
            <a href="http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/i/intestinal-atresia-and-stenosis">
             stenosis (narrowing) of the small intestine
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            An
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_laparotomy">
             exploratory laparotomy
            </a>
            (opening the abdomen to search for the cause of a problem) was performed on her date of death, 2/1/1988.  A bowel resection (removal of a section of bowel) was also performed, presumably due to the stenosis.
           </p>
           <p>
            She died at 2:43 pm (1443 hours).  It doesn't say what time the surgery was performed, so she might have died during surgery.
           </p>
           <p>
            When she died, her bowel had been obstructed for 36 hours, so a day and a half before she died.  She was in septic shock for six hours, so that could have begun before or after surgery.  She was in cardio-respiratory arrest for 30 minutes, likely the amount of time that they spent trying to revive her before calling the time of death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Incredibly sad.

              No, of course they don't debunk the blind, and I wasn't attempting to debunk.

              I was pointing out that her death certificate shows the problem that killed her was in her small bowel, not in her colon.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the article on Giardia noted, the disease can be caused by oral/anal sex, meaning performing oral sex on a male who has had anal sex, thus actually supporting the blind.

              Undoubtedly she had damage to her genitals and colon from long-term abuse, but those things apparently weren't the cause of death.

               What you found is very useful...and paints a MUCH darker picture about what really happened on 11/7/1986 if my theory is correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               My theory regarding the incident is as follows: Repeated anal rapes killed her, with the incident on 11/7 being the worst injury that accelerated the process.
              </p>
              <p>
               Given what that exec said in the Culkin interview about getting carried away, I can conclude that they were particularly brutal with Heather. The medic getting involved supports this.
              </p>
              <p>
               I suspect that they perforated Heather’s rectum and in the process injured her small intestine via something akin to blunt force trauma (blunt force trauma can contribute to stenosis). Which makes me believe the foreign object inserted was a metal pole shaped thing.

            For any production, look way at the bottom of the cast and crew list under "other crew" to find these people.

              Tutor picture with kids and he tutored on Nickelodeon.  There is really a reason to be looking at these people.  They could be give jobs by their relatives as you say and have connections to the Moguls.

                  No, she is not in the picture.  I found another tutor teacher that is possibly way to happy to be with those Children and he worked with Nickelodeon.  There have been quite a few posts on here about them.

            Thanks for the new post! I've had my suspisions about (((Feldman))) from the beginning. Why would he talk all this shit about (((Haim))) being raped, but never mention the name, and then Dr. Oz pulls some random, no-name fucker who no one has ever heard of and (((Feldman))) says "That's him." GTFOH!

            Darkknight, maybe if you posted the question about the studio tutors in the CDaN comments, some of the expert Pedowood watchers that follow that blog might be able to help? You should also reply to enty's Tweets with the same request.

             Even the guys at CDAN are having issues identifying this tutor. They do believe he’s tied to someone VERY powerful at Pedowood.

             I suspect scrubbing as far back as 2012.

            UP VOAT!!!  Good God, why cant we find the names of the Tutors?  I believe they were scrubbed.  There are usually accounts of them just like the record of where scenes were even filmed.  I have seen it with different movies.  If not listed, then there is a reason, and that is possible involvement.  How odd they can't be found for both of those movies.  I spent hours one night after your last post and could not find anything.  I hope others will get on this and realize how important it is to find the Tutor's Names.  Thank You for your Tireless Efforts regarding their Horrid Murders.   RIP Heather   RIP Judith

             Tutors on set are also called "studio teachers," "welfare workers" and "set teachers."

            <p>
             For any production, look way at the bottom of the cast and crew list under "other crew" to find these people.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, on the set of Poltergeist III, Judy Wix was the "welfare worker":

             She also did some acting (Kindergarten Cop), apparently:

              A Personal Quote from Heather
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to continue acting, but I want to be a director. I'd been thinking about it for a while. A couple of years ago, I decided it would be a different experience to work behind the camera. And I'd be able to work on scripts. But I like acting a lot. It's fun. You meet a lot of people.
             </p>

              My parents put everything in a trust fund for me. I won't get it until I'm 18, so I'll use it for college.
             </p>
             <p>
              No, you won't get it honey.  So sad.

              For the most part, it's that simple. But it's a big job. And an important one. Most people are aware that the history of child actors in Hollywood is a veritable epic of abuse, exploitation, and mistreatment. The Studio Teacher is there, first and foremost, as a defense against the business forces that would overwork and jeopardize child actors. Studio Teachers are advocates, sometimes the ONLY advocate, for the well-being of the child actor.

              Wow. Well, this sounds like it would be OK, but many are not doing their job. I will take a look under your advice and info.
             </p>
             <p>
              I saw of course where she is listed as you mentioned.  I find it odd that there is no listing under Poltergeist 1 &amp; 2.  Also I check the Happy Days Going Steady Episode and there isn't any one listed under welfare worker or anything that might match.  Thanks for letting me know where to check.
