            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In March 2015, agrochemical giant Monsanto had a problem. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) announced that glyphosate, the principal ingredient in Monsanto's Roundup weed-killer product, was probably carcinogenic to humans.
             </p>
             <p>
              The documents also reveal communications between Monsanto and a Canadian firm hired to recruit scientists to publish studies that ultimately defended glyphosate — some of which were secretly reviewed by Monsanto prior to publication. All those papers, as previously reported by CBC/Radio-Canada, were also used as part of Health Canada's re-approval process of glyphosate in 2017.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Five studies, including a review article, were eventually written and published in 2016.
              <strong>
               Monsanto hired Intertek, formerly known as Cantox of Mississauga, Ont., to set and co-ordinate four "independent expert panels" to publish these papers in the journal, Critical Reviews in Toxicology. The 15 researchers concluded unanimously that glyphosate was not a carcinogen.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              .Those papers got noticed by federal regulators. In defending its decision to re-approve use of glyphosate in 2017, Health Canada cited those papers in its list of references. It re-approved glyphosate until 2032, a decision based in large part on studies written by industry.
             </p>
             <p>
              Internal Monsanto emails show that the company closely followed the evolution of some of the articles and even edited passages.

              On Jan. 6, 2016, company official Heydens writes to Intertek about one of the papers
              <a href="https://baumhedlundlaw.com/pdf/monsanto-documents/2-Monsanto-Executive-William-Heydens-Admits-Ghostwriting-Introductory-Chapter-in-Expert-Panel-Manuscript.pdf">

              </a>
              : "I think you and I should talk about how that chapter gets completed, as it is not exactly what I was expecting."

            The video I posted is by the abuse victim from the Outward Bound camp.  He now lives in Berlin and his name is Phoenix Kaspian.  Here is his steemit account

            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/MercurysBall2">
             @MercurysBall2
            </a>
            . Great research. Could you provide a link documenting the "indescribable abuse" at Outward Bound? While I don't doubt it occurred, as it seems to have occurred in EVERY children's organization, we need something supporting that per Rule 2. It's a significant statement. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thank you.

            Maybe there is something here too. It was a little elitist when I was a growing up in the 80s. It's international too. I imagine he had ulterior motives for it!

            The Duke of Edinburgh's Award (commonly abbreviated DofE),[1] is a youth awards programme founded in the United Kingdom in 1956 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, that has since expanded to 144 nations. The awards recognise adolescents and young adults for completing a series of self-improvement exercises modelled on Kurt Hahn's solution to the "Six Declines of Modern Youth".
