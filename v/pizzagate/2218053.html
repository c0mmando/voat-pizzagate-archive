<p><strong>&quot;Punch drunk&quot;</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Remember in <strong>2004</strong> when <strong>Kevin Spacey</strong> got &quot;brutally mugged&quot; while walking his 
dog at <strong>4.30am</strong>? And then how <strong>Spacey</strong> revealed he hadn\'t been mugged but &quot;fell 
for a con&quot;, where a kid stole his mobile phone and</em> <em><strong>Spacey</strong>, running after him 
tripped over his dog? What really happened was this...</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spacey</strong> had taken a shine to a waiter where he was dining. He handed him a 20 pound note tip 
with his phone number on, and the star-struck waiter agreed to meet him 
later. The two men then got trashed together. While walking back to <strong>Spacey\'s</strong> 
apartment near the <strong>Old Vic</strong> to continue their drinking session, they passed 
through a nearby park. <strong>Spacey made a suggestion to the waiter about what 
they could do next</strong>. Not liking this suggestion, the straight but rather 
worse for wear waiter, punched the star in the face. Afterwards, <strong>Spacey\'s</strong>
lawyers suggested rather strongly to him that he might want to keep the 
story to himself</em><em>. The waiter wasn\'t interested in selling his story or 
taking any hush money and has kept a dignified silence ever since. Almost.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It appears the UK has a ton of Spacey gay underage seduction stories from his years of working in the London theater scene. Calling all Brits...</p>

             And from what the mother offered - as unsatisfying as it is for anyone -- it may have been generational and the father, himself, may have suffered a similar life.

              Absolutely! A friend that I tried to redpill last year about this whole "conspiracy" told me about this article (of course he still believes that it's a "conspiracy," but I've come to accept the fact that he's not emotionally or mentally strong enough to handle the ugly/evil truth).

               Agree with you .... but sadly many here are mainly concerned with finding a scapegoat ...
someone to punish.  It's difficult to get them to understand that the punishing part isn't 
as important as unraveling this thing and finding truth -- and stopping the whole machinery
of it.
               <br/>
               I'm sure that Kevin Spacey didn't want the family story told, but I think the brother did the right thing.

             The older brother tells a tale of family misery and being sexually assaulted by his father.
            </p>
            <p>
             And as poor and unsatisfactory as the Mother's reply is to the children about the father, she may have given a true hint that the father, himself, also suffered a similar home life.
What we do know is that sexual abuse can be generational.
            </p>
            <p>
             These revelations by the older brother begin to give us some understanding into why Kevin Spacey is who he is today.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no way of knowing, but what the older brother seems to be describing of his younger brother in their youth is someone who is "disassociating" -- possibly where Kevin Spacey retreated into another personality in order to keep hidden what was actually happening to him?  And what was happening to him?  Is it likely that the father didn't also sexually abuse Kevin?

             Do you actually think that everyone in that family wasn't totally intimidated and threatened by the father's behavior ....
and sexual abuse of at least one of the sons?
            </p>
            <p>
             From what the brother describes of Kevin Spacey's emptiness it sounds as if he could be describing how sexual abuse victims protect themselves from the reality of what is actually happening to them by "disassociating" and splitting their minds off into another personality.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have to understand what violence, sexual abuse, family trauma does to children, especially at these early ages.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the exact knowledge used to control children which was learned from Nazi experiments and used in MKULTRA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing all of the truth one day is the only thing that will finally help us end this nightmare of male violence.

              And as the older brother makes clear, there is more to be told.

             How likely would you speak up if you knew not only you but your entire family would be dead the next day? I have already stated numerous times the LAPD is owned by the studios. There's more than enough evidence LE in Britain is far, far worse. So who would you complaint to? The FBI?
