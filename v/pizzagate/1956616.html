            Note that there is no suggestion that any of these people were anything but HETEROSEXUAL ....
           </p>
           <p>
            Homosexuals are NOT our sexual abusers of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our sexual abusers of children are MALES but they are HETEROSEXUAL males ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's some info from one of the studies ....
           </p>
           <p>
            "Focus on the Facts" -- Sean Cahill, PH.D
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
           </p>
           <p>
            Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
           </p>
           <p>
            Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Footnote 65 -- p.123
           </p>
           <p>
            A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

to debase and demean women -- but also child pornography.

             Because men love porn.  There are some women watching it, but it is mostly men.  I don't know how they can't see CP bad and not see it as bad wen they watch women turned into sex objects.  Granted, of course the children are minors and you may say that the women do this of free choice. But what many don't know is that a lot of the porn stars are young girls that are of the older looking variety and dressed up with makeup.  The really cheap foreign ones are forced into it. Those that watch this garbage are contributing in some cases to delinquency of a minor or abetting violence to women.

              Agree with you --
and there are a growing number of cases of men having become so addicted to this porn
that they are no longer able to work or to sustain family relationships.
If I recall correctly, pretty much all of those involved in porn have been sexually abused
as youngsters and some of them are runaway's.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have young males as young as 11 watching this porn and it certainly does effect
the minds of these children.

            If that had been any other news publication, I doubt this quote would have even been included. Seems to me that was included to incite sympathy. Evil bastards still pushing for normalization of pedophillia.

             Hopefully it helps make clear that our sexual abusers of children are Males and that they are Heterosexual males.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also see my report from studies, above.
            </p>
            <p>
             Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, women never sexually abuse children UNLESS they come under the influence of a heterosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lesbians have never been found to sexually abuse a child.

              Well that's complete bullshit. I've seen at least 10 headlines of female teachers having sex with underage males. I've read reports of women sexually, mentally and physically abusing children in all female households. It's less likely that testosterone is to blame than mental illness. Power and control are culprits more so than anything and there is no doubt that gays and women have those issues as well if not more so then men.

               <strong>
                A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

              </p>
              <p>
               That doesn't mean that we don't have female pedophiles, or "situational" female sexual abusers of children.
But, as you can see from the statistics, it's rare.
              </p>
              <p>
               40% of Catholic nuns have been sexually abused (and physically assaulted) by priests.

              </p>
              <p>
               And some large number of Catholic nuns have sexually abused children.

              </p>
              <p>
               And, again, homosexuals are NOT our sexual abusers of children as the study below makes clear.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Catholic Church which has been sexually abusing children over 2000 years now has created this myth
that it is homosexual males who are sexually abusing children.  It's a lie -- and a very convenient lie for the church.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's one of the studies on pedophilia --

                A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
               </p>
               <p>
                Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
               </p>
               <p>
                Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
               </p>
               <p>
                A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
               </p>
               <p>
                Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

                At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
               </p>
               <p>
                Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.

                A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

             None of that suggests that there is anything wrong with homosexuality, however.

             In fact, long ago in Hawaii before the coming of the "white" man.... homosexual males and females were held in honor
and high esteem for their care for orphaned children.

              A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

              In an earlier study of convicted male child molesters in Massachusetts, none of the 175 men were found to have an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation or to be primarily attracted to other adult men.
