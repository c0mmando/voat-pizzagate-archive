<p>Open this at your own risk, it\'s quite bloody, literally. They are activating a killswitch which makes me bleed from my nose cavities and lungs. I\'m still in the process of documenting my hospital take-in, where the kill-switch was turned on/off multiple times. Every time the blood manifested, hospital staff would race for examination, however the switch was turned off every time with each examination. It left doctors and nurses puzzled; they could not find anything in my lungs and nasal cavities. Ultimately I was transferred to the Erasmus medical center where they did a lung embolization procedure taking out one blood vessel. It stemmed the bleeding somewhat but not whole. I\'m still bleeding or not, depending on my analysis on local people. They are trying to threaten me to stop research and withdraw conclusions about certain important people.</p>
<p>Yes, the synthetic telepathic network is real. All prominent New World Order Satanists are part of it; they can be &quot;patched&quot; and connected to one other. I have 3 of \'em assigned to me who try all sorts of mental manipulation (it\'s like a mental walkie-talkie). I have a detailed log in my Outlook agenda that I used as a time-line to describe various events in which I am outlining how I exposed the mental network they have. </p>
<p>I\'m still alive, but I don\'t know for how long. I will die in the harness if it\'s to be.</p>
<p>Be ware when watching the pictures and movies, it would be classified &quot;gore&quot;. However, this is no fake. It\'s taken with my Samsung phone and it\'s still on there. </p>
<p>For now, I\'m signing off, I had to share this with you all just so it\'s known to as many people as possible. They WILL use a killswitch on those that got to know too much. They have to be subtle about it though, hence this type of thing. It\'s because I responded adequately by calling the emergency line fast and be taken by ambulance.</p>
<p>As I am typing this, the fuckers are ramping up the thing again. I love you all good people of this planet and beyond.</p>
<p>ArtificalDuality.</p>
<p>P.S. I have more footage and I am in the process of transcripting the event log in my Outlook agenda into a comprehensible format. It\'s a detailed log of all that happened in the two hospitals I have been taken into. I underwent 2(!)  CT scans, a bronchoscopy and the surgery I told about. Docs were puzzled.</p>
<p>And yes, I knew what I was getting into with my life-time research (see my entire posting history here on VOAT). Including becoming subject to assassination. I have prepared for this for quite some time. For a better world.</p>

            I don't believe anyone owns the world, but I know that the kikes run it, and I also know that there's no paranormal reason as to why. I think the answer is much simpler. In fact, I know it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            I practically helped found this subverse motherfucker. This started out as an investigation about real shit, and once the actual breadcrumbs of info started drying up because "oy vey the goyim know", stupid motherfuckers like you decide to stumble out of /x/ and the looney bin and talk about fuckin space alien raygun beams and shit.

            This isn't going to bring justice to the thousands of dead kids. This is going to discredit pizzagate. Take it somewhere else and stop making us look bad, you fucking loon.

            Give me scientific whitesheets and take it to a different sub. We don't talk about /x/ here, and I know this guy isn't important enough to be a "targeted individual", by anyone who matters.

            Even if you're right, this reeks of disinfo thread. There's nothing about pizzagate that is paranormal outside of elites and their cults. Their cults don't have real power. Talk about pizzagate or frankly get the fuck out. I'm tired of people straying off into tinfoil hattery and religion, and making a CRIMINAL investigation into Ghost Chasers.

            if you want, but it doesn't fucking belong here in the real world, until you can give me all of your proof. And I mean PROOF. At this point, this is like you saying that God did all of this and you know it for a fact.

            I too am being remotely killed. They brain link me and torture me. They believe in complete whack job horse shit, like stealing life energy. They are basically technologically empowered murders with fanaticistic beliefs. If they practiced secular, it would be fine. But hitting someone with directed energy causeing sleep deprivation and then endangering other drivers on the road is assault. It is mutilation. They need to be put down. 
It has been two years for me. Give me the opportunity I would return them to their source. It is not rehabilitative. It is heinous, grotesque, interspecies predation from liars with egos so big you cannot comprehend, and psychocisis so retarded none can.

            It is their access to the weaponary that enlists their followers. Either they fear them or are not informed enough to be able to tell the difference. Magic is reserved to the relational theory. This magic is nothing more than sick, morbid, fucking assholes who need more holes drilled in their heads for all the shit lies they spread.

            They try and use neurologist programming as well as satantic torture techniques. It is a reinstantiation of MK Ultra buy those with enough money to buy such things. Those without enough money and no skills to lie to survive. And those who have serious mental issues in a power hungry manner.
           </p>
           <p>
            The loss is their own. They do not understand the beauty before them. They are to lazy to have real curious fire in the belly to get anything productive done. They truly need to under go a spiritual death before they can hope to get better.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not intend harm to self or others, but given the opportunity I will defend myself. This is murder.

             I am not a Jew. I am not Satanic. I can answer ti the question of  morality. Secindly my research confirms the Synagogue of Satan. Do your research about me properly if you are going to say something. Thank you.

             It is because I do not want to concede to those anti-merino luciferists calling themselves Zionists so they can call anti-semite every chance they get, tha I am suffering this shit.

              It's your delusion about violations of the laws of physics which make this well poisoning. I appreciate not only any work you do in uncovering the jew in any walk of life, but also you replying to every insignificant comment thereon (meaning this one), but you won't get anywhere with obvious falsehoods.

               lol which laws of physics? Flat Earth? You are not even telling how and what I violate. The earth is not flat. I made a meme that shows how to conduct a measurement using a few smartphone cams and a few people spaced 2 timezones apart to prove the Earth is a globe. I hate the fake science bullshit as much as you.

                    I couldn't care less about you. You don't matter in the slightest. The factuality of what you say is the only thing that matters. Substantiate your claims or expect to be called out as the obvious shill you are.

                    Yeah, totally irrelevant to the topic of discussion and not in question by anyone. Classic shill tactic, equating proven reality with delusional fantasy. "X is real because it's related to Y (because I say so) which we all know is real, so you have to accept X!"

                     go to science daily .com there you will find evidence. I have CONFIRMED the existence of that network with local workers around me through systemic testing, knowing what and when I thought sentences. You can believe that or not. I made highly detailed logs and transcripts of words said by coworkers, conversations we had etc. They are attempting to assimilate me and otherwise terrorize me mentally.

                      Okay, thanks for trying, at least. Your complete and utter inability to prove anything you've said only detracts from the exposure of the jewish rape and sacrifice of children over the course of the last 2 millennia worldwide. If you had any actual evidence, you'd post it. You're purposely conflating pizzagate with your /x/-tier bullshit that is not founded in any scientific theory or fact.

              I think you're just upset because I'm not enabling your mental illness.

              You may very well be in the hospital, but you are not a Targeted Individual, you are not being Gang Stalked, and you probably have some kind of non-native virus. I don't think that just because you're researching satanic cults in Spain, that you are somehow important enough to be zapped with a telepathic raybeam or some other 1960s scifi cliche.

            Others are saying you were groomed by ES, well, I'm on the fence about that. You present as totally complicit in the brigading and consensus manufacturing - further evidenced by your trying to act like I'm the bogeyman just because I know that Satanism is neither the problem nor related to/affiliated with Scientology. LRH was a goddamn pretender, a thief &amp; manipulator, a pervert, an abusive father, all that awful shite - but what he made, did, etc, has absolutely nothing to do with Satanism - you just call it "Satanic" because that's the easy way out and it suits your religious background(no, I'm not criticizing Christianity by saying that).
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're actually a victim in this, prove it. Stop trying to pin this on me just because you can't see the things I do.
           </p>
           <p>
            I put in more effort than a lot of people around here, when it comes to digging deep into topics that most avoid because they find it easy to slap a label they don't understand on things they don't understand - if you
            <em>
             were
            </em>
            groomed, you need to take a good look at the propaganda being used to groom you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice that ES loathes me and makes up bullshit about me(same as he does EricKaliberhall), grooms others(allegedly including yourself) to brigade me, uses his alts to brigade me and even made at least one for the specific purpose of doing so -

            Lmfao! You dense, bigoted fool. I've made it very clear that I'm Syncretic and have, many times, explicily stated that I don't even call myself as a Satanist. The only one playing pretend around here, of the two of us, is you - indeed your continued displays even make the word "bigoted" obsolete as an adjective of you; you're clearly just a shill pushing tired propaganda to manipulate others who are genuinely of the cloth you pretend to be part of.

            Your desperation to make it all about me, in order to throw people off from yours and ES's pitifully transparent charade, is very obvious. Moreover, the act of using newly created alts to offset the votes over in the other thread, is equally as pitiful, desperate and transparent.

             That is so beautiful.  What a wonderful comforting momento for him to read at his time of distress.  I think you are right.  Letting hope take over your body can change your outcome immensely.  Having faith also can be very calming.

               Our true consciousness does not exist in our brains or in our bodies. But this illusion of our individual bodies, along with the misinformation of our true origins, has manifested the idea that we all think independently from one another.

               With this misunderstanding it would seem impossible to scientifically explain telepathy, clairvoyance, spiritual mediums and other phenomenon dealing with transferring information between sources without physical means of communication.

              unfortunately there are still gaps in my knowledge - no attempt to avoid the question so to speak, but, most of my understanding comes from experience and research which intertwines into... well...

              No worries, I just couldn't help but notice AD's bio and those who had been responding here, especially when then considering the accusations which have been thrown my way.

             He and I have just dueled a bit over flat earth, it was all pretty good natured, I think he still likes me. He has some beliefs that were a bit out there for me but I do believe he's in hospital being treated for something. Part of why I liked to feud w/ him is cause I have some Dutch friends (AD is Dutch) and they love to wrangle. I hope he gets better. That thing on his nose looks like Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cancer). I had that. Maybe I just didn't look deeply enough into what he was espousing but I wish he'd had explained it better at the time, this was months ago. "If you can't explain something simply you don't understand it well enough yourself." Of course this statement can't hold true in everything. Also, you can see in the thread that he and Jem777 are burying the hatchet. (So here I am saying he is "out there" when I'm talking flat earth lol.)

              Yeah I definitely noticed a lot of love between AD and those mentioned in the bio, here in this thread. Hence being very confused and wanting a bit of clarity :P

            Can you go to a crystal shop?  Buy yourself some black obsidian, some black tourmaline and some pyrite.  These are protective stones from negative energies being sent your way and emf.  The tourmaline will reflect the energy back to the sender. The obsidian is a strong protective stone. Pyrite also protects you from emf.

             I will take a look at it :) crystaline materials do have their own resonant EM frequencies and may alter the EM fields present surrounding them. A human being has a strong effect on EM fields surroimding them as well. A human is a conductor and channels/contracts field lines.

             +1 to this, sounds like woo on paper, but I can attest to some amount of efficacy; placebo or otherwise - debate that another time.

              Yeah, I know--I thought it was all BS too.  But I used to get very sick if I sat next to a computer for a long time and when I was under fluoro lights.  The obsidian and tourmaline worked.  Don't ask me how, but they did.

               yeah explaining it is a bit beyond me too... there's books, but it's easy to look at them and think "some of this HAS to be utter crap", touchy subject but the proof is in the pudding.

            I'm sorry...I'm calling BS on this one.  I see nothing to support OP's claims but some blurry photos of a zit gone bad.  A comment in Zero Hedge is proof of life?

            Something is off with this story.  A few posts here in there, which do fit in.  And if I am wrong, I have no problem apologizing.  Not a snowball's chance in hell I'm downloading some file.  Post individual JPGs of you laying in bed bleeding out of your ears like Litvinenko.

             some suffered permanent brain damage. this was actually in the news. But even if a LARP, it is possible to be attacked. One thing for sure is either way, get right with your maker because these people are going to make our lives miserable either way and we can't give in one bit.

              Acoustic torture isn't Telepathic Raybeam Zapperoni technology from some 1960s scifi cheese. If this dude was being hit with it, then he would have to have been within a direct line of sight  of the transmitter, he would have HEARD it because those fuckers are LOUD, and it wouldn't have caused whatever that lesion was.

              We aren't flat earthers, and we aren't christfags. This is a real investigation about real tangible things that real people have done to other real people. Not spooky ghost stories down by the campfire. If you want to prove that this guy is the real deal, then give us proof, until then, shut the fuck up.

               I am now back home, I got released from the hospital. You seriously need to tone down your vitriol spamming yap. This is not Flat Earth shit. Here, I made this a year ago:
               <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/LP6pPqY">
                https://imgur.com/gallery/LP6pPqY
               </a>
               Use it to thwart FE trash.
              </p>
              <p>
               Further more, give me your e-mail or whatever and I can send you all relevant personal documents about me, my co-workers, my company and conversation logs I've had that enabled me to establish existence of the synthetic telepathy network. I've already sent you supportive links from Science daily enabling this technology.
              </p>
              <p>
               So all in all, it is YOU who needs to shut the fuck up big-time. B.t.w. I just got released from the hospital and now I'm back home typing on a full-size keyboard with access to all web resources I have once more. No more fudging with a minikeyboard of horror on a mobile phone.

                Alright, well hurry up and redpill me on this so I can actually buy your story. Don't pussy out like ESOTERICshade and give me some lame-ass crypic metaphor. That's why I don't believe this garbage, that, along with the Targeted Individual Psychopathy fad. If you're not a part of that group, then you have to do a better job of choosing your words, because I've had NUMEROUS run-ins with those psychos, and I can absolutely tell you that
                <em>
                 nothing they say is true.
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                If you have your resources on hand, I'd like to see what you've got. Burden of proof lies with the claimant and what have you, but if you guys are going to keep blueballing me on information, then I'm going to keep calling this disinfo, because all that tells me is that you've got a big ol goose egg and you're making shit up for attention or to discredit Pizzagate. At face value, your story sounds ludicrous and unrelated to pizzagate.

              Make sure that if you die, that it gets on the news. Then we'll know if you're bullshitting. Until then, go be mentally ill somewhere else.

            I have great empathy for you friend.. this isn't the real life . We were not created to suffer ! We were created to cultivate the earth and live on it forever ! With access to the finest materials for building homes without the need of any money . Gold and silver will be for adornment for whom ever wants to use it! Those  who endure till the end will be the ones left over on the earth after Armageddon! If we happen to fall asleep in death before the day this war takes place , then we will  be resurrected ! Think about what they do with DNA now , even though humans are imperfect we can still do remarkable things , imagine an earth being rid of all that is bad ! We will enjoy perfect health and peace forever on a paradise earth. God knows each one of our DNA maps and every hair on our head he can number ! He is perfect in all his ways . He has the ability to bring us back from the grave and use his super power to restore  you to your most "vigorous youth ". Everything I described is written in the Bible , I didn't cite the scriptures but will be happy to look them all up for you if you want . I will pray for you to know how to over come this , but remember the scripture where Jesus told the sinner hanging on the pole next to him? "I will see you in Paradise" Well paradise is a real hope and a real promise from God . Not a fairy tail . What they have been teaching in most churches our whole lives has been lies !

            Bind up the devil and the demons in Jesus Christ Name. They have been trying to kill me and my family for years. Don't fear them. Be strong. Be courageous. Don't be terrified by your adversary. Proverbs 19:23 is a great verse to stop them. Psalm 23 too. Satan was defeated at the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He's nothing but a paper tiger now.

            Are your zerohedge comments under the same username as here? I haven't been able to find them. I can't see the archive file using my iPad either. But, it sounds terrible. &lt;3

             That'll be tough, I don't have a faraday cage suit for those THz scale waves. I'll just suck it up and take it like a man. It's people doin this and they hate exposure and truth spreading. Besides my indefinite faith and trust in The Infinite (as I call it, independent of religious choice).

              Please be careful. Don't drink tap water even brush your teeth with it. I will be praying for you. Is there a timing to it? Or simply random. How do you know it was 3? I am asking for arc angel st Michael to protect you and neutralize this coven. I will also ask my prayer group to pray. They have their peeps but we have ours. It's not over yet!

              I am terribly upset to hear what you are going through. It must be horrible. In the show "better call Saul" the brother was allergic/sensitive to electricity and wore a mylar blanket to protect himself, maybe something like that would help you. I don't know what THz waves are.  You can stream the show here

             no I have not but I may when I get through this. For now I decided to share with you all first, I have been quite active here on VOAT trying to offer support and knowledge. Now the Merino hating satanic sectarian cult has its eyes on me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, the Zio-Satanic-Cabalist-Cult calls everyone on the good/divine side, "Merinos". I am called that as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Merino is a race of Sheep. Its symbolism for God's Sheep.
            </p>
            <p>
             Differentially they call themselves Goats, Baphomets. And as such, Satanists.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is one reason they genocide Christians around the globe. And anyone else on the good side.

              OK.  I am getting into a fight right now with someone that made a racial remark about a dead girl in Chicago.  Wasn't that bad, but she is dead.  Geez.  He said  black chick.  stupid for walking into a freezer.  She is dead. Sorry, ticked me off.

               look you have to understand that you are also dealing with 4chan autists that say all kinds of irreverent things. waste of energy to get offended. the Truth is more important and thats the goal of everyone right now. They care too but they also like the banter.

             It's ok, but it isn't. I have systematically uncovered this fact with involved people. Part of this is documented in the Vault 7 files from a while ago. Neural bio electric interfacing nanoscale technology. Further more, it's not a claim. It's first-hand experience. Besides, it's not the main point of my post :)

              Pray. You defeat this evil only through binding lucifer and asking for God to intercede. This is a spiritual war first and foremost. I'll be praying.

              What oftotc is trying to say, is that discussions about "the synthetic telepathic network", are best saved for
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              , given how much needs to be explained and rationalized, before "the synthetic telepathic network" will make sense to 'normies'.
             </p>
             <p>
              Similar to the complexity of the discussion pertaining to DMT and it's involvement in all this.

            you have contributed so much to uncovering this evil. You were explaining things 6 months ago most could not understand. Your insight and courage has been remarkable. I am sorry you are being attacked. Praying for you.

               Are you sure you're not being poisoned? Try changing your routine. Eat different things, Buy food at different places. Change your residence if possible (to avoid any fumes). Throw away your toothpaste and carry a little tube on you. I don't believe this is being done to you "telepathically" as those types of attacks are highly ineffective against a spiritually sound person. But there is an entire universe of poisons and ways to deliver them. Good luck.

             Thank. I know we had a little argument before but I'm over that. Thanks again. We'll see how far I'll get. I'm still dumping footage with narration from my phone onto my CPU.

             If the bleeding gets worse I'll have to call emergency again and the hospital. As for the type of killswitch, it's a mold / yeast like microbe that can get very aggressive when turned "on" and "off" with EM pulse trains. That much I have researched. I have been "buddy-hugged" by one of their agents in March 2016, leaving me with an anomaly on my nose, can be seen here:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently the stuff can be used as a kill switch too, note though that the yeast sits in the repiratory tract. The anomaly on my nose was a different, supporting agent to scare me. A dog's saliva killed it off.

              Start a real Mexican diet. The hot stuff actually adds to the flavor when you know how to apply/eat. The tip of your tongue is your hot receptor contact to your brain. If this fails for you then you need a product called neem. Neem trees are available in South Florida and I would not try to buy the product in a dried up pill form unless absolutely necessary. Neem works, and is used in every big country except USA because of big pharma..

               I currently have a staphylococcus aureus infection inside my nose. It bleeds then scabs, and never fully heals. Sometimes it gets better, sometimes it gets worse. My ENT just confirmed the staph, and he believes I might also have MRSA. Could you maybe explain to me why you guessed that? I'm wondering if it could be of any help to me.

                You know the cure for MRSA is manuka honey.
               </p>
               <p>
                The way to heal infection is with garlic, crushed ten minutes prior to application to produce the chemical allicin.  It was a favorite of Herodotus.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chilli is anti-inflammatory.  Coconut oil is anti-fungal, anti-viral.  As well as this, infections are unable to thrive in a balanced body which is not straying from the natural PH of blood.  Apple Cider Vinegar helps to maintain this level, take it daily.  If your body is resistant to healing, it is likely you are experiencing a vitamin and mineral deficiency.

                 .  If it is IN their nose, I would think a long strong round of antibiotics would work ...and maybe some honey inside the nose?  There are a lot of strange skin conditions and other stuff out there now that I don't think anybody knows about.  After all, it is called 'practicing medicine".

                I  took a microbiology class in college.  One of our test labs was to isolate and grow out a mixture of different bacteria for identification.   Anyway, one of the bacteria was staph aureus and it is pretty contagious because the lab instructor who kept a good distance from us students doing the lab work, ended up with a big boil on his nose a few days later that looked pretty much like the pic that artificialduality posted.  A big boil right on the tip of the nose is something you just don't forget once you see it.    The lab instructor, besides being irate, knew what it was right away. I always assumed it was something you were more likely to get in a hospital, so that is why I thought about it.  I don't know much more than that.

               No it is not. This was very localized, where an involved person touched my nose. Rather, I touched her cheek with my nose during an innocent birthday kiss to the cheek.
