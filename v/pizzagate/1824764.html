<p><strong>Wikipedia</strong> points out the differences, right from the start, in <em>their</em> descriptions of these <strong>psychiatric disorders</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pedophilia</strong> - <em>This article is about the sexual preference toward prepubescent children.</em> <strong><em>It is not to be confused with hebephilia or ephebophilia.</em></strong> <em>Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to</em> <strong><em>prepubescentchildren</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Hebephilia</strong> - <em>Hebephilia is the strong, persistent sexual interest by adults in</em> <strong><em>pubescent (early adolescent) children</em></strong>..., <em>typically ages 11–14.</em> <strong><em>Hebephilia differs from pedophilia...</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ephebophilia</strong> <em>is the primary or exclusive adult sexual interest in</em> <strong><em>mid-to-late adolescents</em></strong>, <em>generally ages 15 to 19. ... It is one of a number of sexual preferences across age groups subsumed under the technical term</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronophilia"><strong><em>chronophilia</em></strong></a>. <em>Ephebophilia strictly denotes the preference for mid-to-late adolescent sexual partners,</em> <strong><em>not the mere presence of some level of sexual attraction.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chronophilia</strong> <em>The term chronophilia was used by John Money to describe a form of paraphilia in which an individual experiences sexual attraction limited to individuals of particular age ranges.</em>... <strong><em>Pedohebephilia</em></strong> <em>refers to an expansion and reclassification of pedophilia and hebephilia with subgroups, proposed during the development of the</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5"><strong><em>DSM-5</em></strong></a> (DSM-5 a topic in itself, but not necessarily here).</p>
<p>Enough with Wikipedia, you get the picture.</p>

<p>Searching the internet for these terms will get you hundreds of results. Here are links to a few articles, with excerpts, that further address this subject of <em>categorizing</em> child rapists - both <strong>critical</strong> of that <em>scientific</em> practice, and <strong>supportively</strong> infuriating:</p>

Various Church leaders have implied that there is no transitional group between men who are into little boys (pedophiles) and men who are into men (gay men).</em></p>

             Church leaders would also do well to get over the sexologically-naive idea that, because many of the abuse victims have been males in the 11-14 year age range (i.e., they are pubescent boys, and not prepubescent little kids), their priest-abusers can't be pedophiles, and so the priests must be gay men. Various Church leaders have implied that there is no transitional group between men who are into little boys (pedophiles) and men who are into men (gay men).

            I'm seeing a lot of blending of predators (pedophiles and ephebophiles), has research shown any differences?

            Good to know for those crusading on behalf of children. It may look like splitting hairs to some but I betcha ephebophilias will be in the vanguard of abolishing or lowering age of consent and that particular age distinction is where they will first try breach the dam. So we need to be on the alert.
