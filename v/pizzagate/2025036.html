<h1>Berlin Thoughts</h1>
<p>For what I can tell, and what my friends have told me, <strong>Berlin is a political, artistic, intelligence and spiritual hellhole</strong>. </p>
<p>It was a Satanic den, headquarters for Church of Satan, Zeena La Vey still lives here by the way. She is a victim of abuse too, she was impregnated at 13 and she even has a halfbrother, who claims to be witness to all kinds of terrible things and abuse featuring the Bushes and his father. (Google that.)</p>
<p>Berlin has been a central for the intelligence agencies during the cold war, and lots of money has been pumped to its culture as a part of the culture war, possibly have been money laundering too. </p>
<p>Politically, the city is run by a terrible clique of radical leftwingers, who finance Antifa to terrorise the only reasonable, patriotis opposition in the country (Alternative fur Deutschland). These people come up a lot everywhere pedophilia is normalized and pushed these days, so it is easy to imagine how this environment would create demand.</p>
<p>I am an art agent currently looking to expand to Berlin and that studio where the festival took place is still in operation. Sick!</p>',
