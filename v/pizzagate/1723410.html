<p>There were <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2922773/Newly-released-flight-logs-reveal-time-trips-Bill-Clinton-Harvard-law-professor-Alan-Dershowitz-took-pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-Lolita-Express-private-jet-anonymous-women.html">some news (Daily Mail)</a> a couple of years ago when these logs were made publicly available. Well, &quot;AD&quot; landed on PBI on Dec 5th and left on 13th. The pilot used the initials of those people most close to Epstein and full names for other quests.</p>
<p>The flight logs are also full of &quot;1 FEMALE&quot;, &quot;1 MALE&quot;, &quot;2 FEMALES&quot; passengers, and Epstein has been accused of using his young servants as traffickers too. One girl accused Epstein for how he lured her to travel to South Africa in Lolita Express and recruited her to get other young girls into the plane for the way back to States. Epstein has not plead guilty on trafficking (only on using minors, with a sweet deal of getting only 18 months in jail after luring more than 40 girls into his New York appartment to &quot;massage&quot; him). Actually there\'s been hundreds of girls. Two of Epsteins former employees have told the police he too 2-3 &quot;massages&quot; every day... </p>
<p>What makes the flight record somewhat important again is <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/ijlyjpqc/florida-southern-district-court/doe-v-united-states-of-america/">another ongoing court hearing against Epstein</a>, and yet another one related to private emails between Epstein\'s lawyers and FBI (telling how the sweet deal for Epstein\'s short sentence was made earlier) and could be needed as evidence for some of the victoms (so that they could sue again). </p>
<p>Feel free to ask anything on the log now that it\'s easy for me to filter and check. I\'m currently working with Epstein\'s flight plans between States/France/Africa.</p>',

             I didn't go through the next 3 years, the log is pretty long, but ask if it really helps. No lines mentioning Alan Dershowitz or "AD" to this destination in the pilot logs between 1998-2005.
            </p>
            <p>
             FROM TIST, there's one line with "AD" and oddly two different passenger lists for this same flight number 37
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              2001 Dec 13 from TIST to HPN: JE, GM, SK, AP, GEOR [?] TINTAY, CRISTALLE WASCHE, CHAUN TAEPAVICS
             </li>
             <li>
              2001 Dec 13 from TIST to HPN: JE, GM, SK, AD, GT, CW, CD
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Part of this passenger list is similar to ones arriving in december, so i'll check this further to another comment
