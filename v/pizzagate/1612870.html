            Seriously, this is the dumbest post I've ever seen. It is literally the inside of a haul rental cargo van with the bare minimum cargo package which can be seen on uhaul's website.

            It's not even customized; it is literally the stock, basic, minimum bare bones cargo van. It is exactly the same as the inside of every uhaul van which you can see on their website.

            Who needs shills when you've got stupid, merit less fucking posts like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            The partition is not made of concrete board, it's made of steel, and is a standard fucking cargo partition.
           </p>
           <p>
            A door is not being built, it already has a door and it's in the goddamn picture. It's just open.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's not building a fucking kidnap van out of the material in the fucking van. This post is a new level of stupid. It's a standard cargo van, with the cheapest available cargo partition, with a door in it. It's not filled with tools because there's about 400 lbs of concrete board on the floor that is most likely being brought to a job site somewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is he going to kidnap kids in this van? Who knows. Probably not since you can see through the stamp-cut holes in the partition if you look through the windshield from outside, and the back doors have fucking windows, so it wouldn't hide kidnapped children very well. But he might still kidnap kids in it! But guess what? There is ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION that is happening from this picture of the inside of a ggoddamn cargo van.
           </p>
           <p>
            The furring strips? They come standard on every single uhaul rental van. They're for having something to tie cargo to. You know, since it's a cargo van.
           </p>
           <p>
            Get your fucking mind out of the gutter and post something fucking useful.

            Thats a metal divider/door you are seeing. Contractors install those as their vans get broken in to by people looking to steal tools and such.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pretty common thing to have in a transit like that if you are a contractor.

            Until someone suggested otherwise I assumed the partition was metal when I looked at it.

            The crosslink part seems to be metal.  I don't know how you could get concrete board like that.

            After a closer look, those look like the 1/2" ones, but they still break pretty easy and that makes them twice as heavy and way less likely they are being used in a layering sound proofing technique for the back of a van.

                 so using it in a van would be unusual? Unless you wanted to make a soundproof van...just wondering how likely this is a kidnapping van. I think it probably is, given the surrounding evidence...

                  I'm not saying they don't use the van for kidnapping, I saw the comments on the IG post, it's possible. I'm saying it would be extremely stupid of them to use that material for "soundproofing" the inside of the van. It's  heavy, fragile and too porous. The stuff is constructed in layers like dense cardboard. I think it's highly unlikely that's what the cement board was used for. It's generally used under tile. Pegasus?

             You are going to fix Sli.mg?  I have photos that have been scrubbed from a site since they were archived and it was posted here. Of course, it was deleted as not worthy for Pizzagate, but enough that someone went to several locations to delete them all! If you fix, could you please let me know.

            This is simply a massive amount of speculation.  There's no evidence they are doing anything more than transporting that board.

            I don't understand why these elements raise suspicion.

             Look at the inside of the van. It has been completely gutted right down to the exterior sheet metal, even the roof.
I've seen tons of vans like this.  Here's one

            It's not the van has been gutted, it was never gussied up to begin with.  A lot of cargo vans that you rent come this way, barebones.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Notice the horizontal boards attached to the sides of the van. Those are called furring strips. They are what the cement board is screwed to.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I've also since this in vans.  It gives you attachment points for bungee cords or rope, so that you can secure things so they don't slide around the back of a van.
           </p>
           <p>
            Years ago I was on a film set as a gopher and they told me to go pick up a statue they were going to use.   It was a first time film crew and they weren't real prepared.   They just gave me keys to a van just like that but with no boards on the side.  So we go to the pick the thing up and there's no crate or any packaging on this statue and the van was empty, so it's totally bare we had nothing to secure it.     By chance we saw someone throwing out a mattress and put that in the van.   Statue probably would have smashed if that wasn't on the floor.

              In his defense which I have no fucking idea why I am defending this guy but I guess..
             </p>
             <p>
              He has admitted the reason why he is here so his motives are out there..
             </p>
             <p>
              He said
             </p>
             <p>
              "consensus? conclusions? fake facts? Agreement is perhaps what I mean. This is an example of how whether the basic facts underlying an argument are true don't seem to matter too often on this board. It's an example of a style of some of the illogical arguments, I've seen on here. Sometimes the basic facts are true and then the argument races way, way ahead of those facts in jumping to a conclusion. That is why I joined Voat and why I chose AreWeSure as my user name."
             </p>
             <p>
              So what he does here is pretty consistent with why he said he is here..
             </p>
             <p>
              Now there was one time he said "crisis actors are not a thing" and that came off as completely the opposite of the claim he made that he wants things to be based on facts and not speculation, but maybe he just doesn't know they're a thing? I mean how can you say something isn't real, that why still to this day people debate god. Or like I could say unicorns aren't a thing but that would be false because technically rhinos are unicorns..
             </p>
             <p>
              Outside of the dumb statement he made that crisi actors aren't a thing I welcome the fact that he often slows us down on assumptions and the likes. There are people that are on here would see that van, and immediately say that people were killed in it it is proven!! Well it's not so what's wrong with someone saying it looks normal or pointing out hat maybe it's just normal. He is challenging our deductive side, I don't have a problem with that at all, almost like a parent giving you a are you sure look when you're playing chess hinting that maybe there's something else you can find that's better, or you're going to have to look harder to find the clues you're not seeing now.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean certainly we have uncovered that the van owner or commenter is a convicted child diddler, and he has a creepy van that he could lock people in the back of. Now that's speculation but it's tangible as well... the rest as he points out is pure speculation and absolutely the boards could just being transported... the creepy part to me is it appears that a mod was made to the van to lock people in the back with the assumably sliding doors.. the only place I have seen shit like that is the police so why? Why is there a subdivided that appears to slide and lock people in the back? That's the creepy part to me.

            This has been discussed from the beginning, when these pics were found. Personally, I dont think that's what was happening with the HardieBacker (cement board) it's too heavy and way too porous. Plexiglas would be a way better option. As far as the van being "stripped down", lots of these vans come this way for commercial purposes. The boards along the side are actually used to strap things off, like a moving truck.

             um yes, discussed before.
            </p>
            <p>
             um, no. cement board IS often used for sound insulation. Especially combined with soft insulation around it, it can work well.
            </p>
            <p>
             A typical strategy is a layer of soft insulation diffuses sound waves to the heavy layer (e.g. cement board as proposed here, often a thinner layer of lead is used instead if they can afford it), then another layer of soft insulation to diffuse sound coming out the other side. Heavy layer in the middle absorbs more energy, why it works. Things like this done in luxury boats, houses as well as studios, loud workshops etc.....
cement board is common, cheap, effective.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yes, again on the boards and common use of bare bones vans. You pay extra for a van if you want it to have an interior at all!
            </p>
            <p>
             Do remember though, welding and cutting metal you need a fireproof environment and cement board provides that, so yet another innocent use possibility that fits this scenario, along with using  the board for plain old siding. 
How normal and boring would that be?
            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldn't necessarily want to draw any strong conclusions about this van.

              You're just trying to make it work. Technically you could use it like that, but sound board, Plexiglas and insulation would be WAY lighter, way stronger and way easier to clean. HardieBacker would keep a record of every kids DNA that's been in there. Not to memtion those are 1/4" sheets and they break really easy. You could break those by driving a screw in too far.
