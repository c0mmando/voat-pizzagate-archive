            I am copying that for good reference all over. Like print out and leave in random places like the church people leave pamphlets in store bathrooms. I respected them and didn't throw it away during my stint in retail. Since they're going to limit the internet, it's time to get real again. Real life. I'm leaving it where I can...the more actual public outreach coupled with what we can do on social networks, the more light we shine like we were asked to do, and hold the light vigilantly everywhere and not let up the outcry is going to come. Eyes will open if this logic is pointed to them.

            I'm still testing the waters about who to speak to about it. It's a hard blow and it's just so unbelievable, literally. I always gotta stumble upon information myself. I take others opine with a grain of salt. If the common nosy person stumbles upon that list randomly in public spots. (I'll be at a Uni tomorrow and that's a great place to leave stuff if you're wise to where you leave it. And around the city. I'm going to brave the city for some good eats around the campus. I actually feel safer taking her and being where I can defend myself with what I wish right now. And I pray she's safe. I call Unis sitting duck zones. Saving as much in pocket as I can (hope it's legit, it's easy because its on all my devices to share) My printer is gonna go dry for now, but it's worth it to get info out unhindered.

             That's a great article, except for calling the Mockingbird media establishment "mainstream" 13 times.  That's like doggedly insisting that your political opponent is "the popular candidate".
