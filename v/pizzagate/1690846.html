<blockquote>
<p>Shepard Smith has repeatedly, for twenty five years, demonstrated the behavioral patterns of a rage-filled, sexual predator.</p>
<p>In 1993 Shepard Smith divorced his wife of six years, Virginia Donald, and moved to Miami. The couple had no children. The divorce records from the state of Florida were sealed. While working as a reporter in Miami for WSVN, he first met a man named Jeffery Epstein.</p>
<p>In 1993, he was sent by his station on assignment to Haiti to cover the political turmoil in the nation. Being held at gun point wasn’t the only thing he got involved in down there. Epstein, through his connections with the Clinton Administration, introduced him officials in Haiti who could help him obtain young men. He can be placed in Haiti during the time by news footage.</p>

<p>In 2000, while covering the Bush-Gore situation in Florida, Shepard Smith intentionally struck a female reporter with his vehicle after screaming profanity at her. The attack was buried and Smith received no punishment after the victim “settled”.</p>

<p>In 2010, Smith reported a series of stories intended to assist Clinton Foundation associated organizations move orphans from Haiti after the earthquake.</p>

<p>In 2011, shortly after Giovanni Graziano joined Fox News as a production assistant, the 50+ year old Shepard Smith became romantically involved with his then 24 year old direct subordinate. This was reported in tabloids.</p>
<p>In 2012, Graziano was promoted to associate producer at Fox Business. He has not been promoted since. Other associate producers at Fox News had more experience when they were promoted to Associate Producer. Matt Schiavone had two years as a production assistant and a year as an editor before being promoted. Jennings Grant was a production assistant for two years and a booker for a year before her promotion. Lauren Hans held a variety of positions for seven years before her promotion. Christina Marazza was an anchor and executive producer at a regional before her promotion. You can confirm these facts on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In 2013, Smith physically assaulted a waitress named Katya Minskova. This was covered in tabloid publications.</p>

<p>In 2016, Shepard Smith announced his homosexuality shortly after Roger Ailes was forced to resign and made cryptic comments about Ailes’ “betrayal” of his trust.</p>

<p>Recently, Shepard Smith has become sharply anti-Trump. This shift has come at the same time thousands of human traffickers were arrested and coincide with rumors of him and other homosexual anchors at other networks being in close contact with Alan Dershowitz, a long-time friend of Epstein who assisted Epstein during his pedophilia case.</p>
