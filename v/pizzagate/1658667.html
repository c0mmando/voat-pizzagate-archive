            You need to open your eyes and redpill yourself properly . Everyone here knows all of these are undeniable fact at this point. Comet Pizza and Besta Pizza aren't even a matter of "maybes", they are an established definite. That pedophiles have infiltrated every level of government and society in general isn't a "possibility" it's a definite fact. This is real and happening, it's not a conspiracy or speculation it is REAL

            It makes you wonder if the signs are meant to be viewed a certain way, like with 3-D glasses.

            Family-owned restaurant worker here. That sign actually says "EAT 24". It's a third party delivery ordering service that is offered to restaurants. When you sign up, you get a special little tablet for EAT 24 orders, but they also provide you with an Open/Close sign and some other stuff that a restaurant would typically have in it (a tablet stand, a window sticker, etc), all branded with EAT 24.

            Plenty of fishy things about this place, but this isnt one of them.

            wow thats so strange, for the past hour I have been taking screenshots getting ready to make a post about the inside of Besta's second location in maryland, It has a picture sphere of the inside as well but it was taken 2 months later than the DC one that you linked to.

            Since you are new to this I recommend George Webb. But his videos started back over 100 days ago and they are packed full of information. Day 109 he gives a summary that lets you know he knows wtf he is talking about and the information will blow your mind.

             Im not a Shill it might seem like that because i just created this account, I have not been following this for months as some people have just stumbling into it and researching with an open mind. Honestly people like you who are so fast to call someone a shill for not believing every single detail is pretty annoying. Its not extremely obvious that it is 2 signs on top of eachother i did not even consider it when i first saws it, thats why i posted and asked peoples opinion

              It is important that people be critical of posts also. It helps keep the investigation from going off the rails. Disinformation can be used against us if we are not careful.

              Thank you for joining in this citizen investigation. This is not the place to criticize others' attempts to be of help with this investigation. Everyone has something to offer, everyone can make a difference.  This venue has proven to me that together we can be a powerful force for good.  it is heartening that so many people are becoming involved, and we can expect to see the occasional entries that try to dissuade us from going forward.  But keep up the good work.  All eyes are needed in this.

               I appreciate the kindness, David Seaman pointed me in the direction of this community, and I have been lurking for a week and think its great that the issue of child trafficking is becoming more mainstream. I never knew how widespread this stuff is.

              Thank You for having an open mind and for taking the time and effort to look into this.

              Some people don't realize that what may be a seemingly innocuous, insignificant, little clue could be a game changer.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you have a great eye for this type of research and citizen investigation. You see the little details that others may not. We all have our different strengths and that's why this crowd-based, shared research can actually work.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope you will continue to look at this case, and maybe even the much larger, global issues with the elites, the wealthy, the powerful, the political, the well-connected and the awful nightmare that is pedophilia and human trafficking.

             holy shit so apparently Besta Pizza has a second location in Maryland, Has this been discussed before or am i stumbling on something new, their google street view has the pedo logo front and center even bigger than Besta in DC.

              There are several solid PG circles, so even though I have followed from the start, I can not definitively tell you that it has or has not been investigated.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would guess yes, but it's important that you dig into what piques your interest, what give you that sinking gut feeling. When you're truly following your intuition you are on the right path. You can, of course, balance this with finding a fresh lead that convinces you and digging on that.
             </p>
