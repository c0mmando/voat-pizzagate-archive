            That faggot/eunich/sodomite and all the Bolshevik collective (Bezos, Jack Ma, Ma Huateng, Gates, Buffett, Spielberg, Eisner, Diller, Geffen, Ellison, Musk, Brin, Page, etc.) are finally starting to understand that there was a variable/entity/aspect they didn't grasp when they finally tried to "loop" humanity and are slowly/secretly walking the line towards the hangman's noose (As above, so below....shivers...)

           <p>
            something beyond our perception of reality in the 4D and five/six sense format is putting "ripples in still water"...not a frightening concept but certainly exciting...three dimensions, six planes, the 7th being the center point...is there an 8th (+) effecting the echo chamber?...i'll leave it there...I simply wonder is all....

            C-130 down at 21? That’s freemason code. It’s most likely fake. C=3+130=133=1x33=33. 33 and 66 are their favorite calling card numbers.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/dtneslo">
             @dtneslo
            </a>
            , I would like to ask you to please edit, and elaborate on some claims you make in your intro:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              'whose Asian Little Boy Fetish may have compromised him': While Tim Cook came out as gay in public, is there any proof
 that he has a 'Asian Little Boy Fetish'? Or any hints he might have? If there are only hints, please point out that this is only speculation so far.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              'since we know China is using corrupted iPhones to track troop movement?' Please link a source - you might want to choose the Fox News Article the Anon quoted in the article has cited.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              'Did Trump threaten him with the “Rice Queen” thing?' Many people here might not know what a 'Rice Queen' is - please elaborate.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              You mention CDAN in the headline, but don't elaborate in the body of the post how CDAN ties in. Please elaborate.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>

             Rule 2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation.

            all phones from all vendors are suspect.  banning i-phones because of foxconn is posturing.  lg, nokia, samsung, apple, huawei, ericsson, zte, motorola - all the same.  base components come from the same factories, cia (and other) backdoors can be mass installed before there's a brand stamped on the box.
