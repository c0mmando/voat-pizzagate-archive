<p>now i know you\'re all busy with research, but have you guys ever watched any of sargon\'s videos on youtube?
he is to me one of the most rational and careful thinkers i have ever watched, and he recently made a video on pizza gate</p>
<p>here is the link if this is allowed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dQVRLrCbZs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dQVRLrCbZs</a></p>

<p>lets get somethings straight
there is massive coordinated pedophilia, orchestrated and protected at the highest levels of power.
their reactions and attempted maneuvering through &quot;russian hacks&quot; legitimizes pizzagate completely.</p>
<p>what we don\'t know, is how they do it, what are their operations like? which victims? where do they do it?who is currently involved? 
while we have a general idea, it is impossible to know these things unless we have primary, first hand evidence.</p>
<p>so to push on issues like the basement, or madeline mccann, is wasted efforted. alefantis is allowed to do interviews because they know precisely we don\'t have hard evidence on him. everything is conjecture. He is a pedo no doubt about it, but we can\'t push the narrative that it is run out of comet ping pong. there simply is no evidence for that. they are using the fact that we claim alefantis is somehow an coordinator to make the revelations seem ridiculous.</p>
<p>i have no doubt he is involved, i have no doubt the emails are real, but the claim we are making that he is some big cog in the wheel is blinding us to what we should be really doing.</p>
<p>we should focus our efforts to let people know that pedophilia does exists, and in the places we don\'t think is possible, through historical cases and factual examples. by empowering the public through education of history, we will succeed in exposing reality, and that is the way to true justice. we have so much talent and man power here, it is truely amazing what you guys have done.</p>
<p>im not saying digging through instagrams and finding connections is not helpful, it definitely sheds light on the size and gravity of the pedophilia, but i don\'t think we can truely win just by unrevealing connections. we need hard evidence, and that is difficult to get.</p>
<p>so my proposal is this, some of us who are talented at research and video, can we make videos exposingly recent pedophilia cases that are busted? and lets not focus so hard to discover how it works, we ALREADY know it exists, it would do us much much good if we can convince the public that pedophilia does exists, and the rest will work itself out. the power is in the minds of people. we need to control the narrative, not focus on things that might not be there and allowing them to use that to derail the truth. </p>
<p>thank you guys, god bless.</p>
<p>and also, could i suggest a new tag? someone that represents the grave reality that these children suffer.</p>

             in relation to cases where arrests have been made, yes. why not research those people, why not make videos on them? we're so focused on podesta because part of it is we hate the clinton camp, and another part is we want to dig up the dirt ourselves, its exciting doing investigations. but realistically can we get real evidence beyond what their interests hint at? there are already cases where they busted 70000. thats way more concrete and would do so much more good overall. why do you think they removed the articles? so we can focus on a pizza guy who will get us no where.

            I am going to say that despite your 1.7 hour old account and critique that this is a genuine post. Your missing a few points badly here, how do we get from conjecture to proof is with a judge, as it is in all cases. We have no ability to actually enter a premises and catch people in the act so to speak so this is all there is or likely will be on an internet forum. All we have is the noise and momentum thats getting harder and harder to ignore. Personally I wanted to change from this name for a while but it would be a defeat to the work thats already been done.
           </p>
           <p>
            People here are clearly hitting on a pain point for people at many levels of the org chart, until this is taken seriously and looked into this is not going away. Even if everyone here agreed to stop right now, pizzagate would still be a thing for years to come. Cats out of the bag.

              Yes agree, I considered the #pedogate tag for a while but it would make it too easy for YT and Google to censor based on subject material. If only we had gone with #jesussavethekids we could have had a few million pedes and an immutable hashtag haha

            this is very true, but not all attention is positive if they find the claims ridiculous that pizza is somehow the key. while it is the key, the average sheep is gonna find that hard to accept. we need mass acceptance, not just mass attention. because for every person that finds pizza gate ridiculous is another circle of friends going against it.
