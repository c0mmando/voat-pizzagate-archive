            Corey Haim's mother Judy surely knows who raped Corey when he was 11 years old so instead of asking Feldman to name the guy we should ask Judy to name him. But my guess is she has already been paid off with enough money to keep her quiet for the rest of her life and her life would end fast if she did name the guy. Sad but that's the reality of Hollywood. Here is an interview she did in 2011 when he died of an overdose he could have been murdered that way:

            We all want to see Dan Schneider become the next Harvey Weinstein but don't hold your breath. The only way it happens is if a parent of a child star he raped goes public with a lawsuit and demands police investigate and prosecute. I don't see that happening there is too much money at stake and showbiz parents are too easy to pay off to make them shut up. It would take a former child star who is now a legal adult going public. Amanda Bynes could do it but everyone will just say she's still crazy. Jamie Spears could do it and demand Dan take a DNA test to probe he's the father of her 5 year old girl. Corey Feldman won't name names he's afraid of being sued or killed and he's most likely already been paid off to shut up he can still tweet and talk about "the problem" but he won't name names. Don't hold your breath for any of this to happen. We could get lucky on the Weinstein angle if Harvey is arrested he could cut a deal with the cops and the feds by naming names of the pedo moguls to get a lighter sentence for himself. That might be the only way to expose the pedo network. Or the cops and feds will suicide Harvey to make sure he never names the names. The cops and the feds all know what's going on but they get paid to keep it all under wraps. If they think Harvey is going to be a loose cannon then he will be suicided very fast and everyone will think "of course he killed himself he was ruined and he had nothing to live for after being destroyed with all the negative publicity" it will be an easy suicide to sell and the perfect "tragic Hollywood ending" where he finally got the punishment he deserved by his own hand.

             This almost looks like a cult sacrifice of Weinstein, in the vain of Bill Cosby, Whitney Houston, Sam Cook, Michael Jackson, Otis Redding style...I'm wondering if he pissed somebody off or became too much of a liability. New York Times led this charge which I find incredibly odd, to say the least.

              No it's not. HW really ripped off a major charity at their annual fundraising dinner held in France. Numerous celebs were papped on the Red Carpet in their (listed) designer outfits. Charity is heavily supported by the 1% and the super powerful in several countries. Members of the Board are top university professors.
             </p>
             <p>
              No one wants to see the charity go down and the recipients at a loss due to HW's greed and major tax evasion/fraud.
             </p>
             <p>
              Worse HW is now seen as a major $$$ loser when he used to be a $$$ maker. His own brother is kicking him out of their co-owned company, now that their mother died last summer. Company will survive with a drastic change of listed board members and of course, under a different name as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also HW sponsored De Niro in the making of his small movie re Anti-Vax. Don't you think TPTB were upset at his gall? Movie was killed as well as another project on the books with De Niro and Julian Moore.

               Sacrifice is routine in that world though. IF, and I said IF, Harvey is being sacrificed it is because they have a more lucrative plan in mind and Harvey is being moved out of the way to make room for what is considered a better plan. I have no idea if Harvey is a sacrifice or not but I know it happens regularly. Just because Harvey has been allowed to play the game does not mean they consider him one of their own. His status will depend on his bloodline and I don't know where he fits in.

            He "discovered" Daniel Radcliffe at the age off 9, this boy is his next "discovery"

             Would you want your entire family murdered (not just you) because of something you said in an interview? Do you understand the absolute power these people have over everyone else? The higher up you are in the food chain, meaning the more $$$ you can bring in (profit over expenses,) and the more people you directly hire or have approval over, the more your wishes will be catered to at all times. Of course power shifts if an auteur takes a break from making movies, or is blamed for a series of losses. Ditto with actors.
            </p>

             Entertainment industry runs the State of CA and that includes all of LE. This was told to me directly by a retiring LAPD highly honored detective over 25 years ago. He took early retirement as he was sickened by what was going on. This was the time of the start of the OJ Trial. His analysis, "They don't put celebs in jail. They make way too much $$$ for the State of CA."
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually Robert Downey Jr was the 1st to go to jail for repeated drug dealing and usage and for constantly violating probation. Got hooked as a child by his actor-father. That WAS taken into consideration but he kept blowing all of his chances. Believe me his actual sentence was nothing compared to the average person. Even Paris Hilton and Ms. Gabor before her got the most minimal jail sentence imaginable. Some claimed it was all a pap stunt anyways. Studios hire lawyers for their money-making talent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hollywood makes way, way too much $$$ for perpetually broke CA. Every time they even threaten to shoot a TV series or a small movie out-of-state many people have nightmares due to the anticipated loss of revenue from just that one project.
            </p>
            <p>
             HW regularly threw public tantrums, ending people's entire (non-performing) career because he interpreted what they mistakenly said or did as a huge insult. Every knew he had the power to do so, no matter what field they were working in at the time or in the future. He's insane. That's why he was mocked in "Tropic Thunder" by TC a man used to extreme emotional instability.

             I would assume he doesn't want to be sued for 30 million dollars. I mean the Hulk got 140 mil from gawker for showing images of his sex tape. I am sure if Feldman named names he would be sued to the dirt. Even if he was correct. Money means everything in hollywood.

             Huge difference between homosexuality and pedo behavior. The vast majority of gays condemn pedo behavior. What's controversial is the situation where a very sexually experienced 16-year-old wants to date a 20-year-old. 
Then again there's a huge difference between REAL dating, forming relationships or at least true friendships, and drugging an underage teen or child, raping them, and passing around to many others after promising to get them work. No one talks about the countless number who are thrown out on the street with an STD, or genital injuries, or suicidal tendencies afterwards. There are reportedly very long lines at the low-cost/free LGBTQ medical clinics after parties thrown by the powerful. LAPD never interferes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most pedos are straight males. They don't care if they molest and rape a boy or a girl. It's whoever is most accessible. Pre-pubescent kids don't have developed sexual characteristics to distinguish them.

            Did I miss something? What I read in the Daily Beast is regurgitation of old news, just a few past lawsuits and allegations dragged up. Seeing as it is old news, it is definitely NOT an open secret. More likely, it's a case of 'piling on'. The question is why, other than for ratings, which is what drives 99.9% of today's mass media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it a case of 'throw them a bone and they'll leave us alone?' It's a common strategy to distract, just as  I've said before, including a previous post on voat. Overlooking the shameless plug, it also appears on page 77 of my book,
            <em>
             D.C. the Dark City
            </em>
            , quoted below:
           </p>
           <p>
            "... Throw them a bone and they’ll leave us alone. Where was I, my dear?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Flying a kid’s wetsuit to Annapolis.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “My, you’re snarky! Wallace will say it’s a training flight to practice refueling, or navigation, or whatever. Just a molecule in a bottomless bucket.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “It’s unjustified, Cassius!”
           </p>
           <p>
            He interlaced fingers, rubbing thumbs with short-sighted aplomb. “No expense is too much when there’s a great deal at stake...”

             True, but still, maybe pieces like this will encourage more male actors to come forward and tell their stories - stories we havn't heard yet.

              When the media piles on, it  is usually for a reason that benefits the wealthy and powerful while seeming to be against them. Further, it has been my experience that the people who come forward in these situations will be those who want financial gain, and when that is revealed the entire matter subsides.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I write in in the introduction to
              <em>
               D.C. the Dark City
              </em>
              ,
             </p>
             <p>
              The triumph of good over evil is, at best, transitory. To sell movies, Hollywood glorifies the delusion, while insiders attest to the shameful reality of Tinsel Town’s longstanding reliance on quid pro quo. Society calls that hypocrisy; Hollywood makes it into an art form. Good will never triumph when evil is more powerful. Its acolytes control legislators, the judiciary, the constabulary, the financial system, the major corporations, the military, and the mass media. Worse, evil is at least three steps ahead.

             Do you realize Hollywood refused to widely publicize this movie or give it a major release date? It barely got to play a few art houses after a debut in NY in an out-of-the way movie theater. So many actresses and models refused to appear on the Red Carpet in support of the filmmaker. This is unheard of in Hollywood. NO ONE would ever turn down a photo op if the subject matter of the film was mainstream.
            </p>
            <p>
             TPTB tried everything possible to scuttle the story, even though the award winning director had previously made $$$ for Hollywood. In fact it got the same flack as the scheduled TV movie about The Franklin Scandal. Do you know how much $$$ was paid so that that movie didn't air nationally?

            Yeah... I was just heading over here to post this. When a left-leaning pub runs a story like this, you know something big is about to go down... If only they understood how this connects Pedogate back to the originating Pizzagate (the same wild conspiracy theory the same publication ridiculed...)
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe it's better this way? Let them cannibalize themselves with the Hollywood pedos, not realizing that we've been on that trail this entire time... when more dots connect between Hollywood/Media/Politicians, it will slowly migrate cross-country to the East Coast as well.
