<p>Comparison of Pegasus Bldg and Alefantis instagram pic of trench digging inside a building (<a href="https://i.sli.mg/KNWZ7C.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/KNWZ7C.jpg)</a>)</p>
<p>Changes since the last google streetview images of the property:
*The 1st story windows no longer have bars. The windows on the south (playground) side are now larger and the window on the west (alley) side is bricked.
*The 2nd story windows on the south (playground) side have been bricked and painted and a single centered window has been added. The paint is noticeably lighter, suggesting the work was very recent.
*The 2nd story windows on the west (alley) side have been replaced and the units underneath them have been removed.
*The structural support over the functional garage door has been painted black. The garage door now has windows.
*The red box and metal shelf filled with plant life has been removed.
*The support railings for the door with stairs have been removed.
*The raised dock with a garage door has become non-functional (boarded over -not bricked over- and painted white).
*There appears to be interior renovation occurring in the the north and west 2nd story side. The unpainted bricks underneath the window suggests it has been renovated very recently. Wooden framing can be seen along the wall inside.
*The north side 2nd story window was being worked on by a man (not clearly shown in video). New bricks to support the window frame. His work to that point did not suggest the window was being bricked up. The black truck appears to be used by the man working on the window.
*Roofwork seems to be completed due to the painted exterior moulding.</p>
<p>Compare the exterior of the building with the Alefantis instagram photo of interior work inside a brick building. Given how the layout of the building appears from the outside and the layout of that building inside, it seems like the instagram photo was taken inside the building. This interior then also seems to be the same as that in the instagram photo (not included) of the hole in the ground.</p>
<p>All I am suggesting is that these photos were taken inside this building.</p>
<p>Also, the &quot;kids&quot; in red paint is still present on the front side of the property. Here is a closer photo: (<a href="https://i.sli.mg/VzhMzf.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/VzhMzf.jpg)</a>)</p>
<p>It looks like:
KIDS
61
6</p>
<p>The first 6 looks too much like the second six to be part of a disconnected 4. But then that could be an intentional style. There is also some faded red underneath the vertical line in the &quot;k&quot;.</p>
<p>The faded red paint on the steps is on the 3516 and 3526 addresses. It seems too accidental to symbolize something. The Pegasus building only extends to 3522 down the alley.</p>
<p>Be smart and good luck.</p>',

            Kids bl 6 "kids b0y l0ve s3x" sorry I don't like using the actual words so that the phrase isn't as findable. Aka I try not to write incriminating things I notice certain ppl have no problem writing sexual things in the same sentence that includes children I guess those are the ways to spot pedos on here.

            I don't think Pegasus fits the picture of workers digging that Y trench. To me this is a much better fit:
