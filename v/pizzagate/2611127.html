<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ROTCRadio/status/1011372680409501702">An Open Secret Tweet</a></p>
<p>Yesterday, the \'An Open Secret\' twitter page reshared a youtube clip from the Argentinian movie, calling out Netflix for distributing child porn, that Netflix offers called Desire. It is upsetting subscribers because of what looks like illegal content. An Open Secret turned the clip into the FBI and the next day it\'s under investigation. Viewers on Facebook have shared a clip of the movie and are calling it outright child porn. In the opening scene, two little girls who look to be about seven and nine are playing &quot;horse&quot; on pillows. The older girl begins to obviously masturbate as the younger child watches. The camera even takes this scene into a closeup of the child\'s face in slow motion, moving up and down and panting like a porn star. The scene is graphic and includes an orgasm. The film is directed by Diego Kaplan.</p>
<p>PJ Media reported it to the FBI and the Department of Justice at the same time as others, along with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which has launched an investigation.</p>
<p>The clip is making its way around Facebook, but anyone sharing it should be aware that it is a crime to circulate child porn, even if you are trying to get help for the child. Any further distribution revictimizes the child, and because of that, PJM will not share the video or photos from the movie that show the victims\' faces. The only thing the public can do is report it to the authorities.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Justice, child porn is clearly defined.</p>
<p>Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age).  Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor. An undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.
Notably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.  Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal.</p>
<p>On this definition alone Netflix is in violation of distributing child pornography because the child in question is very clearly engaging in the sexual act of masturbation and this exceeds the minimum requirement of merely being suggestive. Netflix should be in serious trouble over this. The law further states that the law &quot;prohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography using or affecting any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce.&quot;</p>
<p>Netflix is now distributing child porn for profit. This is not surprising to anyone who read my expose on Netflix\'s original series, Big Mouth, which is nothing but a cartoon that grooms kids for child abuse. It is a hideous and outrageous piece of garbage that includes talking genitalia of children, children telling jokes about blow jobs, and constant, unending masturbation. The obvious next step for Netflix is real-life children engaging in sexual activity. The question must be asked. How low can the entertainment industry go? And what kind of parents took money for their child to be used in this way?</p>',

            Let me throw another thought out there

            .  Amazon's largest customer is Netflix.  Netflix uses AWS' infrastructure.  Which in turn is layered over redundant networks of Akamai and other distributed network providers.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is feasible - this is just a thought - that Netflix/AWS has set up an encrypted virtual wide area network (VWAN) for the purposes of distributing large amounts of streaming video (and live) worldwide, without detection.  Using an encrypted key network (think Fortinet dongle), it would be nearly impossible for any entity, other than the NSA, to crack the streams without knowing 1) how to find it and 2) having the appropriate key generator to decrypt the video.
           </p>
           <p>
            How do we find out if there is a "Netflix 2" used to distribute full pedo via streaming?

            35 comments by women and surprise,  not one identifies this pedo filmmaker for what he is: YET ANOTHER FILTHY
            <strong>
             KIKE
            </strong>
            .  Of course it's well known that women suck at noticing patterns, which is one reason they score an average 5 points lower on IQ tests.
           </p>
           <p>
            More likely tho theyre just more comfortable believing in some multiracial UN Of Pedos, not wanting to single anyone out.  After all,  they know a really good Jew dentist who's so nice.  Right

            Netflix is a virtual cesspool of degenerate garbage and mind control for the masses. Remember, George Soros owns a portion when he bought in a couple years ago. Almost overnight the content changed. It’s nothing but dark, occult, sex, violence, gore and murder. Have you seen the children’s and teens content? The teen section is mind blowing. How they get away with the shit the put on there is anyone’s guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another disgusting one on there is Nymphomaniac. There are two parts. The first part has the character as a kid and it is just awful what they show as if it is natural. It is not. Then they show clips throughout of her as a teen. This shit is sick and twisted.

            </p>
            <p>
             What is unfortunate, is that the mind control programming of people has included being entertained for decades now.  People cannot live without entertainment, whatever it might be, even if it is degenerate garbage (like most of it is).  I fired all the them including amazon a long time ago and refuse to pay the assholes to watch or buy their crap.

             A really "in the know" person asked me the other day who George Soros was.............sigh.  She also thought Sweden was an ideal country.....this shows how out of it people really are.

              Hahaha yeah I know what u mean. The good thing is people are starting to talk and ask questions I suppose. The downside is, it may be a little late. I also avoid all movie theatres (for a few years now), no magazines, Amazon, Walmart and big chain stores where they treat employees like animals and everything is from China. The only reason I have Netflix is to keep tabs on the agenda and u can see what they are pushing through media and the types of movies out there even though it kills me to pay them and keep them in business. I can find my own entertainment easily without all the mainstream trash out there. Sweden and Germany are in bad states right now sadly but so is North America. Just listen to people speak these days about current events, they are so badly brainwashed. Virtually no one uses critical thinking any longer, it’s all about feelings first even though the truth is staring them right in the face. Sad, sad world...

            How low can the entertainment industry go?  I thought Netflix had already scraped the bottom by hiring the Obamas.

            In addition to all of the outrage and horror... I thought of something worrisome and problematic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can they pin this on subscribers? What if Netflix goes down with a giant fine and a dumpster fire of civilian outrage? Fine. There’s a dozen other platforms, including TV stations and production companies ready to eat Netflix’s carcass.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if it’s a foil? They get a value out of the demise of their dinosaur video platform’s demise:
           </p>
           <p>
            On the wat put they can label a bunch of otherwise decent citizens as pedos. They can add this video to anyone’s account on the platform, and then say that this reprehensible content wasn’t just their fault, but also the fault of all of these subscribers who requested and patronized that sick content.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the know which pizzagate investigators are Netflix subscribers. Maybe it’s time to cancel my subscription... like RIGHT away.

             There was no better feeling for me than to tell netfux I wanted nothing more to do with them.  It really can be done but they've got people so addicted to tv, movies, videos...it's difficult to separate oneself.  Actually the consequences are just a few days of withdrawal.

              Admittedly, I’m being paranoid. The enemy is insidious, though, so a little paranoia may be healthy.

            I think this may be a case to which Hanlon's Razor applies. But someone definitely needs to go to jail over it.

               You're right, they don't do it normally, but a new normal is being pushed on us. With all the bad influences in the world today it's extremely difficult to protect innocence. I've even read that soy baby formula can lead to this sort of thing.

                Michael Robinson has to be a very, very common name, and I just don't believe that. There is some evidence that Obama might have been born to his mother while she was visiting Kenya, but the idea that Michelle might be a man I believe is just plain wrong. African-ancestry women tend on average to have more muscle than European-ancestry women, and I believe that's entirely the matter.

                 Where are the pictures of them with their children... Not the children as teens BUT AS BABIES...  everyone takes pictures with their babies right?  Thats what did it for me.  ZERO baby pictures.   Oh, and have you watched the hour long video of Sherriff Arpaio from Arizona dissecting that faked birth certificate?  They even found the person's birth certificate that was used to generate the fake.  Your comment that "there is some evidence" means you have not looked into this.  Don't take my word for it! look into the what the actual investigators have been up to...  Quite literally These people (Barry Sowetoro, his real name) illegally took the highest office of the land brought in a MAN as the first "Lady".  They did it to shame us and throw it in our faces since they see us as sheep.  They LITERALLY call us "The Cattle".   One more question...  Who is Qanon?

                  I don't know if there are baby pictures out there or not, but I still see no credible evidence that Michelle is actually a man, and plenty visually and from her voice that she isn't. I have seen that photo before, but that could easily be photoshopped and without more definitive evidence, like official video showing that moment, then I have to think it is.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Your comment that "there is some evidence" means you have not looked into this."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Well, it might mean that, but it doesn't. I did look into it very deeply...ten years ago during the Presidential race. I read the analyses of a guy with some graphics expertise who also researched different birth certificate forms from Hawaii, and he kept pointing out how Obama's documents were likely fake. I followed WorldNetDaily's extensive coverage of every aspect of the story, including laws on citizenship of that time, and studied things like the Hawaii newspaper birth announcement, the confusion over what Oahu hospital he was supposedly born in, that information sheet or whatever from years ago which said he was from Kenya, and on and on.  And yes, I also watched that video that Joe Arpaio did and believed that that BC was likely someone else's made to look like his. I hope the truth on that one day comes out, but I don't know if it ever will in this world. On Michelle, though, I still so no evidence that she's not a real woman.

                   watch this video to get a tiny little taste of what they are capable of.  If they can do they it would be child's play to make Michael Lavon Robinson into the first "Lady".   Suspend disbelief, go through these sources and let it sink in.   It's hard and scary but very important.  We ALL need to understand the reality of what is happening.  That is why I came here.   I am part of the Qanon's army  Kek's army.  I am here to help people understand what is going on.  I want you and those like you to understand reality so that you can make good decisions with the stuff that is coming.  It's not about right or wrong it is about an awakening.

                   What do you think about Chuck Schumer's "wife"??   OBVIOUSLY a man in a dress.  This guy is rich and powerful.  Why the hell not have a hot tart of a wife?  Makes no sense.  It is a tool of control.  They parade around a tranny and then are controllable.  The fact that they are controllable by the Super powerful elite means they CANNOT FAIL.  That is how the system works.

                 This is real...  Let that sink in a bit.  Really, its real.  Our former president was an illegal immigrant from Kenya with a male "Wife".  Every single thing that was done in his presidency is null and void... think of all that... boy.  Shit just got real. WWG1WGA

                        I know.  Now I believe why he died.  Not that I doubted, it but is now cemented in my mind. Breitbart was married to the daughter of the actor Orson Bean.

            I don’t believe they do this accidentally.  They’re testing people’s reaction to paedophilia.  It’s like when they “accidentally” done that child porn survey thing on Facebook.  Just testing the waters.

             I also think it's strange because Netflix picked up Craig Sawyer's documentary called, Contraland. Then it hosts documentaries like "The Keepers." It's like certain board members who make calls on content are Pedo's while some are none the wiser.
