            So when the chief of New York Police Department comes out and says what they found on Anthony Weiner's computer involved pay to play schemes, drug trafficking, child exploitation-that it was vile and disturbing, that's apparently fake to you?  The narrative that is indeed fake is that "Hillary Clinton is operating a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet ping-pong in Washington DC." Except that's not the narrative that anyone on Voat is proposing.  Researchers and lurkers on vote who have been paying attention and are calling out corruption on both sides of the aisle within our swampy government, recognize comet ping pong in DC was a window into the collateral damage that is our fucked up government and their fucked up business plan for regime change to justify big finance by shady banks and vile executives from the oil industry and corrupt politicians who stand to benefit because of the revolving door between politicians and money in politics. If you cannot have the decency to research the Franklin scandal the Dutroux affair, if you were not aware of all the trafficking rings being busted worldwide and within the United States, by the FBI, if you don't understand the basic modus operandi behind "brownstones" and how the CIA employees them, if you haven't done your research into the history behind the Bushes and the Clintons dating back to Arkansas and Mena airport, and haven't heard of Gary Webb and the Bilderberg's nor Blumenthal, nor George Soros, nor Mohammad Yunus, nor Frank Guistra, nor Jeffrey Epstein (and I'll add the Koch brothers) there is no hope for you at this point. If you have not done your research into the Clinton foundation as a money laundering front, don't understand how regime change leads to a power vacuum and instability and is ripe fertile ground to continue drug and sex trafficking, if you have not been watching any of George Webb's videos which have reported on the aformentioned topics and connected it to Anthony Weiner's computer, the spy network within top congressional democratic offices, well… That's on you. Have a nice day.

            You're basing your 100% claim on the word of a Russian hacker.  There's no other evidence.
And he's not in prison in Russia.  He was caught in Prague in October on after US requested a high alert Interpol warrant called a Red Notice.  A Red Notice is basically "Get this guy right now."  I believe he had been living in Russia for years without getting caught and then he took a road trip through Europe and posted photos to Instragram showing he was no longer in Russia and thus Interpol could get him.  If he was openly living in Russia, we can assume that he didn't have fear of arrest in Russia.   Russia has a history of protecting hackers.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's been wanted for years for his hacking of LinkedIn and Dropbox, but he was only caught when he left Russia. He is still in jail in the Czech Republic.  The US has requested extradition.   Once the US requrested, Russia decided they were going to arrest him to requested extradition.  So there's an extradition battle going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way your headline is a claim&gt;Comey and FBI tried to bribe a Russian hacker to say that he "hacked" the election. The only evidence is this guy's word.  I don't think he wants to be extradicted to the US, so this could be
           </p>
           <p>
            A. throwing sand in those gears, making the US look bad in hopes of being returned to Russia where he lived for years without being arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            or it could be
           </p>
           <p>
            B. A standard plea deal agreement that got lost in translation.  We offer incentives all the time to people to plea and avoid trial.  They are not considered bribes and usually they are not offered for the person to fraudently confess.
           </p>
           <p>
            It could also be
           </p>
           <p>
            C.  exactly what he claims it is a bribe and a political FBI smear job.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think A is most likely.    Here's why I don't think C is possible
Again this is being translated from Russian, but he said
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "[They told me:] you will have to confess to breaking into Clinton's inbox for [U.S. President Donald Trump] on behalf of [Russian President Vladimir Putin],” Nikulin wrote. In exchange, his interrogators promised U.S. citizenship, an apartment and money, he said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is ridiculous.  So far there is no evidence anyone broke into Clinton's inbox.  Perhaps he was talking about the DNC or Podesta, but that is not Clinton and a hacker would be quite aware of this distinction.  It would not be expected that the Russian Intel handler of this hacker explains the details.   It's highly improbable, someone would say, you're going to hack Clinton's inbox for Trump and Putin supports this.
           </p>
           <p>
            The backstory to this is there is a very close connection between Russian intelligence services and the hacker community.  We tried to arrest a hacker in 2009 and he was tipped off.  The US believes that tip off came directly from the FSB.  The hacker's father was a politician close to Putin.
We have four hackers wanted by the FBI in connection with the hack of Yahoo.  When the names were released two of them were Russian Intel officers.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The officers of the FSB -- Russia's successor to the Soviet Union's KGB -- were identified as Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43, and Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There's another hacker in Spain waiting extradition.

            Critical thinking skills and anecdotal evidence ... like Ryan who Alefantis threatened ... "critical thinking skills" and common sense would tell you the guy is for real, and you continue to deny the fact, because it fits your confirmation bias, which apparently is born of fear.

            Congratulations, you just showed/proved just how pervasive and systemically corrupt the fake news industry is by naming all these crappy sources ... they're all intel mouthpieces imbecile ... don't you ever do any "alternative" research? They've been telling you and me what to think for decades. Try going the "anecdotal" route and use some critical thinking.

             Reports are that he is "furious." He also called Trump crazy. You know this is likely just the tip of the iceberg with these appointed "see no evil" political hacks.

              Hopefully being furious means mistakes are going to happen, when people see red they don't care what people think anymore and their minds are so mixed up in anger they expose all sorts of things, with a sane mind they could control!  Let the evidence of corruption pour out Comey!!

                 Hillary is a very high ranking pure blood.
 Comey and Bill are much lower ranked in the elites chain of command.
They will do anything to protect her.
They are scared of her for reasons too bizzare for even this place.

                  I believe that to be true. It's why I hope definitive proof of something so obscene becomes public. It would ruin her, and her status, and her protection. It would have to be so unconscionable that her loyal protectors would scatter rather than be associated with her and "it".

               Oh yeah. They do take an oath don't they? One forgets about that 'cause they've made such a sham of it over the years.

               Bill Still also has a credible story that went under the radar about a leaked Wikileaks email where Loretta Lynch said she would do anything to protect the Clinton's ... and there's a link between this email and the possible reason for the death of Seth Rich. It was posted here on Voat a few days ago but was buried immediately by the Comey firing news.

             Maybe they did, but the other hackers were too afraid to snitch, that's why we don't know IF there were others...?

             Possibly the original guy that this was offered to would have snitched and blown the whole scheme. Maybe they thought this was their only chance to do it and get away with it ...
            </p>

             the individual was already "wanted by the Justice Department on charges connected to hacking U.S. companies." There was/is an "international extradition battle underway between Washington and Moscow" concerning him.
            </p>
            <p>
             And maybe this (below) made it too risky to solicit someone else after he turned the offer down, twice:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Additionally, as The Moscow Times reports, the case has drawn some attention in Russia, where reporters have unearthed photos of the self-described “used car salesman” driving lavish cars and taking photos with the Russian elite. Nikulin's social media pages had included snaps with both the daughter of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, and Kremlin press secretary President Dmitry Peskov."

             It's pointless that we need to state how our post is related to pizzagate. My post (very related and obviously so) was deleted because rule 1: didn't show how it was related..

             my post was removed because:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              it is Pizzagate related ... because??? Please look at how we define Pizzagate:

                 that is when the mods do their job and remove the post.
                </p>
                <p>
                 if they delete a post then i want to assume it was unrelated or written by a retard, not because they failed to see a statement declaring relevancy.

                  Well,  unfortunately, this forum is filled to the brim with retards,  so I highly doubt the mods have enough time to delete that much.  I assume that's why so much retarded shit gets through as it is.

             removed by him today, and please check my footer there... So I used some time to find a needed link on mobile while away from home where I had it bookmarked.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then seeing current top 4 posts on the daily HOT are more questionable on following the rules... I really start to wonder the policy, which I've tried to learn all the time but having still difficulties in following it. Especially the complicated rule 1 in two parts...

            OK, if I tell my stupid fake news friends about this, they will say Washington Times, are they even reputable.  Yeah, go ahead you idiots, believe the paper that hired the pedo that  was so stupid he could not even win a campaign for your candidate with election fraud in the works.  Yeah, remember you idiots, some of you were all in a dither because of his emails, and how he burned Bernie, yeah, you have forgotten already.  I will try, but they have been brainwashed by WaPos fake news.  The Russians Are Coming?  Oops, they have infiltrated everything.  You will never see that Comey was protecting  the Clintons.  Why then are the Establishment Dems in a fit over Comey being fired?  Huh, Huh, will you tell me that?

             Its so frustrating when you have people/friends who have said for years how corrupt the CIA is, and they can't see what's happening here. Cognitive dissonance (or they have something to lose, I don't know.) I ask if they read the podesta emails and they change the subject. wtf?
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT, but it was like this with the catholic church too, at first my mom (for example) didn't want to know, now she is the most anti-priest person I know.

             We will probably find out that any dirty deeds done by Dirty Director Comey was and is ultimately pizzagate related.

             However, at this time, I'l be happy to remove the submission if the community thinks I should (or mods). Thanks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Perhaps the Podesta emails could have been more easily waved off or questioned had Comey been successful in this move? Because Bill Still says (but it's not in the article, not that I could see) that the hacker was instructed to lay the blame on Wikileaks. Would Wikileaks' credibility have been damaged had Assange been blamed?
