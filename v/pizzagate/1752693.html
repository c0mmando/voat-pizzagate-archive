            People... You're getting lazy.. Dont just upvoat.. DIG.  This guywas described as &gt;
In the tribute, McInnis noted that “in his capacity as a foster parent, Jeff has helped several youth in the region through his work with the Young Life Association and the El Pueblo Boys and Girls Ranch.”

            Look up Young life or el pueblo... I did. Read one review and came back here. Here is the text from 2014&gt;
I was out there for over a year and honestly the only reason I was there that long was because of my residents. They were extremely disorganized, unprofessional, violated many laws, and it was too much finally. I was there during the investigations of the reflection cottages, when the news was reporting on it and we had to shut them down because they were using them pretty much as solitary confinement. Some of the things that went on there literally made me sick to my stomach. When I left I actually spoke with several of the residents case workers. And the corruption goes all the way up to the milieu supervisors. I actually had one of the supervisors there tell me to control my cottage (during a code green) -and to rough up my resident if I needed to in a no cameras room. At that time I was working with the 9-12 yr olds with behavioral issues!! That was my boss, I spoke with the case worker about that situation when I left. I have not only seen staff trigger but verbally abuse residents and many times it was the residents that were DD. I of course would not allow that to happen when I worked but many staff told me they seen it and didn't say anything because our supervisors seen what was going on and allowed it or was part of it. They would mix cottages when we were short staffed. I was livid because one time they mixed the young behavioral boys with the DD sex offenders and since they were DD the residents could go over the age for 18!! They mistreat the staff and honestly don't care about their safety. They see the staff as expendable hence why they have such a high turnover rate. Once my residents all discharged I left too. I cared about my residents which is why I was there so long&gt;
