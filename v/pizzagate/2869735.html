<p><strong>Review finds 71 Scouting abusers used camping trips in 60s, 70s and 80s</strong></p>
<p><strong>Review of the organisation identifies 71 alleged abusers and 108 cases so far</strong></p>
<p>The revelations of the extent of historic abuse in the youth organisation, which has 40,000 juvenile members working with 13,000 adult volunteers, were disclosed by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone to the Oireachtas committee on children and youth affairs on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Elliott, who has been conducting the review</strong>, said the cases of alleged child sex abuse were identified from an audit of historic records, interviews with former members, and from abuse victims who had come forward to the organisation in recent months.</p>
<p>He <strong>told the committee he expected the number of known victims to increase “quite considerably” as the review was still ongoing, and victims were contacting the organisation at an “increasing” rate</strong>.</p>
<p>Scouting Ireland officials believe the disclosure of the initial 108 cases of past abuse would likely result in further victims coming forward.</p>

            And here is where the CEO of AT&amp;T Randall L. Stephenson was taking us until Hillary lost. Stephenson has been a senior Boy Scout official through several of its recent controversies, including decisions to admit gay and transgender youths as scouts, and to accept openly gay adults as unit leaders. He said he wasn't surprised by the negative reactions to Trump's speech.

            This is going to be huge.  Why in the world do they all of them say the same thing, similar worlds that mean absolutely nothing to the Victims.  The RCC and the Boy Scouts have made attempts to apologize, but it just keeps happening.  Shame on the people that were entrusted with the care of these Children, for they have completely failed them.   Thanks for Posting.  UpVoat.

             We have to consider that the leadership entrusted with the care of these children is sexually attracted to them--thus the foxes guarding the henhouse.

             See this 2015 article about how a gay man almost became Chief Scout of Ireland:
             <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/gay-irish-scout-drops-out-of-leadership-race-after-receiving-threatening-email-31462454.html">

             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Kieran Gildea (58), is a long-standing member of Scouting Ireland, and was a favourite for the position of Chief Scout, but dropped out of the race after receiving an anonymous email which contained 'insinuations and threats' which led to his 'immediate collapse'.
             </p>
             <p>
              The email was received on the eve of the National Council in April, where it was expected that Mr Gildea would have been elected as Chief Scout.
             </p>
             <p>
              Speaking to The Irish Scouter, Mr Gildea said that the email triggered repressed guilt he had felt at being gay and thew him into depression.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The message triggered a flood of bad feelings about myself and convinced me that I was letting everyone in my life down in the most hurtful way and that the principles that I strive to live by were all a lie," he said.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr Gildea, who is Director of Operations and Corporate Services at the Adoption Authority of Ireland, said that he does not think homophobia is widespread in Scouting in Ireland..
             </p>
             <p>
              ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr Gildea said that he won't run for Chief Scout in the near future but didn't rule out running for the position at some stage.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And here we see that the next year Mr. Gildea was, in fact, appointed to a leadership role for 2018:

             These kids are sitting ducks.  What are the parents thinking?

            <p>
             And did you catch Gildea's day job?  Director of Operations and Corporate Services at the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Yeah, all kids all the time.

               <em>
                ALL the people running the organization at the top and in charge of filling other leadership positions are sexually attracted to kids, and they're boosting their like-minded friends into top roles

                Ugh.  How Horrid.  The whole thing must be shut down then.   What else to do?  Parents must insist a whole clean out or else.  The whole top tier must go.  This is so sad for the Children.  The same with our Boy Scouts here.  Again parents are asleep at the wheel.  They must grab hold of this guy and shake his brains out of his head and throw him over a cliff.  What do you propose? When it is that infested.  Either shut it down or a complete overhaul.  But who will do it and who can they trust. That is always the question.  So sad.

                 Shut it down.  Kids can go on camping trips with their own families and friends.  Any formal organization in this day and age will be targeted for takeover by LGBTQRSTXYZ interests with the backing of the ACLU in the courts if anyone opposes them.  This is what happened with the Boy Scouts of America.

                  You are correct they will pull the same shenanigans again.  We have seen this movie before.  These are tests for the next step.
