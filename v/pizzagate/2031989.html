            Key findings in the report by the IT specialist known as The Forensicator:
On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the “NGP VAN” 7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016.
Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet.
The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. “Direct access” means that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN).
This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast.
The data was likely initially copied to a computer running Linux, because the file last modified times all reflect the apparent time of the copy and this is a characteristic of the Linux ‘cp’ command (using default options).
A Linux OS may have been booted from a USB flash drive and the data may have been copied back to the same flash drive, which will likely have been formatted with the Linux (ext4) file system.
Analysts believe the most important aspect in The Forensicator’s report is the “estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s)” at which the documents were copied. Analysts say it’s “inconceivable” the DNC documents could have been copied at such speed from a remote location.
Disobedient Media noted that “The Forensicator concluded that the chance that the files had been accessed and downloaded remotely over the Internet were too small to give this idea any serious consideration. He explained that the calculated transfer speeds for the initial copy were much faster than can be supported by an Internet connection.
“This is extremely significant and completely discredits allegations of Russian hacking made by both Guccifer 2.0 and Crowdstrike.”
On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was murdered and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 DNC emails.
WorldNetDaily (WND) reported that former D.C. detective Rod Wheeler was initially hired by Rich’s parents through a third party to find their son’s killer. Wheeler alleges former interim DNC chairwoman Donna Brazille contacted the Metropolitan Police Department demanding to know why he was “snooping” after Wheeler began investigating Rich’s murder.
As a result, Wheeler said, law-enforcement authorities are now refusing to provide him with more details about the case, according to the WND report.
           </p>
           <p>
            With security that must be in place at the DNC, this kind of file size for 20,000 emails, being transferred over the required 23mb/s up stream, over the internet would take time and should be traceable to when or where the file went.

            Lawyer perspective with tin foil hat firmly in place:
           </p>
           <p>
            You know how challenges to the Government to release information are just generally hard to win?
            <br/>
            Need the right Judge, etc.?
Ok.  Well we also know that Wheeler is under some kind of gag order
Can't talk about Rich (which is probably precisely what the DNC wants).
In a defamation suit (which is what he filed against Fox), a
            <em>
             key
            </em>
            issue that has to get litigated, and documents have to get produced for, is whether the subject of the defamation is actually TRUTHFUL
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm saying is, the TRUTH will get litigated in this defamation suit. 
And, because he will be in court and a Judge will order him to do so, Wheeler WILL be able to talk..
In essence, he will be able to circumvent any gag order.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying its for sure happening this way... but if this were the play, he has a legal avenue to drop Redpill MOABs while remaining protected from breaking his court order.

            saw the story this am as well... on cnn money.... i have not followed the seth rich issue as much as the original pizzagate subjects.... but i did make a cursory review of the facts some time ago, including viewing the interviews with the family right after the incident, and assange live statements around this time. even with this sketched outline of the subject, it was clear that the story today about the lawsuit is pure disinfo-- they do not actually address any of the issues about the case, but refer only to vague conversations regarding fox and wheeler discussing the 'conspiracy'. 
hey MSM, debunking stories are best played when they offer FACTS. calling people crazy and filing lawsuits are the gas lighting techniques anyone researching a coverup should expect. 
 i agree this comes at a convenient time to replace the story of Awan's arrest! fancy that~
i rate this attempt at disinfo WEAK, try again losers.

            Heard the story on NPR this morn. I immediately thought oh boy somebody got to wheeler and is making him do this and/or he's doing it for the money. MSM trying to make it look like Trump purposely created and planted fake news on fox. Trying to discredit questions about Seth Rich, Pizzagate etc

             As I have posted many times, Wheeler is a Freemason.  Freemasons don't need to be "paid" for their "contributions."
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW, it is HILARIOUS how I was downvoated a few days ago by pointing out that RD is a Freemason and a liar.  Back then, you Trumptards still thought he was a "good guy."  Now that he has "turned on you" (in your view), my opinion is "popular."

             NPR has Soros ties.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In October 2010, NPR accepted a $1.8 million grant from the Open Society Institute. The grant is meant to begin a project called Impact of Government that was intended to add at least 100 journalists at NPR member radio stations in all 50 states by 2013. The OSI has made previous donations, but does not take on air credit for its gifts.

              Do you know Tillerson's real one then? Because 2 L's isn't working. The one with 3 L's has a lot of followers. I don't care about the other guy. I liked how Tillerson retweeted it.

            So.... WTF? Wheeler is dragging SR through the mud along w/ Fox News? Retracting his story (which he also backed up in the George Webb interview)? And is putting into question the entire Seth Rich investigation to save his own career?
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless we find out he's doing this explicitly to bring Rich back into the limelight to intentionally uncover new details - which would be epic.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, if Mr. Wheeler is doing this purely to save his own ass and distance himself from the Rich conspiracy to make a few bucks, he's an even bigger coward than when he backed off the investigation and refused to name sources from months ago.

            That's because Fox News is being sued over that Seth Rich Story, it ran and then retracted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The investigator, Rod Wheeler is suing them claiming that they made up quotes and attributed to him.  And that the story was a deliberate attempt to change the narrative on the Russia hacking.

                Molly Macauley was also killed that weekend.  She was a Scientist working for NASA under BO.  I have read on here from a member that she suspected possibly had proof that voting machines were being controlled by satellite.  Combined with what Seth Rich knew (we can guess what that was), it could be a dangerous combination of knowledge.  I believe with the IT knowledge that Awan had, he could handle even something so complex.

                 Yes, that was me.  College classmate.  Brilliant.  Huge Hillary supporter.  Degree in Economics and Public Policy. Masters, Doctorate, Professor.  Stabbed in the neck by assailant while walking her (large) dogs. Murder unsolved and fell to the bottom of news cycle with Baltimore BLM riots. Hmmmmmmmm.  Yes, Carmencita, we live in very dangerous times.  It's not about 18 minutes of a tape being deleted, anymore, Toto.

                  Oh, Thank you for replying. A couple of of times when I have brought this up on here, I immediately get asked for a source.  There really is not one is there?  The only source would have been Molly. Do you know of one?  I am looking for one now.  Was she a classmate of yours?  I am so sorry.  I have read many times about what a wonderful person she was.  There is also an important question that has never been answered.  What happened to her dogs?

                   Yes, college classmate.  Source is Google her obituary and also her cv.  People who were close to her have been the ones asking questions and wondering out loud if she stumbled on something with her satellite work that she shouldn't have.  Again, much of what happened that weekend got covered up with Baltimore's problems and then, the Seth Rich murder. From the best that I can determine from other alumni, her dogs are with her partner.  They were big dogs, so there is conjecture that whoever murdered her, knew her and her dogs knew them.  Evidently came back to the house (in a very affluent outside Baltimore neighborhood) with their leashes dragging.  This is the part that makes me the saddest and the maddest.  It just seems so easy for the bas....s to just ruin people's lives-snuff them out like they don't count for something.  There is conjecture that some in the evil cabal enjoy this-that that is part of their ritual.  That is why it has to stop.

                    Thanks for the info it will help me research.  Yes, I believe you are correct about them enjoying it, or at least not caring one little bit.  It is just like taking a bite of a piece of toast or a having a sip of coffee. Just another part of their day.  Yes, it has to stop.  Btw, what is cv?

                      Not too much explanation on the how satellite system worked, but how all three of them were tied together.  Very interesting.  I believe they wanted Ashe out of the way first because maybe she had convinced him to squeal her info during his testimony.

                      Yes, sounds very familiar.  The silence is deafening is it not.  I am going to post something in the comments that I found about how Ashe Molly and Seth were connected.

                       Yes, thank you.  Forgot about Ashe being the connection that was really bothering those who want some traction on the solving of this murder.  I read a lot of mystery novels-they have nothing on these real life mysteries.

                         Yes, same class.  And, until all this came out from the Podesta emails, I never knew the info about Nas a and the secrets involving them. Family members in the big war were encryptors and code breakers, but I still am surprised about all the things I'm learning.
All the secrets. Secrets, everywhere.
