<p>On page 202 of the book titled &quot;Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, and the Torch Song Tradition&quot;, it talks about a photograph of a politician kissing a baby that was supposed to mean &quot;Kiss them now, kill them later.&quot; Costello describes this as the &quot;ultimate act of betrayal,&quot; then immediately talks about his song Tramp the Dirt Down and how he wants to witness Margaret Thatcher\'s burial and help stomp the dirt down. Remember that Margaret Thatcher was good friends with Jimmy Savile.</p>
<p>Then, on page 221, the text talks about a song that describes a child getting molested in a church.

<p><em>His talk of politicians gives me an opening to ask him about his native England, which he quit for Ireland, then the US, and then Canada, where he now lives with his jazz-pianist wife, Diana Krall, and their eight-year-old twin sons, Dexter and Frank.

<p>Gee, I wonder what turns his stomach about Cameron?</p>
<p>And what about Joni Mitchell? Was she abused as a child, then allowed her daughter to be abused? </p>
<p>In the book &quot;Dancing in Hell&quot; by Daniel West, there\'s a chapter titled &quot;Making Her Case for Her: Both Sides Now - Joni Mitchell&quot; where the narrator describes a young girl being molested by her uncle and the girl\'s mother allowing it to happen because she was also molested by the same relative.

             Wow! Thanks for digging that up. Although, while Costello hates Thatcher, he still sides with Clinton and Abramovic, so he's still pretty creepy.

              No problem. I always wondered about those paddles on display in Comet Ping Pong. Thatcher being friends with Savile is a huge red flag to me. We know, without a doubt, that Savile was a pedophile. Unless, the video of him touching that girl on TV was fake, Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) lying, endless reports of molestation lies....he was a pedophile. That's what we know for sure.

               Most definitely. It's just a shame that those who knew what he was didn't speak up before he died. I find it egregious that Savile was given a key to the Children's Hospital, and people saw him going in there at night, but nobody said a word.

            I think are there is left to know are the big names involved. By now if you believe pizzagate is real you have accepted as truth that powerful elite take advantage of children all over the world. They convince others to do the same and use that to extort them for life. Now we just need to know who they are. Charlie Sheen, Robin WIlliams, Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski, Bill Clinton, are obvious ones. I want to hear about other big names like Spielberg, etc.

             Lyrics to King of Thieves:
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll tell your fortune in a minute or two
I might even tell you what comes next
The moguls want a human sacrifice
And look at that girl - young, hungry and perplexed
They took away the best years of her life
Ah, but it's all in good fun
And if you kept your nose clean
You can laugh now at the caring things they've done
            </p>

             Those certainly are creepy lyrics. This guy has me completely baffled. He rejects England's elite, but performs at Hillary Clinton's 60th birthday and Obama's inauguration. What's up with that?

             Costello married his third wife, the jazz pianist and singer Diana Krall, in 2003. His reputation in his adopted homeland received a huge boost last month with news that he was headlining at Hillary Clinton's 60th birthday party to help make it "younger, hipper, more fun". Revelations of the Clintons' love of Costello had even led to speculation that they named their only daughter, Chelsea, after Costello's hit.

            Funny you bring up Costello.  Was he not married to Julia Roberts?  My mind traveled to the thought of her being in Mystic Pizza.  Never having seen the movie, does anyone know could this have been another Message Movie?  Just a thought.

              Oh my gosh!  Thanks for clearing that up. That's why I did not make a positive statement, but asked if he was married to her.  I admit I have mixed up Lovett and Costello before.  But that movie is what popped into my mind and yes, it should be revisited, one way or the other, Costello or not.

                Believe me I know a lot of yahoos that are still living in that dream world, but they are not pedos or supporters.  I agree it should be deleted IF it is proven that he has any connections to pizzagate.  We should def research him first.  We should know one way or the other.  This is a good time to get into his background.  But it's your post and your decision.

                 Agreed. He is an interesting character though because he hates one faction, yet buddies up to another. The fact that he lives in Canada now is interesting, too. I'll have to find out when he moved there. I'll leave it up for a little bit longer, then delete it. As always, thanks for your input, Carm!

                  No problem.  Wish we had a huge team of researchers to investigate all these people, but sadly, we don't.  Any connections to Montreal or Trudeau would be significantly suspect.

                   Good idea! As I just found he's connected to Abramovic, I'll search to see if he's buddies with Trudeau.

                     He is indeed associated with Trudeau and Montreal due to his attendance and performance at Leonard Cohen's tribute concert.

            hi EC, interesting topic, but I'm not really seeing any clear connections to pizzagate, as defined in Rule 1 of the Submission Rules (found in the sidebar.)  if you are able to find relevant info related to this topic, kindly reply to this message within 24 hours so that we can remove the flair; otherwise we'll have to delete it.
           </p>

             Hi, Ben. I know this is obscure evidence, but I'm hoping more can be found besides the few excerpts I have taken from these two books, which I stumbled upon after seeing that Joni Mitchell was just at David Geffen's birthday party. I did a google search for 'Joni Mitchell molested' and this is where I found this info about Costello and Mitchell. I think there's more to find, and I'll be digging today to find more. Thanks for the additional time.

              I read a long time ago that the song Coyote was about a ritual satanic abuse that happened in the desert. A coyote is, of course, someone who brings in illegal aliens from Mexico.

               That's interesting, and would appreciate it if you could find a link. Some of his song lyrics do appear suspect.

There's a Devil monkey laying on our backs
Now tell me, where's the heart? Where's the bullet for breaking?
Who's gonna give me a weapon, a pacifying weapon?
An' I need it all
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon, oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I said, I said, "Welcome me"
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon, oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I said, "Welcome me"

              perhaps you are reading too much into it (one shouldn't necessarily view every situation through a pizzagate lens.) i think it's more likely that Elvis Costello is simply a lefty singer and lefties are supposed to always hate on 'righties' (Margaret Thatcher, in this case).  that would explain your confusion regarding the EC/HC connection imo.  remember, to normies, MT and HC are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.

               You might be right, but something is still nagging at me about this guy. I don't play into this left/right paradigm, so maybe this just proves that they all actually play for the same team, but act like they don't. Hard to determine right now, but strange nonetheless. It is interesting that he's associated with Abramovic...

            Given that this song was written long before the Savile story broke, he might want to tramp the dirt down for other reasons....like the ones he mentions in the song.

             Thanks for making an appearance. I guess this means I'm on to something! Well, might Costello have known what Thatcher was BEFORE the Savile story broke? I'm sure a lot of people knew, but didn't say anything.

                 I hardly derailed my thread, I just revealed that he's actually a slimy guy who hangs out with the Clintons and Abramovic. This is what true research accomplishes. I dug deeper and found out he's not such an upstanding guy after all. Good researchers dig deeper and aren't afraid to admit they were wrong.

                 uh yeah shill - that just because the story hadn't broken in the news yet didn't mean buttloads of people didn't already know savile was a pedo! But like always you have to deflect and derail to steer everything in the direction you want it.

                  You're immediately buying into a theory you just learned about and you're calling it logical.

                  Elvis Costello has talked many, many times about that song and why he wrote it.  It has absolutely zero to do with Jimmy Savile.   Costello had a long standing and public antipathy to Margaret Thatcher's policies and wrote at least three songs that deal with them, probably more.

                   I’m not agreeing with anybody, but Maggie Thatcher is a well known hated figure in Britain and people hate her for MANY reasons, not just Saville, I’m sure Costello was the same
