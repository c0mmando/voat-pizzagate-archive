<p>In part one of their two-part expose, &quot;Unmasking the Predatory Priest Cover-Up,&quot; on the sex abuse scandal rocking the Catholic Church, The Station of the Cross Catholic Radio Network released a detailed report on a major sex scandal in the New York diocese and called for Bishop Richard Joseph Malone of Buffalo to resign.</p>
<p>The report is full of letters from Bishop Malone, detailing the sexual exploits of one Fr. Smith, who was accused of grooming and touching minors and young people at an alarming rate. What\'s especially shocking about these allegations is that they are not many decades old, but range from 2004 until as recently as 2017.</p>
<p>Commenting on a 7 Eyewitness News series on Bishop Richard Malone’s handling of two priests, Station of the Cross explained, &quot;We believe the 7 Eyewitness News report to be credible based on the internal Diocesan documents included and published with the report.&quot; The report added, &quot;We have read the investigative report and internal Diocesan documents in detail and wish to provide an unbiased, dispassionate presentation of the facts for your edification and discernment.</p>
<p>In 2004, a seminarian accused Smith of sneaking into his room and touching his genitals. In 2011, an elementary and middle school principal, Kristine Hider, reported Smith for &quot;grooming&quot; behavior and stalking an 8th-grade boy. According to the 7 Eyewitness News investigative report, Bishop Kmiec, bishop of Buffalo at the time, suspended Smith from the parish and, documents show, officials told parishioners that Smith was taking a “medical leave.” He was sent for psychological care at a Philadelphia treatment center.</p>
<p>By 2012 he was back interacting with elementary students at the same school! The principal once again reported him to the bishop\'s office. &quot;Fr. Smith was on St. Mary’s property on two occasions on March 1, 2012,&quot; she wrote. &quot;It has been rumored that he is hearing confessions of another elementary school, saying mass and has contact with youth.&quot; Kmiec went on to say, &quot;Several other sites have reported him to be involved in their church life. This man is a predator and a groomer of young children. Something needs to be done. It is perceived that nothing is being done or has been done to stop this man from hurting anyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>The very next month, when this report should have been fresh in the bishop\'s office, a new bishop was installed, Richard Joseph Malone, who reinstated Smith to active ministry the very next November. Smith was assigned to a nursing home, but managed to go to a youth conference in 2013 where hundreds of teens were in attendance. Smith began hearing their confessions in a hotel room. Principal Hider was at the event and had to calm a student who came to her with strange tales of hearing Smith saying inappropriate things to her in the confessional. Hider wrote two more letters to the diocese expressing her incredulity that the bishop would knowingly allow a predator to be in a hotel with minors since her initial report was sent to the diocese in 2004. &quot;If a teacher would have been grooming children and had inappropriate relations with a minor, they would have been fired and lost their license to teach,&quot; she wrote, &quot;yet a priest that has a history of inappropriate contact with the youth was among the youth ministering the sacrament of Reconciliation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Station of the Cross reported that Bishop Malone wrote back to Hider, denying that Smith\'s behavior was in violation of the Charter for Protecting Young People. </p>
<p>In 2013, Smith was further accused of inappropriately touching a 19-year-old and a priest in training at the nursing home where he worked. Bishop Malone received the complaint in a letter from the Brothers of Mercy of Montabaur nursing home asking him to remove Smith from their facility.</p>
<p>In 2015, after the multiple complaints of inappropriate behaviors around young people and minors, Bishop Malone gave Smith a letter of recommendation that read, &quot;I am unaware of anything in his background which would render him unsuitable to work with minor children.&quot;</p>
<p>Many have called for Bishop Malone to resign over the abdication of truth and responsibility, including the Catholic Radio Network, but the bishop is digging in, refusing to step down, angering lay Catholics everywhere. Pope Francis continues to do and say nothing, while the church burns with a shameful scandal.</p>
<p>There is a video included with this report.   This priest had the gall to hear confessions of the young people in his hotel room.  I can\'t even.</p>
<p>This is pizzagate related due to anothe rordaind priest, a person in power, and member of the RCC sexually abusing Our Children.</p>',

            What a frickin conspiracy !   Nobody absolutely nobody cared about the kids .........
I’m just curious , I wonder how this info coming out has anything to do with the NWO of one religion ?   The church just keeps getting pummeled ( by their own behavior). We all know this sick behavior is in every major religion.

             It figures in that they want kids messed up for one, and also to completely infiltrate the church with gays and pedophiles.  They are nearing their quota but it's now being told everywhere.  We have to keep posting about the gay priests and raping of children and seminarians.  They are hoping it will die down and go away.  NOPE Not this time.  37K Catholic Women signed a letter addressed to the pope.  Now that is a 1st.

             Yes, they are always trying to Fly The Coop.  Wonder if he went to Florida.  A friend told me about the Homestead Act in Fla.  They cannot touch the perp's residence nor pensions.  There are tons of retired priests in Fla.  Well, we know they are always trying to wriggle out of it when they are in Hot Water.  Thanks for the article.  I have been reading about so many of these situations it is just mind boggling.  They keep piling up.

            Seems like the support these rogue priests get from their superiors indicates that if the support was withdrawn the rogue priests would start spilling the beans on the higher ups. The Church is rotten to the core, needs to start up again even if it's under canvas tents. 
Another reason why these pedophile priests seem to be unchecked by the Church: by molesting other seminarians the pedophile priests are "weeding" out the unfriendlies so that the end result is a Church full of gay predators. They can't exactly hang out a sign that says "No heteros accepted here" but they can sure make it intolerable to stay in the ministry.

             Right On Penny!  Totally agree the church needs a brand new start.  Tents sounds like a great idea.  Masses in the park, whatever.  I firmly believe one of many reasons they are raping seminarians is that possibly they are doing the same program the CIA has been doing.  Blackmail.  They are filming the encounters and threatening exposure.  These Jesuits are a Crafty Lot.   Yes, no sign is needed, the release lately of the article about the Lavender Mafia and the huge number of gay priests in the RCC speaks for itself.   Catholics Wake Up!!!

            This was Malone's excuse for not resigning while at the same time acknowledging his failures:
           </p>

            <strong>
             “The shepherd does not desert the flock at a difficult time.”

            IRL translation:  Malone has to be in "difficult times" with hot water up to his eyeballs before protecting his flock is a thing for him.

             Ha Ha.  In the article he says  The bishop said that he is establishing a task force to review diocesan protocols for dealing with claims of inappropriate behavior involving adults.  And he also ads that he will include a politician or two.  WHAT A JOKE.  Another task force.   Politicians?  Another Joke.  If it comes to a vote, we know how those chosen pols will vote.

             He is either up to his eyeballs because of all of the ignoring and denying or he is involved in some sexual abuse and rape himself.  The pope (devil) will defend him til the end.  Not until there is a Huge Outcry, and maybe not even then.  I love how he says this is a difficult time.  Understatement of the Century.

              Well said. People of faith are kidding themselves in thinking it doesn't happen in 'my denomination'. One of the worst things we can do is to ignore the potential threats in our own communities. God bless this school principal, Kristine Hider! Indeed, there are angels among us.

             Yes and this is in NY and they are about to start of Grand Jury of their own to look into these horrible crimes.  Let's hope everything is on the up and up there.  We also had a post on a Whistleblower account by a Rabbi and the Orthodox Sexual Abuse being committed.  It's all over the world.  I too hope for Justice for the Victims.  The fact that 37K Catholic Women signed a letter addressed to the Pope speaks volumes of how all of this exposure has touched the hearts of Catholics.

             Thanks for the ping, Carm. Please see also my submission about this case:

             TL;DR: Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict VI, and Pope Francis were all involved in the cover-up.
