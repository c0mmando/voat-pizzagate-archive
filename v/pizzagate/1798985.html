<p>Analysis </p>
<p>After having viewed this disturbing report, videoed in 2009, the national investigation trail went cold. Let’s examine the report and its contents chronologically and it will become crystal clear that there are major omissions from this network report, which was designed to take attention away from child trafficking for the purpose of organ harvesting.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The video reported on multiple New Jersey politicians (e.g. mayors, state representatives) who were rounded up and arrested and accused of laundering money from “ill-gotten gains” and shipping the money off to Israel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there was the vaguely reported case of New York City rabbis being arrested for laundering money, and it was reported in what referred to as a “parallel investigation” which was part of this news story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The case involved an “informant” who offered illegal bribes to help launder money. If this was true, the politicians and rabbis could successfully argue entrapment. The alleged primary crime makes no sense because since when do local politicians have the market cornered on money laundering, especially when you have a proven money laundering bank at HSBC just across the East River? The report also loses credibility when they bring in the rabbis  and arrest them. If the politicians could somehow launder money, then why would the rabbis be needed? If the rabbis were likewise able to launder money, then why would the politicians be needed?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact is that there was NO informant. </p>
<p>Here is what actually happened. In a later clip in this network report, it was stated that the “FBI also stumbled upon a Brooklyn man who would broker the sale of human kidneys for $160,000 as he would find donors in Israel, who needed the money, who then would fool U.S. hospitals that the donor and recipient were related and would then pay for the organs to go to the Israelis for the purposes of transplant. The report stated that this unnamed man had been doing this for more than 10 years”. “And then prosecutors stated that they found rabbis at synagogues in New Jersey and New York, …who helped launder over three million dollars back into Israel…”  Confused? So was I until I followed the evidence trail.</p>
<p>In order to believe this entire report at face value it would be necessary to believe that Israel does not enforce money laundering laws. Are we also to believe that one informant laundered $650,000 to New Jersey politicians and $3 million dollars to Jewish rabbis? One informant that netted 44 high profile arrests? No way! And then where did the report come from which exposed the organ trafficking back to Israel? Why is this last item even in this story? It’s in the story because this was an international organ trafficking operation that also pulled in local and state politicians.</p>
<p>Did you notice that the reporters did not even have the guts to name the man who trafficked in children’s kidneys? Brian Williams and Katie Couric did not have the guts to say this organ trafficker’s name. His name is Levy Itzhak Rosenbaum and he admitted to “stealing” three kidneys in a plea bargain deal. This case should have opened the eyes for all to see that organ trafficking was operating in the open and prominent members of the community and politicians had involvement in the process.</p>

<p>The “Rest of the Story”</p>
<p>One might wonder if there is any proof to back up my suspicions that American children were being killed and their organs were being trafficked back to countries such as Israel and China?</p>
<p>Well, the United Nations Palermo Convention on human trafficking passed regulations related to human trafficking for organs. This UN agreement has been applied in prosecutions, for human trafficking in Brazil, South Africa, India, Moldova and other countries. The major purpose of the agreement was to prevent human traffickers, many of whom are surgeons, from “exploiting the bio-available bodies of immigrants, refugees, prisoners, the mentally deficient and others from being harvested while still alive”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/treaties/CTOC/">https://www.unodc.org/unodc/treaties/CTOC/</a> </p>
<p>Professor Nancy Scheper-Hughes (read Journal <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/300123">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/300123)</a>) stated that “Transplant trafficking has been going on for many years in the US, as it has elsewhere in the world. The individual cases in the Organs Watch research files run to the hundreds. Some of the victims of US organs trafficking are bonded servants from Syria and Jordan brought into the US to provide kidneys to their patron royal families from the Gulf States. The Cleveland Clinic has a transplant wing that for many years has catered to these so-called “transplant tourists.” UCLA had its heyday with wealthy Japanese Yakuka crime “family members” who were given priority for liver transplants from the UNOS waiting list, livers that technically belonged to US citizens”.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Clinic and UCLA? This leads any rational person to ask what the hell is going on? To those of you who have criticized me over your inability to believe that the elite are engaged in the widespread child sex trafficking, how would you explain away this evidence? If they will steal children’s kidneys, then why would they not traffic their bodies for sex?</p>

<p>The Most Evil and Vicious Occupation.</p>
<p>In India, it works there like any other place where they abduct children. In India, children are snatched off of the street, euthanized in a medical facility and their organs are taken. After the 2004 Indian tsunami, several foreign organ extraction teams suddenly showed up in the country in their chartered airplanes and pretended to lend humanitarian aid, but they were actually performing organ harvesting work on the orphans who had survived the tsunami that had taken their parents.

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Why hasn’t anyone asked the question as to why the federal government will pay a CPS organization approximately $5,000 per child that it takes away from its parents, more money is paid if the child is a minority or has a disability because the parents don’t always have the means to fight back? The child sex slavery ring and child organ harvesting trafficking begins with the federal government as they are paying CPS to seize children. Why does the federal government care if CPS seizes children? The answer should be obvious, this is the modern day version of the Selective Service Act and the subsequent drafting of our children for the right to prey upon their genitals and organs.</p>',

            You know I was in the dark to the whole Jew problem till Pizzagate.  Pizzagate became a rabbit hole from hell that upsets everything you thought you knew about the world.  The fact is EVERYTHING you have been taught is a lie.  Everything is fake.  This fact came as a major shock and earthquake to my sense of the world.  Black is White.  Up is down.  And the so called antisemitism is just a fake ass tool the Jew uses to control what we think and dare talk about.

            This is the source of America's problems. The UK decided ILLEGALLY to give Palestine to Jews, they had just as much right as Ireland giving India to Australia, it's fucking absurd. We were drug into WW1 and WW2 as a favor to the UK and in exchange Palestine was to be given to jewish control. Since then we have been false flagging and invading countries all to EXPAND Israel's dominance, it's not a Jew conspiracy it's an Israel problem, why are we funneling our resources to advance a country that's not the US, it's not in our best interest to be involved w/ Israel, if anything they are maximizing ME conflict. I say we throw our support behind Palestine, even Jesus said Israel would fall and I see no reason to defend an illegitimate country with the blood of our children so they can have the promised land. We are not a majority Jewish country and Israel has caused us nothing but bloodshed and poverty. Wake up, Israel isn't our friend and never has been.

             This un-conditional support for everything that Israel does is unfortunately supported by a huge proportion of the population, especially among Christian Evangelicals.  Trump's rabid embrace and adoration of Israel (at least publicly) was certainly a major in him winning the White House.

             The Pro-Israel bias is further propagated by many in the "mainstream" and "alternative" media.

             It is because they have bribed or blackmailed for more than 300 years.  They have crypto´d the English Crown.  They have crypto´d Saudi Arabia and Jordan.  Who knows how many families and politicans are actually crypto Jews?  But you know we have the technology with DNA to get to the bottom of all this once and for all.

            Public trust in any public institution should be at around 5% or less.  Abuse of power in every institution for personal gain is rampant, and it's costing lives of those without the means to speak for themselves.

            Well I am crying again.  This is so very horrible to read, but I cannot stop.  I must continue because as I am sure, many on here feel the same.  If we do not keep going, who will?  None of the Hospitals surprise me.  Especially Johns Hopkins.  Look up what they did to Henrietta Lacks. It is disgusting.  Also, do you think that Ben Carson knows none of this? I am not saying he is involved in this, but how can you not know when you are a registered hospital Brain Surgeon.  Forget about all of those trusted hospitals you thought were on the up and up, for you will be shocked which ones are involved in this heinous business.  All across the country, especially Children's  Hospitals will be compromised.  Also the holy of the most holy people that you so respect, those that decry what happens to children and the poor will also be involved.  Please help us research and dig into these places.

              Give it to citizen news journalists such as Project Veritas or anyone you follow on YouTube to get the word out. MSM will never report any of it so don't rely on them.

              They are hoping that we will start losing members and interest will wither and die just like the children.  We will not let them have that satisfaction.  They in the meantime are having their perverted pleasures.  We cannot give up.  We have to find that connection that can start putting one f the top leaders in a noose and report it to the FBI.  It seems like we sure have found many connections to a lot of the  organizations that represent children.  Maybe they just are not strong enough to hang these suckers yet.  Any Lawyers out there, what are our chances as of now?

               A little off topic -- it all ties together though--FBI Anon's latest short little interview

               Thought this was very interesting.  It all makes sense as Israel, CIA, Schumer, McCain KEEP coming up.  I don't yet understand where Jared Kushner falls in all this??  I am still not sure if Trump really believes Assad gassed his people.  Is he just playing along to "appease" the globalist pedophiles?

                Good article.  The American people are always kept out of the loop.  We are always left to question what is going on and who is doing what.  Yesterday at dinner people said they think Kushner is running the country.  I am so tired of armchair quarterbacks fed by the MSM.  I am sure that they would have bitten my head of if I had mentioned that the rebels gassed the people with the sarin.  I read a really good article of an interview of Seymour Hersh and it spelled it all out.  So many are listening to the Fake News talking heads, but completely discount the real journalists that we trusted years ago (and I am not talking about news casters).

                  We will probably not know what he believes. People that powerful never let you into their world or their brains. They keep us out of the loop.  They never want their enemies to know what they are thinking.  Their beliefs are known only to them and sometimes not even to those that are very close.
