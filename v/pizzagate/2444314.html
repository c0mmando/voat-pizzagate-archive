At this point, this witness will do or say anything to get out of the jam he is in. What kind of jam? How about the largest collection of child porn the world has ever seen. This foreign national is one of the richest members of the richest families of the world. For dozens of years he filmed boys as young as 3 having sex with grown men. There were thousands of these boys who worked as slaves during the day and then would be forced to have sex with grown men. All filmed. That slavery practice has ended, but the boys are still imported from other countries and still raped and it is all still filmed. The FBI found out about it and now are using its existence to get him to say whatever they want him to say. Apparently these people are so rich they have their own &quot;cloud&quot; which is highly encrypted where all these videos are stored. George Nader, top adviser to the United Arab Emirates, was arrested in 1985 on child pornography charges, is cooperating with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III</li>

            Hi AngryMimi. Could you add a headline to the top of your post (stick a "#" in front of the line of text) that explains more clearly the content and how this relates to PG, since your uneditable headline is so generic? Our submission rule #3 requires it. Something more specific like you'd see in a newspaper. Thanks!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm giving this our 24 Hour Removal Reprieve flair so you can do that.

            Interesting, Nadar, and Prince met in Seychelles and that is being investigated by Mueller. I recently did a report about child sex trade and money laundering in Seychelles that goes all the way up to Gov and Catholic Diocese...
