            . Thanks for posting this. Unfortunately, I have to remove it per Rule 6, because the community voted last year not to allow Share a Link submissions after someone direct-linked CP. Can you please repost this using the Discuss button, with the link and the screencap link and a brief description in the body of the submission? Much obliged.

             One of the recognizable flawed pattern of conspiratorial thinking is reinterpreting everything as further proof of the conspiracy. So if someone disproves obvious pizzagate nonsense, that just means that he feels guilty.

                   You are cherry picking a quote from an e-mail where in the context of inviting people at a visit to a farm, a woman "Tamera Luzzatto" mentioned her grandchildren or somehow related "Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   going the opposite of common sense and taking it out of the context of how boring parents talk about their kids, and interpreting in a deranged way where that woman is offering those children for a gang bang.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There is nothing pedophilic in that e-mail and the only eason to interpret it in such a sinister way is just so that you can make pizzagate work.

                     Yeah I think that instead of that woman using some grandma talk that sounded weird which is exactly why that e-mail was cherry picked, it's much more probable that women offered her grandchildren for sex and the children's mother and father were totally ok with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Come on dude...if you're reading that e-mail trough the suspicion of pizzagate looking to find anything that can be interpreted as pedophilic, you're obviously gonna interpret it that way. But looking at it unbiased, you have no reason to do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The handkerchief e-mail example is more baffling. Are you suppose to imply that instead of simply something like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     i.imgur.com/PaoJ8nY.jpg
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Podesta left some handkerchief stained by semen after abusing children and some realtor offered to mail it back to him, to which he replied by: "It's mine, but not worth worrying about"?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     All these examples are the product of pizzagaters cherry picking and looking at things trough the biased pizzagate lenses, and interpreting everything in a way that fits that narrative, no matter how absurd those interpretations are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Wikileaks published over 20,000 pages of emails. If the Podesta e-mails contained code words that an elite child sex ring used to communicate, you would expect to find dozens of examples of the same code words and establish a pattern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yet you pizzagaters always refer back to the same handful of cherry picked e-mails that don't even use the same supposed code words. One talking about a handkerchief, one about the game of dominoes, one about hot dogs and so on.

                       Unless you don't use your e-mail to comunicate with people, I highly doubt that. Those people used their e-mail to comunicate to one another. If I went trough your last 10,000 messages, I'm sure I'd be able to cherry pick lots of quotes that I could then take out of context.

                       Those 2 e-mail examples do not talk about dominoes on pizza or pasta, nor about pizza related napkins with maps on them.  You're inventing shit again so that it is easier for you to take it out of context.

                      <p>
                       And are based on the same taking cherry picked shit out of context strategy.

                       There's nothing stopping you from interpreting those few cherry picked e-mails in the most absurd possible way you'd like. The problem is that this is pure speculation that you have no way of proving, and it's basically useles.

                         Those 2 e-mail examples do not talk about dominoes on pizza or pasta, nor about pizza related napkins with maps on them. You're inventing shit again so that it is easier for you to take it out of context.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I wasn't referring to the Tamera Luzzato e-mail there, nor have I admitted that they sound like they were selling sex from their children, I specifically said that only by looking at it expecting to find something pedophilic, would you interpret it that way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So replying to this saying that you quoted the exact Tamera Luzzato e-mail doesn't make sense.

                        <p>
                         No there isn't. The only thing out of context is the deranged and illogical imagination of pizzagaters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Also, the reason why you are only quoting the Tamera Luzzato e-mail, and constantly use it as a reply to claims talking about the other e-mails, is probably because those other few cherry picked e-mail examples are even more obviously taken out of context and make even less sense.

                         If I went trought the last 10,000 messages from your corespondence I'm sure I'd be able to find tons of quotes to cherry pick and take out of context.

                        <p>
                         Wikileaks published over 20,000 pages of emails. If the Podesta e-mails contained code words that an elite child sex ring used to communicate, you would expect to find dozens of examples of the same code words and establish a pattern.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Yet you pizzagaters always refer back to the same handful of cherry picked e-mails that don't even use the same supposed code words. One talking about a handkerchief, one about the game of dominoes, one about hot dogs and so on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The cherry picked e-mail argument, in order for it to work was accompanied by lies about "FBI discovered pedophile code words" being found there, where pasta = little boy, map = semen etc.
                        </p>

                         LOL Distort facts and take "cherry picked" quotes out of context and interpret them in bizzare irational ways all you like, that won't get you anywhere. That's pure speculation that you have no way of proving and it's basically useless anywhere outside your conspiracy theory circle.

                                 That e-mail wasn't even sent directly to Podesta, but to a whole bunch of people(including Mary Podesta, his wife) in the context of inviting them at a visit to a farm.

                                 As I previously said, as you previously addmited, and as it is demonstrably true, there isn't anything pedophilic in that e-mail. Fact.

                                 Claiming that e-mail is about pimping children is(besides going the oposite of common sense) pure speculation that you have no way of actually proving. Fact.

                                                       Anyway this conversation has gone of the rails a long time ago. Technically it was off the rails since the very begging.

                                                       I suggest you take that one e-mail cherry picked out of tens of thousands to any police station or any institute that combats child trafficking and start explaining to them about your deranged interpretations of it. See how well that would go for you.
                                                      </p>

                                                       Of course you're not going to do that cause it's way easier to be irrational on a conspiracy theory forum, than actually putting your nonsense to the test and risk getting emberassed over it.

                             Yes I absolutely did, as seen here where I showed that "pizza in poor health and not expected to survive" doesn't exist and pointed out that there isn't anything pedophilic in the Tamerra Luzzatto e-mail, and you are simply speculating a deranged scenario which you have no way of proving.

                              Someone was obviously pimping children to Podesta.

                             <p>
                              It is NOT NORMAL to have emails like that, AT ALL.

                             <p>
                              There is no "cherry picking".  No normal person would have emails like that.

                              It is obvious she was pimping children to Podesta.  You even admitted it as I quoted above.
