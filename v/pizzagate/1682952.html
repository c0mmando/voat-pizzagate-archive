             and LaVey knew Sammy Davis Jr. , who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth into the Knights of Malta alongside Queen Elizabeth's  other black boyfriend Sidney Poitier.  Elizabeth has an obsessive sexual fetish for angry black males. She's made it her life's work.

             back when she was organizing the Manson hoax, worked for the 7th Psychological Operations Group out of The Presidio/Alameda Island
            </p>
            <p>
             well, back then she posed with LaVey, and Anton LaVEy was always posing with those corny little props crammed into the frame, his little devil horn costume and everthing, it never seemed realistic. every photo with six 'cult members' just standing around all crammed into one picture.
like this :  Does this look real too you, or like a photo shoot?

             the people who believe that these people killed Sharon Tate etc. grow up
            </p>
            <p>
             Sharon Tate murder was fake, like Jon Benet murder was fake, like Colombine, Sandy Hook , all of it.

             Cosby was a close friend of satanist  Sammy Davis Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact Cosby openly recognized Sammy Davis Jr. as  having been his mentor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sammy DAvis was a member of the Knights of Malta (AKA Sicilian Mafia) and the Church of Satan (AKA Pentagon psy-ops team which staged Manson hoax etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Sammy Davis Jr. worked for U.S. military intelligence in his traveling USO 'entertain the troops' roles during his WW2, Korea and Vietnam War days with Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
            </p>
            <p>
             A book by Sammy Davis Jr., his autobiography titled 'Yes I Can' , appears on the bookshelf of Rosemary in 'Rosemary's Baby':

             So we've got Bill Cosby in AHAB, meeting in Robert Ryan's apartment with Knighted black actor Sidney Poitier and others , in the same apartment where Rosemary's Baby was shot , featuring a book by good friend of Sidney Poitier's and mentor of Bill Cosby , Sammy Davis Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
             here's Sammy Davis jr. with Sidney Poitier and another of her black Templar boyfriends Harry Belafonte:

                 Lennon was tired of being so famous that he could not even go shopping, plus he was gay and faced being outed. He was into occult ritual group sex in NY before he split with his wife Yoko Ono. He'd basically gone completely gay , and so had she , when they split up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That whole Dakota building where they lived was into group ritual sex:

                 John Lennon lived in the same suite which Rosemary's Baby was filmed in. after Robert Ryan moved out he sold it to John Lennon:

                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lennon was heavy into the occult with Robert Ryan.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lennon in fact sublet an apartment which was attached as part of Ryan's gigantic three story suite atop The Dakota.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lennon lived there for a couple of years before Robert Ryan's wife died inside Ryan's part, and Ryan wanted to move out.  After Ryan's wife 
did , Lennon and Yoko made a formal application to the Dakota's co-op board to buy 
Ryan's entire estate there, and got past The Dakota's ban on selling to rock stars
by virtue of the fact that he had already discretely sublet part of Ryans' place for  years
without incident, and that he was settling down with pregnant wife Yoko there.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So Lennon was surely into the Templar sex rituals at the Dakota with Robert Ryan, as were depicted in Rosemary's Baby,.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yoko Ono still lives there in the same creepy place, because LEnnon's death downstairs was faked. As if she'd still be living there now if her husband had been assassinated outside downstairs.

                   There are numerous links confirming that John Lennon sublet part of Ryans place 
before buying Ryan's whole thing. If you look at a picture of what Yoko Ono lives in today, which used to be Robert Ryan's, it's like a gothic mansion sitting atop the rest of the building. That's really what it is. The suite is at the top, with all the little turrets and towers and things reaching into the sky as its upper floors above it. A little castle in the sky.

                    John Lennon and Yoko Ono famously lived at The Dakota Building on 1 West 72nd Street New York, NY 10023.  They initially sublet the apartment #72 from actor Robert Ryan and then eventually purchased it sometime after his death in 1973.

                   Where it becomes obvious that Lennon was living there , off and on , for years before that , is because Lennon and The Beatles were in close with the circle around Mia Farrow and Sharon Tate during the creation of the Manson hoax.
All indications are that Lennon was already staying there before he accompanied Mia Farrow to Rishikesh, right after she'd finished filming Rosemary's Baby in The Dakota. We can surmise that Lennon was living there when she was in there filming Rosemary's Baby, because they went to India together right after that.

                   this link says Lennon moved in there initially in 1970, which would be two years after Rosemary's Baby had been filmed there. But it was Ryan's guest house, essentially, so chances are he was there as a guest during the making of the film.

                   The odd part is that Robert Ryan was close in age to Frank Sinatra, and Ryan was a lover of Mia Farrow's mother, actress Maureen O'Sullivan.
                   <br/>
                   Sinatra and Ryan were due to star in a film together, which fell through, which proves they were both A-list Hollywood lead actors at the same time as Ryan was fucking Maureen O'Sullivan and Sinatra was fucking Maureen O'Sullivan's daughter, thirty years younger than him. Further , Ryan was STILL married to his own wife living with him in the Dakota, while bedding Maureen O'Sullivan in the building next door. So...what picture does this draw of Robert Ryan..he is openly sharing himself with two women who live in the same housing co-op , while his friend Frank Sinatra is sleeping with one of their daughters. Plus he's got bisexual John Lennon subletting his guest house suite at The Dakota. and having a film about an occult group of actors and their wives having group sex, filmed in his apartment. And the girl who plays the part of the young rape victim in the film is none other than the daughter of his lover, who is sleeping with his actor- pal Frank Sinatra, who is 30 years younger than  him. Further , it turns out that Farrow grew up in The San Remo , since she was a little kid, immersed in this whole scene with seven other children...

                    Bob Guccione (Caligula etc.)  type occult ritual sex taking place in the network of buildings encompassing The Majestic, The Dakota, The Langham, and The San Remo? Alluded to in Rosemary' Baby? Far fetched? Maybe not so far-fetched really , considering who is involved here. Then there is the blackmail aspect to consider and the rumors of ritual initiations being carried out to forever bind members to the group for fear of exposure.

                    Pedophocracy, anyone? Frank Sinatra was 51 when he married 21 yr. old Mia Farrow. Robert Ryan was set to co-star with Frank Sinatra in the film Honored Glory, which was never made:

                    Robert Ryan was only six years older than Frank Sinatra. So you've got Robert Ryan the lover of Mia Farrow's mother Maureen O'Sullivan, and Frank Sinatra the husband of Maureen O'Sullivan's daughter.
And all of them living in this Skull n' Bones occultist mafia housing Co-op....
Farrow's brother and sisters were immersed with her and John Lennon in TM etc. in Rishikesh.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Frank Sinatra was opposed to the whole Rosemary's Baby film project, and tried to force Mia Farrow to end her involvement in the film. He threatened to divorce her if she did not quit the film and famously divorced her right on the set of the film, presumably in The Dakota itself.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Could the film Rosemary's Baby have been loosely based on the real life of actor Robert Ryan?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Rosemary's Baby is about a young, aspiring actor who secretly agrees to join the occult elite in order to further his acting career , in order to 'make it' in the industry , so to speak. In fact he has to sacrifice his first-born child to them.

            I don't agree with the reasoning for Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick kept this movie a total secret. Cruz and Kidman had secrecy in their contracts. He made the movie in London while it takes place in NYC. Then Stanley died a strange quick cancerous death three weeks later. Read up on the making of the movie. Stanley was not one of them but told the sick stories in a way some just didn't understand. Like Clockwork Orange.

            Bill Cosby never drugged and raped woman and that has never been proven. What he said, and what the media twisted, was that he gave woman drugs for sex.  The media turned that into he drugged and raped woman.    Woman told Bill that they would fuck him for drugs.  Woman do this all the time.  He had drugs that they wanted and they took the drugs willingly and willingly had sex with him.  Also woman claim rape from millionaires all the time in order to get money from them.  The article doesn't mention any of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article is crap.  Tying people who lived where a movie was made to real life and fake news the media created about Bill Cosby.

             Cosby has been accused of the same thing by 58 people

             He started training as an army medical assistant when he was 17. To work on navy hospital ships. He apprenticed at just 18 and trained to administer drugs and prep people for surgery, to transport unconscious patients, to bathe them etc.  So here's this 18 yr. old randy black kid working with the taboo 1955 white women of Washington's elite, in residence , with access to the white female patients at Bethesda Naval Hospital in D.C., during the red-hot 50s civil-rights era. Figure he might have had a bit of fun with the drugged up unconscious wives of the Washington elite while working there? Think he may have lost his virginity under very 'unique' circumstances? Think his idea of what 'spanish fly' ideally would be like might be a little warped?

              Rosemary's Baby was about occult baby sacrifice.  By wealthy and prominent people connected to show business.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rosemary's Baby was filmed in the real life suite (in The Dakota)  of  Hollywood war movie actor Robert Ryan.
             </p>
             <p>
              The organization or coven which Cosby was a member of used the acronym AHAB .
             </p>
             <p>
              AHAB met, in real life,  in the apartment of Robert Ryan , the same place where Rosemary's Baby was filmed.
             </p>

               read?  ugh...oh, ok.  so the group or coven Cosby belonged to, AHAB, which met at the apt where Rosemary's Baby was filmed, named themselves after King AHAB, a nasty sonovabitch who was really into child sacrifice.

               <p>
                Hence the cult choosing the acronym AHAB, because they knew the rich occultist jews financing their occult machinations would be the only ones who would figure it out.
               </p>
               <p>
                And they were right . This was fifty years ago, and none of us figured out until now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Though Polanski was accused, at the time,  of making the cult in Rosemary's Baby seem Jewish. In particularly Dr. Saperstein, which is a Jewish name, and the character of Minnie Castavettes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rosemary's Baby is full of clues to the real life background of all of this.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fictional 'Castavettes' couple of 'Roman and Minnie Castavettes' were clearly in reference to the real life actor John Cassavetes , who played the role of Rosemary's husband in the film.
               </p>
               <p>
                Before anyone says that 's impossible, because the movie was based on the book by Ira Levin...
Rosemary's Baby is incredibly strange , because the movie rights were bought from Ira Levin before he had even published it. WTF?
here's the official story , which , imo , is probably a bogus cover for the fact that Rosemary's Baby was probably a screenplay and film FIRST, before it became the book, hence the 'fun' Levin had with the names in the book.

                 William Castle brought him the galley proofs of the book and asked him to purchase the film 
rights even before Random House released the publication. The studio head recognized the commercial potential of the project and agreed with the stipulation that Castle, who had a reputation for low-budget horror films, could produce but not direct the film adaptation.

                So , anyone ,
               </p>
               <p>
                tell me how in the F else we ended up with the coincidence that
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  the film was being conceptualized and financed etc. before the book it was purportedly based on had even been published.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  the book and film ends up with main characters with names  that are nearly exactly the same as the name of the actor hired to play arguably the main role in the film
                 </p>
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                ie : Greek actor  John Cassavetes plays the lead role in the film, while one of the main characters in the film is name 'Roman Castavettes'.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will tell you what I think went on here.  The jewish Hollywood guys who were making the film for William Castle  (and the London intel establishment who probably financed it) decided to embed some clues as to what was really going on. Because they knew the Jews were being set up as the fall guys.
So they call attention to this Greek name, the Greek actor John Cassavetes. When you look into who is who in London, you find out Queen Elizabeth married the King of Greece. Britain had essentially colonized Greece during the era of Queen Victoria. The British royals financed and  governed Greece prior to Queen Elizabeth marring Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Greek Eleusinian Mysteries cults are what Mi6 agent Aleister Crowley and the royals have been delving into dating to before John Dee. The British Knights Templar rites and occult knowledge encompass the Eleusinian Mysteries.  The royal bloodlines trace to the occult days of ancient Greece and Egypt and the Knights Templar reconstruction of the ancient knowledge.

               </p>
               <p>
                So was  Rosemary's Baby  a veiled 'exposé' of the royals involvement in Templar ritual sacrifice?
               </p>
               <p>
                Were  Polanski and Levin et al  trying to get the word out?
               </p>
               <p>
                Kubrick almost made Eyes Wide Shut the same  year, 1968, right after finishing his space fiction  movie 2001 Space Odyssey, but shelved the project when he saw the threats and things leveled at Polanski during the making of Rosemary`s Baby
               </p>
               <p>
                (threats from the Sicilian Mafia Knights of Malta AKA FRank Sinatra etc.)
               </p>
               <p>
                So the character name `Roman Castavettes' was possibly a tip off .
               </p>
               <p>
                Roman Castavettes = Italian Greek = Sicilian Templars?
               </p>
