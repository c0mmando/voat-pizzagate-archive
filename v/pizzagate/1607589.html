            The victim David Shurter doesn't have a lot of credibility. I'm not saying he's lying but I think he might be augmenting the truth. One interview he gave was with a reporter who later said he was smoking pot the entire time she was with him. That could be him self-medicating given the immense pain he's experienced. It could also mean something else. Let's put it this way, I highly doubt a prosecutor would ever put him on the stand in a case against a supposed pedophile. A defense lawyer would have a field day with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing that get's me about all this is rarely is someone ever fabricating 100% of the story. There's probably parts that are for real and that's what's disturbing.

             Yeh.  I'm trying to stay neutral but it's hard not to believe something happened since his story was out there long before pizzagate.  As for the weed, if what he claims happened to him and what he claims he did to children is really true then I'm thinking drugs to numb the pain might be necessary.  Seriously - his testimony is the most horrific one that I've read.  It's so horrible that it really is very hard to believe.  I just don't know what to think.  I wish some of these victims would have pictures.  I wouldn't want to see them, but pictures would solidify pizzagate.  No one could deny that as proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm really really hoping that the huge file of videos and images found on huma and wieners laptops has the proof needed.  And I'm praying that it doesn't get swept under the rug.  My biggest fear is that solid proof is there but that law enforcement is going to be forced to destroy it

              "but pictures would solidify pizzagate".....According to Robert Boyce of the NYPD those pictures do exist somewhere in the 650,000 emails they found on Weiner's laptop in a folder named "life insurance".

               Yes.  But like we've seen so many times while investigating, they destroy evidence or keep it from being exposed at least.  If it's in the hands of ONLY law enforcement, I'm worried it will never be used to prove it.  Hopefully Assange has the proof too

                "hands of ONLY law enforcement".......Robert Boyce said if no one at the FBI or DoJ do anything he'll leak them himself. I have no doubt that Boyce and the NYPD will do the right thing. If they don't address ALL of the crimes in that 650,000 they'll just leak everything unredacted. The Democrats made many enemies in Law Enforcement these past 8 years. The chickens have come home to roost. Muahahahahhaaa

             I also don't think he's lying but the years of torture and abuse have almost certainly damaged his mind. When you've seen children murdered in front of you, when you've experienced unspeakable things from people who are supposed to be your family then I'm sure one horror blurs into another eventually - even after you've dissociated.

             I personally think he's telling the truth about Scalia but I have nothing I can point to and say why I do. But the truth is coming soon.

              " telling the truth about Scalia".......Have you seen the evidence connecting John Podesta to Scalia death? Someone writes to Podesta about "wet-works" which is a term for assassination. That's not the disturbing part though. Another email about investing in a screen play refers to an image on the Smithsonian web site and there's a line pointing exactly where Scalia was murdered. The line is part of a label for some innocuous thing. I don't remember the exact text but you can find it if you look.

            Just saw his wife (introduced) live tonight when Trump introduced his SCOTUS pick. Felt sorry for her remembering all this stuff. We used to go out to that area on vacation.

             I do not feel sorry for any pedophile's wife or husband if they know what they are doing.  There kids are a different story. If you have 8 kids with them and live with them all of that time do not tell me that they have never one time wondered.  They were OK with no autopsy? They know.

              Maybe battered wife syndrome, hard to understand unless you've lived through it. Abuse in a family is one thing, sadistic stuff outside is another. Who knows what she knew, she was probably quite submissive in the relationship. I have no problems in believing Scalia was no good. Was he cremated (besides no autopsy)? In TX no autopsy is illegal, but Poindexter and friends could pull it off.

               Well, I was in a very abusive relationship but would never have put up with that.  You are right about Poindexter having the strings to put it off.  I am sure the elites and royals that visit that ranch would be happy to help out.

                Sorry you had to go through something like that. It's weird, some victims get angry and strike back, others just accept it and move along. I guess it depends the extent of the abuse. Did you read Mackenzie Phillips' book? She forgave her dad, but then he never was violent, he was one sick dude.

                I've know families who've been through this. It's easier for a traumatized and submissive and fearful wife just to keep it all quiet. Depends on one's personality too. 
Anybody that belongs to one of these elite secret clubs is def suspect. No autopsy really made me mad. You have to remember that if they have power to halt an autopsy then they have power to keep people quiet. I know I myself would be scared to death. There was wholesale slaughter of witnesses and investigators after the JFK hit and no one came to their 'rescue.'

                     Well, about the sex trafficking, etc. with the Clintons and Bushes, etc.  about 3 mos.  About the two parties about a year now and have been convinced there is something fishy about both parties about six years now.  We could have all had cheaper medicine if we had passed Bernie Sanders Drug Plan but both sides voted it down.  We could not convince one person to back down which would have at least tied the vote.  Two votes and we would have had it.  That is why I believe we need to end this being for one party or the other and Bernie Hillary and Trump people need to band together and stand strong against these horrible votes.  Which one of us would not want cheaper drugs?  They have divided us for a purpose.

              No, we would go through Marfa which is right by the hotel there, on the way to Big Bend. Couple times. Anyone can stay there but it's pretty remote and w/ the Scalia stuff it reminds me of Hotel California. Spooky and I wouldn't stay there now though I would have before, but it's quite pricey.

              A google review:  "Unless you are a Supreme Court Justice at odds with a maniacal President with a God complex,  this would be a great place to chill.  Pillows are nice and fluffy.  Perfect for placement on the face of a heart attack victim."

              South and West TX are popular w/ the elite for hunting, south TX is where Cheney accidentally shot and wounded his friend.

                Just another note, it is hard to imagine how wide open and remote this area is unless you've been there. It's amazing. So there's plenty of room to keep the tourists (if they get many) and others quite separate.
