<p>Alleged child rapist on the run was an Army scout, Iraq veteran</p>
<p>David Hamilton Jr., 47, of Lower Southampton Township in Bucks County, may be driving a white 2016 Toyota Avalon -- similar to the pictured vehicle -- with a Pennsylvania license plate of PD3759P. Facing 12 counts of child sexual abuse, Hamilton was recently seen in Solebury Township. (Courtesy photo | For lehighvalleylive.com) </p>
<p>Authorities stressed the importance Wednesday afternoon of finding a stolen car they believe a fugitive charged with child rape may be using, as he continues to elude investigators.</p>
<p>David Allen Hamilton Jr., 47, of Lower Southampton Township in Bucks County, is a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Army and was a Cavalry scout who served two tours in Iraq, township police Chief Ted Krimmel revealed. He said the information on Hamilton\'s background came anecdotally from friends and family of the suspect.</p>
<p>Local and federal investigators described the car reported stolen Wednesday morning in the New Hope area of Bucks County as a white Toyota Avalon with Pennsylvania license plate PD3759P. </p>
<p>The car was stolen from the 200 block of Bobwhite Road in the Fox Run Preserve neighborhood of Solebury Township in Bucks County. It belonged to a neighbor of a woman accused of helping Hamilton to hide out from Friday night or early Saturday through Tuesday night. </p>
<p>The woman, Meredith Custodio, was arrested Wednesday on charges of hindering apprehension, police announced at a news conference. Familiar to Hamilton, Custodio was the caregiver to a 78-year-old woman living in Fox Run and is believed to have sheltered Hamilton in the elderly woman\'s home. </p>
<p>Detectives developed information Custodio knew Hamilton and visited the house two times, Friday and Tuesday. She denied knowledge of Hamilton\'s whereabouts, police said. She was charged after police investigated the stolen car report next door, and sent to Bucks County prison in lieu of 10 percent of $150,000 bail.</p>
<p>Authorities on Wednesday also released a surveillance photo that shows Hamilton purchasing a white tent with red top Sept. 15 from the Oxford Valley Target, according to Robert Clark, a supervising deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service based in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&quot;He\'s got clean clothes, obviously some money and a vehicle so he\'s mobile and he can go anywhere,&quot; Solebury Township police Chief Dominick Bellizze told reporters Wednesday at the township building. &quot;I don\'t know if he\'s still in the area or not.&quot;</p>
<p>On the run from authorities since last Wednesday, Hamilton is believed to be hiding out in woods along the Delaware River separating Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>&quot;He has the tent, he\'s camping out, he has the Army background,&quot; Bellizze said. &quot;We believe he may be down by the river in a wooded area like he was before. That\'s why we\'re concentrating a lot of our efforts there.&quot;</p>
<p>Hamilton is charged with the rape of two young girls, described as relatives of each other but not of him. Law enforcement has been watching the victims and their family, including visiting their school daily, as Hamilton continues to elude investigators.</p>
<p>&quot;We\'re confident they\'re going to be OK&quot; while Hamilton remains on the loose, said Kimmel, the Lower Southampton chief. </p>
<p>Investigators ask anyone who sees the stolen Toyota sedan or the white tent with red top to call the U.S. Marshals tip-line at 866-865-8477 (TIPS) or 911.</p>
<p>The Marshals Service is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading directly to Hamilton\'s arrest. </p>
<p>&quot;It\'s imperative for us right now to find that vehicle,&quot; Clark said. &quot;It gives us a starting point of where Mr. Hamilton may be. And it\'s just important for the public to be vigilant to try and locate that vehicle and also if they\'ve seen that tent any time in the last week ... I\'d ask the public to be vigilant in reporting that tent if they\'ve noticed that.&quot;</p>
<p>Police described Hamilton as dangerous and possibly armed. In addition to raping two children, he fought with a New Hope police officer on Friday and tried to steal the officer\'s firearm before fleeing, authorities said.</p>
<p>An archery hunter spotted Hamilton in the woods Friday and supplied photos of him to investigators.</p>
<p>Authorities do not anticipate having to limit recreational activities in the search area, and say hunters may be of assistance if they see Hamilton, the stolen car or the tent. A heavy law enforcement presence aims to keep the public safe during the manhunt.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t think it\'s unsafe to be out and about,&quot; Bellizze said. &quot;As I said, I\'d keep my eyes open.&quot;</p>
<p>Marshals on Friday wrapped up a three-month manhunt that led to the arrest in Ohio of Shawn Christy, the New Jersey native and Pennsylvania resident accused of threatening President Donald Trump and other officials.</p>
<p>&quot;We\'re well-versed in rural searches, long-term searches,&quot; Clark said. &quot;The Marshals Service specializes in finding sex offenders. So we believe we\'re prepared and we\'re up to the task and we hope to bring Mr. Hamilton into custody as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

When we reduce debt at the treasury ..universal jurisdiction will be enforced by the US marshals..who will be instructed by the surety to enforce worldwide jurisdiction upon elements that r visitng terror and being accomplices to it..

At the moment the deep state controls the war on terror..by proxy..as a result of the surety being at sleep..
Its called word war iii....

            , if all you've got connecting this creep to elite child trafficking is that he was enlisted in the armed forces, we're going to have to remove this per Rule 1. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace to see if you can turn anything else up. Was he an officer?

             I am working on it.  I was under the impression since he could use his being an  Army Vet as a grooming tool. Having been a former vet surely can cause people especially parents to think highly of him.

             The suspect “is a 20-year U.S. Army veteran with cavalry and ordnance experience,” the alert says.

              Look for any vet serving as military police 2003-2004 at the Abu Ghraib Iraqui prison where in addition to abusing adults detainees, mothers had to watch their children  being raped.

              </a>
              Not saying all were involved but the prevailing environment was corrupt. When there is an Iraqui tour US vet charged with domestic child sex crimes, there is a reasonable question as to what type of activities that vet was involved in overseas.

               Possibly they send those kind of guys there on purpose.  Rapists already in practice.  It's not too impossible to think about.  They are cold and calculating and evil.

            Wonder why the police didn't mention if he was armed. 20 year veteran, two tours of Iraq has probably some firearms in the house?

             The odd thing to me was that they said he tried to wrestle the gun away from a LE Officer.  As you say, would he not have a gun or arms of some kind.  I agree.  He has bought camping equip. and is probably camping in the woods.  Someone did see him and snapped some pictures.  This reminds me of a guy they were looking for a guy that kidnapped a girl and took her into the hills and forest and they looked for quite some time until a couple saw them in the woods and reported it.  Hopefully someone will call in a very good tip.  The two girls he allegedly raped, I am sure they are not the only ones.  The parents know him too, so possibly he is an old friend or groomed them too.  smh  They always trick them first.

            LOWER SOUTHAMPTON TWP, Pa. — A Bucks County man who was “gifted” a 14-year-old girl from a Lancaster County couple years ago was charged with raping and abusing her five sisters, prosecutors announced Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lee Kaplan, 51, of Feasterville, now faces 15 total sexual assault charges, according to Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub. Kaplan was arrested in June after investigators learned he fathered two children to a girl, now 18 years old, which was given to him by Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus of Colrain Township in Lancaster County. Monday’s additional charges centered on allegations Kaplan also abused five of the girl’s younger sisters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus are facing child endangerment charges for their role in “gifting” their children to Kaplan, but will not face any additional charges, Weintraub said. Police say the former Amish couple gave away their daughter to settle a financial debt with Kaplan.
           </p>
           <p>
            WOW.   Bucks County seems to be having a real problem with a lot of sexual abuse cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the Furry Parties?    SICK.

I don't know if it is connected to this case but that is a Red Flag if I ever saw one.    I believe it has been turned into a Recreation Center.

              It is alleged that when Kaplan met Daniel and Savilla Stoltzfus in 2002 the couple were leaving the Amish faith and struggling financially.

              There are some really wicked Amish people in pockets here and in Mexico as well.  This sounds like he was trying to formulate some kind of family cult.  Evil man.

               They fly under the radar. No birth certificates or SS #, children born at home, schooled at home.Stoltzfus had dog kennels. Was he raising children in the same manner?

                Ugh.  Reminds me a little of the Turpin Family with the 12 children that were locked up and tortured.   There is more of this going on than we think, imo.
