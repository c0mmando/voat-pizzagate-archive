<p>&quot;The Disturbing Meaning of Poppy’s “Time is Up”</p>
<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/the-disturbing-meaning-of-poppys-time-is-up/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/the-disturbing-meaning-of-poppys-time-is-up/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lead-that-poppy-times-up3.jpg">https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lead-that-poppy-times-up3.jpg</a></p>
<p>&quot;Poppy is crossing over from YouTube to the mainstream. Unsurprisingly, her video “Time is Up” is one of the most blatant celebrations of Illuminati MKULTRA ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Time is Up&quot; A very strange name for a song.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg2pS9KN28U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg2pS9KN28U</a></p>
<p>From the article</p>
<p>&quot;oppy has been creeping out people on since 2015 on YouTube with hundreds of bizarre, surrealist and hypnotic videos. In my article “That Poppy”: The YouTube Star Under Illuminati Mind Control, I explained how her entire act revolves around MKULTRA. Indeed, nearly every video on that channel addresses a different facet of mind control as Poppy speaks to the camera in a robotic matter. Also, peppered throughout the videos, are lots of subtle yet unmistakable nods to satanism. In short, Poppy is 100% in-line with the agenda of the occult elite.</p>
<p>Poppy is also a recording artist signed with Island Records. She will soon release a second studio album entitled Am I a Girl? and embarking on a second world tour of the same name. And this time, the media push is strong. Indeed, slowly but surely, she is crossing over to the mainstream and is poised to become a household name.</p>
<p>Mainstream Exposure
When I first wrote about Poppy in 2017, she was a viral phenomenon with millions of YouTube views. However, she was still fairly unknown to the general public. This will probably change soon as she’s been getting that sweet media exposure that is usually reserved to the world’s biggest stars. And you better believe that everything about her is still focused on Illuminati mind control.&quot;</p>
<p>This is her official tour photo. MKUltra checkerboard and a monarch looking outfit.</p>
<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poppy-ama-2018-768x1152-e1539806439712.jpg">https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Poppy-ama-2018-768x1152-e1539806439712.jpg</a></p>
<p>&quot;Time is Up&quot;</p>
<p>he lyrics of this song and the imagery of the video are 100% about Poppy being a mind control slave. While there are also allusions to her being some kind of AI robot, the video implies that she’s a girl who has been fully dehumanized through programming.</p>
<p>The first frame of the video says it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poppy_time_is_up1.jpg">https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poppy_time_is_up1.jpg</a></p>
<p>The video begins with Poppy laying on a bed, inside what looks like a stylized cell. She is hooked to a machine that monitors her vital functions. Robots don’t have vital functions. The video is about a human under MKULTRA.</p>
<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poppy_time_is_up2.jpg">https://vigilantcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/poppy_time_is_up2.jpg</a></p>
<p>She has electrodes connected to her head. Her mind is literally under control.</p>

<p>Poppy is monitored by a handler played by Diplo.</p>
<p>The lyrics of the first verse could not be more blatantly about MKULTRA:</p>
<p>&quot;In the factory
In the sterile place where they made me
I woke up alone
Dizzy from the programming
Have I been wiped again?
Oh my God, I don’t even know&quot;</p>',

            Poppy and Titanic have copied Mars Argo, who has now sued them.  This comment:

             Poppy and Titanic literally harassed Mars out of every project she tried to do for years and most of her old content has been removed, so of course her work isn't as popular

             Yes,and now Mars Argo is saying he was extremely emotionally/psychologically and physically abusive to her. Poppy is responding saying it's all a lie, but that she herself is a survivor of abuse. Wait, it gets even weirder.... Poppy is saying that Mars Argo is now purposely dating Poppy's previous abuser.

            I actually think this IS a hybrid trans human. It’s too odd for her to be a real person I don’t believe she is. I’ve heard so much about cloning and whatnot that this fits the narrative to a tee. Why wouldn’t they bring out a trans human to fuck with everyone? DARPA had this technology for quite some time. YouTube only? That’s odd enough. Remember 2030 is fast approaching and apparently we won’t even have gas powered home features like stoves and heat any longer, nor gas powered vehicles, no gas stations.

            Don't watch TV or listen to new music, but I know the industry producing this garbage promotes occult symbolism and MKUltra imagery. Why would you think anybody in the business is "exposing" the system? They are running it under the normies nose like they always do. You do not teach people about things through videos. You explain what is going on. Graduate past this stuff kids.

            She’s only somewhat talented, so she and her artsy fartsy boyfriend are trying ingratiate themselves into the “Illuminati” Hollywood culture they’re fully aware of thanks to websites like Vigilant Citizen. They’re saying, “look, we’re using your gang-sign symbolism out videos, please love us.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, they’re satarizing the symbolism.

            Hi Mods, if possible, can y'all flag this with something like "possible trigger warning (SRA &amp;/or others)" ? This is my first time hearing of Poppy, but a quick scan of some of links (just the images alone) scream trauma-based programming &amp; mind control abuse to me. I myself am not a victim, but see plenty here that could potentially trigger someone.

             Does the same to me I can't watch them.  There is something weird going on there just don't know what it is.  Sublimal crap maybe?  Same thing happened when my son showed me some weird colored videos on youtube awhile ago that were posted by the finders- it was the finders that lead it to him. He is an adult and researches all the finders stuff that he can find as well as the Franklin stuff.
