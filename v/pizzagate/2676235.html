Adrenochrome is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO3, produced by the oxidation of adrenaline.  Adrenochrome is formed when the body\'s adrenaline (epinephrine) oxidises.  It is harvested from the human pineal gland that is located in the brain.  When a donor is &quot;terrorized,&quot; more adrenaline is pumped into the blood.  Killing at the peak of terror ensures purity/higher quantity of adrenochrome in the blood for cosumption. It is extracted through a needle at the base of the neck/spinal column. There is evidence from past posts that child sacrifices have occurred to obtain this substance.</p>
<p>I came across all of this info by accident a few days ago from a twitter post.  As the website adrenochrome.net states, if unable to be consumed fresh, is stored frozen or refrigerated.  Once collected, the chemical was sold on the black market for exorbitant prices.  Now, anyone can purchase, because adrenochrome is now a cryptocurrency, for swifter payment and swifter production of adrenochrome.  ADC coin, as it is called, is available on most cryptocurrency ERC20/altcoin trading sites.  ADC altcoin  can be purchased with Ethereum.  Due to the decentralized nature of the Ethereum blockchain, ADC altcoin allows anonymous participation in a growing aand highly lucrative global trade of Adrenochrome.</p>
<p>The website further states that Adrenochrome ADC altcoin allows everyday cirtizens to profit from the sourcing, harvesting, and consumption of fresh adrenochrome.  ADC coin is managed by the Adrenochrome Foundation, providing new opportunities for beautiful, talented children and adolescents to sacrifice their youth elixir for the greater and exponential health of the elites.</p>
<p>The very next paragraph then states that the Adrenochrome Foundation is a pure fabrication by visual artist Natalie Lambert, so I am not sure what is real and what is not.

<p>The only word I can use to describe Natalie Lambert is a whacko.  Born in 1984, she lives and works in London.  In August 2017, she was interviewed by another artist and a curator about the power of meme and the #pizzagate movement.  Her artwork has been censored in the past.  She reminds me of Abramowich.  She says this about her pizzagate &quot;art&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Pizzagate is a curated braindump; a redacted (black) pizzabox containing tweets, emails, links, documents, photographs, code keys, and memes printed onto transparent paper which allows for the information to bleed into each other.  I resisited the temptation to map it on a wall, instead inviting the viewer to sift, sort, explore, and make connections (or not).  Pizzagate is a metaphor, a fantastical narrative of the (real) corruption of elites.  It\'s intended to be both appealing and repulsive, a liminal space which incorporates a flux of fact, fabrication, fantasy, and perverted invention.&quot; 
 <a href="https://www.isthisitisthisit.com/natalie-lambert">https://www.isthisitisthisit.com/natalie-lambert</a></p>
<p>The current focus of Lambert\'s practice is &quot;Adrenochrome,&quot; a visual art project and display which has launched at the CSM degree show this year.  CSM (Central Saint Martins) is a public tertiary art school in London.  Lambert has set up an exhibition stand which morphs into an Adrenochrome harvesting chamber which serves as the launch sight for the Adrenochrome ICO (initial coin offering).  Anonymous purchase of ADC coin, in the format of a small artwork (at a fixed price), is possible therough the CSM shop.  After the show, the ADC goes live on the cryptocurrency trading market, where buyers can trade ADC coin and watch its value rise and fall dependennt on subsequent transactions.

            To my knowledge, these have not been established as "facts". You need to link to genuine support (not just someone's claim on a blog or tweet) for each of the claims you've made here. This topic has been one of the biggest BS vectors we've had to contend with here, so we need our ducks in a row when we discuss it. Either link up some solid support for these "facts", or rephrase everything to emphasize they are unproven claims that may be disinfo to fool the truth community. I'm giving this the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit. If that is too much trouble, you can repost this as is in

             , please undersatnd that this afternoon I have assumed the roles of both chemist and neurosurgeon rather than practicing piano, harvesting herbs, and going to the grocery store as I planned.  Based on the subject matter, this was a difficult task that you presented.  Look for the added info in an hour or less, presented at the end of my post with the hope of being "vindicated."

              Thank you for taking on that challenging task, 13B. :-) It's hard to get people to make serious research posts on this topic. You did a great job showing that the pineal gland could be accessed directly. I have two unresolved issues that haven't been addressed.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the items in your list of "facts" is "There is evidence from past posts that child sacrifices have occurred to obtain this substance." You've given no supporting links for that and I myself have seen no posts showing evidence of adrenochrome related child sacrifices. You can either add the links, or edit it out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, you describe as "fact" a process in which high blood levels of adrenaline are harvested via a needle from the pineal gland, yet the research you posted in Part 2 says the body protects the pineal gland from adrenaline in the blood, so that doesn't really hold up:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The stress-related surges of adrenal gland adrenaline and noradrenaline secreted into the blood, never get to the pineal. The pineal security system, made up of "vacuuming" nerve cells, simply cleans-up the blood-borne adrenaline and noradrenaline in an incredible efficient manner.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I think you should edit so you are not claiming this as "fact" but as theory and mention there are many remaining questions about it. Otherwise, we will have to flair this as "Possible Disinfo". I'm speaking of these specific elements of the larger post, not the cryptocurrency or the art show.

            IMPORTANT.  Knowing absolutely nothing about cryptocurrency, some answers are needed.  I happened to stumble upon this patreon site that is some type of forum, and a post was about THETA being at 8.5 cents.  Scroll down the replies a little bit, it's a short list, and you will see a reply from "AW" which reads:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Joe, an Anon for Q just found a token ADC Adrenochriome...on the twitter page is George Soros, Media Matters, David Brock, Chelsea Clinton.  This isn't going to get good publicity soon.  I'll send it to you via twitter."

             From what I can tell,  the user on the comment page is just warning the site owner that ADC seems to be connected to the pedocult and warning them to sell before the public gets wind if they own any add.
            </p>
            <p>
             Adc itself does seem a bit sus. The volume of trading indicates that it is certainly being traded to the tune of 59,000 transactions in the past 5 days but the first time I've heard of it is when someone posted about it on here the other day. I'm going to keep my eyes open regarding this crypto and see what else comes out of the ether.

              .  At first, I questioned whether this cryptoocurrency was fabricated, a concept, which was part of  Lambert's  art exposition.   That is not the case, however.

              Any additional info would be appreciated, as much controversy, and rightfully so, exists here on pizzagate.

            I am an artist and a filmmaker and I look at the quality of this site and the video that she put out and I question where did she get the money to do this elaborate 'hoax' if it is a hoax. We are currently getting bombarded with 'jokes' and in your  ace ridicule. Also, I went to the Vatican over 10 years ago and couldn't understand why the largest sculpture there was one of the Pine Cone or The Pineal Gland. 
Something else somewhat unrelated is the new dance production called MKULTRA making a mockery out of MKULTRA.

             Your observation of sophisticated resources being used on this woman's site, along with Vindicator's above comment regarding Adrenochrome being one of the biggest b.s. vectors  here are GLARING bits of evidence of the probable validity of this whole Adrenochrome matter.

             An astute observer to JFK's assassination by the Clowns can see the many tactics used to discredit any reasonwble questioning in the ensuing decades.
One method was to unleash a plethora of "researchers" of eccentric demeanor.
Another was to put forth "experts" to discredit  the clearly observable, public facts.

              Right on, Satanic Panic is a perfect thing to cite. Even Wikipedia claims Ritual Abuse was( renamed by them) Satanic Ritual Abuse and of course, wikipedia references the satanic panic from the 80's, which to honest, I don't remember any satanic panic at all except when reading about court cases involving ritual abuse, they always called as witnesses or experts The False Memory Sydrome Foundation people. It was a C.I.A. front! Funded by them and most of the directors were later brought up on pedophilia charges including one guy whose daughter claims he raped her for years!!! Much more on these directors including an article from The Netherlands where one of them speaks glowingly about pedophilia and how it should be legal!! 
Wow, these are the scum that prove satanic panic?? Yes, if you have a chance, research the f%$k out of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. They should be locked in cages and tortured all day long for what they have done.

               These are very dangerous people
              </p>
              <p>
               maybe go the way you would with a rabid animal
              </p>
              <p>
               then go for the head, who controls them
              </p>
              <p>
               to me its murder, plain and simple, murder of a childs soul
              </p>
              <p>
               I sometimes wonder if the lucky ones are the died ones, cruel I know, but my heart aches for these children
              </p>
              <p>
               and sometimes these children become abuser themselves
              </p>
              <p>
               damn,  this shit is so sick, I don't know if I should cry or scream
              </p>
              <p>
               fuck just fuck
              </p>
              <p>
               guess my body decided to cry
              </p>
              <p>
               I am so sorry you have to go through this, and there's not a damn thing I can do for you

             another gland they may use is the thymus gland in the chest, I've seen articles where Doctors take it out without parents ok or give some fluff excuse

            Says a FERRY goes right to Keystone    WELL, is that what steered you to the connection to Ketron Island and the stolen plane?  The Ferry going to the Island.  Are they doing the same thing there as Keystone?  Just Wondering.

            The twitter post, as I mentioned earlier, is where all of this started, and it contains a lot of info. Someone posted several pics of what possibly could be an adrenochrome factory in British Columbia or art depicting adrenochrome manufacturing and correlating it with the location of that stolen plane crash that occurred last week.

             When I looked at the aerial photos of that plane crash it looked just like Flight 93 from the 911 crash. Hole in the ground but no plane. Check out the aerial photos. Does not look like a plane crash to me.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             When a plane crashes it does NOT disintegrate into pieces so small that the plane is gone. There is always a fuselage, wings, tail, etc...no matter how damaged it should be there.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             There was nothing on the ground but a black spot and some VERY small scattered debris. Not normal.

              I agree.  This is another head scratcher.  I am asking how this correlates.  Why would someone make such a statement.  It just didn't fade into thin air.  Or did it.  It totally disappeared to where?  If it did not land or crash on the ground where is it and he?  And why did he say all those things to only disappear and why is his family playing along.  A total mess.

               As far as I know he crashed into the island because he either ran out of fuel or didn't know how to properly land. Another interesting point is that next to ketron island is a place called McNeil island, where they send sexual predators of the worst kind. Literally the entire island is full of violent sexual predators. Idk how useful this is, just a little tidbit. I've lived here my whole life and never heard of ketron island, same for many people I know here.

                Wow.  Have an UpVoat!  Thank you for that info about McNeil Island.  How odd and possibly a factor.

                  They make doctor trips, tons of them taking prisoners off the island for tests and such.  It's amazing.  I wonder if there are other reasons the are allowed to leave.

                   I hear that a good portion of them are aging and don't quote me on this but they have used like 16 million in state resources for medical treatment, I think I read this in the Tacoma news tribune a while back. Not sure how helpful that is but I found it interesting.

                    Yes and I believe there has been outcry over it.  That is a steep amount.  Also I saw pics of them living in small rms and not cells.  This is a haven for pedos.  No suffering.  They said that when people left to take patients off the island for dr. trips, some were stealing fruit and making alcohol.  They have garden visits too.  I wonder if they taken them on other visits as well.  Is this a place where certain people can visit an island that keeps children?  They are they only prisoners there now, the other section was closed down due to backlash.

                   No, I have been lurking since all other platforms for pizzagate were banned. I live in the area, and ketron island wasn't something I was aware of even after 20+ years.

                     A lot of people really have no idea this is as pervasive as it is, as they like to say to me "I'm sure some people are involved, but not (insert name of politician and/or celebrity)" no one wants to believe it because it's uncomfortable. I would hope the Catholic Church is bringing more people to the truth, they are really getting it now and hopefully it all gets exposed.

             I did a lot on PP ,  That was so bad, I never did go back to it,  some of the articles gave good examples, but its what they werent saying that bothered me
            </p>
            <p>
             nana66 mentioned addiction to it, which would explain all the children
            </p>
            <p>
             never could figure out why they needed so many, and would be easy getting blood in war zones
            </p>
            <p>
             also read where Obama carried AB neg on him and that Kerry got stopped at an airport with blood
            </p>
            <p>
             is this blood infused?
            </p>
            <p>
             also remember 2 people who wore blood in vials around their necks
            </p>

              It also says that this connects to the stolen airplane that crashed at Kreton Island.  Could they be doing this there, frightening the kids and extracting? Seriously,  I am getting very ill.

                Oh no.  I have not slept well either with this cold.  It is winding down thank God.  I found a small connection with Alaska too.  The guy that bought Ketron Island his last name was Morris and he came from Anchorage Al.   I have yet to find where in Alaska Russell came from.  He was born in Fla and moved to Alaska when he was 7.   I think he found out something really sick and awful.  Possibly he saw kids at the airport and found they were being taken on the Ferry to Ketron Island.  Did he ever go there?  Was he taken there as a child?  Idk but something sick is going on there, imo.

            You can find many places that sell adrenochrome, because you don't "harvest" adrenochrome.  You can make it in a lab quite easily.  Adrenaline has been synthesized for over a 100 years.  You then mix it with a oxidizer.    It's used for medical purposes when folks have issues with blood clotting, I believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who have tried to get high of it, say it's a waste of time.   Way better highs from more common drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a big zero as a scandal, an urban legend.

             remember once I gave some of my pain pills to a friend till she got hers in the mail
            </p>
            <p>
             when I took hers they did nothing, she wanted to trade more, I said hell no

            <p>
             you ever been sick and took a generic NyQuil?
            </p>
            <p>
             no sleep, where Nyquil helps you sleep so your not so cranky next morning because you did get sleep
            </p>
            <p>
             once when I twisted my ankle Doc gave me Vicodin script
            </p>
            <p>
             pharmacy didnt have generics so they gave me brand, BIG difference between the two
            </p>
            <p>
             so I dont agree with your take
            </p>
            <p>
             how would you know if they are human or animal?
            </p>
            <p>
             course I dont know if there's a difference but would think an animals gland would max out before a human because they grow faster
            </p>
            <p>
             moral of the story, brand drugs are much better then generics

              This has nothing to do with generic drugs, nor does it have to do with animal or human glands.  You can make adrenochrome in a purely synthetic process.  All you need to do is oxidize adrenaline and creating adrenaline in a lab is technology that is over 100 years old.  And Pharmaceutical adrenaline is widely available.
