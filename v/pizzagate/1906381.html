I came to this conclusion from my studies in my Environmental Science degree and from studies I found on my university’s website, which unfortunately I cannot provide a direct link to.</p>
<p>First, I would like to point out that it is possible to use light to affect neurons; it is possible to depolarize (turn on) and inhibit (turn off) neurons.  This often involves some sort of genetic manipulation (I’ll discuss this later).  This is known as optogenetics.  Here is an overview (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics)</a>).</p>
<p>This 2003 study I found on my school’s database (Effect of Sensory Feedback on Immediate Object Imitation in Children with Autism, Ingersoll et al)(cannot provide direct link) examined the effect of sensory feedback (light and sound) and the effect it had on an imitation task (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation)</a>).  Children in the study were given one of two types of toys; one with sensory feedback one without (normal).   The child than imitated the researchers task with the toy.  Normal children were able to perform the task with either toy; the performance of the autistic children in this task showed that there was a significant difference between the sensory toy and the normal toy.  The conclusion that researchers drew from this was CHILDREN WITH AUTISM WERE LESS MOTIVATED TO IMITATE BY SOCIAL INTERACTION, AND MORE MOTIVATED TO IMATATE BASED OFF A NONSOCIAL REWARD; IN THIS CASE THE SENSORY FEEDBACK.</p>
<p>Applying this to the youtube vids; the autistic children are motivated to replicate what they see in hopes of sensory feedback, in this case the odd colors and sounds is the nonsocial reward.</p>
<p>And the rabbit hole is about to get deeper….</p>
<p>I mentioned genetic manipulation earlier, which I believe is happening on an industrial scale due to mercury vapor emissions from industrial sites and power plants.  Studies have shown that there is a correlation between distance from power plants and industrial sites and incidences of autism; studies have also linked autism severity and distance from such sites as well as the amount of mercury emissions and number of autism cases.  I believe that the vaccine argument is a distraction based off of the studies that I have read, which show researchers are able to account for all the mercury in the vaccine in newborns feces shortly after vaccination.  A proper analogy would be the chlorine in table salt vs the chlorine you would put in a pool: one you can eat and the other is toxic.  Likewise, both forms of mercury have different properties.</p>
<p>Additionally, a physician who advocated this theory, Dr. Bradstreet, was found with a gunshot to the chest.  He also believed vaccines played a role too.

<p>The final nail in the coffin is a recent ruling by the Supreme Court that occurred the same day as the Gay Marriage ruling.  The Supreme Court struck down a provision of the clean air act that required polluters to measure and record mercury emissions: mercury can now be pumped into the air with impunity because of this ruling. Guess which court case got more media coverage?</p>

<p>To sum up TL/DR
* These youtube vids target autistic children
* Children with autism are motivated to imitate based off sensory feedback
* This makes autistic children more likely to imitate what they see on the vid because of the odd colors and noise
* Mercury emissions from power plants is correlated with cases of autism-Dr. Bradstreet, who advocated this theory was found dead less than a year after this case with a gunshot to the chest
* The vaccine argument is a distraction
* The Supreme Court struck down requirements for measuring and reporting mercury emissions-no media coverage</p>
<p>I would like to conclude with a question.  One of the anons who commented on these vids on here and 4chan reported having a daughter who got stuck in one of these hellish youtube loops, and had behavioral problems  If anyone has had contact with that anon or that anon is present I would ask if his daughter has autism?</p>',

            QUESTION: Did Ivanka and Jared Kushner vaccinate their 3 young children? Did they have a choice? Do weathy individuals have the opportunity to choose whether or not to vaccine their kids with this poison? Or is it just the poor and middle class that have no choice but to do so?

            Not many people are aware, but there is a community of people recovering their children from autism.  Check out Thinking Moms Revolution, TACA, Autism is Medical, etc. They do so by reverse engineering the damage done to their children via vaccination, antibiotics, maternal immune activation while in utero.  The path is different for every child - it depends on their underlying genetic makeup and the environmental assaults that occurred.  The vaccine topic gets convoluted because of MSM reporting and Pharma control.  There are camps out to prove it was MMR (See Vaxxed - From Cover-up to Catastrophe) while others are out to prove it was Mercury (See Trace Amounts).  Typically, its a combination of factors.   The recovery occurs by 1. Correcting nutritional deficiencies (most autistic children have digestive disorders) 2. Correcting detoxification and methylations pathway anomalies (includes chelation) 3. Correcting mitochondrial disorders 4. Re-integrating sensory processing - The book, Outsmarting Autism -

I made the mistake of allowing my child (preschooler) to watch videos on youtube. It seemed innocent enough, when you search on the actual site none of these nasty videos show up. No, that happens once the parent has walked away and its on autoplay or suggested videos.
My child went through a phase, and when I say phase I mean a hellish unending cycle of constant crying/wanting only Youtube. No other shows, no interest even in the actual shows that the videos were supposed to be copying. Now my child has constant potty humor. Everything is butts, poop, My child is autistic and I've noticed their behavior is TERRIBLE when I allow access to youtube.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is violent aggressive behavior, threats of self harm, threats of running away, bad personal space problems like hitting other people on the butt or pulling pants down to see underwear. It doesn't make sense because their was no one else displaying this behavior. I realized it was youtube. This was prior to any of these posts. I cut youtube at night because they would scream and cry hysterically because they wanted youtube to go to sleep. Even when they did originally have youtube, I would come back at 3am expecting a nice sleeping child as was normal for any other bedtime show, however the autoplay function and constant stimulation from the bright colors/music/ect. was keeping my child up literally all night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course as a parent I disabled/blocked youtube and the behavior drastically became better. I understand that children are influenced by what they see, and I understand it's my fault for allowing access. However I never EVER knew that these autoplay suggested videos were so terribly inappropriate. My other child also watched the Spiderman/Elsa videos and I now understand why they were joking constantly about shots in butts, dating, and pretending to make dolls kiss. I even had to cut sleepovers because my non-autistic child was trying to "play doctor" with the friend (both 4), to the point I thought possibly my child must have seen this somewhere/experienced it/was possibly sexually abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            These videos are introducing nasty fetishes literally to our children. So I have one example of atrocious aggressive/inappropriately sexual/nasty behavior caused in an autistic child, and another example of inappropriate sexual behavior in an non-autistic child. With my autistic child these videos seem to cause hyperactivity, aggression, and a complete lack of personal space when away from the videos. However when WATCHING the videos, my child initially seemed "calm" however I now believe it was more of a trance like state because when I broke concentration from the videos, the child would throw a fit/become upset/essentially only want to continue watching.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's as if the videos were the only thing that could calm and entertain my child. I experienced similar behavior from my non-autistic child in that if they watched a lot of these videos for a long period, they would habitually ask to continue watching throughout the day. However since non-autistic children are less repetitive/more able to cope and so it was much easier to just convince them to move on to a more interactive activity like playing with actual toys.

            Hi
Trying to be supportive here...   but if they don't care and you are watching them so often, become the parent and forbid it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will work because, as you say, they don't care.   Just do it until they tell you not to.
           </p>
           <p>
            My 2cents.  Clearly is "free" so disregard if it doesn't apply.   :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            I see your pain.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had to red pill some family members about vaccines and i did it slowly - with short articles here and there.  That, along with a lot of prayer, worked.           Not sure if you are a follower of Jesus, but if you express your concern and ask for the words, it'll happen.   Not sure how that works but it does.
           </p>
           <p>
            One other thing: get a bible, sit down and read them Proverbs 4.  They may look at you like you are crazy, but ignore it.      Explain to them the importance of praying for wisdom and make them do it - make them say - God, please give me wisdom and discernment.
           </p>
           <p>
            This may sound NUTS  but it WORKS.   I've known other parents who have made their kids do this and it is amazing what happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see your love for those kids = they are so lucky to have you in their corner looking out for them!!!

           <p>
            A call to Poison Control…
           </p>
           <p>
            “I gathered all vaccine ingredients into a list and contacted Poison Control. After intros and such, and asking to speak with someone tenured and knowledgeable, this is the gist of that conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Me: My question to you is how are these ingredients categorized? As benign or poison? (I ran a few ingredients, formaldehyde, Tween 80, mercury, aluminum, phenoxyethanol, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sorbitol, etc.)
He: Well, that’s quite a list… But I’d have to easily say that they’re all toxic to humans… Used in fertilizers… Pesticides… To stop the heart… To preserve a dead body… They’re registered with us in different categories, but pretty much poisons. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Me: If I were deliberately to feed or inject my child with these ingredients often, as a schedule, obviously I’d put my daughter in harm’s way… But what would legally happen to me?
           </p>
           <p>
            He: Odd question… But you’d likely be charged with criminal negligence… perhaps with intent to kill… and of course child abuse… Your child would be taken away from you… Do you know of someone’s who’s doing this to their child? This is criminal…
           </p>
           <p>
            Me: An industry… These are the ingredients used in vaccines… With binding agents to make sure the body won’t flush these out… To keep the antibody levels up indefinitely…
           </p>
           <p>
            He: WHAT?!
Your conclusion?”

            luckily I never seem to be particularly affected by videos that are supposed to impact a person neurologically. but those are super weird. and the conditioning videos are just confusing. but this is clearly not normal shit at all.

            I can understand the theory behind the videos triggering responses in autistic kids, but those videos are just pain creepy with a touch of cruelty.  That is something that seems off.

            The high incidence of autism in boys have always made me wonder if there is something in vaccines that targets something in males that females don't have.   And then you have to ask, why would they target boys?

            I mean I get that it should be avoided. but I have to know what it is to know the enemy. what do I search for to find them? or can you explain them to me? do they attempt to get kids to do sexual stuff using a feedback reward system or?

            I feel sorry for parents trying to raise children in the current environment.  Beyond the family network, the world is not a safe place. I know someone with two autistic children. She says they were meeting all milestones before immunisation shots. I would say that there can also be a genetic component.  Another two autistic children I know have a parent and uncle on the spectrum.

            Regarding autism, does anybody know why autism occurs in boys at a much higher rate than girls.  Only one out of 42 autistic children are girls.  It seems boys are the target of autism, yet I never hear this as part of the discussion.

             I highly suggest the documentary Trace Amounts - Great explanation of the mercury load issue and rates of autism, how vaccinations are the number 1 culprit and explains how estrogen is protective... If you want some REAL info on autism and mercury, that is the film to see. (FYI, it is NOT just mercury. Autism is a spectrum and presents differently in each person. 
 0+10 = 10, 4 + 6 = 10, 2+3+5= 10, 8 + 2 = 10. Multiple combinations to get to autism:  NO genetic issues + tons of environmental assaults.  SOME genetic issues + SOME environmental assaults, LOTS of genetic issues + few environmental assaults).  Figure out the underlying genetic weaknesses and reverse engineer the environmental assaults and UNDO autism.
