<blockquote>
<p>In addition to carrying on with the weekly furniture sales Noel Abel and his son Tony have built up one of the largest removal and storage business in the country. <strong>In 1972 a large complex of storage and removal buildings were erected opposite the R.A.F. Station</strong> on the Norwich Road. These were considerably expanded in 1980 and now cover an area of 8 acres with a storage space of 54,000 square feet. A fleet of 61 removal vans, which include some of the largest removable vehicles allow­ed on British roads, make regular trips to Germany and other European countries as well as Singapore and Australia, thereby putting Watton very much on the map. One of the firm’s most im­ portant contracts was the removal of the effects of the Prince and Princess of Wales from Buck­ingham Palace to their home at Highgrove. Another of Abel\'s special assignments was moving an ex­hibition for the Sultan of Oman 6,000 miles across Europe. Mr. Paul Kryger drove the large removal van through Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Austria, stopping in towns and cities on the route to display the exhibition for His Majesty Sultan Oaboos bin Said, the Sultan.</p>

            <p>
             Joanna Shields, Baroness Shields, OBE (born 12 July 1962) is a British-American technology industry veteran who currently serves as Group CEO for BenevolentAI.[1] Shields previously served as UK Minister for Internet Safety and Security, Under-Secretary of State, and Advisor on the Digital Economy to David Cameron. She was made a Life Peer in the House of Lords in 2014. In 2016, Baroness Shields was appointed the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Internet Safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In 1997 Shields became CEO of Veon, an interactive video technology company whose intellectual property included patents for adding interactive links to video streams that became part of the MPEG4 streaming video standard. Philips acquired Veon in 2000. After closing the Veon transaction, Shields was hired by the company that invented streaming audio and video, RealNetworks, to run its businesses outside the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shields briefly joined former Efi CEO and colleague, Dan Avida, to build the business of a storage encryption company he founded called Decru, where she played an instrumental role in forming a partnership with Network Appliance, the company that eventually acquired Decru for $272m.[5]
            </p>
            <p>
             Shields then became a managing director for Google Europe, Middle East and Africa where she was responsible for developing the company's advertising syndication business, AdSense, and for the acquisition of content and partnerships for such products such as Google Mail, Video (before the YouTube acquisition), Maps, Local, News and Books.
            </p>

             On 18 June 2020 it was announced by Matt Hancock that the UK government intends to switch from the centralised test and trace model to the decentralised approach pioneered by Apple and Google due to privacy concerns, among other things. Harding will decide on the suitability of the alternative model. She stated that 'What we've done in really rigorously testing both our own COVID-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well enough to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world'. The change was, however, widely interpreted in the press as an abandonment of the UK's app in favour of the Apple-Google one, and a U-turn by the government.[20][21] The BBC also reported that the "latest developments come a day after the BBC revealed that a former Apple executive, Simon Thompson, was taking charge of the late-running project as part of Baroness Harding's team.

             Palantir, the US big data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, is working with Faculty, a British artificial intelligence startup, to consolidate government databases and help ministers and officials respond to the pandemic...NHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the “Covid-19 datastore”, said the technology would give ministers and officials “real-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed”.

             Healthcare firm advised by Owen Paterson won £133m coronavirus testing contract unopposed -

            <p>
             A healthcare firm which employs the prominent Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a paid consultant has been awarded a £133m contract without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has given Randox the contract to produce testing kits to help respond to the coronavirus pandemic. It was awarded “without prior publication of a call for competition”, according to details of the contract seen by the Guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
             The founder of Randox Laboratories is Peter FitzGerald, a polo-playing multimillionaire Northern Irish doctor who is the UK’s 475th richest person with a £255m personal fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list.
            </p>
            <p>
             Matt Hancock’s department awarded the contract last month under fast-track arrangements that enable public bodies dealing with the pandemic to give contracts to commercial companies quickly without the need to ask other firms to bid for them.

             In July 2014, Home Secretary Theresa May announced that he would be leading a review into historical sex abuse claims.[10][11] His report, written with Richard Whittam QC, was published in November 2014. It "found nothing to support a concern that files had been deliberately or systematically removed or destroyed to cover up organised child abuse", but also said that it was "not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place"

                You talked a bit about differentiated content as one of your five drivers of growth, and it’s pepperedthrough the slides as one of the differentiators for you. You’re obviously quite pleased with the way it’sgone so far, you’re getting some critical mass, with 2 million peak viewers, etc., and you’ve now got an EEcustomer base and a big 4G network to distribute more content over. I’m just wondering where you’regoing with content? Are you happy with what you have, or are you encouraged to push harder on content?And if so, in what kind of direction you might go? Thank you.

                Well, this is something we will touch on later in John’s presentation in particular. Content as a form ofdifferentiation has worked for us. We’ve really done that mainly in sport, and I think the results havebeen pretty good if you look it’s less than three years since we launched, and I think we’ve got a verycredible number two player in the market. And we’re happy with that.We will continue to be disciplined in how we invest going forward. So, market leadership at any cost is nota strategy we will follow in sport per se, but we must make sure that it is a compelling offer for customersand that we’ve got the ability to make those sorts of investments.
