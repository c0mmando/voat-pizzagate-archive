            I also think this is worth reading which I came across after some digging. I suppose you can make up your own mind but it strikes me as interesting that Moses Farrow - now a psychologist and family therapist - appears to think his mother is vindictive. Her openly declared treatment of her 'daughter' - understanding that the same daughter eventually married her ex-husband - is a real eye opener. I'm not a psychologist but it strikes me that this is the behaviour of a narcissist. .

            Not quite sure which side Maureen Orth is on. On the face of it, she is an investigative reporter who is prepared to go all out with Dylan Farrow (and therefore presumably Mia Farrow) against Woody Allen. She has just published her booked about the killing of Gianni Versace. But her twitter feed - which is very active - has not one mention of Pizzagate (or pedogate). Her article on Margaret Thatcher (me :-))
            <a href="https://maureenorth.com/2014/06/margaret-thatchers-big-problem/?utm_content=bufferd6dd1&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">

            is verbal diarrhoea.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is interesting to see what Ronan Farrow has to say about it after Maureen Orth's blog. He is important because not only is it his sister we are talking about but he essentially was the person that uncovered Harvey Weinstein. I believe he is a good guy - truthful without grandstanding. Here is his article.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572">
             https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572

            Nolte has valid points but I am unsure as to why he would put his reputation on the line like this. He would have been better off making his points but including Maureen Orth's. I
            <em>
             believe
            </em>
            that what he is getting at is the lack of due process in these cases. Trial by media is no trial. Roman Polanski was convicted of terrible paedophile crimes yet is revered by Hollywood. Woody Allen has - at a minimum - a twisted understanding of how a father should interact with his daughter. It is unhelpful to the discovery of truth that the allegations emerged after he was separated from the mother of his children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does Woody Allen relate to Pizzagate? Maybe, inasmuch as he is another name to add to a list of Hollywood sexual deviants. He does not, however, appear to be a central figure and the evidence against him is too sketchy for us to use his example to further our cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            To illustrate this it is worth reading the Huff Post article. HuffPo is one of the worst offenders for sensationalisation and selective editing, which it does in this article yet still fails to highlight any really 'damning evidence' as its headline suggests.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-shea/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866.html">
             https://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-shea/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the meantime, would I watch a Woody Allen movie? I won't go out of my way to. The only time I ever know it's one is when the titles come up at the end. If I know in advance, I tend to avoid them. He just strikes me as a bit odd, but I suppose all those celebs who were hedonistic in the 70s are - including Gloria Vanderbilt.
           </p>
           <p>
            One other thing that struck me looking at these articles was the story of the father who was wrongly convicted of paedophilia because of the ex-wife's story - but it turned out that the real culprit was the stepfather (ex-wife's boyfriend) who able to continue to abuse the boys while the real father was in prison. This is why due process is so important. And I think that is what Nolte was getting at.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you ever get chance to watch this video from the 'I am innocent series' it is very worth doing.

            Listen to me when I tell you this, fellow niggerfaggots: Brietbart is an Israel/jewish propaganda outlet and it was from the beginning. Only neocon Zionists/jewish supremacists hang around there. I've been banned from there dozens of times for telling the truth. believe me. I consider Brietbart an enemy to white people and America.
