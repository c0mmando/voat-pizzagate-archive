 Many on voat have discussed how Hollywood is slowly conditioning society to accept child rape as a normal, harmless part of life. They place it in movies, art, music, pseudo psychology text books, news articles, etc. But over 25 years ago the Public Relations Team of Michael Jackson was passing off beyond inappropriate behavior as totally harmless. Society was told that MJ was a harmless man child who was also a all American heterosexual who could not keep his hands off Lisa Marie Presley. These ideas were not just by chance but we\'re carefully crafted PR propaganda to sympathize with the predator and condemn the victims.
 Back in 1993 child sexual abuse was a major topic. Many positive changes were made to educate people on how child predators behave and how to help victims of abuse. However what was also big in 1993 was image making. MTV was still a major player and even people like George Michael, Elton John were packaged as heterosexual. I make this point not to equate homosexuality to pedophilia but to show how strong and important image was in that era. 
 So now it is 2018 , we understand even more that grown men sleeping with children is beyond suspicious. We understand that adults who try to isolate and spend countless hours alone with a child should be immediately looked into. We understand that Hollywood has a major problem with child abuse. We understand that it can take decades for victims to come forward. We understand that cash settlements are a way for high-power celebrities to get away with criminal activity. But still the architect of grooming and deception gets a pass from many. It\'s time we listen to the victims of Michael Jackson because their history of abuse brings us exactly to this point in time in 2018.

            Either Inside Edition or the other tabloid TV program in the mid 1990s had a lot of coverage of the Jackson issue. They interviewed his Spanish maid that said he had an apartment in LA just for sleepovers &amp; all it had in it was one sleeping bag. When Jackson started paying attention to her young son she quit.

            This kid in OP's post got a settlement with confidentiality agreement so he vouldn't talk before &amp; perhaps was scared.

            I wonder if the most successful stars are so deeply secured in their golden cages, that they are actually alaves, chemically comatose most of the time, brownstoned, hypnotized, brainwashed, and their victims too.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real monsters, the handlers, producers, middlemen... we don’t talk about them, but we’re all lining up to spit on MJ’s grave, (halfway myself included). I’m not defending him. I would like to point out though, there is a far more nefarious aspect to our investigation, that fits this fact pattern: the MK/Ultra and Illuminati stuff. I think MJ fell into his cage early and rarely got out. His victims are probably being groomed and prompted, produced and supported even now by the same people that handled Michael. Just guessin’. Maybe a Michael Jackson researcher has insight to refute or support these suspicions. I suppose I will do some research.

            I talked once with a former A list star who told me he knew a man who had sex with MJ.  Nothing about pedophilia came up in that conversation, but I have no doubt MJ was abused in his own youth.  Victims become victimizers unless they are shown a different path in time.  This also I know...

            Gotta hand it to you MJVictims, you keep plugging away at this. I can't imagine the flack that you must have had to endure throughout this process because even CDAN put out a blind indicating that the corporation STILL CONTROLLING Michael Jacksons estate HAS A TEAM OF PAID TROLLS DEFENDING HIS NAME.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Jackson is STILL A HUGE NAME, especially in untapped markets like China where they stand to make just as much off of him in death before his reputation catches up with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT in my mind Michael Jackson was one of the WORST celebrity pedophiles to date, was a fully manipulated MK, and had his hands DEEP in the ENTIRE panopticon that is pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Jackson is a faggot cog in the wheel that's going to fucking BURN

            This same  guy  testified  under  oath Jackson was a pure gentleman. Kinda weird, I  can understand being too programmed  to tell the truth, but he testified  FOR Jackson several  times; his video looks  very earnest, but I'm troubled by him testifying under  oath-problematic

             I understand your skepticism, but many have been threatened to protect those in power and making money for the industry.  Perhaps now that he is older he has more courage to come forward maybe even after some well needed therapy.  There are many that have been abused and not been able to come to terms with their horrors until decades later. This from many abused by priests or SRA Victims.

              I understand that- but testifying several times as an adult, one under  oath still causes  me to pause; very  frustrating because this  could  have been the testimony that really sealed MJ as a pedophile, which I believe is  the case

               I know they needed someone, just at least one someone to come out and say, yes he touched me or words to that effect.  But no one did.  To this day I always think about the money they would lose.  It's really sad, but we also know how evil and greedy Sony is.  It's really almost too late now.  Because of all the twisted lies that were told and now no one knows what to believe.

                I definitely  believe MJ was a serial pedophile, perhaps the  worst  kind, because they  have  the ability to evoke sympathy, despite the evil acts they commit, and the innocent young lives they  destroy- "some  times  mercy  is  best  not  served"

                 It was not that long ago when I realized that not only are they grooming their victim, but they have groomed themselves and their families and friends all their lives.  Their life is a constant lie. To themselves and everyone else.  They are so sick the actually start believing this.  I have no sympathy for them either.  I think he was beyond help, he was so horribly abused.

                   Well we know that a few succumbed to money and also knew he and Sony would be hard to fight. Imagine the lawyers.  No one can afford such a fight.  Some may have been under their spell so to speak.

                     Yes, and many are so brainwashed they will not stand up for him anyway.  So sad when we do not stand up for Victims and Children.  FMS was a thing that they tried to push but now therapists are coming out and saying that the reason they wait so long to come forward is the pain it causes to the Victim.  Really?  They think this stuff is easy to come out with?  And we should not believe them?  Oh yes, how uncomfortable for the Criminals.  Poor Criminals.  Boo Hoo.  I have no sympathy for any one criminal after being involved with the posting of the Horrid Experiences of our SRA Survivor

                      Well, emotions aside for the  moment-we  must  not  forget  our  charge on  Voat  is  to separate  fact  from  fiction in these reports,
this is a necessary task, in order to  prevent the psychopaths  from derailing these truths; what we discuss here is different than how we would address an SRA survivor in a  personal  interview

                       I totally get what you are saying, but I also know they are constantly trying to hijack what is being done to children and blaming the children.  Totally agree.

            I thought I read that Michael Jackson was actually talking in kids to protect them from preditors and was demonized as one himself because he was working to expose a lot of what we know now. May be remembering it all wrong.

             I’ve heard the same. That David Geffen et al was responsible for it all. There can be no destruction of MJ without bringing down Geffen. Which I haven’t seen any research into him and there needs to be.

             Who told you that?  Where did you rad that?  He most def was fiercely abused by those in the industry and his father Joe J.  He sold M off to make money.  His mother is just as guilty.  This whole business is disgusting because I have sympathy for him being horribly abused, but we must not remember that he had books of naked children, etc.  and pictures that were mentioned. There are many of those that are doing this today and we do not give them a pass.  There is also him paying off those that filed lawsuits.  He is so guilty.  He was beyond sick in many ways.

              I don’t believe him. He’s just like Corey Feldman lying ass. Keeping his stories alive when he’s out of money you hear the horrid abuse stories, they cut him a check and suddenly he’s ghost. I don’t take Wade or Corey seriously they waited too many years and Wade has gone on record saying MJ did him nothing. These are not the people that help this cause. I’m sick of them both.

            Is this the kid who was sitting on the couch with him in that miniseries that aired? When Jackson said it was a beautiful thing to share a bed with a kid. I haven't seen it since, but I remember them showing the kid's face and then blurring it out on repeats after controversy was sparked.

             This also brings to mind Woody Allen and Dylan.  He laid in bed with her in his undershorts while he read her stories .  All the while allowing her to suck on his thumb.  What is the matter with people?  Are people not getting this stuff?  Are they thinking this is normal behavior?  I really don't think so.  I think they are afraid to admit the truth about all of their Idols.  Time they have wasted.  Get over it people and let it go.  We have all been groomed at one time or another by these Sickos.  Time to Get Real. MJ was a Pedo and so is WA.

              Just get over it. It's not about giving up fantasies held about this scum, it's about protecting kids. Hell, when it comes to it, people should be willing to give up spouses over that issue. NO ONE gets a pass. NO ONE as in NO ONE.

                  Well, think about it. The Cannibal Elite pushed us back. With the careful narratives created to convince us that children were lying little mischief makers and that Satanists were under attack by being unfairly targeted by children who just loved to lie and make up stories even though they did have STD's, but they caught those from their scummy parents and not the teachers who took them out of school to those people who wore masks and did things to them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now it's grooming gangs that are being unfairly targeted because of their religion.

                   Yeah, if it works don't change it.  Most def people have become very lazy parents.  Too trusting and think of their kids as mini adults.  We now have tweens when before they went from children to teenagers.  Now we have to have a special name for another group.  It's good to let your kids know their special but not beat it into their heads.  Way too much attention in one way and not in the other. All kids really need is simplicity.  Good food, a few clothes. And lots of love.  But it seems parents tend to believe others over their own children.

                    Children do not have the cognitive skills of adults. It's why parents are so shocked when they see those staged videos where someone deliberately tries to show them how easy it is to lure them into a car. It doesn't surprise me, but it surprises them. After all, the children were taught not to talk to strangers. And, further, the parent is right there on the playground reinforcing that the child need only run to them. Nonetheless, when that paid actor says he's lost a puppy/has a puppy in the car and do they want to find or see it? The kids are WHOOSH!!!! GONE!!!! They practically run and drag the actor to the car! And the parents are seen shaking their heads in dismay when watching what actually happens when kids are confronted with this type of situation.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Hell, even adults don't reason things out cognitively. It's why we're in this mess because everyone shares a common bond of normalizing situations. It's to keep us from flipping out every couple of seconds. People that don't normalize are thought to be crazy and likened to crying, ''Wolf'' too many times.

                   <p>
                    It's just ultimately sad that any group of people would use our children's innocence to take advantage of. We want to give children their freedom to play and dream and be kids, but with hormone blockers being shoved in their mouths at three, and films destroying their safety by planting sick ideas in there heads, we have two entirely different factions battling for how we want to shape our world.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It's why I'm so impressed at this forum and our warriors who fight for change and to return our society to one where kids can be free range and not locked in their rooms staring at a computer.

                     Yes,  Free Range like our chickens.   If chickens are healthier when Free Range, then so are our children.  Pushing this this stuff on our kids so that our pedos can have Free Range to abuse our kids is only going to backfire.  We see this morning that the Pan Sexual movie they have released is not doing so well.  Actually doing better here than in Europe and Asia.  That has me worried.  But some are Woke enough to realize it.  Some will go to see anything just to say they have seen it.  I will shock people by revealing I have never seen even 1 Star Wars Movie.  Not One.  And I plan on  keeping it that way.

                     Children need our guidance.  Not the guidance of what they put in books and movies, for those have been hijacked.   Now NCMEC is proposing we stop scaring our kids and stop saying to not talk to strangers.  That is their new advice.  So talking to strangers is OK???  NUTS!!!  This is a complete reversal.  This should tell us they are again in the Pedo Camp.

                      As for the pan sexual porn ... yeah, I'm gonna skip that. It was part of a huge franchise so I understand the attendance. I tend to bail when a great series begins to crumble and disintegrate, but that's me. Some stick with it to the bitter end. The sickos that released that film were counting on loyalty -- which they're getting in small measure.

                      Definitely, parents be parents. Ignore idiots and pervs and paid talking heads. The bad advice is only designed to get your kids into a rape van.

                       I have to admit that there have been a lot of reports on the news that say kids are escaping being attacked now.  They scream, kick and run away.  Granted some end up missing but I think they are being taught to fight back.  I still advocate Defense Classes for Kids to learn to fight back.

                         Now this is something that small town schools should be pushed to require.  It starts with those that are Red Pilled pushing their school counsels to provide Defense Classes.  That is something that can be accomplished.

                             Great 💡 Idea!  I have been thinking also that the ones to fight against these pedo rappers is the teens We need a big group of good kids that are already organized to counter them.

                               Oh I am sure they would want to help out. I have a feeling if they knew, they would be fighting mad.  After all it is their future and their world too.

             Exactly! What kind of parent lets their child sleep in the bed of a full grown man?! What kind of parent lets their child go to the house of said man for a SLEEPOVER even?!

              Totally agree!
             </p>
             <p>
              Nonetheless, how many stories have we read here that concern pedos molesting kids either: [1] while babysitting or [2} on sleeovers!
             </p>
             <p>
              Gaining trust is part of the strategy. But then again, a lot of these parents wanted their kids to be ''stars''. Evidently, that means selling/pimping them out. But even when the parents did fight back, they were destroyed. It's a no win situation, but you are 100% correct.
