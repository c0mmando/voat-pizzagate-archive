           <p>
            No one is attempting to hold "justice hostage" in fact presumption of innocence is a specific legal principal that is depends on charges being filed. It is to protect the accused standing trial. Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11, states: "Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence.".
           </p>
           <p>
            . No one is asking for podesta or alefantis to prove they did not do it. As far as I know the public is demanding an investiagation from law enforcement. Our FBI, D.C. Police dept, they have NOT investigated as they should. In this country and most democracy the legal protection of presumption of innocence is afforded to those accused with a crime. It's a specific legal principal. You want the presumption of innocence without formal charges and it does not work that way. You don't change the rules of the game if you don't like it. That is cheating right? The rules only work when they are applied equally, justice should be blind. But unfortunately when it comes to politically connected wealthy individuals such as podesta or alefantis They are able to bribe or blackmail to avoid justice.  "They" hold "justice hostage". As long as the discussion remains in the "court of public opinion" than there is no presumption of innocence, there are no Miranda rights, there are no burden of proof rules. We the public at large are not bound by any of those legal principals whatsoever. We are not public institutions, there are NO charges filed therefore they have NO right to presumption of innocence. 1st come charges THEN AND ONLY THEN do they have the right to presumption of innocence.
           </p>
           <p>
            What podesta and his crew of pedofile traffickers are trying to do is avoid an investigation at all costs. They hire shills and public relation firms and use their connections in media to distract, discredit, and distort the legitimate questions that remain unanswered. We all know Where there is smoke there is fire. Innocent people all the time are ruled out during an investigation. The problem is not the public asking the questions, the problem is the high powered white collar criminals are able to prevent the enforcement of laws. That does not mean they have not broken laws it means they exert pressure so that the laws are not enforced. As it stands anyone who calls infants hotard, drinks menstral blood and sperm, associates with convicted pedos, collect artwork of sexually abused children and dead people, and tape children to tables, celebrates canibalism, should be investigated for the email code words and the public photos and comments posted on social media. there is already precedent of people being investigated for child abuse just on photos of children and animals being taped and published on social media. Are you saying podesta or alefantis are above the laws of the land?
            <br/>
            It's ok to use children as entertainment in a heated pool? It's ok to tape a baby to a table? It's not ok for a mother to do that to her son. People have been arrested for the same thing except they were not wealthy or politically connected. 
What's interesting you are advocating not asking questions about wealthy and politically connected  individuals who publish photos and collect art that depicts children getting harmed. Who will speak for these children? These elites individuals don't need your voice: they have the ability to buy the best defense. Yet here you are choosing to protect these "elite" instead of protecting the victims who have no voice. 
At this point the public is demanding an investigation, and justice one way or another will be served ... the writing is on the wall. Public relations will only go so far. 
Facts matter evidence matters, your opinion ( that has no basis in legal principals) does not matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is moral outrage building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go back and tell alefantis and podesta: when they are officially charged thejudge and jury will presume their innocence, they will have the right remain silent as it stands now the pubic will judge them anyway they want. Their own behavior damns them in the court of public opinion. They want rights ? They they should turn them selves in!

            Don't forget the Podesta email where there is an event that "all available children" should be brought to it, another case where totally strange use of language involving children with adults. I think it was a pig roast or tortilla party or something. It was commented on here a while back.

            Could you give us a citation on that video,  please.  Google  Ms. Luzzato, then press images and see all the pictures on her. A weird one, for sure. There is a picture of her and Heather Podesta having fun. Alas, I don't know how to copy pics from one site and post to another or I would display for all to see.

             Sometimes it works to right click and press "view image", and it will take you to separate page, you can copy the URL from that. But only once in a while do you get a link that actually opens up in Voat. You might try it

            I forgot to mention one thing when I originally read that email Kids in a pool for entertainment I remeber thinking to odd that luzzatoo would allow children in a pool on a cold day when she was advising others to dress warmly. Now this is before pizzagate connections were made. Then as I kept rereading the email it was clear she was using these children and had no concern for their wellbeing. She would use these children as entertainment on a cold day while advising her colleagues to dress warmly. In my family and social circles she would have been given a lecture on caring for children. Thanks for your post once again!

             That makes sense. Do you think a valid argument could be made for the heated aspect? Saying well, of course she cared for them, that's why they heated the pool. Swimming in a heated pool when it's chilly outside is kind of fun!

              It depends how warm the pool is. I know children should not be in jacuzzis and maybe my family tends to be overprotective lol but they would have had a fit if children were not properly bundled outdoors in cold weather. I thought it was odd how the email read. Adults bundled up against the cold and children in a pool without their mother or father just a driver? Who was going to make sure the children changed out of a wet bathing suit?just knowing how kids are it seemed weird the whole set up. It jumped out as odd and this was before pizzagate was figured out, so I knew there was something wrong especially when you count her entertainment comment. Very, very shady.

            This was an awesome post thanks for helping expose these people so logically and reasonably. I did not know about the jacks place connection: it's heart breaking hearing about children referred to as raw and uncut or premium subscribers get full access. This truly is a national security issue. These individuals show very poor judgement, they have no idea how to function with social norms, the level of depravity with the art they collect and social media images in my opinion makes them vulnerable to black mail and also shows they have weak personalities that are controlled by their lists. We need to hold people in public office and government to higher standard than private citizens. In the least luzzato and rao and the rest of the clowns should be fired. If I had posts like that I would be fired.

            Very good job! These people make me sick. Seeing it visually is different. I know this stuff happens, but when I seen baby Jack's picture of him in the bath it broke my heart. It's sickening that they would let people see him completely naked if they're subscribed. These kinds of people deserve the death penalty. No sympathy for these creeps!

               That's exactly what I am attempting to do, because seeing it clearly laid out in visuals makes it really hard to deny. Please offer any suggestions for making it more clear, this is your blog too. Hearing the recent Joe Rogan and other interviews lately where pizzagate was mentioned, I realize we have NOT done a good job at presenting the evidence we have in a convincing manner. People are in such denial and concerned with whatever is on MSM, that we really have to present this as "pizzagate for dummies" with pictures and super simple language.

            I don't know how you people come up with that interpretation that she's sending kids to a party to be raped by Podesta and other various Democrats. And you keep reposting this evil slander. I'm thinking it's the shill camp that keeps harping on this.

             WHOA!   No one is suggesting rape.  Sexual gratification can be accomplished via voyeurism. By listing the ages, Grandma Luzatto invites hebephiles 11yo thru 14yo and pedophiles , children under 12, to partake of viewing pleasure. If you are into infants, nepiophilia, then go to the Jack or Evie blogs.

               Context my dear. It's not just those 7 words, its the entire email together with a naked grandchild being offered up for some raw and uncut viewing.  Anyone who is a parent and/or grandparent would agree that the verbiage of Ms. Luzatto is peculiar. How so? Well sexual gratification is one possible explanation for the odd phrases, there can be other explanations I'm sure.  There are pedophiles who never go so far as sexual intercourse. Being close to children and just touching children is sufficient, Joe Biden being an example. The Pizzagate community has enlightened us with the knowledge that parents oft times are complicit in the sexual exploitation of their own children, Its not a matter of children being snatched by total strangers.

               You comment frequently. What's your take
               <br/>
               on the sexual references by Jimmy Comet to every photograph of a child?  Do you regard that as normal and harmless?

              What is the crux of your post? Are you saying that she wasn't sending the kids to the party to be raped by Democrats? What is the insinuation then? I destroy dumb-play specialists. It's my specialty.

               I'm an upper-middle class American, approaching six decades of personal, social interaction, volunteerism, and close, personal friendships with a large number of people in my excellent experience in human interaction and friendship on this earth. Long-term frienships with many  people include bartenders, investment brokers, soccer moms, pipeline workers, accountants, farmers, teachers, preachers, steel and coal workers, graphic designers, fine artists, bankers, lawyers, physicians, mechanics, college professors, stay-at- home moms, politicians, drug abusers, and community volunteers. I can't even begin to express the joy I have, when I think of these people, so thanks for that inspiration.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                I KNOW
               </strong>
               , none of these people are perfect.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                That said
               </strong>
               , Not one person, of all these people I have known, or associated with, in these decades, have
               <strong>
                EVER, even once
               </strong>
               , described their kids as
               <strong>
                "the entertainment
               </strong>
               , unless it was a school play, or some school sponsored entertainment event.  What's the reason for a parent to refer to  photos of their beloved child  as  "raw and uncut".
              </p>
              <p>
               That's only  a small part of

               If I had anything to say beyond what is stated and shown in the post, I would have added it. If you want to ask me if I personally believe Podesta raped a child in the pool, I have to admit I've never really thought it that far through, and it wouldn't matter what I think anyway. The only thing I'm concerned with is the evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, that points to strange and concerning language being used with regard to children. And finally in the post we have actual evidence of a link to solicitation of child porn, or was that lost on you? Recognizing child porn is not part of your specialty?

                So you have no insinuation about why she's sending the kids to that party but you made a post about it? But then you say you picked up something "strange" in the language that she used but you become bashful about explaining what that is once I make my charge about what you are insinuating. Wouldn't you say you are at least implying some shenanigans were going on with those children and the adults at that party? If you admit that then I'm gonna ask you what kind of shenanigans so be careful.

                 I think their own words in the emails and the blog lead to those questions. I think without an independent investigation these questions will taint the reputations of these people. The only thing that will clear these individual is a full investigation. But the last thing they want is an investigation. That is evident.

                   Then investigate and clear them of any wrong doing. Once the Miranda rights are read then they have the right to be presumed innocent. I am not sure why they would rather let all these doubts and questions surround them. Clearly they are hisding something. Innocent people welcome investigations.

                  This is another one of their shill tactics: debunk one detail while ignoring the context. He is trying very hard to make this about one issue. He will ignore every other questionable point you raised and try to discredit the whole thing based on one detail. Next he will try to accuse of profiteering somehow when that does not work it will be a threat for law suits. That it is illegial to accuse people like that.

                   It's clear Podesta has hired someone to defend him online. This one appears to be a lawyer. One who doesn't give a crap about the suffering and abuse of children, only cares about a paycheck for defending ALLEGED pedos.

                  Does this mean you are backing off your claim that the woman was sending children to be sexual entertainment for Podesta and the other Democrats at that party? It's okay if you are. I won't ridicule you for it. But the people replying to your post are probably a bit confused right now and are expecting you to bravely spell out the charge because it would be a serious matter if your charges are correct. None of them are pretending you meant something else at this point.

                   This (below) was my exchange w/ Falcon about your first Really Graceful post that was deleted. I did send him the link as he requested. Then I saw he deleted your second Really Graceful post. I just (metaphorically) threw up my hands ... he left the stupid NPelosi post up, at least for a very long time.

            Great post. One possible addition under "Reasons why this is highly suspicious.." - Luzzatto states "a swim is a possibility" but then says "the kids will definitely be in the pool" - to me, this means something like 'you can have a swim if you want, the kids will be available for sure'. Also, it seems wasteful to heat an entire pool for one event, with 3 kids and heaps of adults - If they're not even sure the adults are swimming?

            Lastly, if I can suggest re-submitting this at a later date as a link post rather than a discussion post, it should get more exposure because all the top voted posts on here seem to be links.

            Fully agree. If I had the means, I would submit a tip to the FBI and also to the Madeline McCann hotline (weird I know, but it seems like her parents would care).
