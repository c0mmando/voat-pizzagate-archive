            We are on the eve of VR becoming popular. I have always been on the side of drawings and words being protected speech. Of course, it seems, that mediums that allow for maximum creativity outside of reality seem to produce strange results full of tentacle monsters. There are much more people who watch virtual murder or gore porn all day then cartoons depicting violence against children. People are already connected to virtual murder spree machines all day long. Add to this the soundtrack provided by immature people shouting expletive-laden abuse at each other. Society already has a means of studying what immersion in a toxic world does to the brain. But we don't study this. There is an outrage machine of concern fagging when we dare try to understand how our children's brains are murdered by spending day after day in a shoot em up environment.
           </p>
           <p>
            My strategy has always beem to do media education. Not everything that is on the internet requires being seen. We need to raise children who understand what they are being spoonfed. My daughter ran into my room to explain her absolute shock at the Luciferian content in the new Sabrina spin-off... She has done the same thing about Riverdale. We talked about the "morality destroying" tropes of TV Shows like that over the years. She doesn't trust the Disney machine because we also talked about the duplicity of "Hannah Montana" (public vs private image duality and glamour lie) and how most plots of iCarly feature the main character doing unethical or illegal things.
           </p>
           <p>
            It helps to have insight on how certain media shortchanges the brain, but, again, people love their porn and will continue to keep it in this unregulated state that promotes one-upmanship and now produces content that kind of looks like science fiction compared to how people usually care to have sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing nobody has studied. Do children who start looking into sex online when they are 10 wind up looking for content that features their peers. I have never seen a case where this situation is brought up. If you have ever seen mentions of such cases, or this situation being used as a defense, please share. I can add this to my pile of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            To close off, before the advent of Pornhub, online sites offering porn made an effort to shield the content. Nobody does that anymore. I believe companies that fill the internet with free to access porn have a responsibility to the community as a whole. They are in the wrong. But I am not sure what is right, and would work to create a speed bump that protects unauthorized viewers and protects them from this content. When I was a kid it was the age of Penthouse letters and softcore blue movies. These things didn't have the mind-altering quality of the kind of porn that is offered today. As a person from the analog age always being pursued by people from the digital age (because porn made MILF hunting a thing...) I am bewildered by how they talk about sex. It's as if they live in an alternate reality where "hate fucking on the first date" sounds like a funny thing to say or do. It is bewildering but mostly sad that young men have been educated in ways that make them unlikely to be attractive to women in the intimate sense. And we are seeing a weird incel backlash against women because women didn't receive the same education and now people have a hard time meeting in the middle.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this is by design. I think the stance of "pretend it doesn't exist" will continue in all matters of porn as we move into the VR phase. Not sure I'll be there to observe this, the thing makes me dizzy :(

             This is an excellent question. I'm guessing the answer is generally no. Kids interested in sex (going by my own experiences) associate that sexuality with the sexually mature body. Kids get crushes on another, but that isn't fully, sexually realized in the child, even a precocious one. Now, if the child has been molested or interfered with? Couldn't say...But that scares me, the idea of a child seeking and finding pornography of other kids. Almost as much as I'm scared of seeing a day come where there is no more outrage because childhood innocence is becoming a defunct concept. I want to be dead when that happens.

              I realize this is a scary concept. I took some time out of my day to plonk all our Pizzagate/Q keywords into pornhub to see if there is content that winks at satanic pedo keywords... I didn't find anything very remarkable. Youtube has way more psycho satanic content than pornhub. What I did notice is that there are a lot of animated content that features video game characters, notably from hyper popular games such as Forthnight (sp?)

              I remember as a child going through the entire libraries of people I had access to (family, babysitters, etc.) and would always find erotica. Of course in late 70s, early 80s, there was no culture of hardcore porn that is more akin to sci-fi than to regular sex. I cannot say that the erotic content I saw as a child was very shocking or noteworthy. It was simply a window into what adults think and do. The true issue is "instant free access"... there is no effort to prevent minors from consuming porn online... that is a huge issue.

             That makes so much sense.  I love how you have explained all this to your Daughter.  Thank you for your creating one more person with a clear understanding of what the media industry is trying to do to her brain.  Now she is trained to find these immoral videos and music for herself.  I have always looked forward to your comments and Thanks again for raising a red pilled Child.

            Child porn is repugnant, and the CREATORS should be prosecuted.
            <br/>
            HOWEVER, don't you find it odd that anyone who becomes overly critical of the DeepState suddenly has tens of thousands of child porn images found on their computers?
            <br/>
            Then they are found dead in their jail cells weeks after being admitted.
            <br/>
            Child porn legislation is the "sprinkle some crack on him" tool of the DeepState.
            <br/>
            It uses peoples' aversion to child abuse to silence calls for investigation into whether the person targeted is really guilty of such a crime, or if they were framed by D.S. devils.
            <br/>
            It also makes it illegal for Pizzagate investigators to hold onto certain pieces of evidence that wealthy Moloch worshipers are sacrificing children.
            <br/>
            Thus, the actual creators of the child porn can use law enforcement resources to silence critics and investigators.

             I think you have no idea how harmful child porn is. It is perfectly fine to prosecute offenders (yes, I read your comments below too). Do you even have an idea how children/adults feel that have been raped, and were filmed? Not knowing when they meet people on the streets who might have seen the pics/footage?
            </p>
            <p>
             In the UK, some police spokesmen are advocating for not sending perps to prison any more, because there are 'too many' of them. That's a disaster for victims.

             Your evidence is not porn, it's not art, it's just evidence of a crime. Also, the #1 goal is to delete all material featuring children being exploited. That is a much broader category than what people think CP is. The naming of it obscures what it is: Evidence of a crime. But if you keep it on your computer it will be taken a re-distributed. So report and delete is a better strategy. It could be that your content has never been catalogued into the hash system (for quick lookup using mathematical representation of content rather than human validation). New content can feature children that are still alive and findable.

            <p>
             I am not specifically writing to YOU but people need to move away from the old CP language and attitude and, step-by-step, face the problem and do the right thing... but not in a way that gets undone. Mind your language: "exploitative videos of children" (that includes completely legal stuff like exploitative videos of children on social media and youtube)

                Please read the above more carefully.  It seems the intent and meaning is lost on you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't know what future child porn laws SHOULD look like, but I do know that what we have now isn't working.
                <br/>
                Remember the child porn ring found on Twitter, and how Twitter banned the people that found it?
                <br/>
                AFAIK, those people in the ring have not been prosecuted, but the ones that uncovered it were punished instead.
                <br/>
                Is that justice?  Is that what you want?  Should we continue to trust a government with laws that are used on those that object to child rapists, instead of the rapists themselves?  At this point I believe that the current child porn laws are more of a single edged sword, with the blade facing backwards.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I think would help, is the death penalty for those found to have sexually molested a child.  I would require physical evidence, or potentially video/audio as evidence.  As, children have been coached to lie before a judge in the past.
                <br/>
                THAT would significantly reduce the generation of child porn.  As the offenders would be dead.  Instead of being released back into the public after being "cured", which I doubt is even possible after the decades of failures in this regard.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, in summary.  Treat the disease (death penalty to child rapists), and use the symptoms (child porn) as non-primary offence that allows investigating and stinging ("have a seat over there") that person.

             Violent video games are currently protected under this same precedent as free speech. If this case had gone the other way, the next challenge would have probably involved the original first-person shooters in some place that tried to ban them. Whether the Court would have extended the holding in this case to a violent video game is a different question, but it follows the same line of reasoning.

               Do you doubt that the next logical challenge after virtual child porn, if successful, would have been violent video games, especially given their place in popular culture at the time of this decision? Nobody ever said they were the same, and the only comment I made in the entire thread was the one you responded to directly, my only other contribution to the thread was a direct question, to you, that remains unanswered.

                   Right, the fact that there are already bans on the sale of certain video games to minors and the fact that outright bans have been propagated elsewhere makes this completely hypothetical. Or maybe you don't know what words mean...

                     When have I ever advocated for child porn? You appear to be deliberately lying about my position in order to bolster you're own weak position. If this is the case then you are despicable. If it's not the case then you should rescind your previous comment.
                    </p>

                     <em>
                      Actual
                     </em>
                     child porn creates actual harm to children.
                     <em>
                      Virtual
                     </em>
                     child porn creates virtual harm to children. A ban on one is clearly consistent with principles of first amendment freedom of expression. A ban on another is not as clearly so. Your use of punctuation and capitalization suggest an inability to appreciate the nuance between the two. You're probably a heavy child porn user who wants to virtue-signal about how bad it is in preparation for the day you're actually caught. I suggest you get help for your problems.

                       Good argument, but legally, and almost lawfully Max is right. I hate destructo video games, and all video games. If you let them make a law like that it will give them leverage for attacking you. They are making software right now to imitate real video. Would you want to have your identity stolen and given to these people? What if they made a bad video of you, and sent it to you? After the law to protect children of course, you, assuming innocence, would be on trial for more than one offence to the initial crime. Example is hate crime.

               It's called precedence. Any law against something that's "not real" could easily be used on anything else that's "not real".
              </p>
              <p>
               Not only that, but virtual cp that depicts actual child abuse is illegal, given that it's sourced from real abuse. So it's not it's a free for all. It's the best we've got so far as a balance between protecting from abuse and locking down freedom. Which is what would happen with a poorly planned out law.

                Precedent and precedents. "Precedence" is not used as a legal term. The latin term
                <em>
                 stare decisis
                </em>
                is used to represent the notion that previous cases should be relied on by lower courts as binding precedent law, and higher or equal Courts should treat precedent as persuasive and not divert from precedent absent a compelling reason.

            Reminder, SCOTUS interprets the law. They do not make the law. So in order to make child porn illegal, the legislative branch must make a law specifically against the making of child porn.
You'd think this is a no-brainer but still, child porn is readily available to those who seek it. So we the people need to push specific laws through Congress to make child porn equal to "yelling fire in a crowded theater."
Equally, I remember in the '90s, parents who took pictures of their naked children in a tub or on a bearskin rug where being prosecuted for child porn because the pictures were developed at the local kiosk and other film development places.
Food for thought.

                              People can not prove or disprove "god". Those that "disprove "god" relegate the concept into some form of pseudo human.

                             <p>
                              Which philosophical ideology of "god" do we first concede is the one that shall be the first and foremost "god" that science shall use to debate the concept?
                             </p>

                              What criteria do bias scientists decide upon to test their theory?

                              So far, historically, I personally have noticed any and all atheists seem dead set on only attacking Christendom.

                              This is the endless circle argument.  Academia is filled with parrot egos that find it easier to write off what is actually a personal journey and try to make the subjective into an objective, when in fact, "god" can not be quantified and placed into intellectual boxes to scientifically examine it.

                                      Again, if your only definition of "god" is a physical human-like being, I'll admit, none.

                                     <p>
                                      If you bother reading eastern philosophies, the concept of "god" is more in tune with a type of energy force. A universal consciousness, so to speak.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Those philosophical understandings are being tested and people are trying to devise lab experimentation to test the concepts.

                                      As I said, read into mindfulness, positive thinking, quantum intuition, synchronicity. You can find peer articles that discuss test performed on Buddhist monks to film what they refer to as chi. You can find many other articles out there delving into modern understandings of energy manipulation, focused intent, etc(FYI, focused intent is prayer).

                                      I'm not trying to debate the existence of physical humans that can snap their fingers and preform magick. I do not believe in such. There is no proof. To date, all magick, is nothing more than manipulations of scientific principles.

                                     <p>
                                      I'll agree all day and night, there is no magick man in the sky that watches like a pervert, making judgments based on whether or not you touch yourself, when you're alone.
