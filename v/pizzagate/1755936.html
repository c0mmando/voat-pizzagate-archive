            Who's Chris Farnham? Does AQ mean Al Qaeda? Did he not get the memo about 9/11?
           </p>
           <p>
            Chris Farnham, grasshopper, young child, 9/11 was an inside job. Al Qaeda is a CIA creation and 9/11 was a way to guarantee the American Military/Industrial Complex at least 20 years of a steady income stream.
