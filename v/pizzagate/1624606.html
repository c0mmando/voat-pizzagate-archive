            And how are we to trust anyone here with our findings? By your own statement, Perps may be avidly following these threads. I have pretty much gone dark on this stuff for that reason. There are a few users who I may possibly be comfortable messaging directly, based on their drive and understanding, but I don't know that having an ongoing open discussion or a open crowdsourced investigation is appropriate. Those of us who know how to access it would be better off focusing our efforts on the task at hand rather than teaching others how to get up to speed. If you don't know how to investigate someone or skiptrace, it may be best to find a different avenue of attack.

            Pedophilia and human trafficking is such a wide ranging problem, you may be better off using open source data about already confirmed crimes like in Bosnia in the post war years, the Laura Silsby case, the HSBC VP who got busted, etc. Track down and make a web of connections, look through their linkedin, instagram and facebooks, document all their connections, their travels, job postings and see where there is overlap in staff, mission, or location. You will find that sometimes someone's kid works with someone who also popped up as a person of interest, and likes to travel to known trafficking locations like Ukraine or Haiti or Sudan.

            Perhaps look through corporate logos and charity logos for known pedo symbols and figure out who sits on what boards.

            Once you feel that you have some real solid connections, perhaps reach out to those who have ID'd suspects in the original
