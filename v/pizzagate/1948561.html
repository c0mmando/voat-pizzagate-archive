            "The Committee had received reports of torture and abuse by the police of youth demonstrators and in the framework of counter-terrorism measures, especially against children suspected of belonging to Boko Haram. Such a child was not considered a victim, but a terrorist; the children were not interrogated by the police but by the army, which increased the risk of torture and ill treatment. Was anything being done to ensure that children accused or suspected of terrorism were treated like children by the appropriate authorities? What measures were being adopted to fight torture and ill treatment by the police?"　  Under HRC as SOS she refused to declare Boko Haram as a Terrorist Group.  So we do not go after them then?  This MUST be changed.  Immediately.   Also why is the age for marriage 18 for boys, but 15 for girls?  There is something wrong about this.  18 for both must be pursued.  Are there too many pedophiles hungry for girls and they do not want to give them up?  Why the age difference.  Do not like this at all.
