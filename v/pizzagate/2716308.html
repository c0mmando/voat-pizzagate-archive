This is the wild west of free speech, and many folks here completely despise Reddit because of it\'s censorship. There is a grand tradition of offensive speech here, and Voat goats have been known to deliberately troll noobs to cull the weak and purge those who want it &quot;toned down&quot; to protect people\'s feelings. You can find out more about that by perusing the comments in threads at <a href="https://voat.co/v/MuseumOfVoat">v/MuseumOfVoat</a>.</p>
<p>Two important things about Voat free speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments are sacred. You can say anything you want, so long as it isn\'t actually illegal speech in the USA, copypasta spam, adspam, or doxing of another Voat user.</li>
<li>Submissions are subject to each subverse\'s submission rules, found in the sidebar, which is viewable on mobile if you choose &quot;view desktop site&quot; in your mobile browser. As the Voat User Agreement FAQ states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I submit links to any subverse I want?</strong></p>
<p>Each subverse has its own rules which are usually stated in the respective subverse\'s sidebar. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1>v/Pizzagate is a research only subverse that has more stringent rules than most Voat subs</h1>
<p>We don\'t allow &quot;Share a Link&quot; direct link posts, for example. You have to use the &quot;Discuss&quot; button and paste the link in along with the other information our submission rules require. You can read about why, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2513395">here</a>. We also do not allow unsourced &quot;meta&quot; discussion threads about what you think or feel about a topic (though that is welcome in Comments of any research post).</p>
<p>As one of the most shilled spots on the Internet, we are constantly fighting forum-sliding shitposts meant to confuse and distract and muddy the waters. Our community over the past almost two years of trial and error, has repeatedly voted to restrict submissions such that they:</p>
<p>1.) Clearly state a thesis that directly connects to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite and</p>
<p>2.) Provide supporting links for every major claim. </p>
<p>The sidebar is LOADED with great info. </p>
<p>I and the other mods, <a href="https://voat.co/user/think-">@think-</a> <a href="https://voat.co/user/Ben_Matlock">@Ben_Matlock</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/user/EricKaliberhall">@EricKaliberhall</a>, are ready and willing to help you figure out how to post within the submission rules, and we have a 24 Hour Grace flair we give most rule-breaking posts so the community can help you edit to meet the requirements as well. We do occasionally ban accounts that abuse the 24 Hour Grace flair. We LOVE crowdsourced collaboration strengthening posts with related links and leads. </p>
<p>In the event we do remove a thread, it can always be found in Removed Submissions, which is linked at the very bottom of the sidebar (Voat mods and subverse owners have no ability to permanently remove posts). If it is a post with complex formatting, we try to remember to PM the submitter a copy of the source markdown text in case you want to submit it to our anything-goes sister subverse, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">v/pizzagatewhatever</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome Q-related threads that are plausibly connected to child sex trafficking by the elite, including Satanism, child sacrifice, Spirit Cooking and anything else covered under the definition of Pizzagate found in our sidebar. It\'s up to you to explain the connection and fully explain the Q references, providing all necessary links for users to vet claims. Don\'t assume everyone here is up to speed with Q (though many of us are).</p>
<p>If you would like to keep an eye on all new submissions to <a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening">v/GreatAwakening</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/v/CBTS">v/CBTS</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> it\'s very easy to by adding them to your front page &quot;Set&quot; (See &quot;SETS&quot; under your user profile).

             -- you'll get enough CCP to post pretty quick. Looking forward to seeing your submission. Please make sure you understand our submission rules and the definition of Pizzagate in the sidebar before posting (view desktop site if on mobile). Welcome aboard!

            Why is this still stickied? It's been months. You and many others have the best intentions, but I promise you that this drives people away. Some people may want to contribute, some may be traumatized and want to contribute with time, some may be new and turned off seeing "drama" and fear contributing. Months? Why? Is this really so important that it should be the first thing one sees when they enter? False info can be researched and debunked and downvoated. Shills don't drive people away, this sort if thing does. It's obvious. Look at the shrinking community, "trusted useres" and posts over time. I trusted this community over time some bit ago. I have story to tell, but I've seen a significant decrease in community here and trust. It's power driven and cultish with the mods. I'm discouraged daily when it comes to research here, the community here, and contributing. There used to be so much more and I had hope before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, I rewrote this comment a couple times bc I reported the post and thought I needed to write a comment to do so. However, upon realizing the text box was not part of/necessary to reporting, I rewrote it again. This is discouraging and people DON'T need to see this upon entering. I'm discouraged.

Is this really so important that it should be the first thing one sees when they enter? False info can be researched and debunked and downvoated. Shills don't drive people away, this sort if thing does. It's  obvious. Look at the shrinking community, "trusted useres" and posts over time. I trusted this community over time some bit ago. I have story to tell, but I've seen a significant decrease in community here and trust. It's power driven and cultish with the mods. I'm discouraged daily when it comes to research here, the community here, and contributing. There used to be so much more and I had hope.

            It's been months. Please, why is this still stickied? I promise you that it keeps people away. If you have the best intentions, it keeps people away. Let the community decide on these things. This has been stickied for months! It's crazy.  Maybe people have things to share. Maybe people are afraid to share things. Maybe people see this sort of thing and leave immediately. 2 months? I'm driven away every time I see this. PLEASE, stop looking for drama and rely on the community to recognize false information.  You and anyone can disprove shills. Why is this still stickie? Yes, I'm emotionally invested in this. This community has been a staple for me and an encouraging force until this drama.  Months? Why?

            How do the downvoats lessen on this post over time and why is it still a sticky? I'm a lurker...especially here in this subvoat. I add no new content to the investigation but I rely on this subvoat to keep informed. My account is poorly aged. I'm a shill. I'm a shill that's seen a downgrade. No one cares. I'm a coward bc I don't contribute, but I can still see that people are driven away by this garbage.

            is amazing to me.  Is it you REDDIT people that brought this?  If so god bless you.  It was getting boring in here, trying to read past half the comments being crap and attacks.  Mostly calling others Jews and Niggers and Faggots, not in the friendly ways that happen here but just ugly.  It all seems gone all of a sudden.  What Happened?  Is Decency breaking out ...or are many  bots suddenly gone?

             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRV">
              v/QRV
             </a>
             , I'm not positive why it was set up that way -- maybe ping modmail in that sub and ask? I'm not a mod there. They may have done it so that their posts don't show up in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/all">
              v/all
             </a>
             (the front page of Voat) to avoid drowning it in Q and pissing off the natives who aren't Q followers.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it refers to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , we're the migrated sub that Reddit banned back in November of 2016. :-)

            For being the "Wild West" of free speech...I find it humorous that such a large amount of this community are bitching, moaning and trying to shut down the massive Q following that moved here. There are a shit-ton of intelligent and woke motherfuckers now arriving that aren't any happier than you guys are about the move...so why not just welcome us, share the rules, and shut the fuck up about any views that we may have that differ from yours?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of you cunts think we're all still in High School and you are the seniors...well fuck that.

             I don't think you really understand. Most goats are not "trying to shut down the massive Q following".
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat has been built by the users. Many have helped code the site as volunteers. Many have funded the servers out of their own pockets. They have invested countless hours in building a culture that actually really does tolerate free speech. One in which you don't have to self-censor. Because of this, Voat is constantly under attack from the assholes at Correct the Record, Shareblue, JIDF, and various three letter agencies tasked with controlling the news and public discourse. We've been DDoSed by governments. We've had our servers shut down by governments. We've had our payment processing shut down on all platforms but bitcoin. Therefore many many goats have become very good at spotting disinfo and thought policing by nefarious operatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are only something like 400,000 unique Voat users and Q just sent a huge group of people who expect self-censorship and moderator censorship of certain kinds of speech. Many helpful goats tried to warn those moderators they were ignoring Voat's minimal rules. They also tried to warn the new folks that their mods had set up the sub to keep them from participating fully here (both TA and QRV) by limiting their ability to gain CCP. That behavior -- and their baseless characterization of Voat's native and longstanding Q research mods as corrupt -- immediately convinced many Voat folk that this was another deep state psyop. Goats don't stand by and do nothing in that kind of situation. They defended the local Q board, and called out the disingenuous and sketchy behavior by the "leaders" of the new subs. When those leaders responded by deleting and banning, the goats lowered their horns, pawed up the dirt and charged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of that happened, incidentally, BEFORE Q asked Codemonkey to make
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/QRV">
              v/QRV
             </a>
             . Now, why would he do that if he thought Voat was trying to shut down his following? Think logically. There is a really good reason he might. Two, actually...
            </p>
            <p>
             1)  The Awakening needs to go further -- people need to stop blindly following "thought leaders" like Neon, Corsi, etc. If they don't, the long term success of Q's operation is nil. Maybe Q sent the Redditors to the goatfold because he doesn't want an army of sheep. People need to grow horns, get nimble, and learn to chew tougher stuff than clover. Voat is just about the only place online you are going to get that. (Except maybe the chans. But unlike the chans, Voaters are accountable through their Comment History, so you can get to know them. Voat is actually a family of sorts).
            </p>
            <p>
             2)  There are wolves among the sheep, and Q knows the goats will cull them out of the flock. Neon already got a taste of that. Corsi was BTFOed by Voat goats.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been a Q researcher since November 1, 2017...just a couple of days after Q's first drop...looooong before Reddit had ever heard of Q. A year prior to that, I went through the Reddit pizzagate ban and migration (though I wasn't on Reddit long before the ban; only for the Podesta email leak discussions). I know what it's like to be hazed by goats. I know what it's like to be under attack from shitstirring shills trying to tear down the pizzagate community with their lies, disinfo BS, grooming of users followed by bullying and doxing...and have sharp horned goats help me fight that shit and stop it dead in its tracks. I've learned a great deal from foul-mouthed assholes who turned out to be lovers of liberty well-equipped to defend it using logic, critical thinking, razor-sharp intelligence and powerful evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are reading the situation completely wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should be asking, why did Q make Voat the official home for the Redditors after all this went down?

                <strong>
                 Just want to point out this new Breadcrumb anon has poor grammar and word choice...not likely to be anything but a LARP
                </strong>
                . Several instances, but this was the most egregious:
               </p>
               <pre><code>AG Sessions cannot look like an impartial player that is out to get all former Obama team members as we need him for other important work.
</code></pre>
               <p>
                Someone who is impartial is NOT out to get anyone. Just sayin'.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, there is no way Trump would declare martial law. That kind of ham-handed power grab would be an admission of weakness; totally unlike the way he operates, which is usually quietly and behind the scenes, until he tweets the resulting accomplishment. These "revelations" seem more like stuff an arrogant SJW believes Trump fans want to hear/believe, so that when they don't happen, people will be disillusioned."

                <p>
                 A couple of thoughts...  QAnon had not yet provided the dozens of proofs of close association with Trump at the time I made that remark demonstrating he is not a LARP, so my view obviously changed.  Also, this was before alphabravo mysteriously disappeared, after expressing how "busy" he was "at work" and pleading for others to continue his efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If I'm not mistaken, it was also before Q got his tripcode in place. We should dig back through all the breadcrumbs anon posts and see which ones made it onto the Q-verified "map" and if any didn't. That might be interesting.

                  No thoughts yet about alphabravo. I’m trying to understand what’s going on because I didn’t see this post. I have never heard of Q being breadcrumb anon. This is interesting. Which part did you change your mind about?

                 <p>
                  I’m just waking up and see there is a lot of reading to understand this. So before I do, which part are you wanting my thoughts on?

                 <p>
                  Q even hinted about that earlier on and told us not to worry. There are some things that have to be done for Trump to bypass things that the deepstate would use to stop him every step of the way. Traditional ways of doing things won’t work in this situation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When it comes to martial law, it doesn’t have to mean administration weakness at all. It means being smart enough to get thru the deep state bullshit and taking care of business.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Like Q said, don’t worry. They will be in control. I believe that. It would only be done if it’s something necessary. Trust the plan.

                Oh yeah.  Duh.  Sorry had surgery a couple days ago and was foggy on painkillers.  No more of those things.  I hate the way that shit makes me feel.  Blech.  Rather deal with minor pain.

             Cool. Thanks xenu. Have an upvoat. When you get 10, you can make a submission about this. Just do it as a "Discuss" post and describe what's there a little bit per our sidebar submission rules. :-)

             This is a good question, enki. We could use a fresh post reviewing all the data sources on this.

             may have a stronger sense of which numbers come out of which agencies. The lack of consistent tracking of this from state to state is one of the most frustrating things about investigating child sex trafficking (and a strong clue powerful people don't WANT clear metrics on the subject).

            Wow, i hope I wasn't one the members targeted for purging since I occassionally  object to vulgar language and name calling here.  Its not that Im a prude what with a hippie, free love background from the 1960s. Indeed, in 1965 my English class thesis was about the use of the word "fuck"  in Salingers classic, Catcher In The Rye.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have tried to encourage a bit more  professionalism  in the commentaries because I wanted to see Pizzagate  taken seriously.   Its not unlike Judge Kavanaugh who required a certain look for his female clerks which apparently consisted of wearing a business suit to work instead of dressing  for a Saturday night  dance club scene. And this was because the work of the court is super serious and important. And how  you dress after work is nobody's business.   Bill Clinton's White House was roundly criticized for its frat party environment which we all know corresponded with a total disregard of the law;, the reverbations are still with us today.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I hope our newcomers  appreciate the seriousness of the work that is done on this subverse. Posters and lurkers alike devote hours researching  and  reading and commenting  in order to enlighten one another  and the public at large about pedophelia and the abuse of power.  Save juvenile antics for another  setting because such antics are in fact  fun and can brighten a day after  dealing with the depravity  we are exposed to here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clever repartee  is always welcome.  And already we are seeing  excellant contributions  from the newbies.   I hope the 34 million  hits Q was getting per month  before being shut dwn translates into awesome numbers for Pizzagate.

             Yes! That's what you get when you combine freedom of speech with crowdsourced citizen investigation. I just wish there were more meme makers and info warriors here taking advantage of our glorious trove to spread it far and wide. :-)

TGA refugee here
Redpilled after 9/11, further redpilled in Nov 2017 due to Q drops. 
Learned about pizzagate during discord chats. I apologize for having my head up my A** for too long.  I had no idea this board existed and no idea this research was taking place.
            <br/>
            I want these bastards caught and punished. I am sickened and saddened our children are being abused and no one is talking about it or doing anything about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to be a meme warrior to combat these vile, evil pedophiles/pedovores.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope I can become a great researcher with you, a great part of your team and God willing a great asset to bringing down the elite pedo's.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could use some up votes so I am allowed to add content soon.  I will continue to lurk and read and learn your board rules so I can be a full contributor.
            <br/>
            PEACE!

            Vindicator, I would like to thank you for the warm welcome, and the useful tips/hints.  Many of the other Voat goats I’ve read seem hellbent on proving what a terrific smart ass they can be.  Which is fine. I can be an insulting smart ass too, so whatever, I really don’t sweat it.  Anyway, I am Redd🖕t refugee, and new to Voat, but I am not new to pizza/pedogate, Q, the deep state, Satanism, gov corruption, etc, etc.  I don’t post much, but when I do I try to ask legitimate questions, or contribute some sort of value.  I’m here for the same reasons I was on redd🖕t, because I want the truth, I want to help spread that truth, I want to expose these sick freaks to the masses and bring them crashing down, and most importantly, the children.  I can’t sit on the sidelines and do nothing knowing that those children are being abused, raped, tortured, and murdered/sacrificed in the most vile of ways.  I have children, so it really hits home for me, as I’m sure it does for many others.  Anyway, thanks again for the open armed warm welcome, and I will do my best to contribute, or be of service in some way.  WWG1WGA

            There is a girl on xhamsterlive.com right now who is covered in bruises, AshleyDin. Maybe someone who knows about this stuff should check into it to see if she has them voluntarily or not.

            Hi local researchers, apparently there is valuable work here, once one finds themselves through the maze of frontpage noisemakers.
            <br/>
            Your work is much appreciated and a lot of the ex-reddit newbs are already familiar with much of it, just can't join the discussion yet, but we are learning our way around here.

            Excuse me, but I had received reports in the past that Voat hosted CP. I checked into it and it was true that some subvoats did indeed host animated CP. Do you care to comment? Doesn't this go against everything we're supposed to stand for?

             Sure, Angelis. Subverses on Voat are independent of each other. I can't control what is posted outside of
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             . Voat is a free speech platform -- one of the last in the world -- and hentai is not illegal, because it's not real kids. It's foul AF, and those subs are full of shitty little pedos. If you see real child porn posted there, please do Voat a favor and report it to PuttItOut, the Voat admin. You're welcome to let me know, and I will also report it. The users of those subs have repeatedly attacked
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and spammed us with disgusting child rape cartoons many times, which makes a lot extra work for us mods having to remove it.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, I did not come here to waste time on impotent pervs living in their mother's basements, jacking off to hentai. I came here to investigate and document organized child abuse and trafficking connected to the global elite, who use it to maintain their grip on power. That is what Pizzagate is. That is what we focus on.

              Thanks for the great (and fast) response. It is indeed a concerning matter, but I'm glad to know no one here is making excuses for it or defending it, that certainly makes me feel better. It's quite ironic to be honest that voat/pizzagate's neighbors are pedosexuals themselves and it doesn't surprise me in the least that they attacked this forum. In fact, did someone document their attacks on this forum? It might prove useful as leverage against their sick subverse.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am concerned about people who stumble across that stuff to be honest, who didn't know what "loli" meant (like I used to), etc. I mean that stuff is scientifically proven to be brain-damaging (luckily it's also shown to be reversible damage).
             </p>
             <p>
              You know, I once knew a guy whom I suspect was one of those pedos living in his mother's basement, and he was also a "Satanist" by his own estimation. It's just crazy how naturally those two things go hand-in-hand, and yet I met this dude when I was in high school before I was redpilled about any "conspiracy theories".

               You could go dig for them in the Removed Submissions and Removed Comments section of

               , which is linked at the bottom of the sidebar. They happened quite a while ago -- over a year, if I'm not mistaken. I don't know how many pages back removals are stored. You could possibly find them via a SearchVoat.co search of "PiNaH" limited to

               Well, it's not surprising, really, from a theological perspective. Not only does Scripture repeatedly emphasize how important kids are to God (the ability to create new souls for Heaven being our most God-like human quality), but by becoming incarnate as a baby himself, God set human beings far above the angels, who have far superior intellects and are not subject to the needs of the mortal body. Tradition has it, that's what pissed off Heaven's most powerful angel, Lucifer and caused him to flip God the bird. So seducing, corrupting and hurting kids is the single most potent way to hurt God and thwart his plans.

              I believe you have to post your pics to maga.img then post the link on your posts. Other users can then download the image to spread the memes themselves.

             We have the world's greatest trove of research into the pedo elite. Voat had to remove it's native Search feature due to massive DDoS efforts that exploited it, but you can rummage at will by going to

              https://SearchVoat.co
             </a>
             clicking the options button, and typing in any keyword. Be sure to click the "search post body" box. You can limit the search to our subverse if you want. There are multiple pizzagate subverses, but most are unmoderated and may contain disinfo, which our submission rules are designed to minimize as much as possible. :-)
