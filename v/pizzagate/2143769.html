            This is the same guy who ran for congress. He also last week declared that he was the head of the a sovereign state and beholden to laws of no man on Facebook.  That along with regular indirect threats to state and federal officials could explain- justifiably- why he may have drawn the attention of various agencies. Just sayin.

             You must be spot on with this post Honeybee.  Reason: you have 3 people attacking you! and especially when equineluvr joins in on the attack we know for sure you must be right.  :) - all we need now is DonkeyButtHole to complete the set.

              to be a reliable and very well informed Voater.  I take the point that anyone e displaying what we have all come to know as suspect symbolism is deserving of scrutiny and a degree of suspicion - no matter how tenuous the link, it needs inspection and the right to question has to be defended.  For a mod to delete comments because they contrast with their own opinion has to be questioned.  I trust nothing and no one until supported with credible and researchable evidence - and won't be persuaded to something being true purely on the basis of their reputation or popularity, irrespective.

               Fair enough, but I don't get the all out attack on Honeybee, there are ways of saying things without putting people down.  I personally was pleased to see Honeybee join voat, I think she is proven to be one of the 'good ones' and a great researcher trying to expose the elite pedos.  My mother hen instincts came out.

                I hear you.  I still don't think it was an all out attack - just an argument that degenerated into battles of sarcasm - in fairness, I think there was more use of crudity and backhanded insult ("are you on crack") on the part of HB than esoteric, and not the balanced debate rhetoric I've come to expect from a mod.  Either way, these arguments do nothing except serve to distract from the subject at hand and are timewasting and unnecessary imo.  Not sure HB needs your 'Mother Hen' protection but fully understand the instinct! Peace.

            He didn't USE them, that's your error and dillusion, get over it, you hardly understand esoteric symbology and how it's used and when it needs to be scrutinized, I don't drive down the street and see a triangle sign saying "go slow" and try to convince people the illuminati is behind it, nor do I look at symbols that have been used for centuries in different cultures that mean very different things the each one and call them all Jews or Nazis,  it's all about application and context, you just don't get it, or you enjoy endless banter.

            I'm all set with this attack, you have no idea what your are talking about! Of course I understand symbols, I have MANY videos addressing symbols and their importance to how all this is connected and how elites and pedophiles use them, but in this case YOU ARE OVER ANALYZING MINUTIAE

            I have spent longer and more hours, if you really were that informed and understanding of when and where to apply your understanding, you would have better posts, more positive engagement, and possibly people would take you more seriously. I'm not trying to be an asshole, but you are way out of line and off the map.

            Already told you that is a montage of spiritual and national symbols inviting everyone to take part in Justice Day, the symbols have nothing to do with the event to support his friend Don Bailey, how many freaking times do I have to post that for you to understand?

            Symbols are pointless, it's the intent behind them, not everything is evil, take a break and have some punch and pie before you pull a hamstring...

             is a disinfo shill, comments on VOAT are sacrosanct, and are almost invariably not to be deleted; this is necessary for the rest of VOAT to continue to allow PG to be here.

            <p>
             Please resubmit your comment if you wish,

              What's the apology for? this user is obviously not conducting themselves in a manner that is intended to build the body of information, or grow the community - they are going out of their way to pick a fight with the mod team.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just another way to distract all of us away from the primary task.
              <br/>
              If it were an honest user mistake I'd apologise myself, but this is obvious in it's intentions to cause issues and division.
              <br/>
              My response to the user would me lurkmoar, not an apology.

            He can ask the mental health facility fora form to complain that there's been a human rights violation. You can only do that within 72 hours and they try to make sure they don't have any copies on hand so you have to know what you want and ask for it, which is impossible if you don't know it's an option. He should be able to leave within 72 hours, by the time he sees the doctor and they observe him a while. I just don't think if I were him I would tell my doctor about some research work when it sounds so out there. I would just go for 72 hours and if I really wanted to be medicated I would stay because sometimes that happens to me and I do need it. I only ever filed a human rights violation once because they were anoying the shit out of me giving everyone pet names so we crazies wouldn't know who they were talking about. They also would look up any information they can find about the patient online to do "pre-evaluations" but they were using that information to make up fucking names for people and it just got me to think I was going insane like what why are you treating me like this, is it because I'm a shitlord? I don't even think I qualify. Anyway the human rights person didn't come until the next week and by that time I wasn't even mad anymore I just wanted to leave.

7301. Persons who may be subject to involuntary emergency examination and treatment
(a) Persons Subject. -- Whenever a person is severely mentally ill and in need of immediate treatment, he may be made subject to involuntary emergency examination and treatment. A person is severely mentally disabled when, as a result of mental illness, his capacity to exercise self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and social relations or to care for his own personal needs is so lessened that he poses a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself.
(b) Determination of Clear and Present Danger. --
(1) Clear and present danger to others shall be shown by establishing that within the past 30 days the person has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another and that there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repealed. If, however, the person has been found incompetent to be tried or has been acquitted by reason of lack of criminal responsibility all charges arising from conduct involving infliction of or attempt to inflict substantial bodily harm on another, such 30-day limitation shall not apply so long as an application for examination and treatment is filed within 30 days after the date of such determination or verdict. In such case, if clear and present danger to others may be shown by establishing that the conduct charged in the criminal proceeding did occur, and that there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. For the purpose of this section, a clear and present danger of harm to others may be demonstrated by proof that the person has made threats of harm and has committed acts in furtherance of the threat to commit harm.
(2) Clear and present danger to himself shall be shown by establishing that within the past 30 days:
(i) the person has acted in such manner as to evidence that he would be unable, without care, supervision and the continued assistance of others, to satisfy his need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter. or self-protection and safety, and that there is a reasonable probability that death, serious bodily injury or serious physical debilitation would ensue within 30 days unless adequate treatment were afforded under this act; or
(ii) the person has attempted suicide and that there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment is afforded under this act. For the purposes of this subsection, a clear and present danger may be demonstrated by the proof that the person has made threats to commit suicide aid bas committed acts which are in furtherance or the threat to commit suicide; or
(iii) the person has substantially mutilated himself or attempted to mutilate himself substantially and that there is the reasonable probability of mutilation unless adequate treatment is afforded under this act. For the purposes of this subsection, a clear and present danger shall be established by proof that the person has made threats to commit mutilation and has committed acts which are in furtherance of the threat to commit mutilation.

              He lies on this video. He posted on Facebook the night before that he was going live at 3. But it garners more of the conspiracy theorists if he says I just posted 15 minutes ago that I was going live and the police are already there. 
Read his posts. The disbarred dude was suing Satan? Who thinks that would work out well but someone with some delusions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I've seen lists of people he's called out by name repeatedly in vulgar ways and told them he was going to get them on Facebook. Most are in local, state and federal positions and some of those he has maligned the most share his last name. So- excuse me if pleas that this is done for peace and love strike me as manipulative to keep his 18 followers brain washed.

              You aren't helping with "awareness" or anything else with your activities on voat.  In fact, it's just the opposite.  This leads me to conclude that you are here as a forum slider.  You are diluting the real information available here to either draw clicks to your videos or shield the guilty from further observation.  If you truly care about PG justice, stop with the bullshit posts and focus on the items in the Executive Summary.

                  Right. We can be adversaries if that's what think is best.  But I guess we always will be if you think submitting documents in a US court citing Satan as a defendant is not the mark of insanity, much less absurdity.

                  oftotc hahahaha where did you come from? CPPong I am guessing! You are a creep from the swamp! - Honeybee is the most legitimate mod here, imo - I HOPE people SEE EVERYTHING she has posted!  So glad you're here Honeybee, thankyou for all the hard work and dedication to exposing these elite pigs.  I became aware of pizzagate through some of your videos - You are opening so many eyes through your investigative work. Its easy to laugh at these losers who are only smart 'in their own eyes' but when put in the light look ridiculously low IQ - I am looking forward to whats coming next because the fan has been spinning for a while now!

              Problem is there are too many shills\JA,HRC,JP lovers joining voat to ridicule or mock anyone who has a bit of truth or credibility. Unfortunately, like the Mayor of London said, we will have to get used to it and live with it!  I have decided that if I am being 'attacked' here my reply is going to be 'crickets' then block.  - Now to Andy Ostrowski, I feel so sorry for this poor guy, I hope they release him soon, the longer they keep them in the worse it is for him.  Does he have family/people to vouch for him? or are they the ones requesting the mental health evaluation.  What can people do to help?

               He has family but he has insulted, berated, manipulated, publicly used the most derogatory of language toward them and ruined many holidays and get together due to his self centered obsession. He has many issues and will choose a battle against even those not present to defend themselves just to create chaos. For someone who says he speaks for peace and love he inflicts a lot of pain and causes irreparable heartbreak to those he was close to. He needs help. Stop buying into his fantasy.

            This is awful! The sick system is so deep and webs out everywhere... only God can help us. These people trying to do the right things and all they get is a living nightmare in return.

             The right thing? Specifically- list what Andy was DOING that qualifies as right? Do you read his trashing of others continuously on Facebook?  How is sitting alone posting rambling manifestos doing the right thing?

            Arrested on a mandatory mental health evaluation, what a nightmare. I have been called crazy by friends and family on numerous occasions during the last year. Yes, since I read the Podesta mails on wikileaks. Luckily I do have a few friends left... 
I have great sympathy for this man, must be a nightmare to convince "the government" that you are sane, when "they" want you to be insane.
