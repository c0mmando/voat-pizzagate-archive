            Thank you for this post, I agree there is more to the 'boy lover' triangle than pedophilia for some who use it.

            In this drawing of an MK Ultra laboratory by survivor Lynn Schirmer, it's possible there is a quick sketch of a  "BL" triangle above and to the right of the projection screen, I can't tell, maybe someone else can.  In any case, there are circular and square shaped spirals:

            Not triangles, but your post reminded me of the strange drawing of a girl seen in the abandoned strip club video,

            for possible child/adult trafficking.  I thought the image also portrayed programming, even the letters CUTE GIRL look computer-related:

             The Throne Chair on the sturdy riser is for the most Senior ranking individual at the Rape ceremony.  It's all mixed up, their masonic symbolism with the satanic, the masks.  They also throw in a grab bag of religious symbols, very ecumenical. They are not all bright people.  A little horned ritual, always necessary to sanitize the beginning, goes a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Throne is masonic and not make shift.  They like that style and color of chair.  The riser is an essential feature, it makes small men seem large.

            Thank you.  I had the suspicion that actually all Pedo/lover logos were actually satanic mind control stuff. This corroborates. Great work

            It’s so simple, it’s easily debunked with a snarky skeptical comment, but the fact remains. Great post, and great comments. Also: what a poignant cartoon!

            The biggest paedophile network I have found while investigating Pizzagate is the West Coast art and design community. It's a contiguous block of child swapping from Seattle to Southern California - along with Hollywood I reckon it could be the origin of the pizzacode  vocabulary.

            Triangle trivet sure looks like the boy lovers sign to me, and the prices for his cheap junk looks like a money laundering scheme.

            I agree that the triangle is multi layered in context and meaning and not restricted to pedophilia. Pedos use it but it has a broader meaning.

            Cool theory. It doesn't change the fact, pedos are using it their own ends. From what I have seen the most coveted form of mind control for (((them))) is multiple split personally disorder. When done right, the personalities have no idea what the other is doing, or has done. Two good examples are the green river killer and Ted bundy. They can pass lie detectors with flying colors because of the blackouts.
