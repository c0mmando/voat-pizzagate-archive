<h1>POLLING</h1>
<p>On a base-level comment, type any of these numbers you agree with, in any order.</p>
<p>1 - Rules are fine, don\'t change them</p>
<p>2 -  Mods are doing a good job, don\'t remove them</p>
<p>3 - Mods aren\'t doing enough, and need to recruit more mods, and remove more submissions.</p>
<p>4 - Mods are not doing a good job, we need to talk about removing them</p>
<p>5 - Rules are not fine, we need to change them </p>
<p>6 - Mods need to lighten up and <a href="https://kek.gg/i/76R43q.jpeg">let more things slide</a>, let\'s talk about that.</p>
<p>7 - Try no rules and no moderation for a couple of weeks  
</p>
<p>8 - No rules and no moderation in perpetuity. </p>
<h1>Millennial_Falcon</h1>
<p>Millennial_Falcon seems to be a popular whipping boy here.  Those that show up in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods">/v/pizzagatemods</a> with complaints tend to target him almost exclusively.  The people attacking him seem to think they\'re not alone, but fail to provide any evidence of wrongdoing.  
</p>
<p>Keep in mind, your accusations and support for them will not just be taken at face value, like every accuser so far seems to have expected.  They will be researched thoroughly, and if there is merit to them, something WILL be done.  Please feel free to be the first to provide evidence of wrongdoing on his part.</p>

            10 enforce the rules consistently and fairly. Don't use the rules to punish people who float ideas you don't like while allowing the same rules to be broken over and over.  If you can't do that change the rules to fit how you are moderating.  Rule 3 is broken all the time and ignored.  Rule one says it has to be about sex abuse by elites but that is frequently broken.  Yet both those rules have been used to delete posts I made.

            then they can
            <strong>
             improve

            their post and resubmit until it meets quality standards.
           </p>
           <p>
            That way, when a person comes here with an actually good thread that goes deep and explores something important, the visibility and stickability (how long it stays near the top) will be at its maximum. Thus, when newcomers come here to figure out "What's Pizzagate all about" they'll be bombarded with high quality evidence and discussion rather than weak threads they can easily shrug off as just random noise.

            Go ask your mum to spoonfeed you little boy. I'm done. I've already shown you, proven you wrong, YES WRONG in every accusation you made (you seem to have the memory of a slug). I've shown you the links, I've told you where to find them. The burden is on you to look it up. No more free lunch for losers like you.

            Yes. I noticed about a month ago that he was quite even-handed and able to separate his personal opinions from what's best for the sub. He also doesn't obsess over stuff, tries to help other people, and avoids flame wars.

            Just to name a few . This post was deleted within a min of me posting it . ( typical during MF hours) I thought the post was relevant to at least research the kids family etc. I decided to continue that research on my own . Found out some interesting things about this young man that lives in Utah too! It would of been nice to have this post left up so others could help research as well . Isn't that what we do, research? 19 year olds having sex with toddlers and animals isn't something that happens  in
            <br/>
            " normal " family's ! These people are bred like this for a reason ! As we have learned , these people like to keep this crap in the family . So why delete it MF ? Before anyone could even see it ? I have pages of relevant posts that have been deleted by you . This is hindering our potential here big time IMO.
            <br/>
            Oh and I will
Just bring this up too .  Calling me a   Homophobic after posting the " Gay Manifesto " and deleting my post , was way out of line . I don't care if it was the " heterosexual " manifesto,( WE SHOULD BE ALOUD TO KNOW ABOUT THIS)  it was relevant as anything , given that this was recognized in congressional records even ! That's my 2 cents . I have more than that if you need anymore " proof " from me . I will just have to sift through all my posts that were deleted and read his very lame excuses for deleting them .

We could make a never ending documentary about this shit and I have a video computer coming in a couple of weeks and I just might take that task on. Make this shit viral.

             Literally no reason for anyone at all to think your first-linked submission has fuck-all to do with the podesta elites, or any systemic anything.  Even if it does,

              your title didn't say that

            I've shown 4 posts that were deleted in the pizzagate mod sub. MF isn't doing his job - that post lists 4 deleted submissions. There was nothing needed to support any of them. MF didn't read them.

            I think you sound a lot like John Podesta actually. Similarities in ad hominem attacks, style, tone lack of logic, etc. You must be him.

            I don't have burdens of being an asshole like you do. Never studied women studies, I studied the sciences. I didn't have the pics so I can't mail them to you, can I? You act like a 13 year old kid, not an adult.

              that the mod has to go. Doing the job or not he is divisive to the community and it's suffering as a result. He would need to be replaced though because the spam complaints here, although not as bad as a year ago, aren't without merit. Maybe give one of the regulars a go who isn't on any "side".

            All we need is somebody with some common sense to treat them like guidelines instead of rules that require the post to be accurate down to the millimeter. No mod will please everybody but we had asshattery going on around here that was just off scale to a degree that the sub can't survive under. Somebody that understands pizzagate and means well can make it work.

               I don't know, exactly. It happened gradually I guess, starting with
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/she">
                @she
               </a>
               if you were here for all that nonsense. Basically a big controversy with a bad mad, and he helped farm public outcry until she was removed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since then, he used his gain in influence from that event to dethrone other mods, except many of those instances the mod in question didn't do anything wrong and instead punished one of his SBBH gang for somehow bullying or manipulating a sub's content. They've evolved into what I feel is a pretty nasty force... while claiming to be good guys looking out for us. It's just a shame to see the way voat has gone.

                 J stands for Janitor. They can remove comments and maybe posts, I don't think they can alter anything else about the sub.

                 D is Designer. I don't know what it does, probably CSS-related stuff.

                 This sub is a joke, because kingkongwaswrong invited Crensch and heygeorge to mod, and Crensch invited kevdude. This means kingkongwaswrong was friends with Crensch (SBBH) before pizzagate even began. This sub has been a joke and was controlled from the beginning.

                 It's sad what happens to this website, when long ago it had immense potential to bring change to not only the United States but more likely the whole of Europe also.

                   All the mods were invited by kevdude/Crensch or by somebody who kevdude/Crensch invited, and seeing as kevdude/Crensch both engage in nasty activity (removing mods from subs with no decent reason, telling voaters to avoid chat platforms with lies, etc)...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think you should take a hard look at kevdude and Crensch in the future (and me, also! Don't trust anyone and you'll probably do well.)

            I'd love to think the same of myself, but, the fact of the matter is that I'm not so sure I can trust myself to curb how I feel about certain topics, to allow for fair and non-controversial moderating.

             Mother fucker you don't have to worry about it. The only thing they knew about you was that you suck great mod dick. They didn't realize that you had an infection on your lips though. Over the last few weeks I fixed that though and they know what the fuck you are. You won't ever be a mod around here, at least not for more than a day, because with the information I have on you that I can post I will blow you so far out of this place they will feel you land when you hit the ground 100 miles away.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I got more. That is not all I have. As much mod dick as you sucked today you might be expecting it sometime soon you mod dick sucking blood drinking parasite on the asshole of humanity. I can crank up the tractor for you mother fucker.

            You guys, Crensch will always be an asshole because he’s one of the board owners. I have no idea why he chose that since he doesn’t give a shit. It must be about control. Anyway, don’t hold your breath on that fag.

            Normal, well-balanced people have feelings and empathy, something you seem to lack. You might want to check that out with a psychiatrist. Oh, I didn't take women's studies, as you stated elsewhere, I studied the sciences. Wrong again. Make sure to get checked out for psychotic delusions as well. You aren't the good kind of crazy for sure.

            I didn't submit anon, I deleted my account and I'm not going to go sifting through the mod log for posts I did a year ago. I've shown post that were deleted and relevant. He even admitted he doesn't read before deleting. I'm not going to put in hours of my valuable time to get my posts deleted because someone doesn't even read properly. I've got you blocked, I won't be responding again because all you want to do is argue and accuse me of being some user I'm not. You don't use logic, you don't back up your claims but you expect me to dig up things from a year ago in a deleted mod log? No. You lose this argument, like all the other ones. You've lost all credibility in my view.

            Wait a minute. Why do you have to have a person that publicly stated that they didn't want Falcon gone? What does that have to do with mod capability? That is taking a side also.

             argosciv is a good egg in my opinion, but he has some occult interests that he has talked about that have spurred a lot of angst from several users. The stress of that would go up dramatically if he had to pull people's posts.

             I think we need to mod some users that have submitted research and have ot taken a side in the drama. No one that has defended MF and no one that has attacked him. Let's see how a neutral group of folks enforce the rules as written.

            Number 4, new mod. Thanx for making us put a target on our back after you don't get rid of the mod. Totally uncool. Now you can take it to the "lets talk about it phase" in which people won't speak up again except for the suck up argosciv, the one that does that blood drinking stuff that is always following you guys around, (shudder) , and probably some alts in favor of the mod. Something seriously stinks about the way this is all going down around here.

            I want my comments added to my vote at the top of the page too. I want people to see how I feel about having to do this publicly. So uncool.

             I have considered the idea of trying no moderation for a period of time, so people can see what would happen, but I don't really think the loudest of the complainers are genuine (and some of them are mentally ill), and I don't think the majority of users should be punished for the behavior of a few shills and lunatics.

              Kinda not terribly happy with the amount of users responding here so far.  I'm debating turning the sub to private for some period of time just so they'll wake up and weigh in.  Probably a bad idea, but it crossed my mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you like any of the other ideas presented?

                You always complain you have no time to read over posts before you delete them and you want to concentrate on the summary (which is good by the way). I've never been vocal about you before but you seem to not give a shit about deleting things on some power trip. You need to be disciplined at a very minimum because you are out of control. I'm a fair person, always have been but your calls have been terrible. Imagine if someone pulled down your PG summary and just dismissed your complaints.

             Not unless you add somebody to take the slack because that is too close to your "two weeks of guaranteed chaos without a mod" idea. I consider this a malicious move unless you appoint someone else. I suggest

             <p>
              Are you even familiar with basic troubleshooting procedure?  You change
              <em>
               one
              </em>
              thing.

             <p>
              Perhaps you should be careful what you wish for.

               Bullshit. "test" what? "Test" the fact that we know this place will be hell without enough mods? For somebody that is always calling people stupid that is really a stupid idea. Go ahead. Polish off what little tiny scrap of reputation you have left. People will cuss you every breath of the way and this sub will finally heave out what is left of its breath. What a vindictive move that is. Maybe you and falcon really are the same people?

               And the users in this sub didn't "make a deal" with you to run rough shod over this place and turn it into hell for two weeks on purpose so go ahead and make that deal with the devil. It will polish off your rep at voat for good.

            Why talk about it? Just get rid of Falcon. I want him replaced. Problem solved. You really expect people to vote in public on this comfortably? That is why voting systems are private. So that people cannot see who they vote for. This is not a legitimate voting session. This is more like extortion because people will not speak their mind publicly on this.

                 Oh?  And how long will the VPN/TOR sock-puppet votes be counted before putt can ban the offending "users"?
                </p>
                <p>
                 You force COMMENTS so the users can have their account history available to look at - like the guy that has zero submissions and 3 comments in the last 29 days.  If I were a user of this sub I wouldn't want that vote to count, would you?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm just a mod, so I put the vote in the submission.
                </p>

              Self explanatory. Voting systems are anonymous for privacy reasons. People do not like for everybody to see who they vote for for various reasons and of course retribution is a primary reason. This is fundamental. Needs no explanation.

              I will say again for clarity: I am not arguing against any topic of discussion.  I'm arguing against a tactic used by the "nazi ladyboys" in their various alt accounts - repost something that's been posted 2 or 3 times to date.  Then try and tag a legitimate article on banning circumcision to a myth.  This has nothing to do with Jews or any other specific religion.  If the same thing were being done against another religion I would raise the same concerns.  And, I never disputed the veracity of the source article.

                  The WHOLE website. Prove it Alinsky Rules For Radicals boy. I want to see every single member praise your dime a dozen submission. Every last one. The whole membership list. Everybody with a user name. I want to see them praising your name. Didn't happen. You are so full of fucking shit its not even god damn funny anymore. I am so glad you got flushed out of your fucking fox hole so everybody can see you.

             I moved away from the board after having posts deleted despite what I felt were meeting the rules. This means that there is subjectivity in the admin. The forum should decide whether a post has traction, not the moderators. The moderators should be there to enforce rules where they are
             <em>
              clearly
             </em>
             broken and when other Voaters complain about a post

           <hr/>
           <p>
            I guess since we are already in the firing squad line as dragonkiller put it we may as well technically say "number 4" and see if

            made a damn good point too. Nobody is willing to do this publicly because it is like giving these narcissists a list of people to harass. Just another reason hardly anybody is speaking.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            We can watch for our amusement until the end and see how crensch justifies ignoring us all again, shake our head at the "rules discussion" and know that nothing will change, again....

            We need to find a place to go and get the fuck out of here. These people are probably getting paid or work for intel anyway to screw up this place. I don't know where but its over due. This might be enough of this shit show for me for a while I think.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            There are places we can go because I have seen them but I don't know if I want to screw with setting one up. I would like to totally get away from the voat voting system all together if I actually go to the trouble of setting up something.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I noticed that several people are missing in the last couple of weeks did they go to another place or just say fuck it?

            These mods really think people are going to show up to do this with a public vote and have their vote known so they can later be targeted for harassment too. What a bunch of bullshit. Nobody much going to vote in this public freak show you have going on and that is obvious.

            needs to go too but as you can see nobody wants to get exposed by saying so publicly. Speaking a truth around here is like lining up for a firing squad in a room full of power obsessed maniacs. No wonder hardly anybody showed for this spectacle.

                  Sort of strange for a person like you that trades mostly in insult and opinion. A person who also claims that they let the votes and the community decide. You have a non answer, insult, and opinion for every time you are wrong, which is often.

            I've taken different stances on this in the past, but overall I feel like the mods are doing a decent job. The
            <em>
             real
            </em>
            issue IMO, is that voat isn't the right platform for pg research.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are users who wish to read and keep current with new leads and updates, and there are users who wish to contribute and publish their own findings. Researchers don't always immediately know if a potential lead is worth looking into, if it is ultimately pg related, if it is irrelevant/unimportant; and except for the poster, nobody knows if a thread is misinformation or meant to be a distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat serves a good purpose and has allowed us all the get this far and uncover as much as we have, but in the end it falls short of being what we need to collaborate and investigate potential leads.

             I'll add your votes to the OP.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree with your words.  Voat was never Ideal, it was simply the best of the available options.

             I just wrote
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/2396850">
              this
             </a>
             , and while you may not agree with the subject-matter of my example, the methodology seems sound.  Are there any flaws to people adopting that here?

            I don't understand why my friends posted about tunnels at St. Charles Seminary, for me, as I am unable to do so, and it was deleted more than once. I  had some solid information there? It is about as "Pizzagate" as it gets?

            I'm seeing "leave posts up"
           </p>
           <p>
            To do something like this we'd need maybe a metric fuckton more mods that would be willing to do such things, I think.  Then again, I'm not really sure on our current manpower level.

             It's only Falcon and I modding these days, but I think with a couple of additional janitors --
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/think-">
              @think-
             </a>
             might be a good fit -- it could work. The key would be that mods aren't expected to edit stuff for people, only leave posts up long enough for the community to help the OP fix them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's how it could work:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              We create four new flairs, one for each rule
             </li>
             <li>
              Instead of removing, we flair for 24 hours
             </li>
             <li>
              When the OP fixes the post, he pings the mod or replies to their comment to remove the flair
             </li>
             <li>
              If he doesn't ping, after 24 hours, the mod assumes no changes were made and automatically removes the post.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The flairs make it just one additional mouse click, so I don't see that as more work, especially if the onus is on the submitter to ping mods to his edit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Falcon will probably disagree, since he gets on early and does the majority of deletions. I've been trying to convince him to split the week up between us or alternate days so that we can take a day off here and there and have more patience/less burnout. You can see our conversation
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2361605/11920980?context=10">
              here
             </a>
             and before that,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2359801/11762767?context=10">
              here
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <h2>
             I propose we leave the rules alone for now, but try a two-week experiment (or maybe just one?) during which posts will be flagged for 24 hours prior to removal.
            </h2>
            <p>
             To prevent a tsunami of  shill spam, we can further stipulate that posting more than two threads at a time earning rule violation flairs will get your deferred removal privilege revoked and they all get removed.

              would be. He/she is calm and tries to solve problems. You need someone reliable, reasonable and doesn’t call everyone a nigger faggot. Think- even gets along with you guys.

              I sort of like the idea but I also see the possibility of it creating a front page full of slide threads that are flared.

             A hard 30 mins is just another way for mod to shit on a user and have a power trip. Having a bit of leeway isn't a bad thing.

             This seems to be the contention here. That the rules are way too stringent as they are and the you have another barrier to the user where someone with a ban button gets to decide if its rel event or not. Most seem unhappy with the current mod group here. I think that's the place to start.

              Its is the only answer. The current board owner and lead mod have run through the dog and pony shows before only to continue to abuse the hell out of this sub and everybody in it like torturing ants in a jar with a magnifying glass and that is what it reminds me of. The current crew blew it and needs to just pack it in. This sub is already a skeleton of its former self and they have proven that these discussions are just fake window dressing.

               Just have a dialogue with a user saying that the post could use a bit more clarity. Tear down this silly wall where the mods and users are at each others throats. If the user refuses to fix it and its getting heaps of downvotes then maybe remove it. Use the flair that people have suggested here and let the users decide. I understand the moderation style was very much needed when Voat was trying to run the sub off, but the evidence is suggesting that the amount of deletions here are now running the users off.

                That would require the lead mod to use common sense with his powers of discretion and he has proven time and time again that he does not have it.

                I can see your point, but this won't work imo. Why? We're flooded with shill posts daily.
               </p>
               <p>
                People get annoyed for two reasons:
               </p>
               <p>
                1) Posts that are of value get deleted
2) Posts by shills or posts that don't belong here for other reasons stay
               </p>
               <p>
                'Just having a dialogue' won't work. It's too arbitrary.
               </p>
               <p>
                We need to find a middleway. Clear rules ('hard 30 minutes'), but help by mods as much as possible =&gt; more dialogue, less frustration.
               </p>
               <p>
                Please don't underestimate the level of frustration because rules might not always be applied consistently.

            And if the people deciding what meets the guidelines aren't up to it then what? This sub of all subs reminds me the most of reddit where before you even think about posting you have to read a bunch of rules an arm long. Then, if you fuck up at all, you will get deleted at the whim of a few who think they know what is relevant. Any complaints are shuffled off to a side sub where only the mods can downvote and it seems at least one is abusing that. We fought against that shit when
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news">
             v/news
            </a>
            an
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/videos">
             v/videos
            </a>
            did it. The right thing has been done with the rules sticky here but I wonder if its too late. I know you have some skin in this game because you helped setup the system in the first place but things have moved on and the rules for posting need to be stripped back if they are hindering genuine users from posting.

             If you hang around here enough you will that this gets gamed by Falcon. Just to "prove some sort of point" he will leave up slide threads knowing they need to be nuked, and then delete good threads by legit users on the slightest of technicalities.

            <p>
             Sometimes its like he WANTS to be called on it so that

             will blow in with the malignant narcissist routine and vindicate him so that he gets to be a victim. Its all pretty sick, tiring, needless, and petty.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             His excuse is damn near "well I have to be fair and use the rules fairly and let the slide threads stay up too" blah blah blah...blahh...bhahhh...That is not exactly what he says but he may as well.

             He either cannot, or WILL NOT mod properly. There is absolutely no common sense reason for some of the threads he deletes, none at all. Which means he either can't cut it or refuses to for some unknown reason.

            Why do they have to. This is Voat not reddit. It's is not a year ago he this board was getting a submission every few minutes and spam was burying decent threads.  Loosen the chains.  THs much dam over letting a borderline post go?

            Sometimes posts will stay up for two or three hours before a mod will take them down. Sometimes these posts have already 20 comments or more. Copypasting the source (which in itself wouldn't be a problem) won't transfer the comments. Also, ongoing discussions will be disrupted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that it might be difficult to grasp this - but the level of frustration in the sub has been
            <em>
             extremely
            </em>
            high lately. People are just fed up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing that the mods will let posts stay for a while, give OPs the opportunity to fix, and possibly provide help, will change people's attitude towards the mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know this might lead to some 'muh fee fees' remarks, but like it or not, people on this sub are different from those on other Voat subs. I'm not into the niggerfaggotkike stuff, but when I go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/wildlife">
             v/wildlife
            </a>
            and kid around with people there, I have a different tone.
           </p>
           <p>
            This said, many people are hurt when posts are taken down.
            <em>
             Even though
            </em>
            most of them could do an easy fix and repost. This is a psychological issue, and I think we'll have to respect that. Many people here are survivors, which often comes with a greater sensitiveness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary: I'd rather take into account that
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            people might be
            <em>
             still
            </em>
            offended by mods deleting their posts and be disappointed, but I'd take this into account, since
            <em>
             so many more
            </em>
            people will be less frustrated than at present.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say: Give it a try. I appreciate that

            Six. 
I think it hurts the investigation when we make a post and are basically expected to have everything together and ready to prosecute, by ourselves, instead of posting ideas for the community to put our heads together.

              Of course you do. We knew you were just fucking with us when you started this thread just a few minutes after acting like a complete ass in this linked thread I will paste here. You won't do anything meaningful and you proved it in this link.

             <p>
              That supposed connection to Comet and Falcon has zero to do with how badly Falcon performed this whole year but now you are holding it up as Falcon being the victim of mistaken identity here at the last minute. You guys drilled this sub into the ground for a whole year. You like being a squatter here because it makes you feel powerful.

              Looking like it, especially with all the weirdness going on here lately.
             </p>
             <p>
              Happens everywhere you go with these internet retards, they ingratiate you on to their site and then turn on you when you think you're comfortable. I used to think back in the day that it was a brilliant spook tactic. But then I realized that the ambient mk programming in society is so latent in these younger generations there is no need for specific agents any longer, those narcissistic tendencies from persistent isolation and loneliness drives them to the instant gratification of emasculating those they believe they have power over. The reason it persists and only worsens with these people instead of compromise is because that instant gratification is so short in duration they need a continual fix of power and control.

                The reason it persists and only worsens with these people instead of compromise is because that instant gratification is so short in duration they need a continual fix of power and control.

               Interesting and insightful comment. Internet bullies like crensch are not getting their needs met in real life so they intellectually masturbate on the internet to get those quick dopamine and endorphin hits by bullying people online and feeling superior. I guess it can get addictive and become a loop situation.

            1st) Rules are fine, but maybe change/enforce some to advance the goal of keeping content and discussion as high value as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            I seem to always tune in on the tail end of the big zhit storms and never really know what went down. All I really see is the dust left from a bunch of rude infighting that erodes the overall experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a daily visitor, what I value most are posts with good titles, clear descriptions of the links and images and some thoughtful opinion or analysis. I appreciate everyone who keeps lists and timelines and other data for reference.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asking people to be nice seems to be an antagonistic thing to do here because that seems to be perceived as a weakness and some how a badge of honor is bestowed only on those that are rude and those that keep their mouth's shut and don't interrupt those being rude.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, my suggestion is in the first line of this post, but I will add a second suggestion below to mods, posters and commentors:
           </p>
           <p>
            2nd) Be less toxic and more informative.

             Ok so, I'm gonna try to help you out here, without ruining the fun...
            </p>
            <p>
             When I reply with certain songs towards
             <em>
              some
             </em>
             users, there's an underlying message being sent, the message changes sometimes, so the imporant thing to note, is context... "repeats are important"
            </p>
            <p>
             The following song is a personal favorite for a variety of reasons...
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=y107RGDyUQ0">

            <p>
             Listen closely to the intro.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's also the following lyrics, worth mentioning in context here:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Question?
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              But they not in the car
             </p>
             <p>
              They're all around you, so just take a second
             </p>

               I see you're learning to quote because it bothers you not getting a direct response - fun part... the horizontal line indicates to other readers, where the edit came in - the edit always comes in when I eventually notice your reply, because you remind me of Elmer.

                You have one job argosciv The Satanic Bozo, and that is to stop acting like a prick. When you accomplish that feat you are off the hook. Until then you will remain on radar. You create your own reality. Create a better one for yourself and you will have a better one. That is all.

            Crencsh the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke,  too little too late after the damage is done still debating about getting rid of an incompetent mod.  You internet geeks are amazing how you stick up for each other when it's clear the moron should have been let go within the first month of this investigation. But we still keep fighting you because this is one of the last places with even this amount of flexibility,  and it still blows.  I can't believe you're still asking for proof when it's totally obvious _falcon DOES NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT ANY OF THIS MATERIAL TO BE A COMPETENT JUDGE OF THE FACTS.  Shutting down a discussion about stem cells because the possibility of them being in Pepsi is ridiculous? How can you NOT SEE HOW SUBJECTIVE THAT IS.  THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE STUPID ARGUMENT IS ABOUT IS FALCONS SUBJECTIVE REASONING.  He uses voat's VAGUE and ALL ENCOMPASSING rules as a cover for his erroneous calls and the poster is left to guess at what is wrong with his thread, not realizing its simply just a case of bias and stupidity from calls like what this thread is about. Over and over and you crencsh or whoever just post another sticky asking more dumb questions to pacify us. No more pacification just get rid of the dude why's that so fucking hard it's not a paid position.

             Actually a lot of people might debate that point. One of the most common questions people have is "is falcon getting paid to stand on certain areas of pizzagate research?" It is a valid question considering his blatant censorship of certain topics. Many people consider it impossible for him to be retarded enough not to understand "relevancy" to the degree that he pretends not to understand it.

              Good point, he has shown an understanding of the topic in general. He seems very afraid of the parabiosis, bloodletting and stem cell subjects..... HMmmmm.

               Pretty responsible thing to say for someone that runs a website. Very odd, and suspicious. Where the hell else are you going to put a question for someone to see well enough to answer on this FUCKED UP CHAT FORMAT? By the time a thread is done in here it looks like a fucking mess. And it figures a moron like you would pick one of the most INANE points to nit pick about, I swear to God you internet fucks are about as weird as they get.

            Suggestion: Our submission guidelines need some evolution to reflect how much the scope of pizzagate has evolved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crensch I remember talking about how Pizzagate has basically evolved into "pedogate" with pizzagate becoming a vestigial name for the entire thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Legit good leads are being axed due to this very reason. Arbitrary sticking to outdated terms. Namely in regards to crimes like organ trafficking, which is intimately tied to human trafficking, which in itself is intimately tied to pedophile rings.

             I looked into Asia a bit before, I'll let you know if I can find anything. I remember seeing a child trafficking sign but I can't recall the context.

             Excellent suggestion here. Hollywood/billionaires/mafia/satanists/porn/organ harvesting/etcetc are all related. There is so much to this.

            Maybe get rid of some off the shittier mods so they stop deleting threads based on actual articles that the community supports, like this one, posted by another user, deleted twice.

           <p>
            And if I have to explain the relevance, do some very basic, entry-level reading on pizzagate. Or don't, and continue to only allow articles from paranoid schizophrenics and their new age blogs.

            i have a concern and i'm pretty sure everybody saw it but i just would like it addressed publicly for transparency and to settle any misconceptions the post may have raised ..... somebody i cant even remember who it was it could have been a troll .... but somebody came across a pizza king connected to jimmy comets instagram that is under the name millenial_falco .... i checked that instagram and it is that name. can we just clarify for everybody that it is not our mod millenial falcon and the name is just a coincidence..... just to let millenial clear his name

             I don't need to clear my name.  The guy who started that nonsense already admitted he was trolling.  And the guy with the Instagram account is MillenniUM Falcon.

               Me being believeable is not even an issue on this because it is known far and wide. I have seen it on 4chan, 8chan, redditt, and some other places.

             Q being allowed in this sub was the straw that broke the camel's back for some people because of the division it created. It should never have been allowed into this sub. There are "storm" subs and forums, Q forums and subs, and it needs to stay at those places. It was obvious from the beginning that it was a larp or a psyop and the longer I watch it the more I think its a psyop run by an intel agency or a political party group.

             THIS! So fucking much of this it's not funny! I asked this before a long time ago and admit, it's a bit draconian, but, thoughts on disabling the "Share a link" button(if possible)?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Reason:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Often see directly linked(no main body for submission) articles with ambiguous titles, I've adopted the habit of clicking "x comments" to see the comments instead - on the hopes that the poster has provided a bit of an explanation as to why they're sharing the link, or, failing that, to see if
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/derram">
              @derram
             </a>
             has archived it :P
            </p>
            <p>
             Why does it matter? Because I like to see that the person sharing the article, has actually read it and they found something they think we all need to look at - would it not behoove any genuine contributor here, to really 'sell the pitch' when it comes to something that warrants pizzagate exposure? It makes sense that if you are invested in what you're sharing, that you would want to tell us about it yourself; a bit of effort can go a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another point, although a personal peeve also, is that I really much prefer being able to stay right here on voat to read about this that and the other, where possible and reasonable - which is to say that, I really don't like when there's no explanation as to why I should be interested in the linked article/whatever, when even a few minutes spent parsing the article into a discussion post, would make all the difference.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why I've also adopted the habit of doing exactly that; parse the article contents or the most relevant parts, along with my thoughts/reasoning for sharing - there's some exceptions, but, I try to consider anyone else who might be sick of the "hit and run link posts", like me.

              Thought about this, and think it's actually a good idea. Might also prevent people from involuntarily click on cp, when linked in headline (there was a submission like this a couple of days ago.)

              Do you remember when the share a link button was shut off for a day? I do: Shitstorm. I strongly advised against it without clear user support.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other problem with this is the button can only be 'suppressed' (via CSS), not removed. So users who choose to disable CSS would still see it and be able to simply click it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Frankly, I do think it is a useful idea and may help submitters to more clearly state what their link is about. The bonus is that one can use the expando button when browsing the sub's main page and see a bit about what's going on. The downside is that viewing content through an expando (the plus-sign thingy) doesn't register as a "view".

                This is why you catch so much hell. You follow the mods around like a stray dog trying to be important and pretending to know things you are clueless about. You keep your foot in your mouth more than you do on the ground. You would really be better off to just stop sucking up to the mods and stay out of shit.

                Yeah, although it may not be too complex. It would also require modifying the subverse settings page.

            There's like a couple dozen here who are consistent posters. Am defs not one of those. Maybe switch up the mods (or just a few) with some of the consistent contributors? Personally like Vindicators modding tho. He seems transparent about what he's doing and posts his own content consistently which helps me get an idea of his thought process which I like (even if IMO Q is a dog and pony show and that I am not too convinced T is Mr pedo roto-rooter--like at all; cld be wrong, only IMO). So maybe a split of Trump/Q folks and others that either just focus on trafficking and/or the occult might be a good mix. MF'e name tho is defs trashed far and wide in web places that post on this subject matter tho. No opinion on that since I mainly just come here to read and have never had something I put a lot of work into getting deleted by MF , so no gripes from me.  How to pick the relief mods? No idea.

            I like the rules. Falcon can't cut it, or actually many think he refuses to cut it and has turned it into his own game of "catch me if you can." The mod IS the problem.

            The shills are real, and after fighting them for awhile, everyone starts to make you wonder, especially if you are tired or have other things on your mind. Of course, that is part of what they are aiming for.

             Do you seriously not question the things SBBH and kevdude have done on voat? I know you haven't been here for terribly long but you have to have witnessed it. Even in the past year they have caused multiple controversies.

              Well, my main inculturation to Voat -- and online forums in general -- came through my experiences trying to help here in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              . I was mostly a casual lurker prior to this, so I don't have any pre-SBBH context. I did, however, witness firsthand what went down on Reddit before the pizzagate sub moved here, as well as the downright vicious efforts to smear PG researchers, dox users, and sow discord between PG refugees and old goats that were rampantly driven by certain shitheads, and saw Crensch and kevdude effectively put a stop to that so research could continue mostly in peace.
             </p>
             <p>
              I get that
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              's ruleset is draconian by Voat standards and that it rubs the libertarian spirit of Voaters the wrong way, but I also know what a shithole this place can turn into when the rules aren't applied, and that most places on Voat do not have people trying to destroy them 24/7/365 like we have experienced. From my perspective,
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Crensch">
               @Crensch
              </a>
              and
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kevdude">
               @kevdude
              </a>
              did not "cause" this controversy here this week. They responded to a flare-up of a controversy-in-progress that has been unfolding for months.
             </p>
             <p>
              All that said, I don't really know what Soap Box Ban Hammer is, or it's history, or what it's denizens have done Voat-wide. From my cursory perusal, the sub seems to be mostly sarcastic shitposting. But I don't understand the history. Please link me up with any relevant material, as it is something I've been curious about.

               Did you see the hubbub with identitarian/identitarians, for example? It was front page for days. Or perhaps the post about ExpertShitposter being banned from gaming for trolling, and then trying to oust the mod who removed him?
              </p>
              <p>
               They do stuff like this
               <em>
                all the time
               </em>
               , they pick a sub and attack it. They try to remove the mod team and plant accounts they either are friendly with or have control of and they destroy subs.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then again, you co-mod this with kevdude, heygeorge,
               <em>
                and
               </em>
               Crensch so there's no reason for me to believe you'll genuinely consider this anyway.

            I was a lurker from the beginning, and signed up 4,5 months ago. I don't see the sub as active as it used to be. I don't know how accurate the numbers of visitors shown in the sidebar are, but imo there has been a significant drop in the last two weeks or so - very often from about 350 to less than 200.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people are still here, but thinking about leaving for good. Unfortunately, some of our best researchers are among them. I've been here only for four months, but the amount of time I've spent begging people not to leave is crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, I personally don't have a problem with the rules. I know why they were made the way they are, and that's ok.
           </p>
           <p>
            What gets many people being frustrated, however, is an inconsistency in how rules are applied sometimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example:
           </p>
           <p>
            MF took down a post of mine (only one that got deleted so far). It was a newspaper article that said 10% of children raped in child porn were infants. I got a bit emotional over this, so I posted it on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , thinking since the elite produce child porn, it's ok to discuss it on the main sub. MF deleted it, and pointed out that I should repost on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . I didn't have a problem with that. (Gonna edit later and add links to posts mentioned.) I even wrote a PM to MF and apologized for being a bit too emotional before posting.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, another post submitted around the same time which dealt with a
            <em>
             single case
            </em>
            of infant rape and chlld porn, the perp not being a member of the elite, stayed.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was the point where I got annoyed. If rules are applied, it should be done in a consistent way. And I know that's what bugging other people as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you've seen it, I've really tried to be objective and fair regarding MF's work in the past weeks, and tried to encourage him whenever he did something I thought was neat. I refrained from complaining. I am aware we're all different, hold different views and that there will never be a mod that will be cherished by everyone. When you're a mod, you'll be the designated asshole for some users anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I ran out of ideas how we could develop a better understanding about how to mod this sub with Millenial. So I think this post is great, I hope many will join.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding A) and B): Many users need some help. When they're posting, sometimes they're in time stress, don't realize how to best point out the connection to pizzagate, or are not aware that their sources don't suffice.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not because they're generally too stupid to read and apply rules, but sometimes they need help. That's why I suggested to leave posts up, ask to fix (providing some help) and give a time frame for fixing.

            you mods are doing a great and often thankless job
           </p>
           <p>
            My 2cents is the focus. Its been nearly 18 months since Podesta's emails dropped, and in terms of the 'Investigation' - well, its been a long time since we've been at the point where its conclusive that there is a systemic, endemic issue long overdue for justice
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally see this forum, therefore, as only partially an ongoing Investigation, and more saliently as a REPOSITORY for pizzagate - and that INCLUDES the Fake News about Pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            What i mean is, if i see something pizzagate related on twitter with 700 retweets, I'm gonna put it up here for discussion - regarless of whether its fake news or not. And i dont want someone up my ass for 'peddaling' fake news when what I'm doing is REPORTING on salient info doing the rounds, whether its fake or not
           </p>
           <p>
            if there is fake news going around out there, we should be the best at detecting it and diffusing it, right?  how do we do that effectively if we dont bring fake news in here, put it on the table for dissection - coz often there's a kernel of truth in the entrails of a dissected fake news rat, right?

             I don't think "peddling fake news" is one of the rules.  Was something removed for that?

             Mods should be removing poorly formatted and explained posts - and spam.

                The reason people don't take you seriously is because it takes a serious case of narcissistic vanity to be as wrong as you are, as often as you are, so blatantly, and then just blow through it with the amount of projection you use. You really do have a mental illness and its serious. Not even kidding a little bit. I am not surprised that a narcissistic sociopath such as yourself jumped on the chance to grab the

                sub name because it gives you a group of people to feed on. It is an especially sad state of affairs because this sub "tries" to specialize on helping desperate children but instead is serves as a siphon point for your power trip needs. Its weird to watch people like you feed on things like that because it seems like it would be a miserable life but for you it is enjoyable for some sad reason. You will suck the last drop of blood from this place like you are doing, blame it on everybody else, forever or until you somehow lose access to the internet because you need this fix. We don't expect you do shit except what you have proven over the last year that you will continue to do.

            If you the sub would be left for two weeks without mods, many people might get frustrated by shill posts and leave. Currently, many are burned out and about to leave for good.

             This is what they fucking want. It's literally what they're here to do. Don't let them crush your spirit, we need an alternative because Putt is not with us. The "Voat Voting" system proved that to me.

             You have to vote and say "i vote for number 4 to remove the mod" or crensch will not record your vote. crensch is not taking opinions you have to say the words exactly. its fuckery i know but i just caught on to it. make sure you ping crensch too when you do it.

            Careful - post too many of those and this place will start to look like the David Icke forum during the height of the Hampstead case when it was full of trolls . Perhaps you know what I mean?

            Why not post there with incomplete leads? It's the clear route, and doesn't start dividing up the researchers into tiny sections. I rarely see this happen, and think it's an underutilized spot.

               Some of the great posts that get deleted literally take weeks to prepare, the really good ones that is. People that are that smart, dedicated, and can "see" well enough to make those associations, and then even present it and make it understandable get seriously irate when it gets deleted and relegated to the back water.

               . Swordfish is almost legendary for his ability to make associations that most people cannot see. pizzagate is a freaky world and it takes a special eye to spot this level of connection and it takes years to learn to see it.

               does not have the skills to see it. crensch said he would hand over the keys to this place to somebody we choose. Great. Hand us the password to the main name that started this sub. I will go in and change the password and nobody but me will be able to get in. I will fire everybody that needs to be fired. I will pick three mods starting with with

               I can straighten this sub out. I know I can. I can pick me some mods that understand pizzagate, want to mod, and put this place on autopilot so that I don't even have to do the modding myself.

                 The rules should serve as a set of guidelines for someone with common sense to use to make the forum function properly in a way that suits the community. Falcon is not capable of using the guidelines we have to make the forum function in a manner that suits the community.

                 acts like this is fucking rocket science or something. Its not that complicated. We don't want you here anymore. You don't care about this sub and you have said so many times. You don't do shit around here except squat on the name "v/pizzagate" to soothe your power trip. It makes you feel important. We want you gone. This sub will prosper without you.

                  I don't see how a rational mind would perceive our short &amp; civil discussion as handing my ass to me. Your final statement was that you were

                  I don't have any say as to what this sub does or does not do. I help with Voat-centric technical questions when asked, or help with CSS when asked.

                  I am not making any peace offerings. I am trying to understand you. What is ironic about you spouting off at Crensch is that even though he hurts your feelings, he is in reality the person who can pull the ripcord on the whole mod team (outside of kkww)

              One problem is that people don't know that is why it was set up. If you look at removal comment history, you'll see that it is not always mentioned. Plus, it's not as visible -- people want their stuff seen and upvoted.

              v/pizzagatemods

           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think the rules are a problem in general.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing I'd like to be changed is that OPs should be granted some time to fix a post, instead of deleting a post and require reposting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reason for this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Often posts already have many comments when a mod deletes and asks to fix and repost.
           </p>
           <p>
            Comments won't show on a repost, and discussions get interrupted by requiring to repost, even if its a minor issue that needs to be fixed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd suggest to give OPs 30 minutes or so to fix, shouldn't they do so, delete and ask for repost.
           </p>
           <p>
            This, of course, depends on whether the mods have the time to look at a post again in the given time period, I'm aware of this.

             That is a good suggestion think-, a real good one, but the problem is the board owners and the lead mod. Until that changes, nothing will change.

             I'm not overly opposed to such a thing.  More demand on the mods, but if that's what the users agree on, we can find a way to make it work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe a comment by the mod pinging other mods capable of removing - if they have to go, the next mod can see what/when/where/how the grace period started, and remove if unedited.
            </p>
            <p>
             Happy to hear other takes on this, but at first glance, a great idea!

                We could have flairs for each of the rules, and flair first so people can edit, then remove the flair when they do, or delete if they don't.

                  Good question. Experimentally, I want to say 24 hours in case they're in a radically different timezone. That also gives time for other users to contribute links and explanations the OP can use to edit his post -- making the whole process more crowdsourced and collaborative.

                   When thinking of doing posts in the future as OP, I'd say: great, go for it! :-)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Considering the quite shilly climate these days however (...), I just imagined some very happy resident shills having a feast day and spamming the sub so bad that good posts would pushed down the thread into oblivion. :-/
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   How can we prevent this? Maybe give it a two weeks trial period?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If we assume everybody would play fair, this would be really great, and could lead to some enthusiastic teamwork. People are always glad to help with links and ideas.

                    Everyone would need to button on their self-moderation sweaters and start downvoating. I think we'd want to try it as an experiment, first.

               This sounds like a reasonable approach, although it could open us up to claims of favoritism for arbitrarily deciding which posts to give time to and which to take down immediately.

                I think changing the way of responding to a post that needs some fixing will make people to be more relaxed in general.
                <em>
                 Many
                </em>
                posts that get currently deleted require only some fixes that won't take much time.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most of those who would be deleted nevertheless will be shill posts.

                You'll be opened up to claims no matter. A bit of favoritism seems better weathered than some sort of international pizza consultant allegedly tied to JA.

                Yes. I have to admit, I already request edits with posts that just need a little tweaking, especially if there is already a good discussion happening.

              As I said, I'm aware this would depend on whether the mods feel they'd have the time to do it.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               if they have to go, the next mod can see what/when/where/how the grace period started, and remove if unedited

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I think it would be great to have a kind of mod diary, so when one mod ends his shift, he could leave comments for the one that takes over.

               I think the comments in the submission pinging the mod should be sufficient.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hell, when a mod starts his rounds, he can just ping himself to those comments, too, in order to keep track, or have a list to go back down later.

                  Not when you have a serious forum. He has no people skills. He can’t solve problems. He goes straight to nigger faggot kike. He’s immature. He’s an asshole. I seriously think someone should make a new sub.

                   Crensch stays out of it as much as possible, from what I can tell. I have no people skills either lol.

                  <p>
                   Some people have reasons for liking him, others not so much - the smear campaign (accusations of being a pedo) is woefully petty, though.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Some people don't like Crensch's attitude, some people don't like the attitude of those who go on anti-mod campaigns over hurt feelings - escalating to slander... we don't all have to agree, hell, that's damn near impossible, but, Crensch isn't the horrible god-awful boogeyman many perceive him to be. I honestly even thank him for the times he's put me on the spot... negative reinforcement and whatnot :P
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If Crensch calls you a kike, just call him one back and move on.

                    I don’t stoop to that level and call people pedos. I have the kind of personality where we could call each other faggots all day long. But some don’t like it. This isn’t the type of forum that’s full of college aged guys.

                     This is true, on some level I do hold the same concern re: pushing people away - but at this point, it is what it is, imo - no malice intended.

                I generally try to be consistent about simply removing and having the person fix and repost. Otherwise it invites claims of bias and censoring certain topics.  The occasional exception I make is when a discussion post could
                <em>
                 arguably
                </em>
                be within the rules, but is on the verge of breaking Rule 3, so I simply ask the person to edit the post to clarify something.

                 But otherwise, you know my thoughts on the matter - I have no qualms with what you do, I think there was a couple of times I got upset over some things of mine you deleted, but, it's understandable almost every time - just pushes me to be a bit more creative when I'm trying to be subtle :P

                   I just love them for everything they're doing for us(even when I don't fully agree with whomever), if that's kissing arse, oh well ^_^

                   Seriously, even if they weren't mods, I quite enjoy them as people and respect their take on things. Just the same as I respect many others around these parts, even if I disagree with them about certain things :P

             I had to read this comment to decide whether you're just a moron or you're a pedo shill piece of shit.  I've decided you are both.  We ALWAYS leave up (and indeed promote!) important posts that have clear relevance to pizzagate, whereas you try to spam disinfo and bullshit, but we're the bad guys, here.  Suuuuuuuuuuuuure.  Mhm.

               He has been targeting me and trying to push people onto other platforms/subverses since almost the beginning.  The reason he and the other shills target me is that I'm the one who removes most of their disinfo and irrelevant slide posts.

                 He might be the same troll as polwarrior.  polwarrior likes to have conversations with himself with his many sockpuppet accounts.  Maybe he forgot to switch browser tabs or something.

            And this is a setup. You talked about this in the thread I linked to. This is the old "order out of chaos" trick. You know full well that if this sub goes two weeks with no rules and no moderation that it will be total chaos and that is obvious. After two weeks of chaos you will come in and say "see, esotericshade and all the assholes are wrong, you need us."
           </p>
           <p>
            You will create a problem and then pretend to fix it. Nobody is dumb enough to fall for this trick.

              And this is a setup. You talked about this in the thread I linked to. This is the old "order out of chaos" trick. You know full well that if this sub goes two weeks with no rules and no moderation that it will be total chaos and that is obvious. After two weeks of chaos you will come in and say "see, esotericshade and all the assholes are wrong, you need us."

             The users have that option.  It's not a trick.  I have no dog in this fight either way.  If they want 2 weeks off, I'll take 2 weeks off.  If they don't, well, I keep my game face on.

                On a comparative statistical basis, gets down voted into the sewer in this thread, but of course ignores it. Sits in a mod sub rigged so that users cannot down vote because the system won't add sub points to a users tally with the 10 CPP limit turned on. I had 30 up votes in that sub and the sidebar still says I have zero.

                Weird how you started this thread pretending to be "serving the community" when in reality you wanted to bait me here and delegitimize me and legitimize yourself. That was obvious when you called a great thread a piece of shit done by an idiot and attached my name at the top of the thread.

             Lures teenage drug addicted girls to his house and tries have sex with them and talk them into letting him drink their blood. He tells them he is a "magic dragon." (seriously, read what he wrote) A couple of those little drug addicted tweakers broke into his house a few weeks ago.

             people hate it. He constantly pings the mods and tattles on people, shows the mods things people say, in an effort to get fights started between the mods and the users.

             Yeah, that's actually a great idea. Anyone who has been here a number of months and has 1K or 2K voats has clearly been in the game and takes this investigation seriously. Perhaps the mods need to agree to give a little slack to such folks even if they (we) are a little snarly sometimes. So 1. and 2., but look at the poster and give a nod towards a slide to those who clearly take this seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
             The biggest factor for me is that I think we are doing the groundwork investigation for people who will eventually do the dangerous work of arresting a bunch of these criminals. As investigations go, some leads are dead ends and some seem crazy at first but yield very fecund results. I would hate to see something get deleted that may prove to be the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yes, MF has ticked me off sometimes, but I don't think he has been overtly unfair to me. And my guess is he doesn't really care for me. But that's okay in the end because his Sticky is obviously excellent and his deletions were always rule 1 and probably for stuff that was on the edge anyways, so he helps me think twice about posting. But clearly he is on the side of the kids and wants to see justice for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             But all that being said, I can understand that being a mod is a tough job, and somewhat thankless. I appreciate the efforts y'all put forth, and I honestly believe you are the good guys and want to see justice done on these enemies of humanity. As always, it will be the volunteers that change the world for the better.

              And what of the infinite bad leads that subversive elements will post here if given the chance?  How much manpower are you willing to put forth in order to follow each of them to their conclusion, be it dead end or something useful?

               My point is that you would give a little extra consideration to post something that sounds a little "crazy" if it is posted by someone who has earned a high number of voats and shown some talent for sniffing out leads over some months. Let the leash out a bit if the dog has been behaving. I've been here over a year now and am familiar with many of y'all and have been able to gauge of talents and insightfulness of various regular posters. Hope that clarifies.

               The absolute best way to ruin this place is to have narcissists such as yourself in charge and the rest turns to shit on its own. You threw a party for about 280 people with this thread and less than a dozen cared to show up deal with your hassles. Me, kevdude, and vindicator all pointed out reasonable information as to why the thread was not handled properly. Instead of having a good sub you want to win arguments, or at least create the appearance of having won an argument. You wrecked our sub that tries to help kids and that is all we really care about, the rest is your narcissistic unimportant drama.

               Could be because they use Alinsky tactics just like the Hasbara trolls do. A lot of people think Falcon and crensch might be the same person but who knows. A lot of people think they are sooks or get paid off to wreck this sub. All I know for certain is that me, kevdude, and vindicator tried to point out reasons why the thread was rational and crensch took it to shit levels of narcissistic personality disorder rarely seen in the real world. Freaky to watch it actually. Especially in a sub of people trying to help kids.

               And that's your excuse for speaking to people the way you do? You tore everyone apart in that thread who cared disagree with you, myself and

               included. And I've NEVER spoken with you before, so I definitely haven't earned that kind of treatment. I saw
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/letsdothis1">
                @letsdothis1
               </a>
               attempting to speak with you in a pretty rational manner, and I saw you fly off the handle. If you can't handle day to day shit from people who don't agree with your every word, go somewhere else.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it so much to ask for a moderator to speak with an iota of respect? Serious question.

                   I heard about that. I hope it is better than the answer they had for vote farming. Basically all that accomplished was the ability of people

                   mods where they can get posters into a sub and down vote them without the posters ever being to gain enough CPP to down vote. That is the way the mod sub is.
                  </p>
                  <hr/>
                  <p>
                   Crensh and couple of other people had their 10 minimum CPP points accrued, then they set a 10 CPP limit. Once the limit is set the system won't add any points. Yesterday I had over 30 up votes in the mod sub the sidebar still says I have zero. So, crensch and crew sit in there and down vote people that will never be able to down vote.

                   All the while crensch preaches about letting the votes speak for themselves. They got down voted into the stone age, statistically speaking, in this thread but of course in a narcissists world that does not count.

                     It reads more than the ip address and mac address. I know that. Not sure how you did that. Simply switching the ip address shouldn't game it. It reads the whole machine ID or something.

You've proven yourself to be completely irrational and incapable of any open discussion. Your posts consist of why you're right, why I'm an emotional faggot who deserves no respect, etc.

                      Twistedmac11 We are dealing with a seriously sick narcissistic personality disorder here. The narcissist actually NEEDS US but we don't need it. That is why it will NEVER leave us and go away. It feeds on us because it has to.

                      will never leave becaues he needs us for his power trip food. Somewhere on this internet we can find a place to go and let this place just finish its collapse.

                        doggedly ignores it all and continues with this fucking show like its not happening. In the mod thread they got their ass handed them too, but of course none of that happened. It takes a seriously strong case of mental illness to push through all this in public and pretend its not happening.

                        is down to being superior and "winning" arguments based on typos and shit nit pick little meaning dreamed up technicalities. That is why hardly anybody is even bothering to participate in this charade. Instead of participating they are just watching surreal shit show with morbid fascination. Its like watching a bus wreck, its ugly, but you just have to watch anyway, ya know?

                        I bet there are several names on the books for this mental illness and at least about three would be sociopath, psychopath, and narcissistic personality disorder, and in this case malignant narcissism. This is seriously fucked up shit to watch right here and watch crensch pretend that he isn't getting ass pounded. Its actually pretty damn freaky to watch and I sort of trip out on when I really think about it.

            I will also refuse to take this bait too. Anybody that reads this thread can see that your attitude is a dead give away that you will refuse to do whatever the community wishes. I will not be baited into a fake discussion by you. I went through the fake Rule 1 sticky thread "discussion" in which not a damn thing changed and the following thread is evidence of it.

            Nice try but i'm not taking the bait. People can read here and easily understand why too. You have totally blown it and there is a no confidence vote in on you by the community. This dog and pony show will not restore and faith in you. You can rest assured of that. People can read. People are not stupid. They can read the following and see where you stand.

             You're a liar.  Every single time some user has had a problem with a deletion, you're there.  And you're wrong - every single time.

                This was a great thread and the fact that you don't recognize that fact makes you the problem.
