            That was posted 2 1/2 years ago, when they thought they could get away with stuff that appeals to those 'in the know.' I'm surprised it's still up actually.

            I'm finding ALOT in the "bone industry" and found an email from cherl mills, heather to podesta that links him to bone/ spinal that bypassed/violated Fda and 3patients died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks, Podesta email 8/30/2014 Re: Podesta/Wyss.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawsuits keep getting shut down. Podesta replies that its a " Breitbart Free Beacon Loop.!!!!!! Podesta received info that it was in Free Beacon, by Heather Samuelson from Cheryl Mills office.
           </p>
           <p>
            He then sent that email asap to Cheryl mills;  and asked her if she was around for a call!! Wyss is a reclusive Swiss billionaire whose company did illegal.expeeiements on humans, using bone to repair spine. 
Three patients died. $22.8 million plea deal with Synthes Inc and Noriancorp its wholly subsidiary and four of the executives ( fall guys) were sent to prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two victims died in California, one in Texas. Was in Washington Examiner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ryoichi Kuuluchi, prized physicist, age 83, one of victims that died on operating table at Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            Federal judge said companies deception is unparralled. Wyss hides as a recluse in Wisconsin and Switzerland.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jonson and Johnson bought the Weschester PA company in 2012 after the deaths. Podesta and Wyss got away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Clinton has had financial ties with Wyss , also, note money given than even Soros to Center for American Progress. HJW is a Wyss Foundation that gave 4.1 million dollars to CAP when Podesta ran it.
Wyss also hired Podesta to consult for HJW for @ $87 k.
Madeleine Albtreit, Senator Tim Daschle, abd Carol Browner ( enery czar for Obama and director epa after Lisa), and Wyss sat on board of CAP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hansjurg Wyss, a behind scenes billionaire, just as big as Soros
Examiner Citizen Audit Database shows IRS 990 tax return of the 27 liberal groups that Wyss contributes too, such as CAP. CAP continued to received highest donations by Wyss in 2011 and 2012.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whyss and Synthesis joined with Norian xr in this spinal surgery that uses CALCIUM phosphate with barium sulphate, called verteproblasty procedure. FDA and US Drug and Food Administration did not approve this bone procedure. They conducted unauthorized experimental procedures for four years, led to three deaths.
           </p>
           <p>
            2004, Captain Joseph Despins investigated and did federal indictment Ag them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judge Legrome D. Davis heard delayed case in 2011, and called these " rogue experiments."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Fda had already approved Wyss for bone XL used n arm surgery. He is one of top billionaires in world. He evaded medical laws for profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please refer to my other comments for many other BONE multi industries including as a bio- fuel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rotsch, German co, mills human bones by " donor"s for implant surgeries. Website, other articles, and Retsch PDF called, " Down To The Bone: Use of Laboratory Grinders for Size Reductions of Human Bone and Bioceramics." The use South Texas Blood and Tissue Center STBTC in San Antonio!! Uses the Reach mills to form the bone powder/ paste/ sizings!! Right on Rrtsch 's own PDF file!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Why bury bones like other past cases, vs make huge profit in medical, bio- diesal and other industries, called Green Energy??!??
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also many emails on Podesta about emerging industries.

              Yes, I have some data by victims and families of medicalexpeeimentation, including children stolen or have died, that will post their info they sent me; when a subverse opens up more on med research, depopulate, multi industry agendas...

              I saw a Dr Becker( not sure name was on a Utube interview about that, with babies and vaccines, last night.

             <p>
              Failure to diagnose, substandard care was finally public released by govt fed agencies NIH, CDC, center for rare diseases.
Go Tp center for rare diseases, CDc, NIH and see there research is also, not about diagnose, but testing with pharmaceuticals and more.

              On WikiLeaks, do expanded search of all leaks. Space 1970s on primates is awful.
Us- aid brings up a lot.
Bone- sustainable industry term of many terms is CA waste catalyst, filler, pastes.
Podesta/Wynne case is a bone filler they used in spine without Fda approval or USDA approval.
Have a good new year!

              Its best to look at ones as prey drive destroy criminal..in their shoes of thoughts, mind, action, agendas, plots, plan, profitteer, groupthink mentalities that build their ego, boldness and fraud justifications to do crimes...they do not think same way, and as years go on, worsen ..just like a crack meth addict..and as natives say, never trust a cranksta!!

            Interesting post, by the way I'm also trying to figure out vote: doesn't help being slightly autistic, but I have so much gong on its untrue... At the end of the day it's all about code words and deciphering them.

           <p>
            Anyway, what you say sounds logically correct.
We know cp = Cheese pizza (child porn)
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizza = baby?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pepperoni pizza = baby of colour? like the ones being trafficked from war torn countries?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just food for thought....

                You're right to be scared, it's horrible. Don't look it up, it's very depressing. I guess the eye condition is not from anal sex but trauma to the skull and fluid builds in the nasal cavity around the eyes. There are different kinds. One is called periorbital ecchymosis. A lot of the people and kids in pizzagate seem to have it or the aftermath of it.

                 haha... yeah, its several different things put together but the jist is that panda were popping up in some of jimmy comets pix on Instagram and someone figured out what it meant... not im not sure how the discovery of the panda magazine came about with Alfentis (comet pizza) owner in it... This has so many pieces and parts to it, its mind blowing how in-depth their operation is..
