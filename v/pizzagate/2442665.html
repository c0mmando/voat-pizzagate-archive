             I think we need a SCARLET LETTER. Well, let's modernize it and call it a RED LETTER (nod to Bono). Our modern version will be called THE RED P. We need to keep RED P list on VOAT to at least publicly shame these "protected" criminals. Put the names in ALPHABETICAL ORDER for easy reference.

            Spinks is a grade A bastard. I looked into him a lot in the past. Looks like Spinks in those pics, older and fatter obviously. He's as bad as Sidney Cooke was if not worse and has done very little jail time. In Belgium he was selling snuff films. In 1990-91 he was heavily into selling boys to paedos from East Europe. The BBC did a documentary on him predominantly called The Boy Business.

             I noticed that on your toucanapartments link:

            <p>
             <a href="http://toucanapartments.com/willems-apartments/">
              http://toucanapartments.com/willems-apartments/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             He mentioned being involved in Amsterdam, and Prague, which fits with the news stories about him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something new, though, was his mention of Gran Canaria (in the Canary Islands.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The Canary Islands are well-known as a tourist resort area where rich Europeans go on hioliday, especially in the winter (the Canry Islands are a tropical possession of Spain.)
            </p>
            <p>
             So I looked up this
            </p>

            "Warwick" is an old blue-bloodline name.
One of the Earls of Warwick was involved with original British East India Co. and the Virgiania Co. and Somers Is. (Bermuda). Warwick Rhode Is. is named for him.
"Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (5 June 1587 – 19 April 1658) was an English colonial administrator, admiral, and Puritan (?). Rich was the eldest son of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick and his wife Penelope Devereux, Lady Rich, and succeeded to his father's title (Earl of Warwick) in 1619 (a younger brother was Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland). Early developing interest in colonial ventures, he joined the Guinea, New England, and Virginia companies, as well as the Virginia Company's offspring, the Somers Isles Company. Warwick's enterprises involved him in disputes with the British East India Company (1617) and with the Virginia Company, which in 1624 was suppressed as a result of his action. In 1627 he commanded an unsuccessful privateering expedition against the Spaniards.[1]
           </p>
           <p>
            Warwick's Puritan connections and sympathies gradually estranged him from the court but promoted his association with the New England colonies. In 1628 he indirectly procured the patent for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1631 he granted the "Saybrook" patent in Connecticut. Forced to resign the presidency of the New England Company in the same year, he continued to manage the Somers Isles Company and Providence Island Company, the latter of which, founded in 1630, administered Old Providence on the Mosquito Coast. Meanwhile, in England, Warwick opposed the forced loan of 1626, the payment of ship money, and Laud's church policy.[1]
           </p>
           <p>
            His Richneck Plantation was located in what is now the independent city of Newport News, Virginia. The Warwick River, Warwick Towne, Warwick River Shire, and Warwick County, Virginia are all believed named for him, as are Warwick, Rhode Island and Warwick Parish in Bermuda (alias The Somers Isles).

            This Warwick was a contemporary of Sir Thomas Myddelton (Middleton), another blue-blood East India Co. investor who made a fortune.
"Sir THOMAS MYDDELTON ( 1550 - 1631 ), entrepreneur , was the fourth son of the above Richard Myddelton . Apprenticed to a London grocer , he became a freeman of the Grocers' Company ( 1582 ), surveyor of the outports ( c. 1580 ), and from c. 1595 was constantly employed on such public business as the valuation of prize cargoes , the raising of emergency military and naval supplies by means of his extensive credit, and expert advice on currency problems . The scope of his private transactions, and his deep underlying piety, come out clearly in his ledger for 1583-1603 ( N.L.W. , Chirk castle MSS. ). He was an original shareholder in the East India Company , a partner in the chief buccaneering expeditions of the reign , and under James I in the New River enterprise of his brother Hugh (below) and in the Virginia Company , and a universal banker and moneylender , often in association with James I 's Welsh goldsmith John Williams (q.v.) . He remained in close touch with Wales , interceding on behalf of his fellow-burgesses of Denbigh against the ‘encroachments' of the Salusbury s of Lleweni (q.v.) in 1593 , arbitrating in other local disputes in 1595 , serving Merionethshire (where he had property) in parliament in 1597 and as lord lieutenant in 1599 , and advising the government on the choice of sheriffs there in 1602 ( Hist. MSS. Comm. , Cecil , iv, 375-6, v. 379, xii, 482-3). "

            "Edward Rich, 8th Baron Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick and 3rd Earl of Holland (1673 – 31 July 1701) was an English peer and member of the House of Lords, styled Lord Rich until 1675.[1]
Rich succeeded his father Robert as Earl of Warwick and Holland in 1675. In early 1697, he married Charlotte, daughter of Sir Thomas Myddelton, 2nd Baronet, by whom he had one son:
Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick (1698–1721)
In 1699, Warwick was tried for the murder of Richard Coote alongside his friend, Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun, and found guilty of manslaughter; he escaped punishment by pleading the privilege of peerage. He and Mohun had killed Coote in a duel, and it was very rarely that a seventeenth-century jury in such a case would not take a lenient view of the matter. He died and was succeeded by his son in 1701.[1] His widow remarried the celebrated writer Joseph Addison, who had been her son's tutor."

            "Global Perspectives on Dissociative Disorders
Individual and Societal Oppression
Edited by Vedat Sar, Warwick Middleton, Martin Dorahy
Routledge – 2014"
           </p>
           <p>
            "This collection engages with the universality of dissociative disorders and their close relationship to oppression. The chapters cover extreme examples such as ongoing incest in adulthood, children and adults forced to kill others, and abusive states in interrogation. Further subjects examined include the utilization of dissociation in postmodern societies to maintain oppression, the oppressive conditions of asylum seekers and the consequences of oppression as they are dealt with in psychotherapy. The final chapter considers how a paedophile pandering network employed multi-layered oppression to prevent the public becoming aware of the widespread and organised abuse of children."

            PIZZAGATE AUSTRALIA MOTHERLODE:
Australian Fiona Barnett testified against Nicole Kidman's father, Dr. Anthony Kidman:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Tired of the constant threats to her family’s safety, and incessant sabotage of her efforts to participate normally in Australian society, Fiona realised she had no choice but to go public.  In 2013, Fiona provided witness testimony to the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse.  She simultaneously participated in mainstream media interviews and published a series of articles in a popular Australian online news journal.  Fiona’s public disclosure led to other Australian victims coming forward and requesting assistance and exposure for their experiences.  Her official complaint against key perpetrator, and high profile Australian psychologist, Dr Antony Kidman immediately preceded his mysterious death in Singapore and attracted global attention."

            FROM FIONA'S BLOG:
"A tightly organised, mafia-style, hierarchically structured crime syndicate has infiltrated every aspect of Australian society including Parliament, judiciary, church denominations, law enforcement, military, child protection, hospitals, educational facilities and childcare centres.  The network has numerous branches and many thousands of members who profit from various illegal activities including drugs, arms and child sex trafficking.  It is a well oiled, clandestine machine fuelled by public ignorance and distraction."
