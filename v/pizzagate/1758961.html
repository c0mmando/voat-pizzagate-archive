              I expect alot of gaslighting, projecting , attacking and making up lies thats for sure. I know this from experience dealing with a malignant narc my father. I psychologically tricked him into going to psychotherapy. That was not easy and he quit a few days thinking therapist was wrong that he was not a narc and that i had the problems

            This girl has grounds to seek legal action. Stalking. Inhibiting her career, due to being forced to remove her art from easy access by potential employers, due to threats coming from THIS SITE. Such a claim could be easily supported, based on the boatloads of negative pizzagate press, including the CPP shooter. A lot of people would readily believe she's scared shitless of "violent pizzagate crazies." The ACLU would love to take this on, and I can see the headlines now - "

            If you still find some importance in Allyn Hughes as a subject here, then public knowledge - for instance, the fact that she was on the HRC campaign design team, links to her public web activity, and
            <strong>
             factual
            </strong>
            commentary on her
            <strong>
             ART
            </strong>
            , I guess is fair, but imo, NOT WORTH IT. Her art, and her historical background - as we know next-to-NOTHING about
            <strong>
             her
            </strong>
            - is just not nefarious enough to defend these comments, as opposed to criticism of the art in the Podesta collection, which IS worthy of such criticism, without question.

              can you update your post? It appears Hughes was not the art director of HRC campaign, just a member of the design team. Your post is great but I think it's important to clarify this point.

               Please notice my other comments here. One has a link to an article about the HRC Campaign design team. AIGA is a long-standing, reputable, and well-respected organization. Allyn Hughes is the little blond in the back row, in the picture of the group of fifteen members of that team. Another is highly critical of this sub, with reasons stated, and without snark.

             Art Director
            </strong>
            , and have you looked into any other members of the
            <em>
             Hillary for America Design TEAM

            ? So far, the only HFA campaign artwork I can find that's attributed specifically to Allyn Huges is this

             ONE

           <p>
            I'm finding this business over Allyn Hughes to be a BIG stretch. Why? Because 1) Every leftist graphic designer in the country would give their eye teeth for the chance to work on that vile yet beloved hag's campaign, for the portfolio prestige alone. 2) Leftist artists are notoriously weird.

            You can create ten more threads and call videos CREEPY without specifying what was creepy about that videos. I didn't see anything creepy. No comparison to "chickenlover" Alefantis and his sick virtual friends, for example.
And I would also be careful to jump to a conclusion, that a woman deleting her public accounts quickly being an indication of being guilty!
           </p>
           <p>
            The videos you presented and I saw showed nothing creepy. Maybe she received threats from some idiots? What if you are a shill and therefore YOU DO NOT DESCRIBE why you make a conclusion that her videos were creepy?!
           </p>
           <p>
            Again: SPECIFY WHAT WAS CREEPY ABOUT HER VIDEOS OR STFU!

              Look how few share that question and demand an answer and how many upvoted that nonsense...
People can be fooled so easily.
Therefore the Alefantis' of this world have nothing to fear: it's so easy to distract them. You can tell them anything - they just don't think themselfes and are not capable to ask the most fundamental, simple questions. Sheep.

             These are deeply disturbed and to my mind show personal experience with such abuse.  Boots are a recurring object, almost always in pairs.  I think they represent her abuser.  You know so many of these "artists" were abused.

              There's one in particular by her friend Brook which seems to depict a baby getting sodomized with a boot or... A tree stump? I don't even know what to make of it.

               This image reminds me of an article or something I saw posted on here about how the satanic cult sees babies as balls of glowing energy that they have to consume to keep their youth.  They believe that once you reach adult hood you no longer have energy and it's all downhill from there.  So they must take the energy from children.  To me this image is a perfect example of this belief. Let me see if I can find the article somewhere....

               I saw that.  It is really tragic and I feel is a cry for help.  I can just imagine these people are caught between hating and loving their abusers as it can be a multi-generational multi-family culture.

            Wow, I didn't think they would take such dramatic actions so quickly.  Now we should all know why archiving is important.  Hopefully someone download her vimeo and youtube videos, as well as archived all her webpages. Boy oh boy this is getting juicy

            This passes as graphic design at yale? Good grief it's bad. Allyn looks zombified. This just confirms that nepatisim runs high among these people whether they have talent or not. Allyn must have done some good killing with Hillary to get in good with her. I still think that H with the arrow means something creepy.

             This is nonsense "graphic art." This woman couldn't get a job at a real (for profit) ad agency or PR firm if she wanted to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her "promo" reels" are head games (promo reels are as important as resumes). Thought not as important, as some Hollywood types once told me when I wanted to make it big in Hollywood or Nashville ... not as important as "who you play tennis with."
            </p>
            <p>
             Makes you wonder about doing more than "playing tennis." I think she's a lesbian too for what it's worth, maybe Hillary had a crush on her.

            Shows that this website is officially being monitored and that those who are doing it have quick access to communicate info to those being investigated. Most of us knew that. Changes nothing as everything is archived. If she had no reason to hide anything then she shouldn't have hidden anything. This just seemingly incriminates her more.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will be no denying it when the time comes.

              Yeah... but you have to understand, most of those people are being paid, they don't really care (goes with their moral code I guess), it's just a job for them and because of that, their job is done half-assed and it's visible.
             </p>
             <p>
              They probably don't comprehend that this is both the immovable object and the irresistible force.

              It's the opposite of what artists do.
