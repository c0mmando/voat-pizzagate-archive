           <p>
            This is an utter rubbish post and continues the deep strain of anti-Americanism on Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            First of all, the article you link to is DOES NOT CALL for Trump's impeachment.
           </p>
           <p>
            It answers a single question of consitutional law:  May a sitting president be indicted for a federal crime?
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps he is calling for Trump to be indicted elsewhere, but here in this article he is saying IF Mueller finds Trump committed a crime, Trump can be indicted while he is still serving his term.
           </p>
           <p>
            This applies to Trump or any other president, and he goes on to point out that the Supreme Court did not delay Paul Jones's civil lawsuit against Bill Clinton.  That when to trial while he was president.  And he points to *
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon">
             United State v. Richard Nixon
            </a>
            *a case he personally argued before the Court.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected any special immunity for a sitting President:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The court unanimously upheld the fundamental constitutional principle that no person is above the law, and even the president is subject to the ordinary obligations and prohibitions of federal law applicable to everyone else. The caption of the case says it all: United States v. Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Secondly you claim as a fact that he makes this argument for person reasons &gt;the fact that he may have a personal interest in doing so.and this is miles and miles and miles from being a fact for the following reasons
           </p>
           <p>
            A.  Trump has absolutely no connection to the court case you mention. None whatsoever.  Nothing about that case changes if Clinton won the election.  Nothing changes if Trump is impeached and removed from power.  Nothing about that case changes if Trump is cleared of all charges and serves two terms.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all makes zero difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  Lacorva is not a lawyer in that case.   He is not the general counsel of the Knights of Malta over all.  He is not the general counsel of the Knights of Malta in America.  He is not the general counsel of Malteser International also known as Knights of Malta Relief which would be the entity involved in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            He in general counsel for one thing.  Their mission at the UN

           <p>
            Why do I say this is deeply Un-American? Because the President is the law.  He is not a king.  The judicial branch is a separate a co-equal branch of our government. The idea that with this or any other president there will be no law is not American.    It's most associated with this guy.

              Perlitz, a Fairfield University graduate who had been a commencement speaker for the school in 2002, set up a child care project in Haiti: Project Pierre Toussaint (PPT). He had active support – including over $2 million in donations to his Haiti Fund – from the Knights of Malta (KOM), affluent alumni and benefactors of Fairfield University, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (a Canadian order), and other prominent Catholics from the Diocese of Bridgeport.
              <strong>
               One of the board members for this Haiti Fund was Philip Allen Lacovara, the attorney who represented the Bridgeport diocese in the failed attempt to block release of documents relating to clergy sexual abuse cases, and his wife, Madeline.

One wonders what exactly in the legal sense is the definition of "collusion", with regard to the actions of a foreign power.

             <p>
              As an experienced prosecutor, Mr. Lacovara might have thrown some light on this. Instead, he engages in the same kind of unlawyerly speculation as the violently ant-Trump press. Editors, do you think you could find someone without a partisan axe to grind to provide some intelligent comment?*

             <p>
              He does not mention Russia.  He doesn't mention any part of the case against Trump.  He talks about if a president is indicted.  You have to ask why?   Nonsense.
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't address his argument at all just launch into a smear campaign against him.   Prey tell why?  Did his constitutional argument trigger you?
             </p>
             <p>
              You are completely wrong about him having a conflict of interest because again Trump has nothing to do with the case you cite.

             <p>
              So what exactly is the conflict?

                  The most charitable interpretation I can come up with is you simply have misunderstood what you posted.  The less charitable interpretation is you know you're making a dishonest argument and you don't care. YES the quote is in the link but it's not part of Lacovara's op-ed......It's a promotion for another piece on washingtonpost.com. It's a video show the Washington Post does:
                  <strong>
                   the weekly Opinions show, "It's Only Thursday,"
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It involves three other people, not Lacovara.   You claimed he used Russia in his argument and that is false.  You are wrong.   Lacovara has nothing to do with how they lay out his article or what links they put on that page.

                   I can't help if you can't understand what the phrase 'conflict of interest' means, or if you want to ignore the part that the Knights of Malta played in the pedophile ring case in  Haiti.  Ot their connections to the Clintons, or that you refuse to consider that the WaPo might place articles about Trump from people who may have interests they want to protect.  I'm not from the 'Trump can do no wrong' brigade but I'm certainly going to point out any persons who may have connections to pedophile rings.

             Liberal here.  The problem is not Liberals.  It is group think.  The thing that makes me a liberal is my willingness to think for myself and be open minded.  The culture has been reduced to taking your opinions from external sources and concerning yourself with trends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine my shock that the people I converse with the most are conservatives.  Problems with that are my disdain for organized religion and my belief that we need to break free from wage slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good thing I am not concerned with fitting in or the opinions of others.  Except that it is a lonely existence.  I cannot discuss things like PizzaGate, Draining the Swamp and DC corruption with my liberal friends and I cannot discuss economics or have a conversation, which does not involve superstitious beliefs with conservatives.

             Jews were the earliest promoters of homosexuality in Europe and America
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews invented feminism
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews hate Christianity
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews call for the end of the white race and instituted mass immigration.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can't get around the fact that these ideas are popularized through mass media which JEWS CONTROL.

             There are a lot of Politicians that are Masons and belong to the Knights of Malta.  I have read on here too that Trump is a Mason also.  I guess it depends on the degree but just thinking about any of them belonging, it gives me the Shivers.  This guy Lacovara  is trying to Pull the Wool Over Our Eyes.  So many trying to Turn the Tables.

              Somehow I always thought the Knights of Malta were operating only in Europe, while they are clearly operating in the US as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the Masons, I think everyone is fishy who is even a 1st degree mason imo, even if he might not be aware what the higher up Masons are doing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, you consent to play a part in these silly initiation rituals where people are led into a dark room, get a rope around their necks and are pushed into a sarcopharg? I mean, c'mon. That's ridiculous.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, I know that Trump is a Mason as well. Wonder which degree he is?

               There is so much Mystery Shrouding those Secret Societies.  Shades of Eyes Wide Shut.  The pope changed some rule in the K of M.  Was somehow connected to Dole of St. Louis Archdiocese, I think.  I researched St. Louis for a couple mos. straight.  There is some serious stuff going on there and what is going on in the country.  Connected to CP and Organ Harvesting.  St. Charles Mo. is also a  Cesspool of Depravity.   If you read some of the submissions of

               you will find much going on there.  He and I worked together and I do miss him so.  The Courage of the Wolf is Still Strong, even though he has taken a break.  He is surely doing what he can do, to help with our cause.

                Thanks for this. I heard about the pope and the former (?) head of Knights of Malta fighting each other, but I couldn't figure out what it was exactly about.

                 Something kept nagging at me about my comment.  It was not Dolan that was involved it was Cardinal Raymond Burke that pope francis demoted.  You will find the proof in here and there are other articles about the fued between Burke and francis.  Burke was a conservative and was somewhat of an adversary of francis.  I believe he knew of some of the things francis did in Argentina.

                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Leo_Burke
                 </a>
                 Also there is this in the wiki about it      In February 6, 2017, Burke was sidelined as the Patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta when Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the Order with exclusive responsibility for the duties normally exercised by the Patron.[9] On February 21, Albrecht von Boeselager, the Order's Grand Chancellor, announced that Burke was officially suspended from the Patronage.[10][11]   I just wanted to Set Things Straight.   This was a Shocking Change on the part of pope francis.  Shocking.

                   Now don't go crazy.  It was a link within jack prine article.  I have heard so many times on here that we should not trust YNW, but when I read it, it reminded me exactly of how I remember it.  What I remember played out on reddit and was not something I read in an article.  It happened in real time on that day.  Something else hit me when I read about the type of airplane and where it landed.  Did Paddock have this type of plane?  Just a thought.

                  Oh, this would make perfect sense. When he was in Argentina, Francis should have protected nuns and monks who were then tortured (maybe even murdered - not sure) by Argentina's dictatorship, but he didn't. Makes you wonder what else he might have been guilty of.

                     He has all the right "Wrongs" in his background.  Yes Perfect Candidate.  I think I read somewhere that the Curia of the Vatican was being set up for quite some time in order to elect the pope that would bring in the NWO, A Jesuit.

                      I love that sentence. It describes so well how they choose candidates for politics, the judicial system and, of course, the Church.

                       Yes, that phrase came to me a while back.  While actually researching the Archdiocese of St. Louis.  It also opened my eyes to the fact that whatever is going on there is also going on in all the larger cities.  Not just LA NY or CHG   but Boston  Baltimore Atlanta, you name it.  They have all been infiltrated.  Sick.
