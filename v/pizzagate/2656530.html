<p>So what?</p>
<p>From the beginnings of the pizzagate, I have thought could &quot;pizzagate&quot; be an elaborate elite plan to bring pedophilia on &quot;the altar of the world&quot; and normalize it or at least make it more acceptable?</p>
<p>To me it, seems so. It seems also a Zionist plan - that has been in the making decades&quot; to divide and conquer the USA.</p>
<p>By corrupting political and institutional elite of the USA - by blackmail and secret orders - the Zionist have almost total control of USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By <strong>Wikileaks</strong> they can compromise and expose anyone they want to and when they need to. By doing so, they can then replace these seats with people who are more supportive towards Israel and Zionists.</p>

<p>This is just my opinion and my opinion alone, what is going on.</p>
<p>Give me your thoughts.</p>

<p>ps. Also, <strong>I really don\'t think pizzagate as a Jewish conspiracy per se.

<p>pps. I think the origins of the Pepe the frog and Matt Furies need to be watched more closely and see if there is anything suspicious. I don\'t have much time to look myself.</p>

            The connections in this post feel like I’m watching  reruns of Rachel Maddow connecting ethereal dots down the yellow brick to somewhere unbeknownst to anyone. One thing to point out is that Q has not discussed Israel right?  Except Israel will be addressed when appropriate (towards disclosures end). Correct? So I’m saving my neuron connectivities on Israel-Judaism- Zionism etc. until then.   Thoughts?

            . But then you added this
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Pizzagate should reach the Talmudic Zionists of Israel also, but it doesn't! I wonder why...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            and the links you added do not actually support your claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have published numerous pizzagate related research pieces about rabbis busted for pedophelia, Israeli use of diplomatic immunity, organ harvesting, potential Mossad involvement in brownstone operations including Epstein, the QAnon leak implying WWII was not an allied victory, and many others. In fact, the only stuff we've removed was shitposts like this that make a mockery of serious inquiry into the question by throwing chaff.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to review our submission requirements and turn this into a serious research thread that makes no claims not supported by links, or we will remove it when the flair is up.

             I removed the line, even though it is more true than false - based on how little there is inquiry towards Zionism.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not antisemitic to raise an opinion or ask questions. Anyone who claims that it is, is not thinking logically or is a partisan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could you elaborate why this is shitpost?
            </p>
            <p>
             And where and how I make a mockery of serious inquiry like you claim? I'm really sorry that I have no time to make a scientific thesis about this topic and waste my life for this. Also Voat is full of shitposts without any actual proof (that could be used in court or verified by multiple points and sources).

             I'm sorry if you can't handle few links without getting upset.

              It's a shitpost because it ignores our clearly stated community focus on research posts backed by linked supporting source material. You are tossing around statements like "It's not antisemitic to raise an opinion or ask questions" yet nowhere do you demonstrate we don't allow that in this subverse.
             </p>
             <p>
              You make a mockery of of serious inquiry -- which is what this subverse and everyone in it is all about -- by "not having time to make a scientific thesis about this topic" and "waste your time for this."
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would I be upset? You are proving my point for everyone here to see. I am sitting on a boat, drinking Margaritas, soaking up the rays calling out shit tier shilling by dingalings. Y'all aren't sending your best. Your flailing is a joy to behold.

                   Don't even try to go there with me. You and I have gone round and round about Zionism probably close to a dozen times. You have defended it, not me. I'm a little disappointed in that tactic you just tried too.

               I am surprised to see EsotericShade again. He/she/it/Zir whatever the correct pronoun is these days deleted my last conversations with him/her/they.  I just figured I’d out debated him/her/them and he/she/it wanted to removed any trace of defeat. What are the correct pronouns?  Never mind I can look it up myself.  Maybe.

               Dear PB, I feel your pain. Rarely come on here now. I’ve headed over to spread the message and meme like hell on Twitter. Like you have been here from very early on .. now use all the information we’ve researched, read, gained and absorbed and put that anger into energy to do our next part of this .. sharing, spreading and getting it mainstream.
              </p>
              <p>
               This site is nearly dead. On the plus side .. all of our work is archived ready for us to show to newbies where relevant.
              </p>
              <p>
               Much love xxxx

                Thank you for your nice message!  Unlike everyone else.  Who seem to be absolutely nasty towards someone who is just fed up.  Good to hear newbies will have some solid reading material.  These same people will see how rude pizzagaters can be though and it might turn them away.

                 Aww it’s ok. I think we have all felt like this from time to time and the nasty messages don’t help. As for newbies seeing it I agree and has been a concern amongst lots of us for a long time but we just have to hope they see through it and see the passion behind us xxxx

               "None of it is helping. Why do we bother." I'd say you chose the right screen name. In the sidebar, you'll find a link to more the 40,000 sealed indictments, and another link to the unprecedented number of resignations by incumbent politicians, corporate officers, media personalities and government officials. Only someone who is stoned and too lazy to inform themselves would claim "nothing is happening."

                So now I’m a bitch because I have an opinion.   What a twat you are.   I’ve had that name for years because I love the pixies.  Fuck you, seriously, I’m not too stoned and lazy to inform myself.  I already KNOW what is going on.   Ugh....you’re extremely rude.  Now fuck off.

               I’ve found involvement here awesome.    I kid you not I am old enough to remember when news was news and people had opinions without getting screamed out. For the last maybe three decades I’ve wondered what his happened? Things stopped making sense and everybody seem to go along with that. So I love being privy to your discussions, and ideas, and learning new things as I go down different trails. So what are we doing here? We are really learning the great art of thinking and we are sharing it with those in our immediate vicinity and those online. We’re going to be here as the foundation when all of this crap definitely hits the fan which it is soon going to do.

                time to give it up,  this website is mugged,  recycles the same posts, and the "leads" that you find go nowhere.   nothing ever heard of again.   people are arrested, but it ain't cuz of us.  but okay my friend,  keep fighting, it's still a good thing

                i've been on reddit years.  i know a shill when i see one.  or read one,  in this case.  the -2 points you have seem to indicate that you can't quite get along with people online.  wonder why that is

               Satan is not cool, because Satan doesn't know what is altruism and what is good for human psyche.

               Satan is cute and also stupid brain fart of human imagination that should be flushed down the toilet.

            You are absolutely correct that pizzagate was staged along with compromised Wikileaks. This is how they chose Trump instead of Hillary to confuse the masses and make deals behind the scenes to cover everything up. They were worried that the People would revolt if Hillary won, and can continue the divide and conquer strategy with Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real story is about something much more sinister than child rape and torture. Read that again.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know the real Truth. Trump is the Trump card. This is the art of the deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at Trump's history. Look at Trump's deal-making. Qanon is the new pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until Trump or Q post the Real Truth - you can guarantee they are part of the game and completely compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            They both know where The Truth is. Why are they silent and complicit?

                Satan is not real and God is not real. God, Satan and rest of the punch are only real if YOU want them to be.

                You can create them in your mind and therefore make them real and allow these superstitious abstracts to influence your mind and actions.
