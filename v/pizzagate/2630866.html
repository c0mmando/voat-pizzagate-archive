            This is what happens when your underlings refuse to attend subpeonas (and lie about the reason), and you refuse to turn in requested undacted documents on time. They did those things because they're guilty and "waaahhhh MUH RUSSIANS" is BS.

             OP tied it to the possible weaponizing of the Podesta emails, which are very much pizzagate. It's not a strong connection, but it is a possibility....

             you are right, some of us are using it to broadcast  news bulletins.  Maybe we should  immediately strike such posts with instructions to post a very brief news bulletin for which no comments are permitted.. The Weiner apartment death and the Stormy Daniels matter didn't belong here either.

              To be fair CDAN has proven to be quite reliable, being the ones that outed Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacy, and Matt Laur YEARS before it got out to the public. Its gotten to the point where even some media outlets are alarmed at just how accurate they are.
             </p>
             <p>
              We HAVE gotten some big leads out of them, like stuff on Dan Schneider, Heather O'Rourke, and Judith Barsi.

            This comes right after that bullshit news conference with the Seth Rich "witness." Which was designed to make sure everyone sees the case as a crazy conspiracy. Now the DOJ has "debunked the conspiracy," and we "need to move on." This seems so orchestrated to me. This isn't deep state panicking, this is deep state winning.
            <br/>
            This is my initial take, sorry to be cynical, but this is bad.

             The fellas here are right. It's a bid for time. They are trying to draw this shit out because they are cornered. They've lost. You've got to imagine that, whenever they make moves like this it is coming as a last resort. They are playing defense. They don't move until they have to. They behave this way because they don't have choices. People with choices make moves preemptively, and it fucks them. People who are FUCKED make moves because they have to, and they are no other choices. I believe they are being whittled down. They are boxed into a corner, and are doing whatever they can to keep their narrative, and ever decreasing options open. The hilarious part about this conference is that they had to have two no name mother fuckers standing behind rod, and that virtually no one was present, and there were no shots of the crowd etc. - They are desperate.

              Yeah, I can see the other side now. It's just an indictment. A play to draw the Russia garbage out even longer. How far could they possibly get with the case?

            Ive read only the news report you furnished us. There is a difference between hacking and downloading on a thumbdrive. . I wonder can any of the hacking be traced to the Wikileaks disclosures. I believe Assange said that the materials he was given could not have been transmitted that fast from to him, that in his opinion the theft of files that he published was an inside job. Im far from.tech savvy but want to know if there is any evidence here relative to Seth Rich. Just pondering...

              I've read only the news report you furnished us. There is a difference between hacking and downloading on a thumbdrive. . I wonder can any of the hacking be traced to the Wikileaks disclosures.

             It's certainly possible that could have something that  connects this Wikileaks, but Wikileaks has said that their system allows for anonymous submissions, that Wikileaks doesn't know who is uploading to them.  Which is why it was very fishy when Assange tried to imply Seth Rich was the uploader.

               Dotcom's assertion is backed up by an analysis done last year by a researcher who goes by the name Forensicator, who determined that the DNC files were copied at 22.6 MB/s - a speed virtually impossible to achieve from halfway around the world, much less over a local network - yet a speed typical of file transfers to a memory stick.

             Hacking and a thumb drive are not mutually incompatible.  In fact, the major criticism of the "Forensicator" analysis is he didn't know what he was measuring. He had no idea what the metadata and speeds referred to Even if he proved the metadata showed the files were moved to a thumb drive  AND HE DIDN'T.  There's still myriad ways the files could have wound up on a thumb drive AFTER the hack.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, you hack and extract the files, but you don't want to use your computer.  So you do this from an internet cafe and when you have the files you put them on a thumb drive.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or you hack the files to your hard drive, but now you have to pass the files to the intelligence agency you are working for.  So instead of leaving a trail of you to your handler, you mail a thumb drive to them or do a dead drop or go to the same Starbucks and hand it to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or you are a foreign intelligence agency and you hack and extract the files right to your headquarters.  But you don't speak English very well or you are an IT guy, not a political guy, so you have to hand off copies to various other people who are going to analyze the files you have.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Foresicator's theory failed just on the technical merits.  The speeds revealed by the metadata can be achieved by nation state hackers.

              thanks,  Sir Knight, I think its safe to assume  that a governmental computer has far more capabilities than a Gucifer sitting at Starbucks.. the Seth Rich murder still begs for justice.

               Wikileaks has claimed previously that it is just like a newspaper, i.e. if people like Bradley Manning pass them info, they are not guilty of espionage, they are just a news publisher was given newsworthy material.  This indictment shows them to be soliciting material they know to be stolen and actively seeking it on a timeline to have a political impact.

              HAHA -not fishy. Please, don't stretch. These players are smart. Rich may have known the deal. Unmasking yourself has benefits in certain situations. Someone who'd thought through fucking the DNC must have known that being anonymous only goes so far. No force of power or opinion can protect you if you don't have a face. I think Assange and Rich, and other players must have known this. Their strength has been turned against them. Their need to remain anonymous and hidden. Truth and light spread from someone openly making moves. They are positioning themselves in order to try and discredit what is coming. It's very obvious at this point. It's a positioning game.

               The Seth Rich conspiracy has always been very, very silly, but it is even more so today.  The Russian cyber campaign went waaaaaaaaaaaaaay beyond the DNC.  In fact, they hacked the DCCC first and used that access to hack the DNC.    Read the indictment to see the full scope and the technical evidence that Mueller has.

               Seth Rich never unmasked himself.  He was murdered on a DC street well after the forensics team hired by the DNC announced they had been hacked by the Russians and well after law enforcement and other security firms agreed with that assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gufficifer 2 who we now know is a GRU intel officer did not appear until Crowdstrike made their assessment.
"Organization 1" worked with GRUccifer 2 directly and they used the murder of Seth Rich to try to muddy up the waters  because it reality, they were working with GRU.
              </p>
              <p>
               Computer security companies are very, very familiar with Russian hacking teams.  They have been following the GRU team and the SVR team for over a decade, they are known by many names in the security world including APT 28 and APT 29.  APT is Advanced Persistent Threat.

               Occam's Razor requires you working from accurate information.
              </p>
              <p>
               The information is completely wrong, so Occam's Razor doesn't apply.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's no way at all to tell if the metadata the guy was looking was from THE TIME OF TRANSFER.   It could have been copied a hundred times in a hundred different ways before the metadata the guy was using was created.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also some of this material appeared on a new web DC Leaks.   A website created just for this material.   That website was registered before the dates on the files.
              </p>
              <p>
               The date on the files IS after the DNC brought in cyber security experts and basically redid their entire system.  The DNC hack was publically announced before the copy dates on these files.
