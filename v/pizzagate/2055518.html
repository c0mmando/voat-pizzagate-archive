            I hear ya. It used to make me nauseous which was odd. Call me old fashioned but I never thought art was supposed to make you want to physically vomit. So I did a little digging and discovered the fetid inspiration these psychotic mother fuckers are feeding off of trying to look cool. It goes by the name of

             And then we get to Henry Darger.
            </h1>
            <p>
             Henry Darger - I think we got some trauma here -  He led a rough, but extremely prolific life.   Wrote a 15,000 page fantasy book called...well, let's wait on that.   He was institutionalized at the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children then worked a menial job in a hospital and went to mass every day of his life.  Sometimes 5 times a day.  In addition to his 15,000 page book which he illustrated, he also wrote a 10,000 page book and a 4,000 page book.   And he illustrated them as well.

             His book is titled  The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion,
            </p>
            <p>
             VOAT could write 15,000 pageson Darger and his imagery and his sexuality.
             <br/>
             Butterflies, horns, naked children, battles,  naked children engaged in battles are among his themes.
Also he may have never seen a naked woman according to some.  His naked girls often had penises.  One critic thinks this is wrong and believes that Darger wishes he was born a girl.  One thinks he would have been a serial killer if not for his art.  Darger said he wished he never became an adult and just had a happy childhood.  The children in his stories are subjected to abuse and torture, but this is by evil adults and in the end, the Vivian Girls are victorious.  Darger also would appear in the story as the savior of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a good article on his life the good and the bad
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/12/art">
               https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/12/art
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Darger was unquestionably disturbed, in a sexual way, but like so many disturbed artists he found a way of sublimating this, of healing the human wound, by the obsessive refashioning of his own early traumas. Seen in this light, what Darger was trying to do was cleanse the world of its indelible darkness and pain. The poor neglected Darger may just have been a dishwasher, but he was the dishwasher of God.

              Serial killers are technically "outsiders" and are therefor part of the Art Brut movement. You dismissing the obvious parallels after only 5 artists is laughable and naive.

               So you link to a set of images that you say make you nauseous and then when asked why, you link to an image NOT IN THAT SET.   and yet you claim no psychosis.

               You made a claim and linked to a page as evidence and that page absolutely refutes your claim and your defense again is from somewhere else, absolutely in no way like a psycho.

                You score zero points and you lose 5 style points for being vindictive. We've talked about your vindictiveness before AreWeSure. It reduces your credibility. As I recall the last time I had made a simple mistake using 600x instead of 600% (which is just 6x) and you tried to drill me a new ass-hole over it.

                You are often vindictive because you have no valid arguments for the most part. You feel you have to "RESIST!" despite that fact so you spew Straw Men and get vindictive as shit just to show you're doing something, anything, to defend

                  As I recall I linked to both a Wikipedia article on "Outsider Art" AND a google search showing at least 20,000 images of, duh, "Outsider Art". You've only mentioned one of the links and ignored the other. It's kind of dishonest.

                 I mentioned that set of artwork several times.  You missed it, it flew over your head, just like the definition of vindictive, which you are misusing, did.

            TMNT=Eating Pizza (Real Pizza)  Chicken=Little Boy   Butterflies=Project Monarch   IDK, but why is it a psy-op?  They are all about this stuff, it is what they do for sick fun.  Or they could be doing it to razz us, and having sick fun at the same time. I remember one of our members reminding me that TMNT ate pizza all the time in their movies.  But you could be right, they may be up to their Magick Tricks.

            You're spot on. I think it's important to keep track of these psy-ops. To me, the easiest way to red-pill people is to tell them what to look out for. Once you know, you see it everywhere.
