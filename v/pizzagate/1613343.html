Cop Arrested for Using Police Status to Rape Little Boys at Home for Abused Children A Florida state law enforcement officer has been arrested and is on paid leave after two 8-year-old boys came forward with heartbreaking allegations. thefreethoughtproject.com
one of these group homes has a yacht club as a sponsor... needs to be looked into further the other group home has the local mustang club as a sponsor..the mustang club and ronald mcdonald house sponsor each other... ronald mcdonald house uses the adult hand child hand logo ...it is a cfc registered charity... cfc is supposedly a govt charity registry but they mostly only register liberal cause charities and can be tied to clinton foundation
theres another sponsor of one of the group homes called the ruby slipper... they need to be looked at more too they have a location in pensacola... orange beach alabama and a few locations in NOLa.... all of these cities r known to have underground tunnels... the ruby slipper started as a charity too Any pedo symbols and
yes... r mcdonald house... and ill show u the otherz...
theres other group homes tied in using pedo logos and monarch butterfly symbols etc specialised sex abuse group therapy for all ages?+ theres also a pizza reference and a very eyes wide shut looking reference Wow. 
that may be nothing but looks suspect af uhmmm what else... all of these group homes i looked at in connection to this case only publish financial records up until 2013 then nothing... and what is published is sketchy 45grand to unrelated 3rd party Doesn\'t sound right having no financial
50k for other ...etc etc loads of money exchanging hands here some people in with these charities may not even know theyre involved
and then theres this.... the cop was the lead of child cyber crimes he helped pose as a child online to bust pedos and had access to cp all day
Yuck
theres a shady shriners childrens transportation fund in this case
at first it looks like a good program to get sick kids to their doc appointments and get kids wheel chairs then u read the pdf and it talks about air fare railway or boat or bus fare if needed... and the people who decide what kids get this funding etc is a parish priest..its tied to the catholic church..shriners and rotary club ill try to find the pizza and e.w.s. type pix and the logos one article has already been removed
the pensacola tunnels are findable on youtube... NOlA tunnels r well known... i didnt find much on orange beach but a few stories online talking about underground facilities...even if there were no tunnels this case needs to be exposed and looked into more
gulf coast kids house did a dragon boat race they won..looks fun..all the boat leaders dressed up but gulf coast boat leader is wearing a fkn eyes wide shut mask with satan horns Omg
theres also a us florida haiti i95 tunnel system connecting haiti to FL... it is there and completed... but is listed as \'incomplete\' i think only elite and traffickers r allwed to use this tunnel system not open to public...
gulf coast and the mustang club.... looks innocent... notice the teen boy in the pizza shirt why is the little girl staring like shes out of it
gulf coast kids house has moved that pic of the mustang club w/ the kids.... it was on their main front page... now itz under our sponsors hmmm...
^ santa rosa using adult /child hand variation lowrey said it looked pedo to him too before he got in all that world of shit What ever happened with him Even his go find me is gone
whoa theyve changed their site as well it used to say specialised sexual abuse group therapy for all ages... now it talks about video monitoring equiptmemt wtf
There financial records link is out
Statement
both of these group homes are bad for taking away kids that arent abused ..they both work directly for cps and are tied to law enforcement my friend who livez in pensacola confirms this and says one is worse than the other... to be fair the abuse didnt occur at the group home that we know of... the 3 boys in question stayed the night with this cop... they were all deemed \'at risk\' youth and its unclear which group homes each kid was from they dont say i got the link to show up but it wont pull up, it says 2015.... it used to only go to 2013 , maybe theyre updating it
im not finding the part that mentions the yacht club now either... i got the financial reports the shriners fund the yacht club members list etc the mustang club does not list its members ill show u how mustang club possibly connects to clinton foundation albiet loosely Great
click the r mcdonald house icon....takes u to their page...
pedo logo imo they been using it forever i didnt do much digging on them mcdonalds is shady af imo and ronald also wears the red shoes click the cfc icon...

              Page breaks are space lines between sentences and paragraphs.
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              Have a play around with typing something and then use the buttons above where you are typing to add additional things to your text. 2 stars ** either side of a word for example makes it
              <strong>
               bold
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              You can highlight a word or sentence and then click one of the buttons above where you are typing and it will apply the action you want.
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                For a page break use (&amp; n b s p ;) without the spaces and parentheses (brackets) on its own line with an empty line above and below it to add a space between paragraphs etc.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                For bullet points type a * and then a space before starting your sentence.
               </p>
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Use the preview button below the text box (to the right of the submit reply button) to preview how your final text looks before submitting it.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope this helps.
