<p>It hit my brain yesterday ... when I saw this video. All the pieces: LV, the arrests in Saudi Arabia, the allegations that the Lebanon Prime Minister was being held against his will in SA by King Salman, of Saudi Arabia. I\'ll repeat that last name: KING SALMAN OF SAUDI ARABIA. </p>
<p>Here\'s the link to the PM being held hostage: </p>

<p>Okay, so KING SALMAN is the key in this. And it was upon seeing a video posted -- a video where the media and Mandalay denied knowing who was in the video!!! Curious they should make that claim since it was CROWN PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN OF SAUDI ARABIA!!!! Further, this video was taken THE NIGHT OF THE LV SHOOTINGS!!!! Look at this!!!! The armed guards are not playing and they\'re ready to hunt bear!!!! </p>

<p>During the night of the #VegasShooting this video was taken. Remember how no one had any clue who the VIP was? Turns out, its Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince of #SaudiArabia #AmericaFirst #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #QAnon #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #TheStorm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are the chances in was in the hotel the same night as the mass shooting took place?!!!! But what if the mass shootings -- which some allege were fake and merely gunshots plugged into the sound system were a cover up for the real target: CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA? </p>
<p>Think about it! If a mass shooting broke loose where he was staying, one of the options might be to leave the hotel. If he did .... he might easily have gotten caught up in what was happening. And if he didn\'t escape, there\'s Paddock with access to the stairways. Could explain why he was never stopped by security since somebody in security must have been paid off. So whether it was an attempt at eliminating him or simply holding him hostage, the mass purging that took place upon his return might be payback for the betrayal/treason. And it\'s interesting that he\'s alleged to be holding the PM hostage. Did Lebanon play a part in this? I don\'t know the ties between Alwaleed bin Talal and Lebanon, but I do know his connections to Obama, the dems, and possibly human trafficking that included: MADELEINE MCCANN!!!! It\'s why these tweets are breaking out: </p>

<p>How does #Pizzagate, Vegas sex trafficking and the recent purge of Saudi garbage all relate? Consider... Saudi Royal’s Child Sex Slave Trade</p>

<p>We’ve always believed Madeleine McCann, the British toddler kidnapped in Portugal, was taken by Arab child-sex traders. They get a lot of money from these blond girl children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madeleine McCann = WHITE RABBIT </p>
<p>I believe that the operation of the sex slave trade was what brought the Crown Prince to Vegas. Whether he was lured there by promises of getting proof of what was going on and who was involved, I don\'t know. But this is the theory I\'ve constructed and it does put the pieces together in a pattern that fits. In fact, on the night of the purge, I even commented on whether the Saudi purging &quot;was coordinated&quot; with the things the POTUS was doing. Remember all those sealed indictments? They started right around the same time and I did call out the timing because as we know: &quot;NOTHING IS COINCIDENTAL.&quot; </p>
<p>Hope I included everything. Oh, except the connection to Obama. Here\'s a chart: </p>

           So this is an attempt to put the pieces of the puzzle together. We all know the timeline/false narrative told by the LV police is RIDICULOUS! Why? Are they just lying again because it's a false flag? I think there actually might be a greater reason this time!!!

            Good post. Upvoted. But how do we know it's MBS in the video? Why does he walk away at the end if this is supposed to be his security? Why didn't they put a bullet proof vest on him if he was a target? All the cops are wearing a vest. But if he was only a bystander I don't think the cops would have let him walk right behind. Curious.

             I believe the place was secure at that hour. And from the angle of the camera, we don't see if sharpshooters were lining the upper tiers. The formation around him looked authentic. Tighter than when security is just leading a dignitary out of a limo and into his destination, but genuine.

             As to how I know, he was identified by Liz Crokin who is supposed to be a journalist. I'm relying on her expertise not to be posting fake id's.  Maybe I shouldn't be doing that, but I am. It's why I included the link to her tweet.

             You mean, as opposed to all the other thousands of kids who disappear?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a good question. Have no idea. Why? Sometimes there's a galvanizing force. Like why is Corey Haim still remembered? A lot of actors have committed suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd say for starters because of what they did to her ... are doing to her because I firmly believe that child is alive. If she's alive, it could be that someone talked, someone opposed to child trafficking or someone deep within the cabal who knows what's happening. It'd be difficult to turn your back on a child that you know is being passed around and made to perform all sorts of perverted acts. You'd have to be a monster not to care.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't help thinking it was something to do with the mother. Gaspar is/was totally obsessed with her. Or did they expect her to go along with the raping of her child? Some do. They just hand over their kids ... like Terry Shields. What a POS she was. It could be who Madeleine was intended for. Could be it was a very powerful elite. Or a function she was to perform? The fact they spent that much time setting that family up keeps drawing me back to the mother.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any guesses? I know people keep bringing up the eye condition, but there are other kids with colobama. I just don't buy that.

               These are people who believe they have a God given right to rule over others. They harbor selfish ambitions to be rich, and to have power over what they describe as (common people.)
They lie, cheat steal, strangle, stab, and slash their way to power. They believe that their actual will power, what the British occultist Aleister Crowley described as “The Will of Thelema, The royal will” must be obeyed and the red carpet rolled out at the Oscars is symbology of the blood shed to celebrate this Royal Will.They are the worlds Royal family's.

                That's still too garden variety of a reason.  It's got to be bigger than that to have the Podestas snatch her.  They were well known 10 years ago.  There was something special about Maddie.

               Hmmmm .... bloodlines?
              </p>
              <p>
               Could be ... it also could boil down to obsession. Think about it. Pedophilia is created by the sickest of desires. If someone took a fancy to a child and they were high enough up the food chain ... KAPOW! That kid is gonna get snatched.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was another idea floating in my head, but since I'm not involved in a cabal of ritual abuse, I don't know if there even is such a thing. But I noticed in these rituals, like freemason, etc., that there is role playing. Like in those Rhianna videos. She's always dressed a certain way. So let's assume that there are roles ... like the Queen of Hearts or something, could there be somebody that permanently assumes the role? Like on the world stage? So, yes, there are all these rituals going on, but there's somebody pegged for the position. Maybe preside at the really big rituals. If this isn't something I completely made up, maybe she's that piece on the ritual chessboard. Or she's being groomed for some Love Goddess/Whore status.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'd have to actually read up on these rituals and I don't want to warp my brain with this garbage, so this is one gigantic guess. Probably obsession. Some big shit was enamored with that child. Hence the plot to get the family to vacation in Portugal.

                  They are listed on the C.A.R.I.S. Registry at birth which keeps them located internationally 24/7.....that is why James Alefantis has babies or children with this eye condition on his Instagram calling them CARISJames....

                 <p>
                  These children are highly prized by elite because they are elite bloodlines, test tube babies...

            Is it true Michelle Obama works for a Chicago law firm involved somehow with international child trafficking? Bet they know about that hospital right next to the airport who've already gotten into trouble for illegal organ donation and dead body trafficking. Of course the owners are  big Democratic political backers.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way Obama's Foundation just held a conference over Halloween with special guest Prince Harry. You MUST listen to all of the speeches on the linked "Black Child" video. The last few minutes of this vid are the most revealing, by the way.

             I think Weinstein was the obvious one. Remember: this is a multi-pronged attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             The NYPD had evidence on Weinstein, journalist's stories had been quashed, and there were serious rumors floating around. PedoWood had to be taken down. Especially since the adoring public fawned over these assholes thinking them God! Imagine them taking the moral high ground in anything! What a joke!
            </p>
            <p>
             So Weinstein it is. He's pushed into traffic. Feldman is lured out. He starts spouting the same stuff, but this time, he's pushed to name names. That never happened before. My feelings about Feldman are pretty clear: I think he's a shill. I do think he's fucked up in the head by abuse, but no doubt he was Haim's handler. It's why he went to the LAPD instead of  Haim. Haim could have brought the whole thing down ... or at least opened up a dialogue because he knew the A-listers of the Cannibal Elite. Feldman was used because he was jealous of Haim. In a sick way, he wanted to be him and be lusted after so he becomes a handler instead. So he goes to the LAPD, but never tells any names. But Haim doesn't know that. Feldman does that to solidify his hold on Haim; to keep Haim from going to the authorities; and to solidify his place in the cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back to Weinstein. That was an easy choice because so many people hated him and he had done things out in the open ... plus the evidence previously mentioned. But here's the rub: he was chosen because it gave Illuminati whores like Paltrow and Jolie to come forward and solidify themselves as leaders of the feminist movement and champion of women's rights. You know damn well that they both slept with that guy. Paltrow was one of "his girls", and Jolie is an alcoholic slob who is held together by cosmetic surgeons and God knows what else!
            </p>
            <p>
             Weinstein and Feldman were also the perfect vehicles to get a buzz going. EVERYBODY is talking about it! Doesn't matter that they don't always get things right, they're discussing it which is light years from where we were in this scum giving speeches and acting as "the moral conscience of America". Think about it? A POS like Kimmel was being positioned that way, pontificating night after night on his little platform!
            </p>
            <p>
             Can't wait to see how this plays out and for people to receive what they deserve. You reap what you sow, PedoWood. You reap what you sow.

              I mention early I thought Feldman a shill in whatever
             </p>
             <p>
              Feldman came first, as doubt rallied around him, people more vocal as his true reasons, that's when Weinsteins and Spaceys dog and pony show started
             </p>

              And Las Vegas and the fires of Cali got pushed back everywhere

               Absolutely agree! She was always on my radar, but now even more so. Totally was a reason for them being together. Paddock seemed to hate her so why were they together? Dig, dig, dig!!!

                I have Marilou’s history saved and sent to secure hands. She managed Uranium One rat lines in Australia and South Africa. She is implicated with FBI brass Mueller, McCabe, Comey, Rosenstien, HRC, Podesta, cia, etc.

                  Yes my posts were all deleted. I was banned then attacked as a bot and shill after over a year of research. I posted about the Vegas shooting link to Waleed the day after shooting and who Paddock &amp; Danley were. Everything is deleted. I was banned. I obtained all their histories including Paddocks plane tail number and matching defense industry, etc.

                 <p>
                  Been ruthlessly attacked since. I have copied and sent all files to numerous flash drives and sent them numerous locations and info directly to some in DC right now.

                   Then it must have been your post I saw because I remember the info about the tail number.

                  <p>
                   Why would they delete your post? That's crazy! It was really informative. I try not to get too into the whys, but that one puzzles me. It's definitely #pizzagate related. Glad you saved everything and have dispersed it. Great job on the research. Really nice. I was wondering why I could never find it again.

              Don't forget Weinstein was being vilified. His brother long wanted him out of their company. When their mom died last summer this was possible. Also they were getting a lot of heat as their last few films were financial disappointments.
             </p>
             <p>
              Worse top elites around the world including at prominent US universities (board members) were furious Weinstein had the gall to put a huge black mark on France's annual fundraising dinner for an AIDS-related charity. NY Times was pressured into covering Weinstein's financial misappropriations and attempts at a personal tax-write off. Spelling the rapid decline in contributions was something many in the international entertainment world would just not tolerate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Weinstein's stranglehold on the Oscar's and other Hollywood award ceremonies had to end too.

            VIP guest was staying at the Tropicana. Shootings were reported at the Trop, Bellagio, Hooters, and other locales. IMHO a lot more than 60 people died. Clark County Coroner's Office just stopped being on lock down about a week ago.

            Lebanese PM's immediate relative and previous Prime Minister was assassinated by Hezbollah. Ira is pushing for a Hezbollah terrorist takeover of Lebanon. It's also a Shia - Sunni conflict. In reality the current Lebanese PM is definitely NOT being held hostage. He's supplying info to SA in exchange for protection until the hot Mid East rising tension end.  Note SA and all of the other Gulf States told their citizens to get out of Lebanon ASAP.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMHO US should be assisting Christians still stuck in Lebanon to come to the US and to live among their countrymen ex-pats. Shame we couldn't rescue more Syrian Christians when there were so many churches across the US offering 100% lifetime support until they were all self-sufficient. Ditto to the Yazidis. Thanks a lot Obama.

                 I'm aware of what people said. People and the police were also so evil as to suggest Denise Huskins wasn't kidnapped and raped, but had a "rape fantasy". They blasted her as a liar on the front page of every newspaper in the country. Then they had to restract everything because she was telling the truth.

              Trump was originally supposed to be in Vegas on 10/1 to tour Area 51 via Janet private air. There were several high level meetings scheduled at Luxor for the following day with Adelson and MGM Corp CEO. He was supposedly informed of the assassination plot on him as well. Instead of being in Vegas that night, he diverted ad flew to Puerto Rico. It was definitely an unscheduled stop.

              Does anyone have a full list of the MGM Corp VIP's who all dumped their stock on 9/12/17 besides Soros, CEO and a few execs? Are you aware that both Hillary and Obama own a lot of stock, under a hidden corp name of course, in the private co which makes high tech security equipment used in airports? All stand to make $$$$$ in profits if the new (and IMHO actually unnecessary) scanners are required in all casinos, schools, concerts, etc.

              Ask Mr. Steve Wynn who immediately criticized Mandalay Bay security operations as being beyond incompetent, understaffed, untrained, lacking weapons, and only carrying their own personal cell phones. Mr. Steve Wynn (my former boss) employs top of the line security personnel. He wouldn't ever tolerate what's been going on for years at Mandalay Bay Corp. Just ask Bellagio employees who've worked under both CEO's.

               Thanks for the info. Lots of stuff I didn't know ... like the scanners. Just crazy. But the money won't do them any good in prison. :)

               As for Wynn, yeah, no way he'd allow that. I don't know him, but when you have that type of high profile guests? No way! It's another reason why I think there was the cover up. For once there was a reason.

             It does fit. I'm aware just because something fits, doesn't mean it's accurate. But the Crown Prince being at Mandalay ... that has to mean something and be a major component in what went down.

             I believe that the operation of the sex slave trade was what brought the Crown Prince to Vegas. Whether he was lured there by promises of getting proof of what was going on and who was involved, I don't know. But this is the theory I've constructed and it does put the pieces together in a pattern that fits.

             Prince Salman isn't a savior of child sex slaves. He just wouldn't want to be directly involved and take the extreme risks involved with the creation of snuff films in the US and of high level blackmail. Some things aren't worth the $$$ due to potential repercussions and terrible PR involving extreme depravity that's hard to make disappear permanently. Not when so many people are involved.

             But that was the excuse used for the POTUS being on the same side as Killary. He was tarred by the same brush and called out as a shame.
            </p>
            <p>
             If they had blackmail on him, they'd have used it! One pathetic fake dossier was the sum total of what they achieved. That and a ridiculous false narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't judge people that way. We don't know who the Crown Prince is and I'll give you an example: Putin. Putin is the last person on earth that I'd think cared about children, but there you go! He did and does and stopped the international adoptions when he learned about the mistreatment suffered by these kids! How could anyone have predicted that? And he was pressured to change his mind which he never did!
            </p>
            <p>
             So we don't know what the Crown Prince thinks or doesn't think. Maybe he doesn't think a marriage between a fourteen-year-old and adult male is wrong, but maybe child porn, torture, slavery, murder, ritual abuse, satanic worship is vile! All I know is that these people were arrested on his orders! And it happened right after the LV attack -- the attack he was caught up in!
            </p>
            <p>
             So could it be just payback? Yes. If we take the jaded approach, it could just be that. It could be that he wasn't getting his fair share of the money from these operations. Another jaded view. Or it could be that he is appalled at snuff films, torture, and children being multilated for pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm thinking that he makes a distinction. The same as Duerte.

              Ok, you're right, I don't know what he personally thinks about these issues, maybe he's one of those who are really disgusted at seeing children abused. And the theory that the LV shooting was a cover-up for a planned attack on the Saudis who had rented the upper floor might be correct.
             </p>
             <p>
              But he is surrounded by people who are also corrupt, and who also abuse children and take part in the sex trade. Even if he's a good guy, he can't bring those down because he needs them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which brings us to the US: Do you really think the military Trump relies on is not implicated in child abuse and satanism?  Maybe more 'traditional' child abuse and less satanism than the HRC faction, but who knows? Think of Michael Aquino. (And no, I don't think Trump is 
into satanism ;-) ).
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever will happen (or not), elite child abuse and child prostitution won't be gone even
              <em>
               if

              Trump will have thrown some of the old network into prison.

               Look, you're talking purification were we all are scrubbed into angels. It's not going to happen.

              <p>
               Even if you have  a best friend, you know there's something about them that ain't right. They drink too much, or leech on people, or can't hold a job, or shoot their mouth off ...
              </p>
              <p>
               This is complicated and deep-seated. Your point is taken and understood. But you don't not arrest someone and have a trial because you can't arrest everyone. It's not logical.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's take one step at a time. What seems to be happening is that at least four countries: the US, Russia, the Philippines, and Saudi Arabia are united on the front of child trafficking. Again, that's what it "seems". So let's take that and run. And you know that PedoWood is about to come tumbling down around its ears! That's a HUGE takedown. So let's stay positive and see how far this goes. We pizzagaters started out with those emails, and the Podestas are being targeted so let's see where this leads.

                Sorry, I don't see Russia and Saudi Arabia doing anything against child trafficking. (And the Philippines?) Putin didn't allow the adoptions to go on, because this was a question of national pride.

                 This whole nightmare is a wake up call for all of us to remain vigilant and not fall back to sleep. "WE" allowed this to happen! We believed the false narratives about satanic abuse not being real and the lies spewed about the great stars of PedoWood doing such charitable deeds. Then there's the politicians that hid behind a facade of morality.

                 We need to think, to act, to vote, to challenge new legislation in term of what it means down the road. In other words, we can't dump being complacent on the backs of someone else. Yes, it takes a leader, but it also takes us.

                  I think the best outcome will involve Americans being less prone to subjecting themselves to anonymous authority (police chiefs, politicians, Hollywood moguls, people wearing lab coats). Then they might not be so pleased with all of the secrecy.

                  Yes, and IMO this won't happen. Why? Because it goes too deep and Trump's own faction would't continue their support. Please look at the people around Trump. Banksters, military, Israel connection...

            Remember This?
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Search the e-mails for the following code words: cards, favors, extras, officers
2) George Soros' connection to Tavistock Institute, and their connection to the Clinton Foundation.
3) “London Connection” to CF
4) Saudi Arabia and Qatar connections to CF
We now have the answers
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Pizza, Pasta, Horus, Hotdogs... Cards...
2/3) Clinton Foundation + Ricky Dearman/ Haiti (this video has a bowler at the end of it)
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfj8pf7_LsU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfj8pf7_LsU
            </a>
            3) Saudi Arabia and Qatar * Podesta paid for ads to run against Qutar during hours golf would be on TV as he expected Trump would watch it. * Mandalay owned by Saudis and Bill Gates, Saudis own entire block of Comet Ping Pong
The Cards! This has a Jack and an Ace

             That's a direct quote from "Statement Analysis." Extremely clear case of blatant lying in both situations. Also proves both are sociopaths/psychopaths.
