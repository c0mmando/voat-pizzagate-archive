<blockquote>
<p>CARTAGENA, Colombia -- Demonstrating the delicate balancing act that has come to define his vice presidency, Mike Pence tried to strike a balance Sunday in Colombia between Latin American opposition to possible U.S. military intervention in neighboring Venezuela, and President Donald Trump\'s surprising refusal to rule out that option. .. <strong>Trump\'s startling comments Friday sparked backlash across the region, including from Venezuela\'s chief opposition coalition and the Colombian government.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is link to article about how the massive influx of Venezuelans into Colombia creates a very good opportunity for the underworld to take advantage of the desperate Venezuelans. </p>
<p><a href="http://todayvenezuela.com/2017/08/13/fleeing-venezuelans-a-business-opportunity-for-organized-crime/">http://todayvenezuela.com/2017/08/13/fleeing-venezuelans-a-business-opportunity-for-organized-crime/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The migration of Venezuelans to Colombia has historically been quite low, but in recent years has increased by 40 percent due to the volatile political climate, insecurity and dire economic conditions. Asylum requests by Venezuelans in Colombia have increased six-fold since last year, and there are currently 140,000 undocumented Venezuelans living in the country, according to Colombia’s national immigration service, and that number is growing....<strong>But Colombia’s underworld may benefit the most from Venezuelan migration and desperation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So guess who has released three news items about <strong>violence in Colombia</strong> and the need for more assistance for <strong>Colombians</strong>?  I have not heard about any increased in violence in Colombia, not that the MSM would tell us.  
</p>
<p><strong>It is Doctors Without Borders, or MSF</strong></p>
<p>Here is one release, followed by links to two others.</p>

<p>NEW YORK/BOGOTA, AUGUST 17, 2017—Violence remains a major problem for many people in Colombia despite the peace deal the government and FARC-EP signed last year, according to a report released today by the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).</p>

            Trump’s Modeling Agency Is A Cover For Human Trafficking. I'm more inclined to believe this is a cover than your wild goose chase.

            </a>
            has taken this huge stand against illegal immigration. Has stated that all illegal immigrants need to go home. Yet there have been allegations made that Trump’s own wife violated immigration laws. Mother Jones broke the story that Trump’s modeling agency was violating those same immigration laws when they brought young girls to the U.S.

            So Donald Trump and his modeling agency traffic young girls. They forced them to lie on their visa applications. Once they got state side, they were crammed into apartments and forced to “earn” their work visas. Donald Trump made lots of money off of this child labor.

             Who knows if Trump was serious about military intervention.  He did call attention to the plight of the Venezuelans, though.  I don't think it was an accident.

              lest we forget that we were supposed to be liberating the Iraqi and Libyan people when purporting to justify military attacks on them that have left those nations in total disarray along with death and destruction.  i hope trump is somehow different than all the prez's since probably jfk and then most before, but it seems unlikely.  even assuming and hoping trump's concerns were sincere it likely won't translate in any kind of action that helps the Venezuelan people

             The founder of MSF Bernard Kouchner was strongly implicated in organ trafficking from prisoners.  I edited my post to show that.  His denial of the possibility of the existence of a bloody yellow house was almost comedic.   Investigators later found a white house with yellow paint underneath in the exact location where witnesses said it would be.  They found medical supplies buried in the back.  You know that saying about" protesting  too much".

No witnesses......established that the women died of natural causes and were not victims of organ trafficking.....a Kosovo Serb and two Serbian citizens, accused of being provocateurs, were arrested by the Kosovo Police for allegedly offering money in exchange for statements confirming organ trading and to mediators finding such information.  The three have been investigated for inciting people to falsely testify that they were victims of organ harvesting.....But constant revelations in the Serbian press that new evidence, or new witnesses have emerged for the organ-trafficking allegations, have all proven either false, or unsubstantiated," according to BBC News. One EULEX investigator called it a "fairy-tale". A source close to the Serbian investigation was also quoted as saying "I still believe something happened there, but nothing on the scale of what has been suggested... and possibly not even connected to the KLA....The Wall Street Journal published an article by Denis MacShane questioning the allegations in Marty's report. According to a former prosecutor in the case against Slobodan Milosevic, Sir Geoffrey Nice, the Marty report provides no evidence, no victims and a witness that does not exist.
