<p>Google said Monday that a vendor mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.</p>
<p>The prominent right-wing website — which has been known to stoke conspiracy theories — blasted Google on Monday after pro-Trump media personality Mike Cernovich shared screenshots that showed a Google contractor saying InfoWars should be rated as a &quot;low-to-medium&quot; reliable site since its stories are &quot;often debunked.&quot;</p>
<p>A Google representative appeared to confirm the validity of Cernovich\'s report, linking Business Insider to his Medium post.</p>
<p>A vendor hired by Google employs contractors to rate the websites that appear in its search results — the rating is used to improve search quality, helping Google\'s automated search algorithm prioritize higher-rated, reliable information.</p>
<p>In examining how the staffers working as website &quot;raters&quot; should evaluate a &quot;rather poor site,&quot; the contractor pointed to InfoWars, advising raters to consider the quality of the information and its reputation.</p>
<p>Google\'s representative distanced the company from the contractor\'s instructions, telling Business Insider that it does not instruct quality raters how to grade specific websites, but gives general rules to get unbiased feedback to improve the algorithm.</p>
<p>&quot;In this instance, we have confirmed that a vendor we work with sent out more detailed instructions to some raters without our knowledge, which included references to specific sites,&quot; the representative said. &quot;This is in conflict with the intent of our guidelines and the vendor has taken action to remove these references in their training module.&quot;</p>
<p>The rating incident with InfoWars involved Google\'s general web-search engine, which pulls results from across the web. That\'s different from Google News, which features only publications that have been preapproved as trustworthy by special staff.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Google explained how more than 10,000 quality rating contractors use a 200-page guideline book to evaluate information for Google search.</p>
<p>&quot;We’re explicitly avoiding the term \'fake news,\' because we think it is too vague,&quot; said Paul Haahr, a senior Google engineer who is involved with search quality. &quot;Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target.&quot;</p>
<p>InfoWars was up in arms over the news on Monday. Cernovich appeared on founder Alex Jones\' show, where he called for peaceful protests outside Google.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed &quot;new right&quot; media personality, Cernovich has become one of the most prominent pro-Trump new media personalities, branding himself as a provocateur unafraid to engage with enemies, promote conspiracy theories, and share controversial opinions about gender and identity politics.</p>
<p>Last year he stoked rumors about Hillary Clinton\'s health issues and propagated the disproven conspiracy theory that Washington, DC, restaurant Comet Ping Pong was the site of a child sex ring.</p>
<p>Still, in the past several weeks, Cernovich has broken legitimate news stories about the new administration.</p>
<p>Cernovich reported on Medium that former national-security adviser Susan Rice requested the names of Trump associates whose communications were incidentally collected, a report later verified by Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake.</p>
<p>The report earned Cernovich a hat tip from President Donald Trump\'s senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, and Donald Trump Jr., who said he deserved a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

            One interesting thing to note is that Fulcrum news is looking to pay $30k to any young "model" who Google owner Eric Schmidt has had inappropriate relations with. Apparently he owns MANY homes around the US and world and buys homes for these young models after having relations with them. He also acts as a photographer taking their photos on the side while running google and YouTube and all his other companies. He's married. He's trying to silence truthers on YouTube that's why fulcrum news is going after him. It's interesting what comes out of this as they have a good point. Google is useless now, most people use Duck Duck Go or some other search engine.

             It's baffling that you would even bother producing that. No one is remotely disputing Jones is thoroughly distancing himself from JA or CPP. 
The question is why? Your hypothesis is that Jones is CIA pedo cover upperer. Mine is that he - via Biggs, as evidenced in your thread I cited elsewhere - had
             <strong>
              no alternative
             </strong>
             if he wanted to stay out of a D.C. Courtroom which in all likelihood would be run by an Alefantis associate. Deny this is a possibility. We had another amusing exchange a while back about this very question. Here it is for your delectation:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               V____Z "I also think it's strange that this Alex Jones cheerleading on Voat was not here before his big apology, and that it isn't organic. I think he has a lot to loose by loosing his audience and it would serve him to have people try to control the narrative &amp; get his followers back, no matter what it takes."
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              rwb: If you realized what leaps of logic are required to make your hypothesis remotely function, you would resign as pseudo investigator and ride off into the sunset in shame.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to you, Jones is CIA, goes rogue on Alefantis for a few weeks until head office notices, gets a phone call from chief that Alefantis is actually on Jones's team. Jones then goes on offense for Alefantis  by going after all other Pedo rings in America, which are also protected by CIA, but for some unexplained reason, they're expendable. Meanwhile, Jones hires ace frontman and wordsmith named RWB to pull back a flock of perhaps 10 disgruntled former listeners who are actually deep reading VOAT/pizzagate threads. And meanwhile, over twenty-two years Jones has managed to hoodwink every NWO, NSA, big pharma, vaccines, CPS, chemtrail, satanic Illuminati researcher of any repute that has come on his show, and yes, even the only person to run for president in the last forty years who should have won. Yes, V____Z you are one piece of work.

              This is a main reason I'm encouraging us to not drop the term pizaagte, and to not take Alex and Cernovich's advice to leave poor James alone. They're telling us that's exactly where to dig even deeper.

             When an Infowars ace reporters falls for a planted fake menu in order to create an ideal pretext for legal action, you do what you
             <em>
              have to do
             </em>
             to stay away from a D.C. courtroom. It's called a retraction. Then, you do everything else within your power to effect arrests, like naming Hillary Clinton and John Podesta as suspects, like Jones has done repeatedly. Do you see anything wrong with Jones saying Hillary Clinton should be arrested for child trafficking?

            Infowars is disinfo meant to discredit the turth movement. So this charade about the establishment being against Infowars, when they actually own it, is laughable. No more AJ and infowhores please.

              I have explained my position with exquisite precision over and over and over again. Jones has told more people that the world is run by a global satanic pedophile consortium than any other person living or dead. If you can prove this statement false, I will relinquish. If you can't, then vengeance is mine.

             There is another website (not remotely Infowars) that says there is a shadow government running things, and they have very wicked intentions.This site also says 95% of what you see and read is controlled by just six gargantuan corporations, which are virtual propaganda machines for the shadow government, also known as the deep state. This site says the world is essentially run by satanic pedophiles and they have an agenda to hyper-sexualize children and steadily lower the bar of what is acceptable in society. This site is one of the very very few news sources reporting that the chemical attack by Bashar al Assad's army was actually executed by elements of the deep state in order to create a pretext for a wider war in Syria. And while the mainstream media and the likes of John McCain, Lindsay Graham, Hillary Clinton, and virtually every other demon possessed liberal was heaping praise on Donald Trump for taking the bait, this website laid out the proof of the ruse and presented deep new concerns about whether Trump had fallen prey to the deep state operatives that surround him. This site is now saying Mike Pompeo must resign, because Julian Assange is a hero, not a traitor as Pompeo says.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now a confession. I lied. The website I was referring to was indeed Infowars. There certainly is a disinformation campaign underway, but it's being run right out of Langley Virginia, and its objective is to lure dupes like you into believing Infowars is disinformation when in fact on a point by point basis, no one here could disagree with a single thing Infowars is saying right now.

               Jones couldn't afford to pay me what I'm worth. Nevertheless, I'm strictly pro bono, because I have vicious hatred of satanic pedophiles, and also those who want to fantasize Jones is not similarly inclined.

            They may say whatever they want about InfoWars and Cernovitch. Any independent journalist should check the reliability of an article NOT BASED ON A PUBLISHER, but simply based on the facts and claims and sources used in that one article. Previous claims made by the same publisher/person plays a role in the expertice of the publisher/person, but keep in mind that previously lying source might suddenly share important truths, and a known truth seeker might suddenly share a serious false flag. Motives vary.

            Be aware that about 90% of mainstream media in the U.S. is owned by only 6 companies, and those six are biased to making money, not to deliver independent news (which they also do to maintain their status as somewhat independent source). Some also use untrustful fact checking service Snopes. We have our own fact checking

             If you really understood the ramifications of what you just said, you'd retract. Google and the rest of the big search engines will eventually save us not just from Infowars, but from every alternative news and information source, especially the ones as uncensored as  Voat/pizzagate. Do you really think google and the other information titans are going to let any dissenting voices remain? Infowars is merely the canary in the coal mine for broad internet censorship. If they can squeeze them out, they'll eventually squeeze everyone out, and then you can really pay homage to Big Brother.

             I have noticed a negative change in Infowars over the past years. AJ has been flip flopping on some issues. He still tends to wake people up but then they need to wake up again and see AJ,  works for the dark side. I believe he is Cointel Pro.
