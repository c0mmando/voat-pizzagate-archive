<p>There were quite a few women who came forward about Weinstein, I am just going to focus on a few.</p>
<p>First there is Rose McGowan. Rose was born in 1973 in Italy, her parents and also the parents of River and Joaquin Phoenix were part of a cult named <a href="https://timeline.com/children-of-god-5245a45f6a2a">Children of God</a> who advocated adults having sex with children. Rose ran away from her parents at age 13 and was homeless for a year.  At 15 she moved in with a 20 year old man who was abusive, her next boyfriend was murdered. At a casting for the movie Doom Generation, she recalls that they wanted to see if she had chemistry with her co-star, so she was told to lay on top of the actor who had an erection. She describes her way of dealing with the situation was by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/29/11-big-revelations-from-rose-mcgowans-memoir-brave-including-her-childhood-in-a-cult/?utm_term=.8c67742d1721">disassociating</a>  She dated the singer Marilyn Manson for three years NSFW <a href="http://magaimg.net/img/5ur1.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/5ur1.jpg</a> In 2011 she worked with convicted child molester, director <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/victor-salva-jeepers-creepers-3-director-paedophile-convicted-child-abuse-a7973676.html">Victor Salva</a> on the film Rosewood Lane, she called him an incredibly sweet and <a href="https://medium.com/codyngore/the-problem-with-rose-mcgowan-f5b5ae837894">kind man</a>  During Rose\'s panel discussion, promoting her book Brave earlier this year, she revealed that at age 15 she was sexually abused by a &quot;very famous man&quot;, she declined to name him, saying the timing wasn\'t right and Ronan Farrow confirmed he knew the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/02/02/rose-mcgowan-recounts-rape-very-famous-man-when-she-15/301306002/">name</a> too.

<p>Asia Argento is the daughter of Italian horror movie director, Dario Argento and actress Daria Nicolodi. Asia started acting at age 9, she worked with her father on three films. In the film The Stendhal Syndrome Asia has two rape scenes that her father directed her in. In 2009 Asia was among some of the stars to sign a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/29/roman-polanski-petition">petition</a> urging the immediate release of the director Roman Polanski from detention in Zurich. Perhaps her most controversial film in which Asia co-wrote, directed and starred in is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heart_Is_Deceitful_Above_All_Things">The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things</a> please read the previous link for the plot overview in order to put this next scene in context. Warning disturbing and NSFW <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpwzQnqFGTY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpwzQnqFGTY</a>  Sorry, the only full version I can find is in Spanish.

<p>These are really short backgrounds, I feel like I could dig further in but I think these few things I have put together raises some doubt on whether these two actresses are going to help us with outing pedophiles in Hollywood. While I do believe Rose has been abused throughout her life, why isn\'t she naming any other of her abusers?</p>
<p>I had 2-3 other actresses that I wanted to include, but I need a break. I may add them to the comment section later or start another discussion. Also any feedback would be appreciated. I you feel like all that I have uncovered is not helping or interesting, I will move on to another subject.</p>',

            Another great post in my opinion. I see things the same way on most levels. I am glad to see the sicko's like Harvey and Larry Nassar brought down. I am all for equal rights for everyone too. I believe the #MeToo movement is also being used for financial and political power plays. I wonder if the allegations against Moonves is all part of a financial power play.

            <br/>
            I do wonder what effect this movement could have on young males in our society. I have read where some are almost afraid to date for fears of being accused of sexual harassment. Just being accused could cause loss of a career even, since we judge people in the court of public opinion now. Of course I want anyone who is guilty of sexual harassment or assault to be punished. I just believe it should be done in the judicial system.

             Yes, I think the only reason we had that story come out about Moonves is because Shari Redstone is trying to gain control of CBS. She wasn't having much luck through the courts, so what better way than to have a scandal hit and the board members force him to resign.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not denying that sexual harassment does occur, but it has reached a point of hysteria and some women are using it as a weapon for personal gain and the ones who do, are really setting women back. You are right men are becoming afraid to even approach women anymore and male business owners are hesitant to hire them, and it's causing animosity on both sides, men hating women, women hating men. It's sad and probably just the outcome
             <em>
              they
             </em>
             want.

              Exactly!  I'm glad you see what I'm saying about the Moonves story. I'm glad to see Julie Chen is not buying it. She know's what's up with it. They were hoping she wouldn't support him. I'm sure soon we will see stories going after her character. Just like Kim K. and them going after her again recently for not saying anything bad about Trump. I'm not a huge Trump fan, but I see how they are playing the game. Once you realize how they play, you can spot it easily when it happens. It happens with both parties too. Hannity is one of the worse ones playing it on the Republican side. Enough on the political stuff. We all see what we see and form our own opinion. I'm just one of those people that believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Your's may not be in line with mine or mine may not in line with your's, but that's okay in my book. 
        I believe many of these women have become hysterical over this too. Funny thing about the word hysteria, means of the womb. Thus, the word hysterectomy(removal of the uterus). It doesn't help any how they pound this stuff constantly in the media. It is a form of brainwashing. Sad thing is people don't even realize that they are being subjected to it. Men are being affected by this #MeToo movement. I feel bad for the young men in my family. You are right about how this may be the outcome they were aiming for.

            BS thread. The whole Weinstein thing is staged production from start to finish. All the accusers and "victims" are insiders who are merely playing their parts. Sure, maybe they are MK-Ultra slaves and abused victims, but chances are so is Weinstein. Makes no difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, we can only speculate what the motivation is for this whole directed metoo campaign. A vehicle for bolstering the anti-male feminist movement? Probably. A way to draw attention to real or unreal harassment committed by adults against other adults rather than to the more sinister underbelly of Hollywood, that is, the rape of children and other more extreme degeneracy? Probably. A way to distract the masses from something else going on in the world? Perhaps. Just general fake news and trolling for the fun of it? Why not. Either way, the whole Weinstein thing is of no use to us whatsoever. They created the drama, they benefit from it. One way or the other, it's a distraction and a dead-end.

             Well I asked for feedback, so I will take the criticism. You may feel it is a waste of my time but I felt like it needed to be exposed. They have an agenda and it's not ridding Hollywood of sexual deviants, it's just an internal war they are fighting to transfer power from one side to another and they don't really give a shit about the rest of it.
            </p>

             You might have already known this, but some people naively think Ronan, Rose and Asia are on our side and brave warriors,  who will help clean up the town of their pedophile problem. I think I made a pretty good case that that is not going to happen and they are not to be trusted.
            </p>
            <p>
             You may think it is all "BS"  and that is your right. But at least I did more than supply one link to someone else's story or youtube video, with a sentence thrown in. I wanted to see what you considered a worthy submission, but it looks like you haven't submitted anything yet? Let's see what you got...

            What if the Satanists and Luciferians went after Harvey for whatever reason. Rose and Asia are definitely connected through satanism. They both are -were close close close with Manson.Yeah, your post points out the obvious. Was Harvey not onboard with satanism?? Makes you wonder. I think youttoo was a distraction away from pedo-Hollywood

             I wish I knew what Harvey did. Since Hillary's side is behind it, it could be something as simple as he said the wrong thing to her, she is very vindictive. I have heard a theory about some powerful women are trying to overthrow the men and take over Hollywood. So that's a possibility too.

             Yes, you are right all three are into satanism  and are close.

             Poundmetoo was definitely an attempt to distract,  but IMO anything that cripples the media is good.  They are the ones who said 'pound me too', I say, okey-dokey.

              I think you're right! MeToo put the focus on the "abuse" of adult women and took attention away from the pedophilia. It was definitely not an organic movement. It was started for a reason.
