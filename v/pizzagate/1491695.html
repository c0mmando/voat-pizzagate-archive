when you listen to this guy, you will think he is crazy, and notice how he says similar things like pizzagate investigators. 
this doesn\'t directly relate to pizzagate, but i thought i could share two links with you. 
the first link is a video of a guy explaining stairway to heaven lyrics backwards in front of a crowd, and it\'s silly but he still makes good points. 
i don\'t actually believe what it says going backwards.  but he suggests a heavily satanic theme , and he has a huge crowd in front of them and they agree with him. he reminds me of randy marsh from southpark.  the video is somewhat related to the 2nd link, because of the jimmy page/led zepplin link. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the second link , is a link to an article, about well known Rock stars, who have been publicly known to have been with underage &quot;groupies&quot;. 
i think making this point to people, can have a significant effect in helping them believe in researching pizzagate. </p>
