            Oh fuck off OP . He can't "discredit" pizzagate because he has some not so mainstream opinions. You can't discredit facts because you have some opinions about another topic. I'm not even a huge of that guy. But you can't "discredit" pizzagate. YOU. CAN'T.

            he's still fighting the good fight. his rant about adrenochrome means he's found out about the Blood Infusion of victims for a psychotropic effect. the old movie line about 'they feed off your fear, the more scared you are, the more they like it' has to do with 'charging' the victim's bloodstream with adrenaline, before consumation. really sick Vampirish kinda shit. David's mind is being hyper~redpilled by the true facts.

            Email in Stratfor  files on Wikileaks about CIA Majestic 12. MK ultra is a spin off of majestic 12. Majestic 12 has to do with UFO secrets.  It actually could have something to with this.

            Obama put up on the whitehouse. Gov site sometime in the last 4-5 months that if their was a threat from space maybe solar flare or UFO. That martial law would be declared. Don't be surprised at what these people will do to hide this. I'll get the link for that later. I'm tired...

            Exactly, if they are prepared to do all that sick sick stuff to kids, then they must have some kind of mass mental illness going on, or a mass delusion to be able to rationalise it to themselves.

            You guys don't play 5 dimensional chess like GW and Seaman the NWO and I have been playing, I have been a truther for 22 years and have forgotten more about the truth movement than most of you have yet to discover, not a brag or a boastful comment. I was a pedo abuse victim 47 yrs ago and my motivation, integrity and altruism are not to be questioned here, I suffered the consequences my whole life from being a victim. Trust me when I say there is so much evil afoot that was about  75% implemented when the Podesta Wikileaks and 4 chan started to unravel all this.. It was coming to a head and through our COLLECTIVE EFFORTS AND THROUGH SIFTING through METRIC TONS OF CHAFF that I was combing through all those years I finally decided to come forward on this platform, and for all that time I was digging that I can honestly tell you all that all conspiracy theories have a nugget of truth to them, except flat earth which is busted. Some were way off some were close but between GW and Seaman and the army of citizen investigation journalists I think we are about to see a whole new world soon, but vigilance is still required. The biggest ever misinformation operation ever , the Anctartica/Alien/Disclosure/Antigravity limited hangout psyop is coming and maybe sooner than what they intended to go with.

            Concern trolls. The pizzagate stuff is real. PizzaGate is actually small potatoes. PizzaGate is about the one McDonald's that Clinton associates frequent. Meanwhile there is a whole Fast food industry with McDonald's and taco bells and burger king everywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            The alien stuff is real too. Wrap your brains around  it and expand your sense of the possible. When this shit goes down your friends/family who haven't been red-pilled will be looking for help so get ready

            My incredibly valuable opinion on Seaman. Not a shill. Just getting a little unhinged and needs to chill. I think he's (compared to me) young, and still a bit naive and impressionable. I don't think he understands that when he gets on these tangents he's doing more harm than good. Maybe he's a bit too isolated.

            I trust him, for what it's worth. Isn't he the one that put together that huge sticky? That was a lot of work. People do have other things that they're interested in (though of course this is pizzagate territory only) ... we shouldn't call them shills though just because they veer a little bit now and then, as people have been previously passionate about many different things (before ever discovering pizzagate).

            David was talking about the beliefs of elite and how it ties into PizzaGate. He also said Antarctica was being used to distract from PizzaGate. His last post mentioned Huffington post article about planned trip scientists searching Antarctica.

            The thing is, David didn't research (enough) and don't want to inform on new leads on Pizzagate, every true researcher can see it... And here he is talking about Aliens/Antarctica and "debunking" FE people while surely knowing Flat Earth theory isn't a PSYOP.
He demonizes millions of FE people who were over the YEARS among the BEST researchers of Pizzagate topics.
David Seaman is a SHILL, and, his timing is PERFECT.

              I don't think he is that ignorant that he went and intentionally insulted and discredited hundreds of thousands of people who support his name and Pizzagate and share his videos all across the world.

              He acts like those FE people are some kind of demonic entities who appeard a week ago..

               He's just reckless I think. And flat earth manifests a visceral response in/with almost everybody. Not sure he's even had the time to research it (a legit look at it), it took me a full year. To me Seaman is an idealistic kid. But I could be wrong.

                 He has good intel and is more well read on conspiracy theories than you think, be it that he does use his platform to get views and notoriety he IS offering his newsletter for free in the first month, he has lost his source of employment and revenue, and like you and I need to pay some bills... People are just too quick to look superficially and yell shill. His viewer base being large enough to withstand the hit from denouncing FLATTARDERY  is when he finally confronted this Flat Earth shitstain that is co-opting the uneducated in the truth movement

            Will check the video, but remember that aliens/ET's/UFO's are above top secret.
As ridiculous as it sounds, GHWBush told Pres. Carter that he couldn't give him access to UFO/ET info because Carter "didn't have high enough security clearance."
            <br/>
            Check the Wm. Tomkins interview by Project Camelot where he is relating Nazis were working with
aliens -- not very nice ones.  Story goes into Antarctica.
            <br/>
            Ending is basically The Twilight Zone's "To Serve Mankind" with punch line ...
"It's a cookbook!"

            Joe Rogan &amp; Alex Jones after resisting pizzagate discussed it on a podcast and mixed it in with aliens and space shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Titus Frost &amp; David Seaman both recently discussed flat earth bullshit along with pizzagate in recent videos.

             Your making things up. I just watched the video, Seaman warns of the fake manufactured alien psyops and flat earth nonsense are intended to sidetrack PG investigation. Where do you come up that he is lumping them together? This entire thread is confused.

              I agree. I was there through whole conversation and he started it by saying Antarctica is a distraction from pizzagate. He said things would build up to a big reveal to distract us when pizzagate hits the fan

             "mental health issue"......Speaking of mental health issues, is there a term for when somebody comes to a discussion forum with a name like TotalObjectivityRequired and they're presented evidence pointing to a much larger crime and they refuse to even consider the evidence let alone read it?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it's called Denial but I'm not sure. For example if a woman named Laura Silsby is sent to jail in Haiti for human trafficking poor, destitute black children who aren't orphans although the woman said they were initially?
            </p>
            <p>
             Or evidence like the CIA being associated with the an orphanage in Haiti which is weird because when you hear CIA your mind doesn't bring up the word "Orphanage".

             Then there's the evidence the owner of a Pizza Parlor in DC has done fund raisers with John and Tony Podesta and then an email chain emerges that kind of implies the "movie screenplay" has some odd wording and through a strange coinkydink has a map of Texas in it with a line pointing to where the movie will be "filmed" and it just so happens through random chance to be where a Conservative Supreme Court justice named Scalia died at?

            This was his "other big news" he had to stop commenting on pizzagate for? After he "did his part" (ie, say "pizzagate is real," not credit real investigators or findings, ask for money)? Come on guys. Stop looking for a hero. Of course he's doing this to make us look stupid.

             Unless the globalists really are going to go through with the fake alien invasion to usher in the one world government &amp; religion. They've been planting alien propaganda in the media and entertainment for a really long time.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we entertain this theory, then it's likely Seaman got info on aliens from an "insider" and he's just not smart enough to realize that they're purposefully preparing people mentally to accept the invasion as reality. The UN has had an ambassador to aliens since like 2011...

            I do not see a problem with what he is saying, he is just laying out the possibility of an attempt by those in high places, that they may try to bring about a huge event to cause people to take their focus away from pizzagate......I have been seeing on internet news a lot of interest lately by several in positions of government making trips to Antarctica......even the Pope and another religious leader I believe of Russian Orthodox faith made a trip.....John Kerry, Putin....David has not gone bonkers, he is just giving a warning to maybe expect some strange happening in an effort to deflect from the Pizzagate story. Yes there may be a possibility they have found something, but they may try to use it to their advantage.... If you want to check out an old story about Antarctica.....look into Admiral Richard E. Byrd and Operation Highjump 1946......I have faith in David, he is not a shill.

            Maybe he could have just spoke about possible psyops that could be used to cover up pizzagate and then stopped there tho. But to be honest I wouldn't put it past these sick bastards to try and hide it by trying to dupe the world with Antarctica and aliens, they have tried fake news,  a shooting psyop and riots and( hopefully) none of these dirty tricks has or will work.

               David Seaman went and made a poor amateurish attempt of "debunking" FE theory without any facts or rational explanations why does it appear in the first place!
That was a reckless and dumb move because those people are/were ALL IN for him and Pizzagate and he intentionally discredited them.
              </p>
              <p>
               That was a ten-steps-back move in this gruelling game of chess for someone who went through hard times to build his reputation as a 'reliable' journalist.
Furthermore, he NEVER informed about new leads/details on Pizzagate!
              </p>
              <p>
               According to all of this; it's very clear to me who is playing a shill role (for now).
I hope we are on the same page here.

            Pizzagate is nothing new. What is new is the email leak, the word pizzagate and people like this investigating it online.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in the 60's, NYPD Detective Jim Rothstein as well as others I am personally aware of, were investigating this.  For every investigation that should have gone somewhere (such as the Franklin Scandal) there was a shut down as soon as they got to a certain point.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the few years prior to the word pizzagate being coined, there is much evidence to show that this was coming. The bad guys KNEW the truth was about to be exposed. No doubt they started planning what to do if the you know what hit the fan.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is different this time? The internet! Social media! The bad guys knew their battle to escape guilt would be bigger than ever. So they started to prepare. And they set up an elaborate game. Like D &amp; D but in real life. The perfect gameboard? Antarctica.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it. Whatever evidence they have or have made up, all transported to a central location and prepared for a 'release' to the world. The minute this gets too big for the bad guys, BOOM! LOOKIE! WE FOUND ALIENS! GIANTS! SPACE SHIPS! And of course, pizzagate will take a back seat for all  but the victims. People have been begging for alien info for too long for this not to excite them far more than than what is looking like a conspiracy theory to those not educated. Not to mention pizzagate isn't their only big problem if they are exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Antarctica is how they will fire back. And win. If we aren't ready. So it's not about the connection. There is no connection. But there will be if they are faced with prosecution.

            I'm going to chime in here and voice my concerns about the motives of David Seaman as well. When I was in journalism school, the legitimacy and power of a story was driven by the sources a reporter quoted or cited. Seaman rarely provides sources. A reporter wanting his work to be seriously considered would
            <em>
             meticulously
            </em>
            source it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, I find it concerning that Seaman kept talking about pizzagate when other "big name" voices who initially reported on it -- Breitbart, Drudge, Milo, Alex Jones -- went silent "at the request of Washington" as Milo put it, after Trump won. There's only one reason I can think of that Seaman didn't get that memo: he wasn't on the distribution list.

             Seaman is certainly sloppy and lazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example he said that "metadata" lead to the Pegaus museum, when in reality it was the content of the images themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             However this (and all the other sloppy reporting from him) does not help the Pedos in any way, shape or form. So yeah, don't expect any meticulousness from him.
            </p>
            <p>
             His motives? You don't need a motive to be sloppy, that's just human nature.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nevertheless I think he is honest and his latest Antarctica video was excellent and right on the money, IMO.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seaman is an activist and advertizer, not a researcher. And we need those kind of people, too.

               Dude, I only saw the Antarctica as psyop video he made.  I thought it was good, and we already had the discussion here yesterday.  So you're just confirming what I'm saying.

            I hope all the people seeing this remember the voaters that were skeptical of Seaman and how he was simply catapulted into Pizzagate stardom. I say this for two reasons: a. to bring awareness to the other voaters (not me for I haven't really contributed
            <strong>
             <em>
              near

            as much as others have) that originally called this that have contributed valid material so that it will reinforce a measure of credibility for them and b. to point out how easy this is to see -- no disrespect intended to anyone. I'm not saying, 'I'm all that.' Simply, these are classic COINTEL/disinfo tactics... called 'limited hangout.' or gatekeeper. He worked for Huffington Post, for fuck's sake. Had a 'falling out.' 'The best way to control the opposition is to lead it.' -- Lenin. Yes, some of the shills are poor at it and suck and you can see right through it -- Mark Dice, DoohDooh7, etc. But look at Alex Jones, or Joe Rogan. Most think that they're legit -- THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE COINTEL/DISINFO. Meant to garner a huge following -- they'll tell you all the truth you can handle -- until they're masters tell them to start pumping the b.s. Then it's, 'Ebola,' or 'Fema camps and martial law,' or 'Sandy Hook was a 'false flag,'' instead of a hoax like we know it to be. This is about IDENTITY POLITICS. They want you to relate to this character and get addicted, so addicted that you forget to check the info. ...rant...

            Everything he's saying lines up with what David Wilcock is saying right now. Supposedly this is in fact what the elites truly believe in. They believe they are a bloodline that traces its roots to the time of Atlantis and even further back, that they were seeded by aliens "the nephilim" in the book of genesis, or the Annunaki from ancient mesopotamia. This is where their god, Moloch, comes from. Specifically this is the god they'd sacrifice their children to and can be seen referenced in the Podesta emails even today. It's the owl that they perform a mock human sacrifice(of a child size effigy) in front of at the Bohemian Grove. Alex Jones broke the story and recorded video of that. David Icke has discussed the elites' belief that their bloodline gets its power from extra dimensional beings. What he's saying lines up with what many other noted researchers have said before. Does that mean it's true? Perhaps, perhaps not. David Wilcock has been saying that the elites know they're fucked so badly right now and that it's only a matter of time before they are completely unveiled for all their crimes against humanity. Because they know they're fucked, they have a Hail Mary game plan of a "Partial Alien Disclosure" type event that will serve as a mass distraction so that they can scurry away into the shadows while the rest of the world is coping with such a mind bending revelation. Supposedly it all is boiling down to Antarctica. Supposedly they're going to break the news on discovering the lost civilization of Atlantis there as a smoke screen. I think he's just trying to get this out before hand so that he can in fact use it as even more proof retroactively should this be in our near future.

            Army, this is one time I have to agree with you. The thing I find problematic with Seaman is that he never cites any sources that would allow people to verify what he is saying. The only reason a "journalist" would do that is because they don't WANT to be verified. That may fly for the few remaining viewers of CNN, but it doesn't cut it for the rest of us.

            This was definitely inappropriate. If he's genuine, this was definitely a bad choice for himself strategically in terms of moving the investigation forward. Even his jump into Illuminati coverage was a bit much. Even if the Illuminati shit is all true, which we all know Pizzagate leads into some related weeds, that information is not what is going to get Pizzagate thrust to the forefront of public perception.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, I'm so fucking tired of people using the idea of Aliens to discredit things. I'm tired of people mentioning Project Bluebeam as being the ultimate false-flag on reserve for when shit is uncovered. Not a single person is actually knowledgeable on the subject of UFOs passed Ancient Aliens and Secureteam10 bullshit. I'm not saying Aliens is more important than Pizzagate - in fact, I put a hold on my research into the UFO phenomenon after 2 years because of wikileaks and pizzagate. However, not a single person I have seen or conversed with online or in person is actually knowledgeable on the history, research, and evidence regarding the UFO phenomenon.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand how Aliens can be used to discredit investigation being as your average individual does not believe in them, and thinks anyone looking into it is a little crazy. But what really drives me crazy is the fact that I spent fucking years researching the UFO phenomenon and have left very fucking surprised at how much evidence there really is on the subject. Mainstream media and culture has done so much fucking damage to research on the phenomenon that it is damn near impossible to get any legitimate individuals to research anything regarding the subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't spend years researching nothing. I didn't pour over hundreds of documents, witness testimony (including military, civilian, government, law enforcement) for no reason. I consciously started this research to build a factual foundation of what we really do know on the phenomenon and made an active attempt to rid myself of all my psuedo Ancient Alien, UFO files bullshit to pursue solid evidence grounded in reality. I expected to be incredibly disappointed - UFOs to me, ever since I was a child, was a "sacred" topic. It brought me comfort regardless of the circumstances and filled me with hope that maybe there's more out there in the world. I was never much of a paranormal guy, or a ghost guy...aliens were my thing. So, as I entered adulthood, I decided that it is best to see for myself if there truly is evidence regarding the UFO phenomenon, even if it came with the cost of my "sacred" childhood daydreams being viciously ripped down as fake, baseless, bullshit claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yet I was proven otherwise, and I was very surprised.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amount of evidence surrounding the UFO phenomenon is absolutely astounding. I want you to also keep in mind that UFOs =/= Aliens. The truth of the matter is, I never asserted that Aliens were responsible for ALL UFO sightings, but multiple scientific and governmental agencies around the world have. Not many people understand this - a huge amount of the evidence we currently have on UFOs came immediately after "The Scare" (yes, our government called the UFO wave "The Scare") in the late 1940s starting with Kenneth Arnold's sighting over Mt. Rainier. Refer to Project SIGN, and read up on the history of it. Understand that there was an intensive study made during the influx of sightings known as The Scare that resulted in government investigators coming to an incredible conclusion - that though we do not have one single conclusion as to what the phenomenon is, the likelihood of UFOs being extraterrestrial spacecraft is likely. Many do not know that our own government has acknowledged that the UFO phenomenon is "likely" to be extraterrestrial. Unfortunately, during the SIGN investigation, the Pentagon was split into two opposing factions on the subject: Those who believed that UFOs had an explainable or natural origin, and those that believed in the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH). Now, during the investigation, the faction opposing the ETH caught a whiff that an investigation into the matter was going down and their conclusion was the ETH. So what did they do? Well, they created their OWN investigation, came to the conclusion that UFOs were a natural phenomenon and promptly rushed their report out before Project SIGN investigators could. This ONE action in 1948 is what laid the groundwork for how we perceive the UFO phenomenon today: crazy, baseless, and worthless. By 1949, SIGN was dissolved, its name changed to GRUDGE and subsequently into Blue Book, which was largely a public relations campaign formed in order to calm the public regarding the matter. Scientists like J. Allen Hynek were hired to "explain away" ONLY the explainable sightings while selectively avoiding the other unexplainable ones. You ever heard of the term "swamp gas"? Often used to discredit witnesses? Well, that was J. Allen Hynek that coined that term. He was vehemently against the idea that UFOs were anything mysterious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, you know what happened to J. Allen Hynek? While doing the job he was hired to do (explain away the trivial, unimportant sightings), he naturally came across cases that were truly unexplainable. This 1% of cases that were in the Blue Book files completely changed his perspective, and from that moment onward to the day he died, he maintained that the UFO phenomenon is real, and possibly extraterrestrial.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, there you have it. Look, Aliens don't belong in Pizzagate research, that's for fucking sure. But do not fall for the idea that evidence regarding the UFO phenomenon is baseless or nonexistant, because that is simply not true. Again, UFOs and ALIENS are not synonymous, but the fact remains that we have not been adequately able to eliminate the ETH as a possibility over many years of multiple organizations studying this phenomenon. It isn't that the evidence points toward Aliens....it is just that the evidence of this phenomenon is making it incredibly difficult to confidently eliminate it as a possibility. That alone speaks volumes.

             If so a pretty decent one.  I'm going with PYSD as awell, his posts go from irate to lucid, although that is a typical dis/misinfo agent move.

            This isn't that far off what Alex Jones was saying on Joe Rogan yesterday, it isn't that far off the wild speculations some have always posted here and 4chan and other sites. I mean this is a HUGE leap, but if he's right... things are changing and it will be a great time to be alive. Frankly, what Seaman believes doesn't matter, whether its disinfo doesn't matter. There is no one here who is that mentally weak to let this be their starting point for our message. But, as always, we have to be patient and realize we may be fighting something bigger here than we ever realized... I hope we did win. I hope we find out soon.

             Alex Jones was saying that the elite believe they are descendants from alien bloodlines, not that they actually ARE or that HE thinks they are aliens.  Look up some info on the Rh- bloodline, colomboma syndrome (the weird eye thing soros has).  This could fit into their superstitions.  Also, the fact that the military and black budget projects suppress advanced tech isn't a surprise.  They cloned a sheep in the 90's, than we haven't heard about cloning.  We went to the moon in the 70's, now we don't even have a shuttle anymore.  Seems like they're trying to regress public tech in the useful areas and implement the Information Tech for us to use that can track and monitor us.  I wouldn't be surprised if we find out theres whole underground cities in Appalachia and the Rockies just for the  CIA, elites, and their cultist lemmings.

              We haven't heard much about cloning because the first time was big news, then after that it gets a bit boring to keep saying 'and now they cloned a cow! 'a horse!' 'A meerkat!' etc. Cloning still goes on. Now they are growing meat in laboratories, like just cloning the steak parts of a cow on their own, to get around the problem of needing space for cows and the damage that does to the environment, as well as to prevent animals from suffering. It's weird - maybe one day people will just have animal cells delivered to them with their shopping instead of meat, and every kitchen will have its own cloning station that you feed the chicken/pig/duck/etc cells into press a few buttons and it clones you the hind leg of a cow, ejecting it from the machine through a mincer.

              I've managed to really creep myself out thinking about that. Would be a good device to have in a science fiction novel though.

              There's supposedly ~150 underground bases in the US alone.

             <p>
              And you are absolutely right about "disruptive technology" (that's what they themselves call it). They were getting ready for complete transition to the NWO but Trump messed up their plans. At this point they thought they had won and wanted us to regress technologically so they wouldn't have any threats or competition to their power and control.

            I don't know exactly what to make of Seaman.From what I understand, he is discrediting the Antarctica hoax., saying it's a distraction. As far as aliens, he's not saying there are aliens, he is saying they believe they are from aliens so to speak. If you understand luciferianism and illuminati bloodlines, they probably believe they are from the fallen angels or as some ppl believe them to be, aliens. So, not exactly disclosing alien information. Idk just playing the devils advocate here.

               I don't think he's a shill, but, I do worry about his mental state (nothing serious) and his safety. I'm sure he is indeed quite smart. (Let's just hope he's wise too, or has council that is.)

            He didn't say that aliens were real.  He was saying that there is a group that claims that they are aliens.  That is a big difference.

             While he did say that he also said aliens are real.  He said there are many groups of aliens some nice some bad some fake. It's weird.  Maybe a smokescreen for the arrests upcoming.

            There has been a lot of talk about Aliens for years....some even say there's a government plan to introduce an alien threat.  There is evidence of Aliens, some of it fabricated, some of it real.  Odd how Allister Crowley's drawing of a "demon" he managed to conjure or manifest through rituals...looked a lot like what people who claim to have seen aliens also describe.  If bloodlines descended from "aliens", well hmmm.... in that book that was removed from the bible, it talked about demons that once walked the earth in material form and bred with humans.  Also odd how that book and many others were removed from the bible by the Church of England about 500 years ago when they started teaching the Copernican Theory of a ball earth going around a sun.....because also in the book of Enoch was a lot of explanation about our earth and the stars above us, how it all works including the calendar that despite language differences, is used worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just things to ponder.  But then again, while pondering, one might ask how come both poles are off limits?  And why is the conception of our earth, charted through actual exploration and used to navigate accurately by for thousands of years kept hidden and a lie told instead, that people thought you would fall off the edge?  Nobody thought that....and why keep that previous conception of our earth hidden?  If nothing else, its quite the novelty....and very ingenious how everyone had it figured back then.....but not even the most educated have ever seen that model or its mechanics....instead a lie that people thought you would fall off the edge.
           </p>
           <p>
            And while we're asking questions......NASA has been going up into outer space for 60 years.  By the 1980's the public wanted to go too.  But we all remember how that turned out....members of the public were selected and all died when the rocket blew up, proving space travel is best left to the professionals....us laymen can see it in images (imagery being the most powerful tool in magic according to the satanic bible).  Its been 30 years since that shuttle accident....and since there have been thousands of launches to put satellites in place, there's regular travel to and from the space station for different astronauts to do their stints up there.....and for 30 years with thousands of missions, there's been zero accidents...a 100% safety record.....so now can we make a tour for the public up into low orbit?  Come on, I'd like to go for a "trip around the world".   With NASA's 20 billion a year, maybe they could set up a public tour of low orbit space..if they charged people that would pay for itself.  I think we should petition for a low orbit public tour... a ship that can take a few passengers 100 miles up, instead of investing in a craft to go 300,000,000 miles out to Jupiter to take a few images of Jupiter close up.....I mean I could use Photoshop and make the images of Jupiter for them if they would just grant us a public tour.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's the message of all that "science"? ...its the name of the a recent Hawkins documentary even:  "There is no God".  Or you can catch famed astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss on his travelling roadshow preaching at universities....after explaining how the universe began with a star exploding.....he always uses his punchline "Forget Jesus!  Thank a star for dying so you could be here!!", or you can see Bill Nye, the failed comedian turned television scientist, at the opening of a Noah's Ark exhibit screaming "its child abuse to teach the bible!".....or now in grade school curriculum....the correct answer on tests is "God is a myth"...the answer is wrong if you make any other choice on the standardized testing.  Not suprising, most of those involved with the space program or those who developed the notion we live on a ball, to include Pythagorean who first thought up the idea, but couldn't draw up a working model...to Copernicus who finally drew a working model.....to Disney and Von Braun who took us to the moon....are all associated with "satanism"...go figure.

             And for those thumbing this particular comment down....there was no insinuation.....merely pointed out facts and left if for others to make their own conclusion.  Every fact in there can be confirmed.  Yet it gets thumbs down?  Sounds a lot like those who oppose the pizzagate information.....the initial response....."that's impossible", "that can't be true", yet have done zero research on the matter or their vision clouded by all the programming.

             Meanwhile, yeah, if the earth were the ball in those photos from outer space or depicted on google earth, and taught to us in textbooks....a sphere 24,901 miles in circumference....its easy to do the math, Chicago would be more than 2,000 feet over the horizon and out of line of sight from the shore 60 miles away across lake Michigan...but its not.   Even the waves crashing on the shore 10 miles away across any body of water would not be visible but they are with a zoom camera.   Or ships could not be spotted 30 miles out at sea....unless they were more than 600 feet tall.....maybe its optical illusion, light bending, or something else that can't be proven or replicated....that can account for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what about the sun?  Its 93 million miles away.  The moon is only 240,000 miles away....yet they appear the same size.  Science uses the laws of perspective to account for that, saying the sun is 400 times further away and 400 times larger than the moon.  So if that's true.....then how come the sun and moon change size as they get closer from our vantage point?  The sun can be seen doubling in size as it moves from horizon to mid day.  By those same laws of perspective, we'd have to get 47 million miles closer to the sun for it to double in apparent size....but the earth is only supposed to be 8,000 miles in diameter.  Hmmmm......Houston, stuff don't quite add up.
            </p>
            <p>
             What about weather?  Shouldn't the length days and weather be almost identical in opposite latitudes during opposite seasons?  They should be, but aren't.....and if the earth really is spinning at 1,000 mph, while orbiting the sun at over 60,000 mph, the sun orbits in our Milky Way galaxy at around a half million miles per hour as the entire galaxy hurls through infinite space at over a million miles per hour.....and every star we see is a sun in its own galaxy undergoing similar mechanics....and constantly moving millions of miles per hour too....(yes, those are the mechanics of the Coperincan model we're taught) then how come the North Star hasn't moved since observation began being recorded hundreds of years ago?  How come the constellations haven't changed if each star is moving more than a million miles every hour?  If all those motions were true....we wouldn't see the same star patterns two nights in a row....to to mention if you draw a diagram...in just our orbit around the sun......the night time sky points a completely different direction out into "outer space" in opposite seasons...we'd be looking at an entirely different set of star in summer than in winter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back in reality, everything we see is explained perfectly in the previous conception of the earth that is kept hidden.

             The earth is not a spinning ball. The sun and moon are simply lights. They circle the flat earth, above us. Antarctica is not a continent, it's the outer wall of the flat earth. There is no 'outer space.' Etc. I avoided the subject like the plague for a year, then I gave it a shot. My mind was blown. And as they say, once you go flat, you can never go back.

              People dont' even know the mechanics of the model they believe in.......or they would see it doesn't work.  All they know is that is what was taught in school, that's what everyone says on TV.....and "that's what everyone believes".....or "nobody could lie like that, too many people would have to be involved for such a lie".....well not to be rude, buy hey dummies look at all those photos from outer space....they are fake.....snap out of it!! lol   In case nobody caught on yet, yeah, we being run by satanists....yeah they do human sacrifice...and no it didn't start with Alafantis or Abramovic...and those people are very well practiced in the "art of deception".
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously, just go to google and type in "photo of earth" and find one you think looks real.  Yeah, it really is that obvious and the magic that powerful to have everyone glance at those photos in amazement never even noticing they're fake.  Same magic that keeps so many from seeing Pizzagate.  You could call Megyn's interview "magic" or make believe. She "cast a spell" to make people believe Alafantis innocent...pizzagate conspircy theory.   Oh and there's much more, those people have been at play for a long, long time...stole many a man's soul and grace.

              People will say you're crazy.  In every show on TV that notion is scripted in....the notion anyone who thinks the earth is flat is crazy.  Its in Bugs Bunny cartoons, Flintstones, you name it.  Maury show, Breaking bad....if you watch, they put that in there everywhere....I saw it in the last two series I watched on netflix....in the one, a scene started with two characters in a car with the radio playing, the radio host came on and said "I had someone call in the other day saying the earth was flat, I told him to put down the crack pipe", in the other it was just referencing it to call someone stupid, something like "you so dumb, you probably think the earth is flat".  Even in Obama's speeches.....things such as "they must have been founding members of the flat earth society", or "they probably thought the earth was flat when Columbus set sail" to reference someone's stupidity.....with all of that put in the programming, is it any wonder people respond by calling you crazy or dumb?  Just like it said in the programming over and over?  I responded the same way for a long time too.

              Add to that the reinforcement of the ball earth....its everywhere....in logos, in text books....In the latest "department of education" basic math books...they are more bent on teaching how the universe works (instilling a lie) than they are on teaching why 2+2=4.  Alefantis is a small player in the bigger game of satanists.  Guys like Albert Pike or Walt Disney were much bigger players, bigger than Crowley or Levey....and its no coincidence that latest "photo of earth" taken by a space ship from almost a million miles away.....says "SEX" in the clouds...the same slight of hand can be seen in Disney's children's programming...or in that intro to the kids series with scenes filmed at the pizza place.  Here:

             <p>
              Universal Studios has been using the ball earth picture in their movies since 1915, although NASA didn't go up to get that image until 1972.....amazingly, it matched the logos they'd been using exactly!!  lol  But of course that image NASA took....its a painting, not a photo....look at it.  Yet its been in textbooks ever since. Back in reality, we watch a big public production (like the shooter at the pizza place all fake) of a rocket being launched, then we see it go out of sight over the ocean.....then the switch to televised images.  Oh the magic of Disney!!  The reality of that is, nobody knows where that rocket went except the people aboard it if there were any.....check old news footage how they show the "emergency escape chute" that goes down the center of the rocket to a room beneath the launch pad.....which also explains why those actors...i mean "members of the public" who died in 1987, are still alive and well holding teaching positions at universities or high level position in government.
             </p>
             <p>
              For those who believe.....all I can say, is if they ever do get a chance to go up into outer space themselves....don't forget to bring your light sabers kiddos!!  NASA = Disney for adults.

                I think its all relevant.  I mean pizzagate is figured out, just need law enforcement to investigate.....everyone seems to have figured out there's some satanic crap involving children that goes on there.  I think there was even a thread at one point about Planned Parenthood and all their lies....the only thing they really offer is to take children off your hands dead or alive.....termination or adoption.  Its all tied together, the usual suspects out lying to sell planned parenthood as something its not, and legislating it in.  Bringing down pizzagate is only whacking a small tentacle off the evil that has permeated itself throughout society, or taking out some low level witches of that cult, if you want to put it that way.  Sure it pisses us off to see what's going on at the pizza place with a few politicians or artists involved....but the works of the bigger tentacles or bigger witches does more to harm the world we live in and has an agenda that won't end well for too many.

            Fuck this alien bullshit. Let's just say he's telling the truth ( just humor me here), why the hell would you bring this up
            <em>
             now
            </em>
            ? Especially knowing how the media already does its damnest to make PG look fake? Why not wait till after PG gets busted to talk about this stuff, so then people will be less dismissive of these crazy theories? Why the FUCK would you bring it up now, and risk slowing down PG, which in-turn allows kids to be abused for longer?
           </p>

            Fuck you Seaman, you are now indirectly involved in harming kids.

             The only real world reason for him to move on to aliens - again assuming it's true - is actually something he alluded to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, he's claiming pizzagate is a done deal.  Arrests and disclosure any minute according to his sources.  So he's moved on to the next issue - he claims to investigate things before they enter the regular news cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
             So he won't cover pizzagate anymore because it's days away from entering the major news cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
             But this implies that he has a legit source about aliens.
            </p>
            <p>
             Coupled with the recent FBIAnon, I'd say that if PG doesn't break next week, the we have a real mess on our hands.

              They already have the technology to build spaceships, they've been building them for decades, even longer. Russia and Iran in recent years have been weaponizing plasma pulse (Magrav) technology. They used it to turn the USS Donald Cook into a floating brick in the Black Sea and also severely damaged the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the North Sea. Iran used it to down 2 US spy drones. It makes all conventional weapons and oil obsolete. The US has had it for much longer than anyone else and has been trying to suppress the knowledge of it's existence.

                Not if they really do want to go through with the fake alien invasion. When "spaceships" show up using futuristic technology that no one ever knew existed, the majority of people will buy into it. Also, they needed to protect the oil revenues of their middle east allies. The stranglehold on the world's oil supply has been hugely profitable for the globalists. Obama signed an executive order banning this technology.

              Aren't they saying that the people involved believe the fucked up alien shit? I mean the beliefs are really no crazier than scientology (besides the added pedo shit).... scientology also infiltrated gov't as well.

               no i think the suggestion is that to keep the left wing glombies ypnotised, they come out with a big aliens are real shtick, make it appear paper thin so the lefties see through it, but that reinforces their skepticism of other 'conspiracy theories'

             Any chance he's under duress? Wasn't a friend of his murdered recently? Maybe he started out on our side but bowed down to pressure. Just a thought. He was one of the first relatively high-profile journalists to take this thing in any way seriously.

              Since Alex Jones went off on pizza gate on Joe Rogen's podcast this week, I say we all hit Alex with pressure to keep covering this and talking about it on his show. He has a big audience and platform and he has experience handling threats and intimidation.

               The way Alex Jones sucked up to the Comet-shooting "witness" proves to me that he could not handle threats and intimidation - at least not this time.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, remember that the bigger you are, the more you have to lose. Alex Jones is no longer some lone talk-show host, but is running a multi-million dollar business. That makes him more vulnerable.

               Alex Jones is a gatekeeper. Why would you ever mention him? He gives 70% of the truth to sell 30% of lies. And he purposley acts crazy to discredit himself, and his fans by association. Plus he is performing a charachter. A well know fraud to discredit the truth movement.

              Possible. I noticed he rarely mentioned JA in the beginning but then after PGG guy was threatened he went after JA. And he's the 49th most powerful guy in DC. Maybe he got flexed on.

                Like he did with that other guy who was making the Pegasus videos - if JA is friends with a whole lot of extremely shady characters who could easily get someone to find out where D Seaman is and send someone to scare him. JA was also telling the other guy how to word things and what to say to throw people off the scent etc. He was obviously kind of good at the manipulative stuff. So I can see the same person twisting DS arm telling him to turn into a crazy conspiracy theorist type to discredit the whole thing.

              Who can really say at this point? He could have been forced to do this, or he could be under lots of stress and just snapped, or he could just be a shill that had planned this all along. There is just no telling.

              Either way, he has now put a hit on PG's credibility. How big that hit is remains unclear.

               Neither Jones nor Seaman is trying to betray this investigation; they are trying to get to the truth.
Anyone who thinks there is nothing to ET's/UFO's and reports that our government has been working with aliens for decades needs to do more reading. 
"Ancient Aliens" series is also helpful.

             I don't know, but can anyone give an explanation why there are not public flights up to low orbit?  Seriously, back in 1987, the public was demanding it...then that accident demonstrated its too dangerous for the public to go up there.  There's been a 30 year track record of no accidents since then.  Do the rockets only blow up when the public tries to go up there or what?   Don't you think for 20 billion a year, it would be of more value to the public to set the shuttle up for passengers instead of payload?  They could charge for the trips, people would pay large amounts to go up and circle the earth in orbit....that program would pay for itself...and seems way easier to do than sending a craft all the way to Mars....30 million miles away to take a photo....or to Jupiter 300 million miles away.  Low orbit begins at 50 miles up....not a million.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yeah, I do wonder if they really go up there.  I mean here's the press conference..yeah, edited down....all the circle jerk promotion and talk about how they're going to name their kids after the mission...what a great achievement for mankind...etc was removed and what's left for proof they went anywhere?  Sounds to me like they lying.  That Adam guy, the team leader....I mean come on...really?  With 20 million a year in tax funding, you'd think they could hire a better actor....like DeGrasse Tyson..he at least sounds smart.   But of course the entranced won't see anything wrong with the press conference...they "Believe" those guys really remotely landed a craft on the surface of a planet 30 million miles away.  When I look at it, I see actors. Same trick as the "gunman" at the pizza place.  Or the news stories of shootings that came with the push for gun control.  Funny how mass casualty shootings went from an average of 3-5 per year up until 2008 or so, to over a hundred per year now.  Most if not all just theater, to "demonstrate the need for gun control", same way all the civilians who tried to go to space died to "demonstrate its not safe for the public", or the shooter at the pizza place to "demonstrate how dangerous fake news is"

              And if you really want to go down the rabbit hole, this movie here puts it into context of how the game of make believe is played and eludes to who's behind it.....using the script from Tom Stoppard's 1960's popular Broadway play "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"...where the "tragedians" theater controlled what comes to pass.  In the one scene when trying to figure out what the thespians (tragedians) were really all about......it is asked "so you're not exclusively players then?" (meaning you're not just actors)....to which its replied by the troupe leader "no, we are inclusively players (their own club)...we do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off, which is a kind of integrity for those who see every entrance as an exit somewhere else"....or in other words those who see things backwards...something satanists learn to do.  Another example of how acting plays into everything, is an old game show on TV, where the contestants are blindfolded celebs who ask questions of a guest and try to figure out who it is....Jerry Lewis (hollywood pedo who like Saville was always raising money and working with children's charities) was one of the blindfolded contestants.....and Walt Disney was the guest.  Lewis figured out it was Disney but before guessing, asked the question "Are you an actor on stage and off?"  hmmm  Anyways see if you can make sense of this movie.....and yes, this all does tie to Pizzagate, but is way up the flagpole from the pizza shop and their little stab at film making.  This shows the magic done in our television news....

              (notice the trans sexual on stage too?)
             </p>
             <p>
              And a little clip here.....an old recording used privately in his office laboratory for the first testing of television broadcasting by inventor John Baird (another member of the club).....if you listen to what he and the dummy talk about (the dummy is freaky, in real life it was just a head on a box, with mechanical controls to move it, evidently Baird was also an accomplished ventriloquist)....it too gives a clue to what television programming is all about.

            Looking like Seaman
            <em>
             might
            </em>
            be a disinfo shill.  From what I hear, he never reported much of the actual evidence on pizzagate.  It could easily be that he was just getting himself associated with pizzagate and building cred so he could then start spouting nonsense and make pizzagate look like tinfoil-hat stuff.  The main things here that sound nonsensical so far are (1) the claim that the Clintons believe they are descended from aliens:
           </p>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/827335239718543361">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I do believe aliens exist, but this sounds completely ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            And (2) this retweet about "Reptilians":
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ILMDRACOS/status/826906569858220032">
             https://twitter.com/ILMDRACOS/status/826906569858220032
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, flairing this post as important.  Whether you believe Seaman is a shill or not, this is very significant.

             I've thought this too. The way he seemed to use Pizzagate as a means to get views, only to focus a lot of the videos on advertising a cash-for-gold service, was pretty alienating (not a pun) imo.

             Voat's gone to the dogs. Short life. And it was your comment that was the nail in the coffin.

              Care to explain?  Seaman tweeting about reptilians and claiming the Clintons believe they are aliens doesn't concern you?  Also, what is "the main board"?

               Reptilian is the name given to humans missing that part of the brain that enables one to feel empathy for others etc. Psychopaths, pedophiles, warmongers; those involved in satanic rituals have shown to be missing this part of the brain and that is where that 'labelling' comes from.
              </p>
              <p>
               Much has been withheld from the world in regards to UFO sightings and the secret practice of the occult by those in the upper echelon of power/society who worship what they consider is some alien power.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am not at all concerned about David - he is speaking his truth and it's not at all different in subject to what David Icke has been presenting to the world for decades. It's not new subject matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know what or who the Clintons believe they are but they are definitely missing the empathy chip. They have behaved as 'aliens' in terms of kindness toward and respect of others living on this planet - that's indisputable.
              </p>
              <p>
               I defended David.  He proved a brave soul with PizzaGate and a true fighter.  He has grown in his fearlessness and they're the kind of journalists that we are desperately missing. Not everything he reports will ring true nor be what others want to here but at least on this forum contributors should have afforded themselves time to study up and extend some respect/reserve before going into slay him. The past eight months or so, since the leaks, have brought forth a new reality and people like David Seaman and YOU are sharing these new truths that are being uncovered - as horrific and unpalatable as they are.
              </p>
              <p>
               Voat has been overtaken by shills - they are as transparent as can be. Armyseer, ConcernedParent2 etc etc - To let them destroy the mainboard of Voat being PizzaGate - well that's your call. David is clearly not a disinformation agent nor has he lost the plot. But that's exactly what those you have been tasked with destroying Voat and Pizzagate investigations are about.
               <br/>
               Best of Luck going forward, and 'thank you' for the immense part you've played in archiving the work of PizzaGate findings.

                Just so you know, we have consistently deleted armyseer's posts, because he does not provide adequate evidence for his claims.  His sub is not a part of our network and we are not associated with him.  Also, to be clear, I am not at this point asserting that Seaman is a shill.  I'm just very concerned about some of his tweets, which could easily be used to smear pizzagate as "tinfoil."  This could just be a lack of caution on his part (as far as not being being clear enough about what he is saying in some of his tweets and re-tweets), or a lack of awareness about information warfare, but it is definitely a potential problem, particularly if these rumors of an ongoing investigation and impending arrests are just disinformation intended to kill the citizen investigation.

                  Earth is flat, okay.  doesn't really matter to me, I don't find it important. Its not something I can change and there is lots of mystery in the world, so I'm not fussed with it round, flat, donut shaped, doesn't matter. I didn't find the video compelling. it was too swirly and made me seasick and I didn't understand the physics, for example gravity makes no sense if earth is flat, neither does the fact that the water is reversed in toilets in australia or africa and the sun is  towards the north. sorry, maybe the video addresses this better than first hand experience?

                   It matters. And you're giving up too easily. Gravity is a theory, it doesn't exist. How does gravity keep the oceans from flying off a spinning ball yet lets a small bird fly across the water, and insects jump from the earth? The swirling sink water is not true, that's a myth. Nasa is a hoax. Etc. (Maybe try some other videos, or just come back to the subject in several months if you're so inclined.) Have to run.

                    red-pilling people on FE in a pizzagate forum is futile. Trust me i've tried it. You have to let them discover this on their own, much like pizzagate. It's an entirely different pill.

                    I cal buy into NASA is a hoax, I can even prove that. But I can also prove the earth isn't flat. That's easy. There are a few very obvious issues with it. Now I actually have respect for you bopper, you're a good contributor here, so I'll take is seriously and discuss it with you, but it does amaze me that you seem to believe this stuff. I don't want it associated with pizzagate any more than aliens which are very possible...

                     I appreciate your consideration and what you said about me. I am risking my rep a bit here, I know, by talking about this - so I will stop. It is not something that you can teach/tell someone, they have to learn/discover it themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Flat earth is something that should be discussed privately and delicately. I fully understand you being amazed w/ me espousing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And, the last thing I want to do is discredit the pizzagate investigation, I am a mere pygmy compared to the work you guys have done. Thanks again, sincerely.

                      I have never understand how you can think the earth is flat and the sun travels in a circle. In the model of flat earth I looked into this picture would not be possible, yet it happens twice a day at different times in different spots of the planet. Based on that it's just not possible. Why does the sun sink At sunset? For instance see this picture? It's not representative of a flat earth and we all can observe it every day.

                        I have never down voted you and actually i upvote you every time we talk even if I disagree. As long as you're being respectable to me, I'm cool with what you say. I had respect for you for over a month or so on here since I first came. There are a few names on here that I have a lot of respect for HTH is another I have great respect for. Doesn't mean we will always agree, but he will get my up. Upvotes because I respect him. I don't really care about votes though. Whatever.....

                         I appreciate that. I was never on Reddit although I followed pizzagate since the emails came out. I finally decided to join in (here on Voat) after everyone was shut down by the cannibal :)  Yeah I don't care about votes either but I know others are sensitive about it. Anyway, it has been enlightening being here on this forum.

                       The vanishing sun you're looking at is simply our perspective, what our eyes see, like looking down a long corridor until there's a vanishing point. It simply looks like it's sinking when indeed it is just moving out of your vantage point, traveling onwards and making its circuit.

                       This is the last thing I'll say 'cause it's bedtime and I have trouble sleeping ... you are experiencing what I experienced when I tried to disprove it. I loathed the fact that every objection I brought up there was an answer to. It is quite aggravating. I eventually had to admit, I simply cannot prove the earth is round. Thank you again, you can always PM me, but I better shut-up, I hope you do indeed check it out. (Please do not think that I am being condescending, I promise I am not.)

                        I mean clearly it's not helping my votes by discussing this which is amazing to me.. like wtf? Anyway but if the sun were to circle around then it would just get smaller, and smaller and curve off to the right which it kinda does, but we would still be able to see it in the sky and follow it all the way around to the back side, if wouldnf rise or set but get smaller and smaller.. but with a telescope or even just the naked eye we would still see it.. I don't get how it completely disappears at a huge size if it's still in the sky over a flat earth. That makes no sense to me. And there are other problems with the theory. Such as if it were flat and you flew west the plane would have to be constantly banking to the right instead of flying straight.. as well as it would run out of gas a long time before it gets to its destination because on a flat earth map the shortest distance isn't the actual way that planes fly... for whatever reason they go way out of their way to get to their destination, so why? Anyway it don't care about voats on here, so down vote me people. Bopper and I have a friendship where we respect each other and each other's opinions. So this isn't about whether the observers to the discussion agree, it's about actually talking things through on a intelligent level rather than just calling each other retards and ruining our interaction with each other because we're unable to have intelligent conversation. Rather than down vote me, I welcome you that disagree with me to discuss. Maybe we should take it to

                        but yeah. There is nothing wrong with respecting each other and having intelligent conversation.

                         It disappears because the sun is 'small,' not a gigantic star, just a light, shining in a certain area as it moves along. Our eyes can only see so far. This debate has been ongoing forever, only settled since NASA. If the earth were a ball planes would constantly have to bank downwards as they flew around it. If it's a ball, we should be able to hover over it in a helicopter and watch it move, then land in a completely different part of the globe. But it doesn't sound at all like you need me, sounds like you are doing some critical thinking already. I can tell you I hated the ridiculous idea and the cognitive dissonance was deafening.

             Completely agree. But, frankly, the amount of effort that went into Seamans' psyop strongly suggests that there is money and experience in trying to discredit Pizzagate - the cover up in all of this is one of the main arguments supporting it.

               Well, okay if you look just at the probability of things, aliens probably are real. I mean they might be rodents on a planet way far away, or bugs or something. I can buy into the odds being good were not the only planet with life. Now aliens that have visited or do visit earth. You're going to have a much harder time convincing me of that, but I guess it is possible.
