            Always good to out any kind of pedo news but I do not really see this as "progress" in regards to pizzagate. We all have known about pedophile priests, the protection of pedo priests... as well as pay outs to victims for many, many years. It was in newspapers, (back when they were popular)  magazines, and even discussed on Oprah type talkshows.  Pedophilia within the Catholic Church is a well-known subject.  The fact that it is endemic in world governments, including our own, is what needs to get out.

            The State Department said it had asked the Vatican to lift the official's diplomatic immunity on Aug. 21. It said that request was denied three days later. For the State Department to make such a request, its lawyers would have needed to be convinced that there was reasonable cause for criminal prosecution.    I am from now on refusing to capitalize the word pope and francis from now on.  He is not worthy.  He is a Jesuit.  He does not speak for the True Jesus nor for me, a Catholic.  I renounce you bergoglio.

What they found was a massive child porn stash of over 100,000 sexually explicit files — 160 of the videos showed teenage boys forced to perform sexual acts on themselves and on adults, and more than 86,000 pornographic photos were meticulously archived in several category-based folders. If that isn’t enough evidence of this sick pederast’s sexual exploits, authorities were able to dig up 45,000 more pictures which were previously deleted. They also found a second stash of similar disgusting material on a laptop Jozef Wesolowski used during trips abroad.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Vatican's former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, the highest-ranking Holy See official to ever be charged with sexually abusing young boys, was found dead Friday as he awaited trial, the Vatican said.
In a statement, the Vatican press office said preliminary checks on Jozef Wesolowski, 67, "indicated that the death was from natural causes."
            </p>
            <p>
             Charges included possession of what prosecutors described as enormous quantities of child pornography on his two computers, including after Wesolowski was recalled to the Vatican in 2013 following the emergence of rumours that he sexually abused shoeshine boys near the waterfront in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.
Wesolowski was the first such high-ranking Vatican prelate to be criminally charged at the Holy See for sexually abusing minors.
The case was particularly delicate because Wesolowski wasn't just another priest, but rather a direct representative of the pope and had been ordained as a priest and bishop by his fellow Pole, St. John Paul II.
