<p>About a week ago, I noticed that the pizzagate subverse on Voat had about 10K subscribers.

<p>You should note that a Google search on the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; renders myriad unsubstantiated &quot;fake news&quot; hit pieces, all using the circular logic that it was debunked...referencing each other and the red-herring claim that &quot;Hillary was running a pedo ring out of the basement of Comet Ping Pong.&quot; You cannot even find this sub in a natural Google search of the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; - I just tested it, and voat will not show until page 3, even though the word &quot;pizzagate&quot; is in our domain name, the keyword shows up 1000s of times on the site, we have 15K (now subscribers), and we have likely produced over 100K pages of documents/threads. The only way that this sub is not the first search result is by active filtering by Google.</p>
<p>I find it encouraging that we see a building of awareness. Something is driving things, and I think it is the Q messages growing a wider audience and increased buzz about this evil. We must capitalize on this!</p>',

           You should note that a Google search on the term "pizzagate" renders myriad unsubstantiated "fake news" hit pieces, all using the circular logic that it was debunked...referencing each other and the red-herring claim that "Hillary was running a pedo ring out of the basement of Comet Ping Pong." You cannot even find this sub in a natural Google search of the term "pizzagate" - I just tested it, and voat will not show until page 3, even though the word "pizzagate" is in our domain name, the keyword shows up 1000s of times on the site, we have 15K (now subscribers), and we have likely produced over 100K pages of documents/threads.
