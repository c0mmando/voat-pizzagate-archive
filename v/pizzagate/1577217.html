            Oh, I've been reading about the election and then PG probably daily since last Summer. I don't talk about what happened to me in my daily life, so I mostly felt uninvolved. You know, like, "I'm a regular person, this has nothing to do with me." But then I'd read something and think about how it applied to my family.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did some thinking last night about how I felt after talking about it. I felt dirty. Like it had happened again and like it was my fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            I once had a couple of conversations with another extreme abuse survivor, who I think was sexually abused as a kid. He told me that his mom forced him to drown kittens when he was a little boy, because they "couldn't afford" the kittens. This would have been in the 1990s. I heard from someone else that when he was little, his mom was a prostitute and would bring clients back to their house. This guy (then something like 3 or 4) would listen at the door and cry while she serviced the client. He told me that it's best just to never tell anyone anything. Because you'll end up saying something heavy and then they look at you weird and you've gone and ruined things for everyone. Everyone feels bad and you look like a chump, a victim.

            Not at all. I want proof of what you're saying is true. She is coming forward and giving a testimony. If you are right about her being a fraud, then it's important to be able to prove it. I'd be more than willing to believe you if you provided us with evidence that supports your argument.

            Anneke's story is chillingly reminiscent to the horror tales depicted in Marquis De Sade's 120 Days Of Sodom. De Sade's writing is too hyper evocative and visceral to be branded as a mere work of fiction. De Sade was an aristocrat with a penchant for S&amp;M involving minors. He was intimately linked to various like minded wealthy fiends and it seems that 120 Days of Sodom is a lot more than just his perverted figment of imagination. Based on that novel and its stark similarities to Anneke's harrowing tale, we the citizen investigators of pizzagate can deduce that serial pedophelia, child torture and murder has been going on behind gilded doors of the wealthy &amp; depraved long before Pizzagate, McMartin or H.H.Holmes hotel of horrors. But unfortunately for them, citizen detectives of cyber age are about to gate crush their party and eradicate the most henious deed that plagued humankind for centuries for good!

             I reluctantly agree (I read the book, haven't seen the film) although his descriptions of men ejaculating 20 times per day with their 16 inch penises is wherein lies the fiction. The violence is appalling, but perhaps descriptive of what goes on

             For anybody with a strong stomach, i recommend watching the movie Salo, 120 days of Sodom, based on the novel you are talking about. The movie is italian and came out in 1975, and is one of the most disturbing pieces of art i have ever seen.

            I'd like a source for your accusations, if you don't mind. It's important to have reliable survivor  stories and if her credibility is in question, it would be imperative to be able to prove it.

            Hearing from survivors is where it gets real. Everyone is telling similar stories and it's from these that we can find out how to find and help current victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like most kids are living with their family or in small groups. I see stories like Becki Percy's that show some of these kids are even in school most of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps we need to start a campaign within public schools to alert kids that what's happening to them is NOT OKAY and provide a safe way for them to report it and have protection. This is so annoying because even the CPS doesn't provide good protection in the US. Where could these kids go for safety!?

             Yes, where do they go for safety?   It must be horrendous.  Can't go to the cops, to your own family, to cops, to the government, to the church.

            My first post after as a longtime lurker. Anneke Lucas tells of torture, especially against boys, and children being killed when they become about 12.
She is unlear about who sold her, and if she remained with her family or if she lived with the abusers.
She claims to have scars all over her body from when she was tortured.
She states the members of the ring were the upper eschelons of society.

             This story has already been talked about, but good that it got on a more mainstream outlet. Would be nice to have her do an AMA, I can ask her if she's up for it.

             What if he family sold her and she lived with them during this?
If that's a common scenario that could explain why we don't see hundreds of unattended children around DC and why there aren't hundreds of families looking for them. Maybe the families know and are paid enough or scared enough to let it happen. Maybe there's extortion.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also interesting because it looks like she went to regular school.

              I am a survivor from a multi-generational family who practices incest. My family is from the DC area. We have a celebrity in my family and I know my family were neighbors of the Kennedys at one time. My mom said she dated one of the Dupont people. I was groomed as a child and then abused only after I turned 18. It took me many years to realize it wasn't my fault. I got away from my main abuser when I got a strong feeling that he was going to kill me.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was brutal sexual abuse of small children on the other side of my family, although I only heard about that and wasn't around them. A family member from that side once told me that as a toddler, she was very aware that the reason her father raped her was because he hated her. That family member has spent her entire life in therapy and has never been a functional member of society.
             </p>
             <p>
              Social services came to my home many, many times when I was a kid. My house was a hoarder house, we often starved, and we were not allowed to go to school. Social services didn't have a problem with any of this and never intervened. It was clear that no one cared about us but the abusers.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have family members who spent time in an elite boys school and then came out of the school as predators. I don't know the name of the school, only that it was for orphans, was expensive, and was in Pennsylvania somewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aside from the existence of that school, the stuff in my family is not something one can look up. People are careful to cover their tracks and the abusers stay close to the victims their entire life. I imagine this helps keep the pattern going but also discourages people from talking about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a survivor with PTSD, I try very hard to live a normal life. The only family I am in contact with is a couple of other victims, who also have never been able to speak specifically about what happened to them. I believe there are two reasons why we are not hearing from PG victims: 1, because it's too hard to talk about and 2, because the victims often become the abusers as they grow up. I spend a lot of my time pretending to be a normal person. I imagine other victims who have gotten out are doing the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think there is a warehouse full of kids somewhere. I think they are all living at home with their "parents" who are complicit in bad things happening to them. In order to find these people, I think it might be useful to start a "It's not your fault" or "You can help others" kind of public awareness campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope this can help some people. It's difficult to talk about this. It's been tempting to cancel this entire post.

               Thank you so much for finding the courage to talk about your ordeal. I don't think I can begin to understand what you've personally went through, but it is testimonies like yours that help shed the light on this very hard-to-talk about issue and also encourages others to come forward and finally break their silence.

               I am truly so very sorry for what has happened to you and the other victims in your family. You are very brave coming forward and someone else reading your post may feel inspired to come forward and share their story as well. This would be an incredible thing and you should feel very proud. May peace and strength be with you.

                I did. I considered saying something after reading it, but didn't. I personally know many sexual abuse survivors (in and not in my family) and I can't imagine any of them wanting to publicly discuss it, especially the men. When you are a survivor yourself and you're with a man who was abused, you can tell. There are certain things he won't do and he'll usually be homophobic.
               </p>
               <p>
                I forgot to include that one of the abusers in my family works for FEMA and another one was a contractor in the middle east for a few years. I don't know if those details mean anything, but none of the survivors in our family ever worked for the government.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am hesitant to mention this, but I have noticed that the online PTSD forums often have PG stories from actual people. Like, survivors from rings and stuff like that. It's kind of an unspoken thing that no one prods into anyone else's story or tries to find out who they are.

                  Google search "ptsd forum" and several will come up. I recommend the first one.

                 <p>
                  I suggest simply reading for awhile. You may get banned if you try to get anyone to share.

               Wow! How brave and thoughtful of you to share this! And what a great idea! No one, not one person without your first hand knowledge could have thought of it. Brilliant and most important: possible. This is a true ray of hope in an otherwise bleak and dismal situation. Bringing scum to justice is good and all; getting the kids away from the scum is most important of all! Thank you, again! (I'm about to go handle some stoopid chores I've been avoiding because you have inspired me)

               Wow thank you so much for sharing your story. It is so incredibly important and valuable.
I don't know if it means much coming from an internet stranger, but none of this was your fault and you didn't deserve any of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I really like your idea of a public awareness campaign. I also grew up in the metro area and would be very interested in such a campaign.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a lot to think about and discuss. Thank you again so much for sharing, and therefore helping.

                I have been following PG since PleadingtheYiff's post in October. Part of what kept me from coming forward before was not having any proof. Reading the other survivor's story where he was raped by Alefantis made me want to go ahead and discuss it. He talked about getting rid of evidence because it was reminding him of the abuse and he talked about having Stockholm Syndrome.
               </p>
               <p>
                If more people can talk about it, even anonymously, and when they can't provide proof, I think it will encourage other people to talk as well.
