Sex trafficking is an integral part of how the CF conducts its money grabbing/laundering schemes in other countries, but there are other aspects of the CF\'s activities that could be meme\'d and might be more likely to take a foothold in the fringes of the MSM (like Drudge). We need to muster an effort to create concise and digestible memes to aid in creating a confirmation bias, much as was done with Trump\'s landslide election through the efforts of the chans and others.</p>
<p>Not to downplay the utter nightmare that is the sex trafficking component, but it can be unbelievable to a point of outright dismissal by most and is very vulnerable to memetic counterattact (#fakenews). Meme warfare is effective and I believe will eventually be successful even if it only focuses on #pizzagate, but perhaps a quicker method of getting more information injected in the fringe MSM would be to start creating digestible bites regarding the CF\'s other shady dealings that are less unbelievable (at first). See George Webb\'s excellent &quot;Where is Eric Braverman&quot; series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCTzFNrsKns</a>. Also, look to the AMAs by FBIAnon again (still on the front page for download as of this thread) for plenty of dirt. And, if you have the wherewithal to dig, check out the doc for all the /cfg/ work that was done since the original FBIAnon AMAs: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/329527190/329473424-Clinton-Foundation-General-CFG-Google-Document-as-of-October-30-2016">https://www.scribd.com/document/329527190/329473424-Clinton-Foundation-General-CFG-Google-Document-as-of-October-30-2016</a> .</p>
<p>Memes are insanely powerful, and the elite cannot currently control them effectively--though we are seeing that change with #fakenews. However, we are better at it than they are. They are just scratching the surface. Remember Hillary\'s speech about Pepe the frog? That was desperate scrambling to turn back the tides of a psychological op created by anons that was absolutely affecting the decisions of our country\'s voting bloc. I believe the last thing they want is another light shined on the CF so that the public can easily access its damning secrets.</p>
<p>Those of us here with the raw talent to create infographics and memes with CF-centric data points that can be injected outside of our community: I implore you to dig deep in the coming days as our efforts are threatened to tumble down a memory hole. Help us create the content that can be plastered on the walls of the MSM fringes.</p>
<p>I conclude with a quote from FBIAnon:</p>
<p>&quot;I find your memes are not spreading the way they should because the effort is not yet there. For the most part, you all seem to trade the images amongst yourselves and other select image boards. In order to be effective, you must proselytize. For example: Start a website aggregating the images/facts and then try to get it linked to Drudge. Shove
the images down every news anchor/journalists throat. Push out to people who you normally would have nothing to do with.&quot;</p>',

            Any proof of that folder being called that? I only saw hearsay about it, nothing from anyone who would have actually known.  If you have a link or some evidence that supports it I'm interested, as I think that would be a very convincing aspect to the story

            I think the CTR shills are incredibly easy to recognize these days. And I think they should be downvoated accordingly through Voat's built-in processes. Subverse rules should be set up to set the expectation that comments will be removed via moderation if they are off-topic -- that includes the huge blocktext pastejobs of anti-semitism that CTR is so fond of. Of course, it's a fine line sometimes and that's where downvoating comes in -- but a meme-based subverse has a very clear topic for which it should be easy to adhere, and it should have clear and expected moderation tactics that should be easy to implement (I think).

            Yes -- I need more time on my account, I only recently became a registered goat (long-time lurker). In the vein of the old /cfg/ meme division on 4chan, here is what I would create and monitor if I could, and I encourage another to take up the reins for expediency's sake:

            Check out Wikileaks on HBGary for a bit of a memetic warefare primer. Or, even easier, briefly examine the shitposting right up to the election for Trump that invaded YouTube comments, Tumblr, Twitter, and pretty much any social platform with (relatively) open commenting. The MSM was forced to start calling the trend "white nationalist activity (neo-nazi)," which actually brought more attention to the memes and forced them to turn around and dampen this story right back down. Just fascinating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any implementation of your skills is greatly appreciated, both by the investigators here and the other watchful FBIAnons who silently cheer you on.

            Maybe we should start a new forum, where we could test each new meme out on each other. Maybe we could test it out on imgur without key words to avoid banning. If we are satisfied, then we could use the proper terminology.

             You're right -- money always helps. I'd be concerned about the money going toward one or more individuals, however (ARKANCIDE). Perhaps identifying a worthy and un-compromised cause (as we've seen many child protection groups have suspicious links to traffickers and likely pedo groups) and anonymously having cash go there as a donation would be enough to motivate people. This deserves more thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the meantime, lets see how we can rally the hordes of shitposters who helped Trump win a landslide election -- those talented bastards who will spread our memes far and wide and have no love for the dark work of the CF and HRC.

              Good thinking, about the Trump supporters.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I talked about making money for this, I was referring to money for personal gain. Maybe somebody makes a t-shirt picture, and then sells it on Cafe Press, or something like that. If an individual likes the logo, then he is welcome to buy the shirt. The seller keeps the money.

               Excellent -- I wonder how quickly Cafe Press will start censoring them? More evidence of a purposeful blackout, and hopefully more fuel for the fire.

            It's me, again.  Here's another one that I need to add hashtags to and will reupload and leave link.
           </p>
           <p>
            With these hastags, do I just add them in photoshop as part of the photo or is there something else I need to be doing instead of or in addition to that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I can make these but I'm telling you that I cannot do anything with them. There must be people out there that can't make them but would love to push something out there. Can we create a repository of memes that need to be pushed so people can come find them and do that?  If not, there's really no reason for me to make any more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or would you suggest that when I have one, I create a post saying I just made one, here it is, push it out there?
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus, am I just giving folks a link or what?
           </p>
           <p>
            MANY thanks for your time and consideration.  I deeply appreciate it.

             I don't know if I found this very amusing, but I think that it is still worth sharing. When you put her head in the middle like that, it forces the reader to slow down, which gives the reader time to let the thoughts sink in.

            Hello. This is a duplicate reply because I don't know who to reach out to for answers. I am hoping you can help me.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I have no idea what I'm doing. But here's one I just made and uploaded - I think - to Sli.mg
           </p>
           <p>

             https://i.sli.mg/5xYTfr.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you tell me whether I am on the right path?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I need to add hashtags? Which ones?
           </p>
           <p>
            What else do I need to do differently?
           </p>
           <p>
            I can MAKE these but I truly can't put them/push them anywhere. That is beyond me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who can I pass these to who CAN do that??
           </p>
           <p>
            MANY thanks!!

             Absolutely. I think the chans might still be the best option here. Engaging the chans amongst all their shills (on a scale larger than ours, it seems) escapes me. I'm not the best chan expert. If any goat has the gumption to spend some time recruiting this holiday, they could be our best tool to outpace the MSM small-time meme machine.

            It looks like Dnanab is a shill (anti-semitism, content easily arguably off-topic, and an account that's brand new). Please downvoat so we can keep brainstorming a bit here.

            I thought a bit more about this -- George Webb's videos are, frankly, phenomenal. If you haven't checked them out yet, please do so for equal parts rage/instruction/inspiration. However, he's already been attacked (videos 1-52 were deleted from his account with no explanation. He's soldiered on, undaunted). So by bringing attention to him here further, I may be subjecting him to further censorship.

            I get it, and those already here will get it. We could use your analogy once people arrive. The problem is that the public will not get it unless they first see some of the truth that we have uncovered. We need to be extremely literal and factual when trying to reach the masses since we are swimming upstream against the flow of MSM lies.

            It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.

            Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.

            I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.

            They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

            Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

            Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.

            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

            Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

            Judaism is Satanism. It's not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.

            As a technical illiterate with non-English grammar, I do know how to pass on memes with a decorum of civility.
Angry civility is better than hate mongering, so we must remember not to shut down the opposition's reasoning abilities, not all are damaged beyond repair.

            I think CF lobbies the globalist agenda(NWO), rich people donate money to the foundation (and offset it against tax?), thats how they grow in the network and get benefits from it, and there are other similar foundations, which all together build an allmighty globalist network which is so huge and entangled, that its impossible to overview.

            Great idea! A few thoughts to deal with the blatant censorship and shadow banning of this platform and the term "pizzagate":
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The Memes are great, but they need to see the evidence.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It's too hard to put the source evidence right into the meme, so we need to direct them to where the evidence lies.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I deployed a strategy starting a couple days ago that's been very successful to drive traffic here. I created a side platform on voat, and I use the #SaveTheKids.  By directing them to the other platform,  which redirects to this platform, I was able to avoid the censorship of "pizzagate."
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              you should try a similar strategy by creating a relevant hashtag (maybe just #ClintonFoundation), pointing to a platform not tied specifically to the term "pizzagate," and redirecting from that platform to this one.

             If the shills can come into our territory and post junk, then we can use their hashtag to promote memes and real news. I'd love to see Twitter ban that. It's better than the #Jesus hashtag. After all, #FAKENEWS is being read by an audience that is curious about the topic.

             I said almost that very thing on Fox's YT site. This is how I feel: For every lie they tell, we need to tell the truth and back it with facts; using what we have available to us. I learned that after reading the Pentagon Papers. There is tons of info available from the Presidential libraries to the Library of Congress. Most of the available sites can be accessed on line. C-Span is another great place. You can find their transcripts for free on-line or videos on YT.

            We can definitely do memes since we are getting closer to the holidays, its much easier to do, plus it fucks up Clintons image, which we could go harder on. I think what FBIANON meant, especially at the time he has said it, was that it was great doing that before the election, so people dont vote for her, but since electors are getting all weird and shit, its good for another go.

            Sorry second comment. Places the left frequents online have a habit of ironic memeing after the problem has been around long enough and all sympathy has faded. If we speed this process up, I think it's likely we can get them all to their apathy stage quicker.

            As we all know, the left don't care about any one issue for too long.

            Strangely I agree completely with this post, memes are also difficult to censor due to the contextual nature of the msg. South parks sexual harassment panda comes to mind and is probably reasonably recognizable. Sexual harassment panda says no to protecting pedos. If you protect pedos your going to have a #badtime
