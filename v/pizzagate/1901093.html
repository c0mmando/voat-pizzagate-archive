<p>Don\'t come around here too much (which I should really change), but I\'m hoping you fine folks could give me a bit of an assist. Came across a pair of posts from here last night <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1877315">(1</a> / <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1900376">2)</a>, and my reading from there lead me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKPSPfsYjZo">this video</a>. Decoding the base64 in the description of that video leads to an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/FUlmV">imgur link</a>. The title of the image reads YBGTE VBIAXK HGX, which translates to FINAL CIPHER ONE. Can simply decode those cyphers <a href="http://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher">here</a>, set it to ROT=7. I believe the characters in the imgur link are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher">pigpen cipher</a>, and I\'m getting to work on that now. </p>
<p>An anon discussed <a href="https://imgur.com/a/4Afze">behavioral issues their child experienced</a> after repeated viewings of the type of video,  discussed by the first posters, who mentions their child, &quot;started blaming bad behaviour on the witch or someone named zee who was \'the meanest girl in the world when her face turns green\'&quot;. Mention of the <a href="http://finger-family-videos.wikia.com/wiki/Finger_Family">Finger Family</a> piqued my interest, because the fuck is the finger family? Per that link, &quot;The origin and spread of the Finger Family rhyme is currently unknown but on May 25, 2007 on the internet, Leehosook uploaded a video simply called &quot;Finger Family&quot; which became the very first Finger Family video ever made on YouTube. Throughout many years, there were Finger Family videos and other nursery rhyme videos uploaded on YouTube and Dailymotion around the internet at the same time.&quot; </p>
<p>This leads me to believe that the videos function as a parasite (of sorts) off of the Finger Family meme, in a few major ways. The channels that are producing these videos have released their content in the last two months or so, but still have a large number of videos posted, all with very similar keywords in their titles. They\'re gaming the youtube search algo, so that they appear in the suggestions for a common children\'s search [finger family], while simultaneously being able to quickly take over suggestions by focusing on a comparative niche (teaching colors) and posting very frequently. For more on youtube\'s recommendation system, see <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/09/How-YouTube-Recommendation-Works">here</a> or <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf">here (pdf warning)</a>. Beyond that, by utilizing a modified version of an already popular nursery rhyme on youtube, the children are primed to be more receptive to the other messaging going on. </p>
<p>The videos are all extremely repetitive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0i14QN1lTo&amp;list=PL2Qc4UQr_ASCklvtZtjP_hKNuYuR3AW7j">(playlist)</a>, featuring a baby in front of the same 5 colors every time, the color song, one color being removed by something scary, the baby crying, then back to placid when the color song repeats. This goes on for each of the 5 colors. I\'m increasingly of the opinion that these videos are meant to cause children to &quot;identify&quot; with the various colors in some sort of abstract way, and induce behavioral problems in their young viewers. Maybe some sort of &quot;flagging&quot; system to ID people predisposed to that sort of influence, where behavioral problems end up with the kids on medication and set up for a life of dependence. Maybe it\'s something more sinister, especially given the trigger type videos. All I know is this shit is really weird. What say you, voat?</p>',

            There were strange mentions of a happening at Pelzer South Carolina. I guess it is a town with 89 residents, and some weird stuff was discussed about the place. There was some sort of map and a "field trip" mentioned in these creepy vids? Does anyone have a rundown on that info from the chans?

            right and someone answered how he had to yawn right before he read it. Maybe it's all just trolling. 4chan is their habitat but it all moved me in a way I can't explain.

            and about that Trigger stuff: I got totally sucked into the boards on 4chan and felt spooked out about the fact that some folks there were threatening others for exposing some weird stuff about emf manipulation. 
And there was this guy talking about how tired he is and that he needs to go sleep and we all should do that and how people said they were even effected by thoose comments. And this guy just came back, over and over repeating how insanly tired he is. This was my most scariest experience on 4chan so far.

             Strange, I just came off a board with that guy posting about sleep. I didn't think to connect it to mind control tho. Interesting. I just guessed it was someone who was literally sleepy bc of what time it was, but would check back when he woke up. I am always half asleep at this hour so stuff I come across of interest, 
I save, to reread when I wake up. But now that u pointed it out, there were several posts about being sleepy, weird. Def someone trying to trigger the mind to rest &amp; not further investigate. Thanks for calling it out.

             I don't really go to the chans but a while back there were some links posted here from /pol that had the same "go to sleep" stuff going on......

            <p>
             Though it could just be trolling, it seems to happen at specific points when the autists are making progress....does seem like an attempt at NLP/hypnosis.....obviously we are the "woke ones"....of course they want us to go to sleep....

             I'd imagine a lot of the responses to the trigger are plants, the idea being that will increase suggestibility (a kind of peer group effect that is seen in "mass hysteria")
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, If it is directly connected to mind control/MKULTRA, we need to figure out a strategy to beat it....and I'm certain it can be even though these guys have been researching this stuff for a long time, I think we have a couple of advantages over them.....
            </p>
            <p>
             Their first problem is being Sadistic fuckers they have mostly focused on the trauma based methods of mind control....and using them on minds that haven't yet fully formed....this of course can be hugely powerful, but even that programming can be broken with a bit of understanding and work.....trying to programme free thinking adults with words alone, though I know it can be possible, takes a lot of work, especially if trying to do it to thousands at once....
            </p>
            <p>
             Using non trauma based techniques is a lot trickier for them....though I've no doubt they are good at it, it requires more than just repeating a trigger a few times to get results....true they have managed to hypnotise most of our society to believe all is well and we can trust our (((Masters))).....but the very fact that we are here and on /pol shows that some of us are more resistant to the programming
            </p>
            <p>
             I know we have other people here interested in Psychology and Magick, I think a discussion might be useful on strategies for overcoming this stuff.....I'm pretty sure we are as smart as these fuckers, and though they may have had a head start and greater resources initially, they have also shown hubris, and I believe are getting increasingly worried that something is waking that they can no longer control....
            </p>
            <p>
             So, anyone have good tactics for nipping this in the bud? My best guess is to get some preemptive programming in if we can to prevent anyone else inducing us....being ethical, unlike these fuckers, we would have to explain what we were doing before inducing anyone.....or set out a self induction strategy.....
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm interested in this stuff, but don't have massive practical experience with it....anyone out there who can lay out a good way of protecting ourselves from this?

              maybe we should make a list. If you would have told me something like that a year ago I would have called you a lunatic. But I smoke weed every day for more than 15 years now and it makes me wonder whether this is the reason why I finally awoke and always felt a little "less sleepy" than others?! Who knows?!
             </p>
             <p>
              Sports and most of all dancing is a good programing, too. I dance every day for an hour. Sounds ridiculous, I know, but try it! And of course praying or meditating.

               Very interesting....I used to smoke a fair bit of weed and it certainly changed my world view and helped me see behind the curtain....psylocibin even more so!
              </p>
              <p>
               I also have always been into making music and the healing effect of sound....and I've always kept fit....cycling in particular is a great way to lose yourself in nature....
              </p>
              <p>
               And that disconnect from nature many have is part of their power...these people are anti nature in everything they do...anti life....anti love.....anti humanity
              </p>
              <p>
               It's up to us to educate and open minds the true nature of reality

            I really want to puke. Don't know anything about underlying shemes but this definately is a commercial for Babys! Disgusting. Youtube is full with this crap. Corperations are targeting the children of parents who are too tired to pay enough attention. This baby literally cries everytime one of the KINDER SURPRISE gets taken away. This is consumer behaviour programming. 
Parents watch out!

            I can't stand those finger family songs!  WTF is the appeal?  Why are there so many versions of them?  It's the most annoying song ever and disturbing too.  Who wants their kid going around singing 'Daddy finger, daddy finger, where are you?'  If it's some kind of mind control, that would be a reasonable explanation for the song's popularity.
