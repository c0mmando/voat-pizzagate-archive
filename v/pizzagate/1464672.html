<p>My initial response, &quot; I see you\'re an asshole as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>Their response, <em>&quot;So no? You do not care that you have been helping to perpetuate a crazy fake news story that has now literally put people\'s lives in danger?&quot;</em></p>
<p>To which I responded (a bit long): 
&quot;You parrot the &quot;fake news&quot; bullshit label while you actually take in fake news from CNN and Think Progress!</p>
<p>You\'re literally the biggest asshole I know right now, to make this incident out to be somehow on me. You\'re nothing but a typical brainwashed, SJW, liberal cultist these days, trying to censor anything you don\'t agree with by trying to &quot;shame&quot; people.</p>
<p>By your own logic, you and every other hateful liberal spewing venom and vitriol against Republicans and Trump are responsible for all the numerous death threats and harassment they and their families are receiving from all the nut bags out there! You all should be ashamed, because you all are actually far more direct about wishing violence and harm upon Republicans.</p>
<p>No, I do not feel the least bit of shame for looking into public information and not sticking my head in the dirt and letting other people tell me what to think about it. I never, ever wished any harm on Alefantis, and just felt people should know about him and boycott the place. I also never &quot;spread&quot; any attacks or doxxing, or anything of a violent or harassing nature, and would never do that. The sites I was reading on, reddit and voat, completely disallow that as well, and mods and members are constantly telling people to not do any of those things, and to send any information they find to the authorities, and let them handle investigating it!</p>
<p>Of the few posts I did share on &quot;pizzagate&quot;, one or two were of the mug sketches from the McCann abduction case, which look EXACTLY like Tony and John Podesta down to the mole over John\'s eye. Am I not allowed to question the odds of that being just a mere coincidence?</p>
<p>I also shared a few posts on the connections to Haiti and Laura Silsby, and Cathy O\'Brien/MK Ultra. All true, all facts.</p>
<p>The few posts I shared about Comet Ping Ping had more to do with the Alefantis\' sick taste in artwork and music that have dark pedo references, the pederasty-linked statue he had as an avatar, and his sick pedo comments like &quot;chickenlover&quot; etc. All of these things are/were public. None of these things are fake - all facts.</p>
<p>Is there a massive elitist pedo-ring, who the hell knows!</p>
<p>Is there some shady, sick shit in all of this stuff, fucking hell yes!</p>
<p>If Alefantis didn\'t want to be viewed as a sick fuck, maybe he shouldn\'t have posted tons of pedo-looking shit online and have connections with artists posting/implementing sick pedo references as well!&quot;</p>
<p>Their response: <em>&quot;So I guess the thousands of people who visit that business every week are all just clueless idiots about what is &quot;really going on&quot; there, and you guys who mostly don\'t even live anywhere near here all have been able to scope this shit out via the internet? It\'s not even just the ownership of that one business, you have succeeded at getting people to harass everyone on that block, believing all the businesses are connected by secret underground sex tunnels.</em></p>
<p><em>It\'s really easy to carelessly spread baseless bullshit when it\'s not your job or your friends who suffer from it. The fact that it\'s easier for you to believe that everyone else are just brainwashed rather than admit that, hey, maybe you made a mistake and should have thought a bit harder before sharing all that crap is a pretty good sign of how far off the deep end you have gone.&quot;</em></p>
<p>My last words on the matter:
<em>&quot;you have succeeded at getting people to harass everyone on that block,&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;No I have not. Not one person on my friend list has done anything of the sort, and yet you keep accusing me of doing that that, which is actually you attacking and harassing me, and promoting for others on your friend list to do the same by spreading such lies about me.&quot;</p>
<p>I have honestly wanted to delete this person from my friend list so many times, but I still keep him around, as he is a perfect example of the typical cultist, SJW, liberal mindset.</p>',

            I'm liberal, although that means nothing any more. Because I have seen my lefty friends change to what they are now, a bunch of fucking ridiculous douche bags that don't give a fuck that the Clintons undeniably run with pedophiles (Jeffery Epstein alone should put anyone calling themselves progressive off the Clintons), use their position for power, fucked over Haiti. 
I feel myself losing friends over this, and it's sad and scary. Scary to see them make up excuses to defend these people- these goddamn billionaires that make our lives miserable by holding the worlds riches.
            <br/>
            Everything I've said so far is FACT before you even jump down the rabbit hole to see what else is going on.
            <br/>
            People also conveniently ignore the fact that human trafficking is a real and pervasive problem, as is government officials convicted of pedophilia. If any of these cunts were literal SJW, they would use this opportunity to talk about that.

             Where are the pictures?  I live in MD/DC area and do know of the old underground restaurant area at Dupont North that's been closed down for some time, but I have never been down there, and don't know of any proof that those tunnels extend to Comet or that there are similar underground tunnels under Comet.

            I like everything you did but call him a vulgar name.  The cleaner we do our business the better.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the shaming thing, it is ridiculous and it is all they've got.  There was an OP on here saying he waas manager at a pizza place in Austin that engaged in shaming too.  He said he was a manager and everyone was on edge because of a threatening phone call about pizzagate, BUT HE WON'T CALL THE POLICE AND REPORT THE INCIDENT, but WE are responsible for them all feeling edgy.  Not him.  Not his inability to even manage events at his own place of work.  WE are responsible because as he put it there are "implications" to this investigation.
Yet, apparently no "implications" when he choses not to report a threat at his place of business.
            <br/>
            Incredible. 
The gays call it throwing shade, and it is done very expertly, so it sounds like it is a friend just giving you a heads up about how you shoud stop what you are doing.
Never mind the children of course, that barely entereed into it.

             The cussing is from the NY base in me, born/raised.  I live in MD/DC area now, but sometimes when people piss me off with such idiocy, the NY cussing just comes right out.  It's out of frustration... like how can this person be that stupid?

            I was attacked multiple times by a few different persons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              A man who attacked me about conspiracy beliefs. I attempted to meet in the middle and have us each share media that we would like to help see each others point of view. I gave him a 90m video on the subject. He didn't even make it through 10 minutes and had already began ranting at me on facebook with indirect ad-homenin attacks. He posted multiple times the next day too. I never responded to him, but I always think about the incident. I don't want to fuel his narcissism and ignoring them infuriates them.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              A man said I needed to see a psychiatrist. I told him off on my wall, and that a real friend wouldn't post something like that for public view.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Another man wanted to check if I was okay, then said 'pizzagate isn't even real'. I told him that we are working from different sets of data and assumptions and that his opinion won't deter me.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              A woman kept repeatedly messaging me if I was okay, message after message, until I responded that I am. After the election, she said I had so much anger for staying on the Anti-Hillary/Pizzagate topic and she was angry at me. I cut her off and called her out for the boundary-crossing narcissist she was in my life (wasn't a real friend, but the extremely nosy/boundary overstepping neighbor archetype).
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            You could say there's definitely a pattern of requisite harassment for sharing this data among friends. I don't flood my news feed about the subject, I just drop little tidbits here and there.

             Yup, same here.  Anything that seems too off the wall, I don't ever even post about.  The stuff that makes my jaw drop, because it's that sick or seems so beyond mere coincidence, is the stuff I usually post about.  I never even knew about Laura Silsby and Hillary until I read about it on reddit on The_Donald!  Same with Cathy O'Brien and MK Ultra.  Both of those things really freaked me out, and I shared that stuff on my FB wall, so others who didn't know about it would know too.  The "pizza" code words, handkerchief, dominoes, etc. ... while that stuff read as really odd and creepy, I took that stuff with a grain of salt.  Still though, there's a lot of sick stuff going on here even aside from that stuff.

              A woman who defines herself as a full time SJW activist attacked me because the content I posted on my own wall that debunked a hit piece against Trump was triggering. Anything that might remotely pass as pro-trump was apparently triggering.

             Are you kidding me?! They already have been trying for decades. Take "PIE" for instance, founded in the UK in 1974 as pedophile advocacy and fight to lower legal age of sexual consent to 4.. YES FOUR YEARS OF AGE.. Sick fucks!!

              Do you know if pizza is referred to as pie in the UK? Not that it really matters, but just one more way to tie all this together.

               I think pizza evolved from PIE around 2k close to the time after I was no longer an investigator.

               But in that other pedo bust recently where a pizza dude was busted, I noticed his "Z"'s in his signage resembled the characteristics of the Pizza pedo logo. But another thing stood out too, the fact his sign was written backwards as in mirrored which spells ASS19
