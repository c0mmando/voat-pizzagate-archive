<p>&quot;Veterans For Child Rescue (V4CR) was formed specifically to EXPOSE that which has been covered up and suppressed – the dark and disgusting world of child sex trafficking rings. These rings include members from every level of our society and involve unthinkable trauma inflicted upon innocent babies and children - the soul of our nation.
This abuse must first be brought to light before it can be cleaned up. V4CR was created to shine that light! We will expose this crisis through joint operations with law enforcement and sharing the truth in an unflinching television documentary-series for the world to see. Through this, we hope to force stronger punitive legislation and create a non-permissive public environment to help reverse this life-shattering trend of abuse.

            I thought Craig Sawyer was genuine but seriously he just wants money to fund a t.v. series.  I would fully support him if it was that his team was going to do a private investigation and round up some of the people we have discovered.  Such as Alefantis , Podesta, the Clinton's etc. But so far he is just wanting to do a t.v. show.   He is also an actor that has appeared in movies and other t.v. shows..

            There are concrete reasons to be suspicious of Craig Sawyer, the new “savior” for many here.  Sawyer is rumored to be a Freemason, which I haven’t yet been able to confirm or refute.  However, his website’s logo contains a

            The (Jewish) actor, Craig Sawyer was part of SEAL Team 6.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sawyer first served with SEAL Team One through Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and, after some time as a SEAL Sniper Instructor, he served with DEVGRU, which was previously known as Seal Team 6."

             I saw where Jones said he was donating 10k....and says that he did.  That was when the site first started and the donations were through Ucaring....because gofundme wouldn't list the fund raiser.   On the first day, Ucaring also refused to participate in the fund raiser after some $50,000 had been raised during and after the effort was announced on Alex's show....that included the 10k Alex donated.  The fundraising was then put onto a donation service called "gunfundme"....it is currently at like $115,000 raised.....90k of that is from Alex Jones....who pledged another 90k after the fundraising was taken down by Ucaring's site....he said that on his second interview with Craig Sawyer after Ucaring decided not to host his fund raiser to help children.  Make of it what you will, but that's what's going on with the money Alex said he would donate and the total funds raised.  In total there has been about $165,000 raised and 100k of that was supposed to have been from Alex Jones.   Yeah, their intention is to make a movie to get public awareness and call for honest investigation.....so if anyone does donate, do know that's what they are donating to achieve.

            He is being sponsored in no small part by Alex Jones, who says that we should stay away from Comet, and is sending his journalists to California to report on lower level busts there. Do we have any reason to believe  that this Navy SEAL won't take Jones' lead and avoid certain issues if they pertain to James Alefantis (and the DC crowd)?

            The thought is nice.. but how much do they really help? What can they honestly do?
What does more money change?

            , you add more to your post about what exactly they are going to be doing and how they are going to be using the money? Maybe a little info on the people involved? How are they different from
            <a href="https://ourrescue.org/">
             Operation Underground Railroad
            </a>
            , for example? Why aren't these guys teamed up? Thanks!
