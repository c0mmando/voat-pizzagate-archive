Am turning the spotlight on JEANNE ALLERT, the founder of The Samaritan Women, a charitable organization whose stated goal is to help rehabilitate human trafficking victims. She is a stated resource for the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force that was formed by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office and, therefore, qualifies as being connected to our investigation of #pizzagate. This in-depth analysis will establish a pattern that seems to be used by a lot of these organizations. It includes: the establishing of shell companies, ties to Asia and Africa, connections to art museums, and the obscuring of company addresses and/or exchange of real estate. </p>
<p>As promised, from now on, whenever I get heavy pushback, I’m gonna go dumpster diving! So So keep it up and so will I! This time the spotlight falls on Jeanne L. Allert, and, man, what I found is amazing … but I’m sure only the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p>I’ll start at the beginning with what turned up on an Intelius report: 
<a href="https://www.intelius.com/people/Jeanne-Allert/Baltimore-MD/0NPJEEKKKME">https://www.intelius.com/people/Jeanne-Allert/Baltimore-MD/0NPJEEKKKME</a></p>
<p>Okay, so she’s President at Ellipsis Partners LLC, but right away things get squirrelly. From her LinkedIn profile: </p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/JP8Qu">http://imgur.com/a/JP8Qu</a></p>
<p>You can see for yourself that, yup, she has Ellipsis Partners LLC listed. But the funny thing is when you go to the website for Ellipsis Partners, yeah, there’s no mention of her. Here’s their “team” page: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ellipsispartners.com/staff/">http://www.ellipsispartners.com/staff/</a></p>
<p>I surely do not see Jeanne Allert, do you? </p>
<p>Anyway, I did a search for Ellipsis Partners LLC, and again, the squirrelly invades the search as a strange real estate transfer takes place: </p>

<p>REALLY? I didn’t know Ellipsis Partners was located in New Canaan. Of course, they could have just grabbed the name. That is common enough, but do people spontaneously transfer four million dollar properties when you secure a name? Maybe they’re really, really friendly in Connecticut? Here’s the listing for the business registration: </p>

<p>A DAVID PRILL is listed as PRINCIPAL, but he probably is the person that registered the company. Still doesn’t account for the land transfer. And I will get back to Mr. David Prill … you can be assured of that.<br />
Now if you put the text appearing on Jeanne Allert’s Intelius page, this text:  “Job Details Ellipsis Partners helped identify … etc., etc.”, the name Steve W. Allert pops up: </p>

<p>Steven W. Allert is listed as a CONSULTANT for Ellipsis Partners LLC. And, in case you’re wondering, Mr. Allert’s LinkedIn profile has been scrubbed … I mean, spontaneously disappeared. I have to be careful since he was a member of the Marines and could kick my ass. We can also see he’s listed as working for WORLDCOM. WORLDCOM? You mean, this WORLDCOM?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>HORTICULTURE THERAPY? Does this mean the victims that the residence program takes in work in the fields? Evidently, they do: </p>

<p>“Back by very popular demand, The Samaritan Women (TSW) is pleased to announce its schedule of spring and summer Veranda Dinners. The Veranda Dinners are an elegant and intimate way to celebrate and support the work of The Samaritan Women. Each menu is custom-crafted using locally sourced products and produce from the TSW Farm. The residents are a big part of the dinners, from preparing the atmosphere, to assisting the Chef, to serving the meal.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so they do work in the field … but it’s “THERAPY”, but let’s get back to Steven W. Allert. </p>
<p>Intelius: <a href="https://www.intelius.com/people/Steven-Allert/Jacksonville-NC/067ZJ10DBPB">https://www.intelius.com/people/Steven-Allert/Jacksonville-NC/067ZJ10DBPB</a>

<p>On Zoominfo, Kristus pops back up. It lists him as Program Director for Kristus. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/company?companyId=129598378&amp;targetid=profile">http://www.zoominfo.com/s/#!search/profile/company?companyId=129598378&amp;targetid=profile</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Company Description: Kristus is partnered with concerned individuals who are providing humanitarian service to our Navy Hospital Corpsmen and Corpswomen who have been killed or wounded during combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original site is gone, but I did find a blog about Steve Allert under “Kristus” and he’s touring the Philippines and Cambodia and looking at vegetable gardens? </p>
<p><a href="http://kristusway.blogspot.com/">http://kristusway.blogspot.com/</a><br />
<a href="http://kristusway.blogspot.com/2006_03_05_archive.html">http://kristusway.blogspot.com/2006_03_05_archive.html</a></p>
<p>If you go to the second link, it really sounds like a humanitarian/community outreach that has nothing to do with wounded vets. Here’s a portion of what’s said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beyond the scheduled meetings and transfer of two new PCs to the Abatan Distance Learning Center, all three participants agreed that the most important goal we can accomplish is to identify what issues the local communities (the leaders and the general public) are most passionate about. Once these are indentified, Kristus Way volunteers will be able to assist these communities to locate and employ the resources and knowledge needed to accomplish their goals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not understanding this at all. Just not. But he’s roaming around the Philippines and Cambodia, and his wife … well, his wife is making in roads into … KENYA?!!!! </p>
<p>KENYA <a href="http://archive.is/1QvDs">http://archive.is/1QvDs</a></p>
<p>Seriously, this is about getting crazy! Here’s the copy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Each year Ellipsis Partners provides pro bono services in support of some worthy nonprofit organization.  For 2007-08 we are taking on a BIG project, one  that we hope will touch the lives of many. Through Jeanne’s seminary studies, she had a chance to meet Samuel Sudhe, from the Great Lakes School of Theology in Kenya. … Ellipsis Partners will be sending Steve Allert, our consultant with extensive international and project management experience,  to Kenya …” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, what is going on? And of course, when you do a search, there is no Great Lakes School of Theology. There’s a “Great Lakes University Of Kisumu”. </p>
<p>And little Jeannie has been busy. She even had time to give quotes about a new law that was passed to aid the prevention of human trafficking. Big stuff! Let’s look see what it’s about. Oh, it got a write up in WaPo, the faux news giant: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/new-law-could-make-landlords-liable-for-sex-trafficking-at-their-rentals/2016/11/18/7d036756-ab6a-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html?utm_term=.5353117d4fa3">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/new-law-could-make-landlords-liable-for-sex-trafficking-at-their-rentals/2016/11/18/7d036756-ab6a-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html?utm_term=.5353117d4fa3</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s a crime of economics. And so if individuals are profiting from this business that’s where we have to tackle cutting the head off the snake,” said Jeanne Allert,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! How does it do that! By doing this: <a href="https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2016/11/22/legislation-could-cut-head-off-the-snake-of-human-trafficking/">https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/2016/11/22/legislation-could-cut-head-off-the-snake-of-human-trafficking/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The bill makes it a misdemeanor to “knowingly” allow use of an apartment or home for prostitution or trafficking, punishable with a $1,000 fine or six months in jail. It passed the council unanimously last week, and a spokesman for County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) said he will sign it into law.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OMFG!!!!! A WHOLE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS?!!!!! THAT COULD STOP GLOBAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING, TOO!!!!! Yeah, they’d never get that chump change. It’s only a billion dollar plus enterprise so Jeannie is right!!!! They’re really just stopping human trafficking in its tracks with this blow!!!! </p>
<p>And now let’s get back to David Prill, the PRINCIPAL of Ellipsis.  For one thing, he’s a Board of Director of the New Canaan Nature Center: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.newcanaannature.org/about/staff.php#early">http://www.newcanaannature.org/about/staff.php#early</a> </p>
<p>They have tons of programs, quite a bit for the kiddies! </p>
<p>Here’s his Spokeo info: </p>

<p>Notice it says an alias is “Derek Prill”. Where’d they get that from? Evidently, his son. Here’s a wedding announcement that appeared in The New York Times:

<p>Re: David A. Prill ... &quot;retired as a vice president with the global services unit of IBM\'  
</p>
<p>As for the happy couple, Katherine Abbey’s mother is &quot;the executive assistant to the board of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art:&quot;</p>
<p>There’s that museum connection and a San Francisco connection.</p>',

            “Back by very popular demand, The Samaritan Women (TSW) is pleased to announce its schedule of spring and summer Veranda Dinners. The Veranda Dinners are an elegant and intimate way to celebrate and support the work of The Samaritan Women. Each menu is custom-crafted using locally sourced products and produce from the TSW Farm. The residents are a big part of the dinners, from preparing the atmosphere, to assisting the Chef, to serving the meal.”

           Okay, so they do work in the field … but it’s “THERAPY”, but let’s get back to Steven W. Allert.

           On Zoominfo, Kristus pops back up. It lists him as Program Director for Kristus.

           The original site is gone, but I did find a blog about Steve Allert under “Kristus” and he’s touring the Philippines and Cambodia and looking at vegetable gardens?

           If you go to the second link, it really sounds like a humanitarian/community outreach that has nothing to do with wounded vets. Here’s a portion of what’s said:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “Beyond the scheduled meetings and transfer of two new PCs to the Abatan Distance Learning Center, all three participants agreed that the most important goal we can accomplish is to identify what issues the local communities (the leaders and the general public) are most passionate about. Once these are indentified, Kristus Way volunteers will be able to assist these communities to locate and employ the resources and knowledge needed to accomplish their goals.”
           </p>

           Not understanding this at all. Just not. But he’s roaming around the Philippines and Cambodia, and his wife … well, his wife is making in roads into … KENYA?!!!!

           Seriously, this is about getting crazy! Here’s the copy:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “Each year Ellipsis Partners provides pro bono services in support of some worthy nonprofit organization.  For 2007-08 we are taking on a BIG project, one  that we hope will touch the lives of many. Through Jeanne’s seminary studies, she had a chance to meet Samuel Sudhe, from the Great Lakes School of Theology in Kenya. … Ellipsis Partners will be sending Steve Allert, our consultant with extensive international and project management experience,  to Kenya …”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           I mean, what is going on? And of course, when you do a search, there is no Great Lakes School of Theology. There’s a “Great Lakes University Of Kisumu”.
          </p>
          <p>
           And little Jeannie has been busy. She even had time to give quotes about a new law that was passed to aid the prevention of human trafficking. Big stuff! Let’s look see what it’s about. Oh, it got a write up in WaPo, the faux news giant:

          <p>
           OMFG!!!!! A WHOLE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS?!!!!! THAT COULD STOP GLOBAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING, TOO!!!!! Yeah, they’d never get that chump change. It’s only a billion dollar plus enterprise so Jeannie is right!!!! They’re really just stopping human trafficking in its tracks with this blow!!!!

           And now let’s get back to David Prill, the PRINCIPAL of Ellipsis.  For one thing, he’s a Board of Director of the New Canaan Nature Center:

           They have tons of programs, quite a bit for the kiddies!

           Notice it says an alias is “Derek Prill”. Where’d they get that from? Evidently, his son. Here’s a wedding announcement that appeared in The New York Times:

           As for the happy couple, Katherine Abbey’s mother is "the executive assistant to the board of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art:"
          </p>
          <p>
           There’s that museum connection and a San Francisco connection.

            Wow!  This is amazing research!  I can not believe the depths of depravity of some of these rich ba#!!rds!  Yeah, a misdemeanor and a fine! Sounds like the criminal injustice system at it's finest.  Thank you for your dedication to the truth.

             Thanks for the good words. There is so much buried treasure that we have not uncovered. We've barely scratched the surface of what's going on, and what connections have been forged.

             I think digging is an appropriate response to shills. Why get mad and into an argument? Just make like the humble gopher and dig, dig, dig!

            Oh this is the kind of work product we need to see more of instead of sniping at each other, vulgar name calling, rants about our moderators, and  silly posts about pedo swirls on cookie packages. I know it takes alot of time and skill and it's why I don't do it but what a pleasure to read it. Thanks again and sorry for the redundancy. I got caught up in the George Webb debate and it was nice to be brought back to Pizzagate's original purpose. I couldn't resist commenting twice when I saw that responses weren't pouring in.

             Believe me, I appreciate the words. I want to see people get back to investigation also. I used to love reading those types of posts and still do.

             Because we've stopped doing it, the pressure has completely gone off key individuals like JA. We were making real headway. And we haven't even cracked the surface. I mean, before doing the piece of The Mint Museum, I never heard of Jeanne Allert. It does take a lot of work, but what the heck? Although membership is up, we're not pulling the numbers in this forum that we used to. I can see from the upvoats and comments. There are some awesome investigators in this forum and I'm hoping they'll start posting again and draw our community together.

            Awesome research. You get the post-of-the-month award. Even though the month is not up, I doubt anybody can rival it. It sounds like the victims have just gone from one form of slavery to another. Working without real pay has been the name of the game for quite sometime in this world of predatory capitalism.  Businesses pretending to be charities and  good standing in the society pages thrown in for good measure.
