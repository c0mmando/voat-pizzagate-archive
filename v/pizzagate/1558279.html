<p>Use good hashtags relevant to the pizzagate cause. These have the biggest reach: </p>
<h1>stopchildrape</h1>
<h1>saveourchildren</h1>
<h1>pedofiles</h1>
<h1>LittleLivesMatter</h1>
<h1>podestaemails</h1>
<p>#humanrights </p>
<h1>news</h1>
<h1>StopChildAbuse</h1>
<p>#ChildAbuse </p>
<h1>childrensrights</h1>
<p>Remember to Hijack current global trending hashtags. Every time you post, add a few of the current trending topics, you will get more reach.</p>
<p>Follow prominent human rights activists Retweet them first over a few days, hold your fire. Then tweet at them and ask for retweets. Ask them direct questions so they have to reply &quot;This is shocking and awful - you are the expert, what do you think of this info? #stopchildabuse &quot; </p>

<p>Other activities</p>
<p>We should also be emailing the organisations who care about this and start to bring their attention to it. This has been a citizen investigation and we must enlist more citizens. Remember that a brownstone operation only needs 6-8 members in order to dominate an entire organization. It is only a very small percentage. Most people are good and honest and true, certainly when it comes to this kind of depravity. They are right there and want to help, they just don\'t know. Not yet. So reach out to organizations and ask politely if they have seen this, you are disturbed by it and felt a responsibility to bring their attention to it and ask what they think is going on here.</p>

           We should also be emailing the organisations who care about this and start to bring their attention to it. This has been a citizen investigation and we must enlist more citizens. Remember that a brownstone operation only needs 6-8 members in order to dominate an entire organization. It is only a very small percentage. Most people are good and honest and true, certainly when it comes to this kind of depravity. They are right there and want to help, they just don't know. Not yet. So reach out to organizations and ask politely if they have seen this, you are disturbed by it and felt a responsibility to bring their attention to it and ask what they think is going on here.

            I would love to do a followup to my popular pizzagate video (that youtube has demonitized but miraculously not removed) - I'm the one that does the 3d pepe videos, blackpilled.com etc. My trouble has always been it seems like there is a constant flow of information and it's hard to grasp all of it in addition to the other research etc I have to do to keep the lights on. If there is a concise summary of where we are with info that has come in post election (and I think silsby needs her own video, and maybe i need to do a series because there is just so much) please point me in the right direction and I'll get started on something.

            4Chan has declared war against ISIS and have a fascinating strategy thread. Posting comment :

            Stefan Molyneux Challenges 4chan to takedown ISIS
           </p>
           <p>
            A dubbs post decided to accept
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Molyneux sees that we accept his challenge, thus confirming he’s one of us
           </p>
           <p>
            /pol/ decided the angle will be to prove ISIS has turned homosex due to a lack of women
           </p>
           <p>
            The fire is rising

            We have come up with the Final Battle Plan after a democratic vote:
           </p>
           <p>
            We are going to paint a picture that ISIS has no women supporters left to keep as sex slave so they’ve turned to homosex
           </p>
           <p>
            Ideas to combine with this:
           </p>
           <p>
            -Teenagers and children of new members are forced into sex slavery at risk of death
           </p>
           <p>
            -The leader of ISIS has his own private boy harem that is overlooked by members
           </p>
           <p>
            -We make #ISisGay trending
           </p>
           <p>
            Ideas on our strategy so far:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.Target ISIS online presence
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Demoralize ISIS sympathizers
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Point out any ISIS sympathizers
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Create believable stories involving ISIS (slander)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Take all that we know of conspiracies and meme them into existence
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            What you can do:
           </p>
           <p>
            Bump the thread
           </p>
           <p>
            Create twitter accounts to tweet out memes (makes sure to do so anonmyously and stay safe, do not use personal accounts)
           </p>
           <p>
            Create memes that perpetuate the plan (#ISisGay,etc)
           </p>
           <p>
            Spread the word (/k/, /sg/, make other threads linking to this one, etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Participate and give us ideas to add onto our plan. Its always a good idea to have open options if things go sour
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.Ignore all shills
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Although we are at war with the Luggenpresse, we can fight a war on two fronts
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              By going to war and imploding/destroying ISIS we can expose any conspiracy theories (US Influence) to be true
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Stay safe
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            We need more memes and presence to be safely established.
War has been declared /pol/.
This will be our first international military campaign.
Will you answer the call?

            Yeah, surely there are other solutions like maybe apps, or something that is not only easier to use but easier to obscure identity on. I'm not saying we need some super hyper security but you're right IRC just puts it out there, as well may be more technical than most would want to mess with.

            What's the lawyer going to do? We're just discussing things and really we're mostly anonymous. Not sure what he is gonna do I guess. Sure they're watching and even interacting I understand that but. Not real sure what the lawyer would do.

            I like the irc channel idea, clearly the shilling system is well organized paid, and determined. We should do similar. A chat room whether it's IRC, or another medium is a great way to not only organize. But to also be able to discuss in real time, answer questions of those not understanding things and to keep interest. Great idea, it should be easy to access from mobile or PC as well.

            Yes if you were to do something like this, my opinion is that you should make them at cost without any profit and make that clear that no profit is being made, as well I would do it as anonymously as I can, and not promote the shirts on this site. Or at least not with an account you use to also debate. People really start questioning your motives when they are exposed and appear to be money.

            This. I believe stickers are a better method. Cheap, light, easy to hide/apply, and are visible 24-7 (until removed). A shirt? A shirt?! No.

            I don't have the skills, but if you can vide edit, have a look at this or add comments and suggestions.

            Some one should make a simple 30 second video, set up a youtube channel and call it "Wikileaks Theatre". Here is a suggestion for the first video.
           </p>
           <p>
            30 second video "Wikileaks Theatre: Act One - If spirit cooking be the food of love..."
           </p>
           <p>
            background music some classical sophisticated elegant stuff maybe chopin

            Intro credits vaguely shakespearean/comical/memeworthy repeat title,
A true story from Wikileaks email id 15893, June 28th 2015. 
 add "Scene 1: A tragedy in 3 courses", i dont know im riffing here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Enter stage right, The brothers podesta and Lady Marina Ambramovic
           </p>
           <p>
            Get headshots of the podestas and marina.  Read the text of the email as dialogue in a play -

           </p>
           <p>
            cut to "Scene 2: At Dinner" text
turn over to edit the most distrubing bits of footage from this spirit cooking performance -
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TYhBbQBpnI">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TYhBbQBpnI
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then juxtapose it with the soundtrack, maybe have dinner party chatter. Or intersperse with some footage of them as individuals doing something innoucuos.

             Yes I like the idea of a Wikileaks related channel. This is a very good idea, or even a Wikileaks workbench channel where maybe not as cool as your idea with the drama reinactment, but just a channel that picks one email at a time and investigates it... great idea!

            I think we need to target MSM comment sections, the guardian and BBC etc. And we need to beat them with logic. No hating or anger, just simply defeating them with logic. We should be in numbers and hit them on a sunday so they are less shills about. It's very easy, they have no arguments, and we have many. They can only call us conspiracy theorists, at which point we can tell people to think them selves, politely ask them to look at the information for them selves and make their own minds up.

            These are great suggestions.  My two cents:  Think not like us, but the people you want to convince who are still asleep. Also, don't use any tag that takes another group's mojo, like #LittleLivesMatter.  The BLM and their sympathizers then immediately put you in the alt right Trump camp because they read it like #BlueLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter.  I hang with these folks all the time and they are very binary and will harden against the cause if they think it is altRight.  Find a way to make this about feelings - they are very motivated by feelings and rights as they understand them.   Tell the story of trafficking and pedophilia and its various faces and personal damage.  Get the lock on the feeling and then there will be willingness to get the facts.

            I couldn't agree more with you mate! This unprecedented citizen investigation has seen incredible and positive leads, it's time to take action. I'll leave my opinion here, and highlight that,
            <strong>
             it's just my opinion on course of action

            I believe our ultimate goal should be to conduct a white march after inauguration, in DC or NYC, or maybe both.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March
            </a>
            If this is done properly, It's impossible to ignore it. It's the ultimate call for attention by MSM, authorities, politicians, other citizens, etc. It worked in Belgium at the time of Dutroux, I don't see why it won't work in the U.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I also believe in two other things: First, we won't get anywhere with 10k people, we need at least 20 times that. These next 9 days should be all about spreading awareness, in a non-evasive, non-partisan, and non-aggressive way. I agree with the social media and meme strategy. Second, we need to drop the word pizzagate. Very serious about this, this word is already widely known, it's been immensely attacked and I'm quite sure that now it only brings negative connotation to our case. Suggestions:
            <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI/status/819379382045114369">
             https://twitter.com/FBI/status/819379382045114369
            </a>
            We go with what the FBI tweeted yesterday - #EndTrafficking #HumanTraffickingAwareness. Dropping the word will not only help to grow awareness in a new and different way, but it will also label us as "concerned citizens" instead of "conspiracy theorists", which will make a much stronger case for us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cheers for all and keep up the good work

            From the top:
           </p>
           <p>
            need far more people making memes about connections we've uncovered, and historical examples of child pedophilia being covered up. People need short single concrete points of evidence to be persuaded along with the overarching examples.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we see something like Twitter or Google protecting / condoning a pedophile network, then we need look up the advertizers / sponsors of said platform / videos. ...(see 2nd paragraph in comment above to review specifics.)
           </p>
           <p>
            ATTITUDE ADVICE: "I want to raise your awareness" most will bargain this down to something much less than awareness and concern. If you instead go forth, hitting people in the pocket books, making people feel guilty for letting this shit continue, then you'll wind up negotiating down to "being concerned" about the issue. Do you see? You have to aim higher than the goal you want to hit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of your awareness campaign needs to be showing that the "authorities" can't be trusted to do shit. FBI and police have been covering it up, and that's why it's been allowed to get this bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about what your enemies are saying, and find a contrary position that's more sensational. Do things that provoke more interest than demand "investigation" be done. What the hell is the common person supposed to do if your goal is to demand an investigation? You have to outline most people an action they can participate in right then -- preferably one that's as easy as spreading a meme or changing a social media avatar to raise awareness. Once they've committed the first easy step, some of them will want to do more. Create a series of actions people can do to help, clearly outlined, and graduated in difficulty / time investment. This way your supporters can work their way up to the level of investment they can give. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            They've been brainwashed into thinking they're helpless and overwhelmed. So, give them some hope, give them something they can actually do, even if it's very small. (Yes, this is the topic of another post I've made, requesting Active Investigators to put out TASK lists of bite-sized chunks others can coordinate their fact checking and digging with, to ensure coverage and avoid duplication of effort.)
           </p>
           <p>
            once you have evidence that something bad is happening in a state or even a city you don't have to call for the federal powers to perform an investigation. You can notify the agency in that state or city that is responsible for investigating corruption.

            Focus on one issue at a time, and release one at a time, IMO. Kind of like the way WL does.just has to be compiled correctly and professionally. It's too soon for that on some things. Or just keep digging for a smoking gun and have a boatload of evidence to back it up. 
Easier said then done for all parts.

            I could not agree more! I've already begun this effort. Using a very basic concept: if sales is "tooting your own horn" then marketing is "having someone else toot it" for you. We need a "grass-roots" awareness campaign. One that will grow on its own so to speak, strait forward, no money involved and tap directly into middle class of America. In other words, repeaat exactly what Trump did to when the election.

            With someone mentioning here Operation Brownstone, another idea could be a hashtag with something having to do with #EndBrownstones or something using 'Operation' in it.   Just a thought.  I also think it would bother parents, reading the article posted last night, of the girl that survived child trafficking in Portland, OR, talking about how the 'handoff' of kids would sometimes take place at Disneyland, or other crowded places.  When people read a woman's quoted article about crap like that, it's got to sink in what's going on.   I will find the link to the article and add it here.

            Someone needs to make a weaponized video. Spend some time on it, collaborate if you have to, but package this shit so it's palatable and succinct for the everyman/skeptic. Easier said than done I know.

            We need a high quality documentary that captures most of what we know now. Imagine making a "Inside Job" style documentary about child trafficking. People love to be educated and entertained at the same time.

            Personally I am waiting for Jan . 20th .  I really think an Attorney General Jeff Sessions will bring charges, and not just political smoke kind of charges that get walled off and buried but actual jail time charges that are prosecuted and stick.  The past few days have shown me how truely spooky our spooks are. How political and the ends justify the means they have become. That will change with regime change.  No more the deep state wagging the dog.  No one is too big to jail you pedo freaks.

            Hmm... We have to understand that we're dealing with an extremely powerful global network of incredibly evil people. This ties in to so many things, the evil is everywhere, in the highest positions of politics, economy, religion, entertainment, and of course the whole mainstream media is covering up for them. Pizzagate is only the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately this is a very serious power struggle, between normal people and highly organised psychopaths and pedophiles. If we're going to win, we have to be equally organised. Ultimately I think there's still more of these sick pedophile freaks than there are people actively fighting them, so we don't even have the numbers yet, let alone the resources and the organisation they have. This is total warfare and will last for a long, long time. These people won't go quietly in to that good night, they will try to take down the whole world with them in their rage, clinging to power.

             They've been successful at keeping pedophile news out of the press by banning pizzagate.
They even wiped out the arrests in Norway with the sledgehammer they've taken to pizzagate.
You can't even post anything about Hempstead without having it called pizzagate.
And, indeed, many of us have likened Norway and Hampstead to pizzagate!

            And what about people finding out your strategy and tell Twitter so all fake accounts will be off ? I think it's a good idea of doing this, but it would be better to have this strategy private.

            Same here. I was (and still remain) a skeptic of some things people claim, but this bread crumb definitely made me take a closer look. PleadingTheYiff's write up was excellent, it is a shame that his write up is not posted somewhere more official that I could share it.

            I worry that pg investigators have compiled a shit ton of evidence but it's so much. Without keeping up here, non-redpilled might be skeptical about small pieces, overwhelmed by the archive. I wish we had an information specialist to put this all together - everything - DC, US, global, money, art, politics, sex, drugs, FBI, CIA, celebrities, elites... we've got it all... in some way that's digestible and believable. Someone genius at presenting complex info, like an Edward Tufte.

             There are lots of simple ways into the pizzagate story -- which just opens up insight into human trafficking, especially in regard to children.  CIA is involved w/MKULTRA-Monarch for purposes of Mind Control.  Problem is that it's an unpleasant subject many want someone else to wade through for them.
And, certainly "Spotlight" movie and Vatican's pedophile priests should have woken everyone up.
Church is often involved.

              That is fantastic.  Copying the front page might be helpful as a handout.
Tack one or two up on the grocery store bulletin board.
Leave a few on a church pew here and there.
And you know, kids -- teenagers -- should be a very interested population because they
are the ones threatened by this.  Them and their younger siblings.
Any women's group could be approached with this easy to use link to WikiPizzagate.
Haven't checked the reports and particulars as yet, but will do so soon.

              thats awesome. One major omission from it, though (if its author is reading) is the evolution of Operation Brownstone, the long running CIA program whose purpose is to generate incriminating evidence (fake or real) that can be used to compromise the worlds most powerful politicians, bureocrats and businessmen. Its an important link to understanding how the sexual/gay revolutions of the 60's/70's reduced the 'sting' in the operation and led Brownstone to go darker than its original  'extramarital affair / homosexual' honeytraps to paedophilia, which - a generation on - now has many 2nd generation victim / perps

               CIA is very involved, starting with MKULTRA which calls for torture and sexual abuse for purposes of mind control.  2nd paragraph:  &gt;MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[11][12

               It moved into Operation Monarch, but Dir. Richard Helms/CIA ordered all the records of that program to be destroyed when he retired from CIA.
And, who is to be believe that these vile programs ever ended?

                “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”

            When I tell people about PG, do you know which part of the story makes them the most angry and most likely to believe there is something going on? Laura Silsby. When I show them the proof, that she was arrested for trafficking children, and then I show them that she is now working for Amber Alert, they FREAK OUT. Parents trust Amber Alerts and finding out that a convicted child trafficker is now working for them? Not going to fly.
           </p>
           <p>
            This story also works well because it is easy enough to prove. Lots of the other connections are harder to follow and require lots of reading and context. This story, on the other hand, takes a moment to verify. It's also something every parents cares about: we all worry our children might become lost or stolen for us, and Amber Alert is supposed to be a trusted resource.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suggestion? Make a hashtag calling for Silsby to be fired.  Don't mention pizzagate. Make a clear picture stating who she is and what she does, and share the hell out of it. Make it non-partisan (don't mention Clinton because then they will dismiss it as 'right wing'. They can figure that part out themselves when they verify it), don't include any  frogs or cuss words or slurs. I'm not creative enough to know what the hashtag should be, but if done right, it will be like DraftOurDaughters or SpiritCooking, two successful hashtag campaigns.
           </p>
           <p>
            This hashtag would attract stay at home moms and church goes, two demographics that are actually very good at getting companies and news organizations to act.

             I appreciate this comment actually, I have felt jaded over the last few weeks trying to convert people in twitter. It's tiring and sets you back alot when the hours of chatting lead to them just playing you for a fiddle. I work all day and sometimes i just cant be fucked after work to expplain to people in a calculated coherent manner, but I lish myself because this is hostoric and important to our livelihood. Ive definitely been doing it wrong though, your way seems like the absolute best approach. I'll let you guys know if it works

              You are welcome. I feel the same way. Sometimes, late at night, I end up crying when I think about how there are countless children suffering right now and we have no one to turn to for help. Every day that goes by is another day a child is hurt, or worse. I just want these poor babies saved NOW but it feels like it will take forever for it to happen, assuming it even does happen :-(  We can't give up though, if our collective efforts can help rescue these kids then we have to keep going no matter what.

             The OP is a marvelous idea.  We're 10,000 strong here.  If we all create secoundary twitter accounts, maybe with pizzagate in the title, and tweet and gab.ai every day the message will get spread.  It's really not that hard to tweet or retweet 1 message a day.  We could even coordinate and all tweet the same meme.

             "but but but... .the children just wanted a better life elsewhere and Laura was kind to have trafficked them away from a bad living, she CARED". That's the response I get. Ugh. Podesta's artwork pieces though, that usually makes people uncomfortable in my experience. Particularly the ones with the children that look spanked and abused.

              I guess it depends on how you phrase it. No one is going to approve of someone stealing another person's kid, even if they're doing it because they want to get them a "better life". So far, I haven't had anyone bring up that excuse when I tell them.

              The art work is a hit or miss with me. Older people tend to dislike it and see it as a moral outrage, younger people tend to agree that it's gross but then say that art is subjective or it's not a "crime" to have creepy pedo pictures. I try not to bring on the art work until after I give them more concrete information, that way they tend to agree that even if the art isn't a crime, it still doesn't look good given the other information they know.

                Wait now, in this thread there is a debate that she doesn't work for amber alert so does she at least work for a company contracted or connected to amber alert? Or can we make sure the information is accurate?

            This is brilliant! I would be willing to start a Twitter for this. As for not merely saying pizzagate is real, how better to convey in dropcards? I thought by linking to the pizzagate voat discussion along with pizzagate is real, it would pique some curiousity. I plan on designing my own cards and leaving everywhere I go. A "ghost" campaign.

             great idea.  I use media, but drop cards are a good idea.  I add  this one to the list:
             <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page">
              http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting when I engine search  pizzagate wiki  Wikipedia pgate comes up and it was hard for me to find the wiki pgate page.

            Has anyone figured out how many kids are missing, how many are boy vs girl, what ages , race, or anything to see a pattern? Are they targeting random kids or do the have certain criteria they are looking for? Where are the professionals who do this for a living for some clues, their must be a pattern from survivor testimony. I'm sick of fucking Comet ping pong.

            I would suggest somebody making a t shirt company with phrases that are sure to get the conversation started. Seems like a good idea to me.

             I also thought of something like this at first. However, as other users already pointed out, this could potentially backfire. First of all the t-shirts not only give you away to people who might support the cause but also to people "on the other side". Secondly if you sell them in any other way than cash and also ship them to the customers you will need some personal information, e.g. their address or credit card information. Now imagine somebody unwanted getting access to this data.

             Tshirts are a lot to think about.  Wouldn't buttons someone can put on their baseball hat, or tote bag good enough?
Or a key chain -- you know those plastic things that usually say "Bermuda" or "Boston"?
Plus, it's winter -- no one will see anyone's Tshirt here on E Coast.

              I think I would make a shirt flats a play off of five nights at Freddie's. Maybe something like 5 nights at comet? And show a bloody piece of pizza. Would be funny and you don't have to mention comets full name.. so people will ask questions. Then you can explain the similarities between the weird game and the real pizza place. Lol.

             vacvape great idea. Something like that would be great easy activity during the inauguration celebration.   Some fun actors and  interesting signs, PGate actors  could have great exposure with it.  A narrator with a karaoke machine could describe the activities,  some mimes could join in.     It wouldn't be considered  a  protest because it's   '''ART''.

              But you could also go full scale and create a children's cartoon.. showing them what the (((elite))) are all about. Kind of a PSA so to speak. That'd rock. Surely it'd go viral on yewtube.. surely.

               Yes,  if it's done very tastefully it could have an incredible impact.  Even though obviously  PG isn't funny,  If done in the right way with   narration and cynical remarks corresponding to situations that were acted out, or done on a power-point type of thing on the wall of a building could have a big educational  impact.      Cynical remarks could be very dark of course.
              </p>
              <p>
               It could discuss all issues, even the bizarre  fox show called the Mick.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have a lot of  ideas for  sketches or short  1 or 2 minute commercial  segments, either live or pre-taped  to show in parks,kind of like the Hyde Park Speakers Corner Soap box type of thing.   uploaded on a vid.me channel, distributed  on media,
              </p>
              <p>
               The idea is to show what these people are doing and  point out the desensitization  tactics that are used when they do it, but present it in an artistic format.
              </p>
              <p>
               A lot of people don't know the finesse and tricky way they've been desensitized to accept something in the name of equal rights or personal freedom.   I was one of those people.
              </p>
              <p>
               Presenting   sketches or commercials of this type might combat this invasive and insidious method of programming that's going on in the name of  art, freedom of expression and equality.

                TY. That's it exactly. I personally have no talent or ability in these areas.. 'cynicism' in spades. Vision perhaps. But to lay it down in art, nah. So I appreciate it when I see it. But that is it exactly and I get the impression I'd learn from watching them too since I can't imagine that I catch everything.

                Sometimes things are so subtle they simply don't rouse your attention while simultaneously we're presented with an "answer" that keeps us from asking questions in the first place. Or it's just ever present so that it's 'normal' but I always got it. Just seemed like it'd have to get a whole lot worse first. But I'm told these are fun times.

                One example in my recent experience, this pink hair gooney nonsense. I kind of liked it at first. Hot pink streak on a hot blond.. looked alright to me and of course oh well now it's a fashion everyone is doing it how long can that last?

                The parasitism public repeat ^^ as if it's the final realization. But ti's actually militarily strategic, force in legion. They can recognize friendly / enemy forces, swarm, etc. A talented person so enlightened could convey such a basic lesson clearly in probably a panel or perhaps two.. within the 144 char attention span required of it to be effective.
               </p>
               <p>
                Otherwise, I recall having seen a cartoon based on child abuse on reddit. Kid lived in terror of the next instance of abuse and it was drawn perfectly to convey that, where she'd be staring at the big door between her and her likely attacker as she tried taking a bath when no one was home. Then a knock..
               </p>
               <p>
                It was seriously disturbing shit. But it was someone's reality and that was well conveyed. I know you get how useful that can be. So that's why I was kind of thing that sort of thing, truly skillfully applied on this subject matter, could be so effective and useful. Of course it's not the kind of work that pays well.. could be the kind that catches you a bullet or a dog attack or ..
               </p>
               <p>
                Being effective is a dangerous thing.

                 That's true about the 144 char attention span required to take into account.    I'm a reader and still confused about why people go online to read  but   refuse to read anything longer than 5 sentences.  TL;DR  my ass.

                 Interesting info about the hair streaks.  I did not know that.  I'm thinking the bright hair is low level amateur warnings.   Serious people would  pack a glock.

                  It all has to do with brand building too you know. Making it seem more normal builds strength into it. An air of strength has two effects. Draws the weak minded towards it, and suppresses weak opposition. People are naturally scared of "everyone else" against them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also fake it till you make it. How many adopted the views themselves, which are plainly fucking irrational, versus just thought it's the cool new style they had to have or be the odd duck out? Do you know what the enemy forces would say about that distinction? Who cares nigger, buy our T-shirt.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the nigger next to you, I fucking promise, don't care.. and probably already wearing the T-shirt. No this is high level psy ops shit. How to oppress a people, displace, replace, or just erase. The beauty of it is that it seems so unassuming because first it's sexy, and you get to cheer for it towards your own bankrupt virtue.. they're all just victims, powerless, strong voices, amplified above all others whom it begins to suffocate under the false pretext of speaking for them, as if on their behalf.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then it's just some trog wannabe buffet and all kind of a joke because you never see the threat. Or you do but think/hope it won't gain traction.. despite the fact that it's being driven by your puppet government and all means of stream dictate you accept it, you sorry, subservient, model entitled citizen.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  See if you can wait this fashion out. Oh but in war, having the jump on them. It's a pivotal thing in invasions. Surprise! It's like how on the man in the high castle that I watched recently when they gassed the guy's family in the first few episodes. They had them in a nice room, fully furnished, comforts of home. Can we watch tv? They put the cartoons on..closed the door, no fuss. No expense. Didn't even need guards or dogs to drag them in.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course they'd not be wearing nazi arm bands because that'd be alarming.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It also serves a diversionary and baiting purpose. Some fish have those false appendages or whatever the fuck they're called, wiggle a brightly colored tail out like a worm or something enticing, becomes low hanging fruit, bleeds resources, distracts focus from the real attack vector and so on.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As to the reading and the TL:DR thing? That's also used a means of discrediting I guess. People will skim a thread naturally and look to read the shorter articles to try and get the jist of the thread without having to suck the whole thing in in detail. No?  Does that not sound semi intelligent? Then you can decide what's worth more of your time or not but for 99% of people they'll have their opinions formed by that initial short skim/short replies/most emotive/dismissive/etc. Maybe a tiny circle jerk to shore it up.. done.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So if they can't speak to your argument they can simply say TL:DR.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The 144 char bit is also addiction.. rapid reward for low investment. Appeals to lazy and the reward is also like a game.. with the likes as bonus points. Instant affirmation even if all false. So it has appeal on that front for the low level geniuses who were like "Oh cool. I can finally tell the world about my sandwich".
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But it's actually a lobbying/voice amplification/suffocation platform in disguise, driving oppressive narratives downwards from above with newly empowered idiots. Even often with circle jerks of 'experts' or others you're conditioned to look up to. Who've now found 'purpose' and 'belonging'... how wars start.

                  In the same way, like on reddit frequently, stooges will be the first to comment on a submission, perhaps their own. Their comment can be the exact opposite of what's conveyed in the article, but guess what people will read? And so an anti parallel to reality toxic to the public and corporate friendly narrative is forged that easily. Some people notice though and they all need to be ostracized or so forth.

                  Now let's say you're suddenly less intelligent than a bright reader such as yourself. Say you've long been suscepted to that wonder bread genocide. Your brain is depleted of nutrients.. doctor I'm tired and feel like shit all the time.. probably getting fat now too. He gives you some 'anti psychotics' (which means?) for 'sleeping pills' (which means?) for nighty night and some lobotomizing SSRIs for the day to go with your ADD and ADHD.

                  You have to come to understand the appeal to flash re-writable attention spans. They truly lack the processing capacity for more. How do you reach your audience? Brilliant isn't it.

                  I've seen them, at reddit, for the government, and their corporate puppets, forge anti reality narratives the exact opposite of the subject matter in the posted articles all day long and nobody calls them on it. Or at least nobody that can.

                  You know what else? I've sampled the commoners, having recently spoken to one. They don't consume these streams of no apparent interest to them.. it's just noise. They sum shit up in some way that least affects them and hopefully it stays that way.. must all just seem like odd fashions to them I guess?

                  So it's a bit like clubbing seals I guess. They're just helpless stranded out on the ice and you can just walk up and crack em between their dough eyes while they smile up at you. In truth I doubt they're half as oblivious.. I bet they know it's coming. But I like analogies.
