<p>The letter -- signed by senators from Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Minnesota and Virginia, and addressed to Deputy Secretary of State John J.

<p>&quot;While Haiti\'s social services agency has had an ongoing investigation into the orphanage for more than a year, nothing has been done to stop the abuse.&quot;</p>
<p>Orphanage Director Eveline Louis-Jacques said Friday that several children in her care had tested positive for chlamydia but said it hasn\'t been confirmed that they contracted the infection while at the home -- and she vehemently denied that any abuse has occurred there.</p>
