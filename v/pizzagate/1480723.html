            Can anyone confirm where Gosch/Gannon is today? It appears he never gave a requested DNA test.

            I swear to God Alifantis is in the same kind of program. Maybe he wasn't kidnapped but he def grew up in a CIA and/or Georgetown mind control situation, although he could be in a multi generational abuse family, or they got their hands on him at a young age for adhd camp and groomed him from there.
