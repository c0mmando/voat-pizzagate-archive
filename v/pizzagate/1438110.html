            My mind is spinning with so many connections from this memo and the connections therein.  The memo is from John Podesta, Andy Stern, and Anna Burger to the following people:
           </p>
           <p>
            George Soros
Jonathan Soros
Peter Lewis
Jonathan Lewis
Herb and Marion Sandler
Steve Bing
John Sperling
Michael Vachon
           </p>
           <p>
            The first connection that comes to mind after reading what FBIAnon said about several things that I got from this great post
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1430910">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1430910

           </p>
           <h1>
            7 listed a major bank that went under during TARP.  It is well known that Herb and Marion Sandler brought down Wachovia Bank.
           </h1>

            Also, their daughter was the author of the infamous handkerchief email to Podesta.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            They were very close to Podesta and as you will remember Podesta's assistant Elizabeth Cooley sent them a message the day after Madelyn McCann disappeared in Portugal which was one of the first emails released from Wikileaks from Podesta.

            Everyone knows the connection Soros and The Clintons have but in case you haven't seen this  is an email to Hillary from Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American progress, a non profit started by John Podesta.  She was sitting next to George Soros at a fundraiser and told Neera the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5ck65m/george_soros_can_call_on_hillary_any_time_on_any/?st=IVZ6G9PK&amp;sh=4bff0855">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this by accident of the State Department emails.  Wikileaks had indexed it as .oros but when you look at the original PDF you can see George Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a group of the most powerful men and women and all have many common goals.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this article that was taken down by Reddit.  It involves Peter Lewis and a tugboat he remodeled under super secret conditions in 1997.  It was renovated in Florida with employees working on it around the clock and under armed guards.  The workers could not talk to reporters.  I posted this on Reddit too and it was taken down.

            I am curious if this is perhaps what FBIAnon was speaking of when he mentioned (#33)TPP fast-tracked to aid in transporting children across Pacific (totally stolen idea from an associate)
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps that is why the renovations were so secret.   Were they designing areas they could hold people/children for human trafficking?
           </p>
           <p>
            The yacht/tugboat was then bought by Eric Schmidt of Google.  Eric is a major Clinton supporter.  This is actually still on Reddit but it's not getting much traffic so it's still up...

            I'm working on some other things involving this group of people but it's taking me awhile.  I hope you have it up in the next few hours but I wanted to go ahead and get this out.
