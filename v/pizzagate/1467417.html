            Breitbart did not "expose" Podesta. He made an entirely unsubstantiated claim about Podesta. And putting heart attack in quotes reveals your bias and agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unsubstantiated: "Many investigators have died shortly after investigating these crimes." Like who? What investigators have even looked into pizzagate? And unless these deaths are shown to be murders, this is irrelevant and again shows your agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            False: Silsby was not convicted of kidnapping. She was convicted of arranging irregular travel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somewhat misleading: Amber Alerts does not strictly deal with locating missing children, they provide the tech for the notification system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Misleading: UK's most notorious pedophile was knighted by the queen. Obviously his pedophilia was not known at the time he was knighted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unsubstantiated: Mark Thompson covered up Jimmy Saville's pedophilia. The investigatory documentary on Saville was cancelled by the show's editor, who said it was his decision alone. BBC press and Thompson say Thompson was never even aware of the documentary. There is no proof that Thompson knew about the show or about Saville's crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Irrelevant: Thompson is head of the NY Times which calls Pizzagate "fake news". First: ALL major media outlets refer to Pizzagate as "fake news". Second: Calling something "fake news" doesn't make it more likely that it's actually "real news".
           </p>
           <p>
            Cloudy: Virginia's missing children rate. Your claim is based on the NEMC's numbers, which differ greatly from the DOJ's records. DOJ shows 211 missing people OF ALL AGES in Virginia, while NEMC's numbers show 415 children alone. What explains this discrepancy? Part of this is because NEMC makes clear that their results for a given state include missing children who went missing from ANOTHER state but may now be in the state you queried. Also keep in mind that the VAST majority of missing children are not "stranger abducted". As for photos, these records go back to the 1950s, of course there are no photos for many of them. You should find out why there is a difference in the numbers between NEMC and DOJ, and narrow it down to believed abducted rather than runaways or a custodian took them.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, your document's errors, false statements, unsubstantiated claims, and deliberately misleading claims would only further convince most people that this is "fake news", a conspiracy theory subscribed to by trolls and lunatics. It doesn't help that there is literally only ONE reference to anyone involved in Pizzagate, and that's a perfectly innocuous email TO John Podesta that no one in their right mind would think was referring to pedophilia if they hadn't been actively looking for pedophilia in it.

            Great idea! I love your posters! Could you write one that says something like " Before you claim it's fake. Before you ignore it. You owe it to your yourself, your family and your grandchildren to look at the facts surrounding #PIZZAGATE" (or however you want to word it) then put the voat.co/v/pizzagate address, so they know where to go.

            This is not essentially our topic, but you can open the eyes of non-believers by showing them the scale of the cover up, both how high it goes, and how long it lasts.

            These are brilliant, straight to the point, just what is needed. Every time I see that email about the kids in the pool it sends shivers down my spine. There is no reason whatsoever to give their ages, no normal person would do this its so obvious what is going on here especially with it saying about them being entertainment.

             The reason to give their ages would be because this is clearly a family-friendly gathering, with the email going out to many men, women, married couples, and presumably parents, so the ages are relevant in terms of possibly influencing the decisions of invitees to bring their own kids.

              Names (may indicate gender) and subsequently their ages ?  and then including  "So you´ll have further entrainment and they will be in that pool for sure"  (assuming is referring to the children) Seriously? at most someone will say well have some fun and the kids are coming with us. This is too specific, specially when you connect them to CPP, Alefantis and everything else that has come up. I wish this was normal stuff or anything else but you cannot look away from this. So many people coming to the same conclusion cannot be that far from the truth even by far. Add this to the "fake news" narrative that has come up in the last month and you got a series of events that are harder to ignore than even the architects  and engineers for 9/11  truth (Building 7).

              If you are not a CTR chill, but someone looking to make sense of all of this, I understand otherwise by the nature of your comments, its probably that you are a shilling for CTR trying to disrupt the rise of the pizzagate scandal to wider public.

               All the people constantly whining about the "MSM" and their "fake news" narrative can never seem to provide a single example of news that has been labeled "fake" by the MSM that was actually "real".

                When I wrote this I was thinking in the context of data modeling and correlational analysis where you usually try to find a mean to make sense of a lot of data inputs.
               </p>
               <p>
                True it could be called mob mentality, but not necessarily peer pressure (no body is pushing this down your throat unlike the "fakes new narrative")
               </p>
               <p>
                And yes too specific in the matter that a lot of what it's going on is related to child trafficking etc talking this way about children it's just plain inadequate
               </p>
               <p>
                why a full grown adult would be entertained by kids?  In a pool and private party?  Why it is ok that Tony it's friends with a know pedophile plus all the "art" imagery that make allusion to CP and rape that ththese people have?
               </p>
               <p>
                Sure I don't know you, and I don't care if you take this into consideration. But if you want to make your point why don't you make a counter posts where all of these things get debunked, it should be easy since every single thing it's fake (as you put it out so simply with your fabulous comments)

            Also....steer away from the want to correct or edit any of these...they are perfect the way they are!!! use that energy to make more with different facts.... you are on to something huge with this man. Make a whole collection of these....and maybe a seperate "images edition".... you've got a great eye for this stuff.

            I agree.  I think this is one of those things where you make seperate ones specifically for the images.... never replace or cancel any of the ones already made. Just keep making more with different facts, different images.
           </p>
           <p>
            in the end, we will have different editions....  Fact Series ...Image Series......2+2 Series etc...
           </p>
           <p>
            That way the viewer gets that feeling like "what is this one going to say??"
           </p>
           <p>
            I can literally imagine us having a database of like 100 different versions of these.....each one with a different fact or image.  And each one equally can effectively redpill a person.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is definitely the way to move forward...It simple and easy and not overwhelming and once they get drawn in, they will take themselves down the rabbit whole like all of us did.

            I had to come back again and tell you how great these posters are!!!  please keep making more and more....i envision these being spread around everywhere, online and in the real world..... they are soo easy to digest and the facts hit hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a person picks up one, its more likely they will actually go and check for themselves .....its easier to get people to engage when its simple and laid out the way you did it.
           </p>
           <p>
            i can imagine like 100 of these, each with different facts.... almost like trading cards.

             I agree, QR codes are useless. No one I know uses them, not a single person. As easy as they are to use, people are too lazy to even scan a QR code these days, a lot of older generation people wouldn't even know what they are or how to use them.

            I know people are gonna think I'm making an immature joke... but we need Pepe. We need Kek. I'm dead serious. I'm not gonna do it, we need true believers on /POL/ and here on voat to do it though.
           </p>

            Look. The elites are engaged in satanic rituals, and it appears they have been for awhile. The prevailing theory is that they do these things for power. Secretly getting others, all around the world, ritual sacrifices disguised as war or terrorism. Cannibalism and infanticide, pedophilia, all for power. I can't help but notice the fact that they
            <em>
             actually have power.
            </em>
            Pretty much ALL of the power, in fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it really that hard to believe that a group of people on the Internet manifested a power of their own? Or maybe an old power (like Moloch/Baal)? Regardless, meme magic works, and Pepe or whatever you wanna call him was something special. All I'm saying is, if we're gonna meme the devil outta here... shouldn't we call on the memeGod for assisstance?

            EDIT: Forgot to say that I do like these posters and this realistic approach as well.

             This may be a little extreme.  I prefer a strategy of offering small elements of absolute fact to lure others to do their own reserch and draw their own conclusions.  While the evidence points towards massive pedophilia and sex trafficking scandals ITS A HUGE SELL. Even tho we discover more everyday their is no way to see the entire picture yet. Our goal is to get more people investigating by catching thier interest.

             it's hard to find actual "facts" there other than Tony's sick art collection and their spirit cooking invitations. If there is any doubt, the facts will be reported as fake... are they are compelling Podesta FACTS you can think of that are 100% proven?

               a lot of people are making new accounts for each post for their own privacy. Why would a shill create a bunch of useful pro pizzagate posters? People scream shill every time they dont understand something, it's bizarre.
