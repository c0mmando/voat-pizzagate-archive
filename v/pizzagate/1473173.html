<p>It also may come as no surprise to anyone who has been following the fund-raising scandals that information from this covert national-security operation -- first reported by Insight last week -- subsequently may have been leaked to politicos at the White House. They, in turn, are suspected of passing such classified data to Democratic National Committee, or DNC, officials and outside attorneys working for the Democratic Party -- information of great importance to high-stakes private business deals with Asian countries.</p>
<p>But what does come as a surprise is an apparent failure by federal law-enforcement and intelligence authorities to pursue allegations of kickbacks to FBI agents involved in the sweeping intelligence operation and separate allegations involving underage boys provided as prostitutes to visiting dignitaries attending the weeklong November conference of 15 Asia-Pacific nations.</p>
<p>One reason for the alleged coverup -- and that may be the only term appropriate, according to high officials in and out of government who claim direct and indirect knowledge of the APEC bugging -- is that those said to have engaged in kickbacks involving thousands of dollars include FBI agents through suppliers with whom they worked to procure electronic audio- and video-surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>As for the allegations of juvenile prostitution, sources who spoke to Insight on the condition they not be further identified say the reason these &quot;crimes&quot; were not pursued is that a probe would have exposed the Top Secret national-security operation.</p>
<p>Put on the record, it is a different story. Official spokesmen for federal authorities variously decline comment or say they have no knowledge of any such enterprise. Seattle FBI spokesman Ray Lauer says, &quot;I am not aware of the operation.&quot; Secret Service spokesman James Mackin says, &quot;We cannot provide you with any information.&quot; National Security Council, or NSC, spokesman RJ. Crowley says, &quot;The White House declines comment.&quot; And other White House and DNC spokesmen say they know nothing.</p>
<p>Julie Miller, a spokesman at FBI headquarters, says: &quot;Unfortunately, we can\'t comment on this. I know that\'s not what you are looking for, but we can\'t comment. I\'m sorry.&quot; When asked whether she denies such a surveillance operation occurred, Miller says: &quot;No, I can\'t deny it. We can\'t comment.&quot;</p>
<p>Robert Bucknam, the chief of staff for FBI Director Louis Freeh, refused to come to the phone when Insight called repeatedly. Ultimately, Bill Carter, a senior FBI spokesman, said that while he could not confirm or deny the existence of any national-security operation, he is very concerned about the allegations of crimes not being pursued involving prostitution and kickbacks.</p>
<p>&quot;To be honest, I don\'t know what you\'re talking about,&quot; said Carter. However, after several minutes of conversation, he said without hesitation that if any allegations of wrongdoing were forwarded to him he personally would see that it is &quot;forwarded to the appropriate office.... We certainly would look into it.&quot; He added that &quot;we take it very seriously&quot; and said that while it is the policy of the FBI neither to confirm nor deny the existence of any national-security operation, he would respond with any available information. At press time, he had not.</p>
<p>Told of the reactions of these spokesmen, Insight sources were appalled and amused. Those claiming direct knowledge say this is why they came to Insight, and that only action by the appropriate congressional committees and a federal grand jury can get to the bottom of allegations involving official crimes and a national-security operation gone awry.</p>
