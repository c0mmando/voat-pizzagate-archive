             Yeah everything after the "lions paw" ma-ha-bone tier involves a loooooot of sucking dick from what I hear. Some weird "alternate group consciousness" bullshit powered by a bunch of dudes sucking each other off.

               I don't know what you mean. I'm referring to Hunka's comment about the masonic grid. Obviously I know these recruits are weirdos and have to do something extremely messed up, in order to access the higher levels. But how do you know the precise nature of the act? I'm genuinely curious. Not saying you're wrong. Just wondered what your source is.

                from  observing NFL fans and the whole masonic subculture around the NFL and NBA!  actually, it was just a wild, semi-educated guess, from observing Crowley's connection to sex magic and his connection to HEr Majesty's Secret Service.
               </p>
               <p>
                Throw in a whole bunch of hints and clues, like Elizabeth's obsession with promoting black/interracial popular culture in the media , which she owns,  like Elizabeth's obsession with promoting homosexual pop culture in the media, which she owns, etc.

               <p>
                The entire city of New York is named after the original British city of York, and its ancient Druid Egyptian occult origins.
               </p>
               <p>
                The occult scene at Central Park in NY is unreal, with its orgies and satanic rituals. The royals are involved with  this stuff up to their eyeballs in the NY underground scene at Central Park.
               </p>
               <p>
                There was a group formed called AHAB , which operated out of THe Dakota beside Central Park. it was called 'Artists Helping All Blacks' , acronym AHAB
King Ahab is famous from the Old Testament as the ancient Jewish king who sacrificed his first born child to Baal.  That is what Rosemary's Baby was about. Sacrificing your first born . It was filmed in  The Dakota.
               </p>
               <p>
                The main couple in Eyes Wide Shut, Dr. Harford and his wife, their aparment was set as being located in a building on the same block as the Dakota, just one building over from The Dakota, The San Remo, which is actually part of the same 4-building celebrity  housing  co-op which The Dakota belongs to.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kubrick almost made Eyes Wide Shut in 1968, the same year that Polanski made Rosemary's Baby. Both films feature successful young couples in Manhattan who are 'social climbing' and find themselves immersed in ritual sex and intrigues, involving murder etc. So the parallels between the two films, and the hinted at implications for the reality of what actually goes in those buildings in real life, cannot be understated. Not when you look at who resides there in real life.
               </p>
               <p>
                Princess Diana lived in The San Remo with Dodi Fayed. Occultist Sir Bob Geldof lives there as does the knighted occultist Bono, with famous Crowleyite Sting just half a block down the street. Occultists John Lennon and his proclaimed 'yes I am witch' wife Yoko Ono lived in The Dakota, and the list of occult celebrities living on that same block beside Central PArk is HUGE.
Princess Diana and her sons today live/lived beside Central Park whenever in New York , at The Carlyle.
               </p>
               <p>
                The list of all the knighted and intel bigwigs who live there is unreal. Jagger had a place in The Langham right beside The Dakota , actually the bldg which is right between the Dakota and the San REmo. Mia Farrow grew up in The Langham with her actress mother Maureen O'Sullivan.  Woody  Allen, DAvid Bowie, Joan Rivers, Bill Cosby all live/lived within yards or walking distance of Central PArk. Knighted Annie Lennox lives there, as do a torrent of others. CRowley himself lived there , on the NW corner of Central Park. MArina Abramovich does all her occult shit there at the MOMA (museum of modern art, one block south of Central Park) even Louise Bourgeouis went to art school right beside MOMA (she's the satanist who sculpted 'hysteria' , the Jeffrey Dahmer dismembered thing in Podesta's pad)

                 Thanks for the links. I admit, I had missed a lot of that information for some reason. Obviously I'm aware of the names and their connections to Luciferianism...But not fully about the Dakota, Carlyle etc.

                 I guess I just tend to see Elizabeth's involvement as obvious, and as part of a chain-of-command relating to SMOM and the Vatican. Also, I know the Scottish clans are involved in this corruption, and have strong links to high finance in Hong Kong and other places.

                 As an Englishman I tend to be sceptical of the Alex Jonesy (i.e. Statfor) debating style because I know the elites can or will use Anglo-Saxons as a convenient scapegoat, and the moron masses in many countries will unquestioningly go along with this. In reality, Scotland is a much more significant occult centre than England. That's before we get to Rome, Brussels, Switzerland, DC, Jerusalem etc.

                 Most English people have never worked in the City of London, which has tons of amoral foreigners working there.
