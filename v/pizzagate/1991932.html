  'formattedContent' => '<p>This is related to Pizzagate because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law">Dima Yakovlev Law</a> which Putin signed into law on Dec. 28, 2012 (Feast of the Holy Innocents), banned Russian adoptions in the U.S. because of numerous incidents of abuse, murder and unexplained deaths of Russian adoptees in America, notably the death of 21-month old Dmitri Yakovlev who died from heat stroke after being locked in his car seat for hours while his stepfather was at work. The Russian govt. specifically banned The European Adoption Consultants agency from conducting Russian adoptions in 2008, and the EAC HQ in Strongsville, OH, was raided by the FBI on Feb.14, 2017, as part of a criminal probe into child trafficking and is currently being sued by the Ohio AG Mike DeWine for a variety of violations.</p>
<p>The Dima Yakovlev Law was passed unanimously by the Russian Federation Council. It was followed in June, 2013, <a href="[https://www.rt.com/politics/passes-ban-us-adoptions-834/">by a law banning Russian adoptions to gay couples abroad.
</a>](https://www.rt.com/politics/passes-ban-us-adoptions-834/)) It also banned single persons from adopting Russian children. </p>
<p>Putin signed an executive order along with the Dima Yakovlev Law which would improve Russia\'s domestic adoption system<a href="https://www.rt.com/politics/russian-fund-luxury-tax-788/"> proposing using revenues from a luxury tax</a> to ameliorate conditions in Russia\'s orphanages.</p>
<p>(In June, 2013, the Russian Duma also passed a law<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_gay_propaganda_law"> banning homosexual propaganda against minors</a>, which passed 388 to 1. 86% of the Russian population supported the measure.)</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the Russian adoption ban and the measures against gay adoption and gay propaganda to minors came a little over a year after then-SoS Hillary Clinton and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/clinton_lavrov_adoption_visas_us_russia_iran_missile_defense_wto/24264993.html">signed a high-profile bilateral Adoption Agreement</a> in 2011.</p>
<p>The rationale behind the adoption ban of Russian children <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/28/russia-putin-says-intends-to-sign-anti-us-adoptions-bill-into-law.html">was summed up well</a> by Pavel Astakhov, the Children\'s Rights Commissioner for the President of the Russia Federation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is huge money and questionable people involved in the semi-legal schemes of exporting children,&quot; he tweeted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>NY Times</em> called Pavel Astakhov &quot;The Man Behind U.S. Adoption Ban&quot; in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/world/europe/pavel-astakhov-the-man-behind-us-adoption-ban.html">article</a> dated Feb. 23, 2013. Astakhov has pushed hard since then for the establishment of  a database of Russian adoptees in the U.S. to monitor their welfare.</p>
<p>All of this Russian legislation in the same 6-month period suggests rather strongly that this was a comprehensive effort by the Russian govt. to protect their children and was not just a retaliatory act against the U.S. passing the Magnitsky Act and banning Russian businessmen and officials from the U.S.</p>
<p>The Russian adoption ban was met with widespread disapproval and outrage by progressives as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law">Wikipedia</a> notes: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the UN, Catholic News Service, and the MSM in the U.S. called &quot;Herod\'s Law&quot;, &quot;cannibalistic&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot;. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/putins-dirty-game-in-the-us-congress">Daily Beast article</a> from last year indignantly declared that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;disadvantaged Russian children are being dangled as bait, with a wink-and-a-nudge promise to have the Russian law (Magnitsky Act) rescinded if the American law is taken off the books.</p>
<p>As one U.S. official put it privately, the current messaging is being “led by ogres out of central casting. They’re saying, ‘You repeal Magnitsky and we’ll let go of the kids.’ And it’s not even American kids. It’s their own. And they’re kids with Down syndrome and spina bifida.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this background in mind, let\'s take a closer look at Natalia Veselnitskaya\'s foundation that she established to overturn the Russian adoption ban. <a href="https://jackposo.wixsite.com/home/single-post/Soros-Don-Jr">Jack Posobiec</a> claims Natalia is a Soros-paid shill, but I\'m not so sure. The same Daily Beast article above, dated May 18, 2016, which I just came across, entitled &quot;Putin\'s Dirty Game in the U.S. Congress&quot;, notes that the website was under construction except for the front page---something I also noticed while browsing through yesterday which means it hasn\'t been updated in over a year. I had also noted in a post yesterday that the name seemed to be parroting the official name of the Magnitsky Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In February, an organization calling itself the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, an obvious echo of the full name of the Magnitsky Act, was registered in Delaware. Little trace of the activities or provenance of this organization exist online, apart from its “under construction” website, whose homepage is written in ungrammatical English.</p>
<p>HRAGIF claims to be “working on analyzing legal and legislative options to help overturn this adoption ban,” according to its site. “We would like to present our findings to the members of U.S. Congress, Administration and U.S. public and is planning to brief them on possible ways of resolution of this stalemate on adoptions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to discuss Natalia\'s connection with the anti-Magnitsky Act documentary by Russian filmaker Andrei Nekrasov which was shown at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. for lawmakers last year, though it has been kept from the general public largely by the efforts of William Browder.</p>
<p>The contention of the Daily Beast article is that Natalia\'s scheme to overturn the Russian adoption ban is not to be trusted because she is a pro-Putin ally and a fierce opponent of William Browder and the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>This goes hand in hand with a <em>Daily Caller</em> article yesterday about William Browder\'s claim that the Russian-American lobbyist, Ritan Akhmetshin, whom Natalia <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/rinat-akmetshin-russia-gun-for-hire-washington-lobbying-magnitsky-browder/27863265.html">hired to register her organization</a>, HRGAIF, worked with Fusion GPS, the firm that produced the infamous &quot;Golden Showers&quot; Trump Dossier, to investigate him in an influence campaign against the Magnitsky Act at around the same time:</p>
<p>The <em>Daily Caller</em> article concludes with this astonishing statement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Browder is not linked to or identified in the dossier, but he has said that Fusion GPS’s involvement on the anti-Magnitsky effort raises questions about the veracity of the anti-Trump research.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>THIS is startling:  THIS IS HUGE!!! THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE GOLDEN SHOWERS DOSSIER WAS A BIG HOAX CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED AS PART OF A PRO-TRUMP AGENDA.</p>
<p>ALSO, BECAUSE NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA\'S LOBBYIST FRIEND RINAT AKHMETSHIN ALSO USED FUSION GPS TO INVESTIGATE BROWDER, THIS COULD VERY WELL BE THE SMOKING GUN PROVING THAT NATALIA VESELNITSKAYA AND RINAT AKHMETSHIN MAY ALSO BE PART OF A PRO-PUTIN SCHEME and used her organization knowing that restarting Russian adoptions was highly popular with the liberal elite (Why, one might ask?) as a way to bring lawmakers on board to begin influencing them against the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>Could her organization also have been used as a front to attract possible pedophiles and traffickers who wanted to restart the &quot;popular&quot; Russian adoption program in the U.S.? That remains to be determined, but it\'s clear that Natalia\'s non-profit was not what it proclaimed itself to be, and the liberal elite themselves were highly suspicious of it. It was a big flop and only one former Congressman was briefly taken in by it: Ron Dellums---- which makes it highly unlikely Natalia was working for Soros.</p>',

            Yep. The Democrats have no credibility left whatsoever. All they have now is Robert Mueller. It'll be interesting to see what he makes up out of thin air.

You missed my clue.

           <p>
            When the bilateral adoption agreement was signed the President of the Russian Federation was Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev.  When the adoption ban became law the President of the Russian Federation was Vladimir Putin.   There was a definitive shift in Russian policy when Putin returned, xenophobia towards the US was a part of that shift.

             Was it ever played in full in the U.S. to the public? Probably not. I see it on YouTube but you have to register to watch it and give a credit card # which seems scammy.

           <p>
            It's not scammy, you're just renting a movie stream. It's like renting a video now that there are no video stores any more.   Youtube has lots of movies/documentaries for rent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why the uproar?  Probably because ordinary people in both countries would be hurt, by a law that didn't really address the problem it claimed it addressed.  Adoption is a super emotional issue for those close to it.  That's just a guess on my part.

            You missed C and D and you missed them by about 5,000 miles.  And that is key to understanding this.

            E.  Bingo.  F. The movie makes more sense as a lobbying artifact than a real movie.  Why is it important to show it in the US?   How many Russian films play here?  The Newseum screening was the PREMIERE of the movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            G.  The use of adoption as a weapon against the US goes back to C and D.

            It might help if you realize just how stupid and desperate Lindsey Graham and John McCain are. The whole Deep State is desperate as hell and will literally grab at anything if it can put Trump in a bad light.

            It's as simple as that. Hillary &amp; Co are desperate.

            That's highly unlikely given the sheer number of flagrant attempts by the Deep State to frame Trump. The Russian Hooker Golden Shower charade fits right in their game plan.

            "I HAVE THE DEMS END GAME ON DT JR MEETING. HE'S A DISTRACTION, THEY'RE GOING AFTER TRUMP WITH THIS. ALL INFO INSIDE.
They've already started running what I wrote below!!

            I'm pretty sure I've figured out the long game with the Russian meeting that they've set Trump jr. up with. They've had this connection planned since May before anyone was ever "hacked" back in May 2016 via the DNC emails. I have their oppo research and all the players are there for what they're going to say. Their end game is to use this against Trump We know from the DT jr's email that someone named Emin Aglarov pushed to set the meeting up, he initiated it. We also know that this Emin is connected to the president of a country which is why he's pictured with John Kerry and knows Hillary Clinton
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev
            </a>
            . All the connections are here
            <a href="https://i.redd.it/uwbd7vrrx19z.jpg">
             https://i.redd.it/uwbd7vrrx19z.jpg
            </a>
            . The top meeting is in May of 2016 (same time as the DNC oppo research at the bottom AND one month before the meeting was set up).
As we see from this article that was just posted
            <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/07/well-lookie-russian-lawyer-veselnitskaya-pictured-obama-ambassador-russia-8-days-trump-jr-mtg/">

            </a>
            . The Russian lawyer is sitting right in front of Emin (who set up the meeting) 8 days after the meeting happened in congress right behind Obama's Russian ambassador (he could coordinate everything). We also know this isn't just any Russian lawyer, she is connected to Fusion GPS which is connected to the DNC paid for foreign agent acquired piss dossier
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/News/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jr-russian-lawyer-steele-dossier-natalia-veselnitskaya-gps-fusion-a7834541.html">

            </a>
            . Here is the Russian oppo research from the DNC in May 2016 (one month before the meeting and BEFORE ANY HACKING TOOK PLACE).
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/10436">
             https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/10436
            </a>
            (search for Emin and he is their entire link to "Putin" because President Trump is in one of his music videos).
So in closing, the DNC in May of 2016 BEFORE THERE WAS ANY HACKING planned to use Emin to connect President Trump to Putin since he was in a music video of his. Kerry met with Emin's father in law in May of 2016, one month before the meeting was requested with DT jr. in June. The Russian lawyer who attended the meeting was spotted with Emin 8 days later in Congress (who let them in?) AND is connected to the Fusion GPS fake piss dossier.
MOST IMPORTANT PART (summary). This DNC hit job to connect Emin to Putin and then Emin to President Trump was planned BEFORE THE DNC WAS "HACKED" BY "RUSSIA". This was their end game all along. Their next "bombshell" will be "Who is this Emin that set up the meeting? Oh wow he's connected to Putin and here is President Trump in his music video". This is how they're going to use this bullshit cooked up meeting to go after President Trump. All planned since May of 2016 before anyone was fucking "hacked". And they weren't his name was fucking Seth Rich you fucks.
EDIT. HERE IS THE EMAIL WHERE THEY GOT THE TRUMP MUSIC VIDEO OF EMIN, THEY EVEN SAY "PUTIN CONNECTED". ALL BEFORE THE HACKING EVEN HAPPENED.

            There are several other key factors which figure into this. and can be read here:

             Just 5 days after meeting with Don Jr.,  Veselnitskaya, was the guest of Michael McFaul, Obama's ambassador to Russia, at a congressional hearing.  McFaul was the architect of Hillary's Russian 'reset' button and stirred up all kinds of crap in Russian immediately after his appointment to ambassador.  They eventually kicked him out.
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              McFaul has been all over the media pushing the fake Russian conspiracy narrative for the democrats.

            <li>
             <p>
              Veselnitskaya,had been denied entry into the US until she appealed and was represented by anti-Trump attorneys, one of which was Preet Bharara, the Obama guy who Trump had to fire because he refused to step down.  Her court day was the same day as the meeting with Junior.

            <li>
             <p>
              Natalia Veselnitskaya was/is also a very vocal anti-Trump person on all of her social media accounts

            "So why would someone with a disposition of being anti-Trump want to deliver information to Donald Trump Jr?  …Especially considering Ms. Veselnitskaya was never identified within the original email request for a meeting? ….and Donald Trump Jr. said, correctly it appears, that he had no idea whom he would be meeting with(?) .
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s enough to make you wonder what exactly is the nature of the relationship between Natalia Veselnitskaya and President Obama’s appointees such that they would be visibly working together only a few days after her reported meeting with Donald Trump Jr. in Trump Tower…."

            Thanks for all your work :)  I'm not claiming to know what is at the heart of this, but there is something going on in the realm of the TPTB for this to become what it has.
I don't think Natalia Veselnitskaya's meeting with Trump Jr. was about adoption even though she probably talked about adoption. Some evidence (if real) supporting my opinion,
            <a href="http://archive.is/YXT1U">
             http://archive.is/YXT1U
            </a>
            I doubt Donald Trump Jr. knew what the heck she was on about, without being well versed in the Magnitsky case, (I am not).
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's what Russia claims about it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <ol>
             <li>
              The animosity by the Russian Government towards the Magnitsky Act has not
diminished over time, and in fact seems to have increased in the last 6 months.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             A. On 3 December 2015 Russia’s General Prosecutor Yuri Chaika provided a
letter of reply to the newspaper Kommersant, in which he stated that; the
adoption of the Magnitsky Act was the result of a large scale, deceitful PR
campaign orchestrated by Mr. Browder to shift the blame for his crimes to
Russian officials; and that the passage of the Magnitsky Act was based on
emotions and anti-Russian sentiment rather than objective evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             B. Chaika’s statements were part of a significant escalation in Russian
Government Anti-Magnitsky propaganda since December 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             i. On 13 April 2016, Russian State-owned channel Russia-1 TV aired a
30 minute film called “The Browder Effect,” accusing Mr. Browder of
being a CIA spy recruited in the 1980’s to bring down the USSR, of
killing Sergei Magnitsky, and of committing the $230 million Russian
Treasury fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             ii. In April 2016, Andrei Nekrasov’s documentary was due to be
premiered in the European Parliament. While the screening was
aborted, there were several former Russian government officials
present, such as Pavel Karpov, who played an instrumental role in the
fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             C. On 31 May 2016, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the
Magnitsky Act was an attempt by the US to contain Russia.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The document claims these are all false accusations, and perhaps they are.  However anything that involves any one or number of the following: Soros, Hillary, Obama, DNC, Neocons, Globalist communism...leaves plenty of room for doubt.
Somewhere I read that Soros et. al...managed to rake Russia over the coals financially, enriching themselves at the expense of the Russian people, following the collapse of the Soviet Government.  I would have to find that article, but I have no problem believing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Natalia Veselnitskaya is not on the same side as Soros, though Soros Open Societies Foundations has skin in the game as far back as 2012. (so why not before? TBD)
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is why does he?  Soros is all about leverage, power, money, control (LPMC) and this case apparently involves enough of that to keep his attention.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Natalia Magnitskaya v. Russia, filed by lawyers from the Open Society Justice Initiative on behalf of the mother of Sergei Magnitsky before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on October 17, 2012.

              https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/magnitsky-summary-10182012_0.pdf
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I find it hard to believe that Soros, who brought about BLM getting $100 million...cares enough for a $230 million alleged theft by the Russian government.  And given the trail of bodies littering Bill and Hillarys career, I seriously doubt he cares about one Sergei Magnitsky either, unless the name recognition provides him some of the LPMC I mentioned above.  But if this case interfered with or furthered the goals of the globalist cabal, or trafficking routes or whatever subversive crap he has his hands in, most especially MINERAL RESOURCES (recall WikiLeaks Albania) then no doubt it has the attention of his foundations networks and associated lawyers and protesters.

            Regarding Fusion GPS..  There are several people named who are part of it including
Christopher Steele, Glenn Simpson.

           <p>
            G.  The adoption issue is being manipulated. It's not a genuine issue which is why they are eager to drop the law if we lift human rights sanctions. There's been 19 deaths of Russia adoptees in a couple decades in the US.  At the same time there's been over a thousand deaths of children adopted within Russia. People who opposed this law included Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov and other prominent folks.

            <p>
             As Alexei Venediktov, editor of Echo Moskvy, a radio station, said on air: “This law is morally and ethically abominable. It is cannibalistic because it condemns a certain number of children—even if it is a small one—to death.” Mr Venediktov’s comment reflected not only the attitude of the opposition but also that of a large part of the Russian elite. Even some of Mr Putin’s own ministers objected to the law.

            Don't know what's up with the fusion story, but Fusion didn't write the Dossier themselves.  They hired a Russian expert from another company.  Christopher Steele's firm is Orbis.  Orbis was the subcontractor to Fusion.  Fusion was the client.  Unclear if Steele was involved in any of Fusion's work wrt Broder.

            well is clear that something funky is going on. I'm going to need to see how things play out, it is just too confusing at the monent to know for sure. but what is interesting is that it involves Russia, the media vs Trump and children which is a pizzagate trifecta so its a situation to keep all eyes on.

            Ashtakhov was a Russian agent and now he is a high powered lobbyist working in DC.  What?  He could be a double agent for all we know.  He also is suspected of hacking although he claims not.  Should we trust this guy?  I don't think so.  There are so many players in here, it reads like a Covert Spy Novel.  It is late and I read it once.  Will have to read this at least 4 or 5 times.

             Akhmetshin is the guy in the US.  He was accused in a lawsuit of having been in military intelligence.  He denies that he worked for the GRU.

              In an e-mail response to RFE/RL, Akhmetshin denied that he ever worked for Soviet military intelligence, something he would have had to declare when he applied for U.S. citizenship.
