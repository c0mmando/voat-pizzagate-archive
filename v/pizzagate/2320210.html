<p>Cholera rarely inflicts damage on organs. Mainly kills via dehydration. Because it is a disease, the murder weapon can become the perfect cover up, since who is going to suspect that a disease outbreak is being specifically used for organ/human trafficking.</p>

<p>New evidence I found this morning. Turns out that Haiti was pratically Cholera free for over 100 years....until the earthquake. More specifically, until the UN brought their treatment center there. Genetic forensics of the pathogen shows it was a south east asian strain of cholera active in a Nepal epidemic in June-August 2010. It infected a major river in Haiti via a septic tank in the UN Treatment Center.</p>

<p>Thanks to EsotericShade for this article on organ trafficking.</p>
<p>We may also need to keep watch in Yemen due to Cholera outbreaks there too.</p>
<p>Relevance to Pizzagate: Organ Trafficking and Human Trafficking tend to be strongly correlated. Can be considered part of our 2010 Haiti Earthquake lead. Bill Clinton was the head of the operation.</p>

<p>Full Definition of PG relates to multiple types of trafficking crimes, including organ. Thanks EsotericShade for this.</p>
<p>Notes: Keep watch on California and sale of &quot;raw water&quot; (unfiltered spring water). Could be cover for a plotted cholera epidemic for sake of organ trafficking.</p>',

            That must be what "Lynn Rothschild" was referring to when she threatened a guy on 4 or 8 chan with.  She (if it was actually her) threatened him that he would watch his child die of thirst and be helpless to help and then he would die of thirst.   That's not a quote but the gist of it.

            I always wondered who was behind the Doctors Without Borders group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, they currently 'rescue' refugees near the Libyan coast (Libya is a mess now, thanks, HRC) and ship them to Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            They've been accused of human trafficking, using their 'rescue' mission as a shield to hide their operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, they'll wait very close to the Libyan border, and traffickers will bring the refugees to the DWB ship in small boats.

            So they had doctors over there with "no borders" and the Haitan children were sent over here to  "Beyond borders".  I wonder where they could be now..

              Remember right before Martin Shkreli lost his bail arrangement and went back to jail to await his trial-- he claimed to have purchased Hillary's DNA and other evidence that he said would put her away? And how he said he went to Trump's organization with the evidence and was assured by them of his safety? And then remember how nothing more was said by him? I'd say he qualifies as a pharma-aire of some kind whether it's million or multi-million.
             </p>
             <p>
              A lot of coincidences and moving pieces. And DNA evidence.

               Cholera can be taken out by any antibiotic that can kill gram negative bacteria. Not known for its high rate of aquiring antibiotic resistances IIRC. Just like Yersinia pestis, the pathogen responsible for plague.

               That drug is unnessecary thus probably bogus.

            ASTRONOMICAL PROFIT IN BLACK MARKET ORGANS

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Organ trafficking and transplantation pose new challenges
The international trade in human organs is on the increase fuelled by growing demand as well as unscrupulous traffickers. The rising trend has prompted a serious reappraisal of current legislation, while WHO has called for more protection for the most vulnerable people who might be tempted to sell a kidney for as little as US$ 1000.

            There are other products that are made from, and uses for, the fetuses of the minors caught in the sex trafficking business which we can explore in a later submission. The fetuses of trafficked minor children have many valuable uses for the traffickers of children.

            According to the World Health Organization, the going price for the seller/Donor of a kidney is around $5,000. The broker who purchases the kidney from the Donor/seller then goes on to sell it to wealthy transplant patients for an average price between $100,000 to $200,000.

            THE MOST LUCRATIVE IS ORGAN HARVESTING BECAUSE IN FOUR HOURS ONE BODY CAN MAKE BETWEEN 1 AND 5 MILLION DOLLARS. SEX SLAVERY DOES NOT EVEN COMPETE WITH ORGAN HARVESTING, NOT AT ALL.

            This is how deep the organ harvesting rabbit hole goes and this is happening in plain site. Just imagine what they DO IN SECRET??? According to this doctor patients are being declared "brain dead", then suffocated, and then their organs are being stolen.
            <strong>
             According to this doctor EACH BODY is worth between 1 MILLION AND 5 MILLION DOLLARS to the organ harvesting industry.

             Organ harvesting is the perfect termination point for an end-of-life child prostitute.  They no longer interest the clientele sexually, but they can still serve the clientele by extending their life.  Plus there's no estranged adult running around spilling the story to everyone.
