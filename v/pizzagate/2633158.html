             Knew he was black before I clicked onto the article! The larger city I live outside of has lots of problems with black men from out of state trafficking young white girls they call "snow bunnies" for prostitution.

            How is it that these pimps are getting out of jail so quick? Why are the penalties for pimping so lenient and the case for pimping so hard? If a judge and jury find you guilty of pimping with the way the law is written currently on what the state has to prove you should be doing life.  You are destroying lives. And have proved you have no regard for human life yourself. So that’s it you are out of the pool.

            Thank you for posting this.

            From the YouTube source I saw this was filmed in Oklahoma City.  I don't know anything about OKC, but I looked up what Fritz Springmeier wrote about Oklahoma in his book listing ritual sites:

             <strong>
              The various Indian tribes that populate Oklahoma have made the state an occult and Satanic center. The Satanic hierarchy has interbred important European bloodlines with Indian occult bloodlines – for instance, so that there are Rothschild descendants with Cherokee blood.
             </strong>
             Other hierarchy bloodlines are also in the state.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The wickedness of the state
             </strong>
             seems to spill over into Kansas. Two cities In Kansas across the border from Oklahoma that have witchcraft activity are Liberal and Parsons, Kansas. I suspect that these towns may have picked up their wickedness by their close proximity to Oklahoma.

               <strong>
                Muskogee
               </strong>
               is an area of heavy Satanic coven activity.  Many of the Wheelers who are Satanists live in this area. See the last newsletter in its article on the Freemans for previous information on this Satanic bloodline.

                Oklahoma City is the site of the Abbey, where Satanic practices, Enochian magic, Sexual magic etc. are
taught to new neophytes.
               </strong>
               The name of the Abbey is reminiscent of the Abbey [that] Aleister Crowley created, and perhaps that is where the idea for the place's name came from.
               <strong>
                Oklahoma City, like Tulsa, except on a smaller scale is a city run by Satanism.
               </strong>

               <strong>
                In Seminole County and Garvin County I believe are places where some of the Satanic section houses are located.
               </strong>
               These section houses are placed in remote areas in the country where no one will or even can visit.  A section house may have in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 families living communally.
               <strong>
                Certain women serve as breeders, and most of the child sacrifices come from the section houses themselves.
               </strong>
               Children growing up in such environments are totally removed from a normal life and grow up under the worst type of abuse and generally totally under bondage to the group.  Police in these areas are infiltrated with Satanists so that it is not likely anything will happen to rock the boat with these remote Satanic communities. Rituals are held on Fridays and Saturdays at the Section houses, but occult activity goes on constantly. Some of the members of the section houses work in towns, and
               <strong>
                have very respectable positions as lawyers, doctors, etc.
               </strong>

                Spiro Mounds
               </strong>
               is a site that Witches claim has a great deal of spiritual energy. The site was an ancient Indian city and has mounds — like little pyramids throughout the site.  The Choctaw Indians and their black slaves who discovered the site around 1800 considered the ground a powerful occult energy source. Local blacks hired for archaeological digs have shown a great deal of fear about what they do at the site.  Craig Mound is the central feature of the site, and is said to have great power, ghosts, auras etc.

                Tulsa,
               </strong>
               this city has several hierarchy groups, which when they all join are also called "a coven".  There are many other Satanic and wicca groups in the city also.  Tulsa is the area of some important hierarchy properties.  They have their own secure houses, within which they have a library etc. The importance, of Tulsa to the Satanic hierarchy was mentioned, but some more of the details about that include an underground Flying Saucer base near Tulsa, and that Tulsa is the headquarters for the Sisters of Light. Another secret UFO base is south of Tulsa at Ada, OK.

            Sadly they often will prosecute the women before they do the pimps because its harder to catch the pimps doing a crime. I think its been cleaned up a bit since 2014 but its been a while since I've been to that area.

             I was thinking the same thing. There is a complete absence of justice and order and if the police are not willing to do their job, citizens need to step in and begin executing this vermin.

            Good god this is maddening. These pimps are beyond evil. These girls need serious help to get away from these predators. Obviously cops have been paid off (chief of police giving orders not to bother) to look the other way as it’s so obvious what’s going on. Most of those girls look like teens. Wonder how many of them are from the foster system?

              I can't view the video right now but several questions come to mind. 1 is it easy to identify which agency they are a part of? 2 same thing for their (the cops) location: city/town, and street corners? 3 if first two can be answered is there any way for internal affairs or a similar agency down there be informed assuming they're clean?

              Good eye! They're probably boosted vehicles. All the pimps are black, so they want to keep all their merch that's for sale within eye shot.

              In my area, suddenly there's a whole lot of yard signs popping up along the roadside that simply say "Single?" with a phone number.
