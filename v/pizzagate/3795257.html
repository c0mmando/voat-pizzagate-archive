            What makes me smile is when I put some mayo on my finger and shove it in the rectum of a child. Love french kissing little girls and feeling their tiny tongues on my cock as I blow a WAD in their little mouths! Then we get CANDY!! Jesus is LORD he is OUR LAMB!

            I wonder what is driving the new wave of interest, both for and against. I don't see it as being a lockdown thing, but where it's coming from I have no idea. Any guesses?

             I think people are spending a lot more time online, and getting on social media, getting exposed to topics like trafficking, population control, vaccines, deep state shennanigans, Epstein, etc. and becoming curious. I've put up thousands of tweets under the #pizzagate and #PizzagateIsReal hashtags, so anyone who browses those hashtags long enough will eventually find their way here. I also drop links to our research in #QAnon related threads by the big name Q researchers all the time.

              I am loving the fact I am fucking my stepdaughter's TIGHT 14 year old PUSSY as my WIFE is a ESSENTIAL NURSE. SHE IS SO TIGHT and man you should see her buck those HIPS. I am coming all over her tits that are almost C cups that need no bra. She climbed on me the first time as I am on the phone with "Mommy" asking her to pick up Taco-Bell. I made Sharon CUM while on the phone with her MOM. How hot is this. GOD I hope more people (esp NIGGERS) die of this virus so I can keep FUCKING AND SUCKING!!!!!

            Gen. Flynn has a list of high level pedophiles the release of which will devastate the Deep State dons.

            I hope, sincerely hope,that list is leaked or mass distributed to alt-media. B\c you know MSM ain't worth a damn. I hope he takes a flamethrower to the Pedo's who operate and those that leverage for blackmail , i.e. CIA asshats et al.

            They planned it out in advance, and had to change strategies to outright ban and censor when it didn’t work exactly as they designed.

            @ababcb figured it out pretty easily. Look back a week ago in the Banned users list and you will notice a trend. They couldn’t make it too obvious for anyone, so they flooded the subverse with spam in an attempt to associate The Truth with other “known spammers”.

           <p>
            Then suddenly as they decided to Ban and Censor anything related to Racine, the forum was slid with sudden spam attacks.

            It smells like Srayzie is still here running operations. Why did Srayzie blackmail members of Voat and attack others accusing them of “sock puppet” accounts when it was proven she had created so many of her own? Is anyone dumb enough to actually believe she ever “left” Voat?
