<p>..The highly suspicious nature of Epstein’s financial activities has already prompted two of Epstein’s longtime lawyers, <strong>Darren Indyke and Jeffrey Schantz</strong>, to hire their own criminal defense attorneys, according to the Times report, which noted that documents show that the pair were “involved with some of his trusts and other entities in New York and in the Virgin Islands.”</p>

            I don’t know how to make a post about this so I will put it here. A friend of mine who just wrote her third book about RFK assassination said the daily beast is reporting Michael Baden was the medical examiner for Epstein. He’s the same guy who created a bunch of inconsistencies during JFK’s assassination.

            Team Epstein has engaged noted pathologist Dr. Michael Baden to conduct an independent autopsy. Wait for it. Baden will declare that the same magic bullet that Oswald fired and that killed JFK went into orbit. It has been, all these years travelling in a path around the sun, and (what a coincidence) came back to earth to strike down poor Jeffrey while all his guards were asleep (like the guards at Jesus's tomb). Baden was just out of med school when he autopsied JFK? At the time of the OJ trial there were many jokes that he was the official government go-to coverer-upper pathologist.

            Knowing how these things work, there were almost certainly some deaths of victims. Either accidental overdoses, medical injuries, intentional murders to get rid of witnesses or sacrifices. In England a prime minister, Heath, would pick up children at an orphanage on the island of Jersey, take them on his yacht and they'd never be seen again. Who carried out this duty for Epstein?

            Meanwhile, over at the UK Daily Mail a headline; "Will Ghislaine Maxwell spill Jeffrey Epstein's secrets to the FBI? Rumors begin to swirl that the British socialite..." They persist in calling her a "socialite" some sort of semi-respectable woman serving cocktails graciously, as does almost all of the propaganda media. A few call her Epstein's pimp or procurer. None use the terms ho, madame, kidnapper, international child trafficker or other vile and more appropriate names. Are they setting her up for a month's community service or two month's house arrest in Buckingham Palace?

             The British are totally in thrall to the idea of celebrity and the class system.. thanks to Tavistock.  I read the Daily Mail to study the processes of mind control propaganda on a population.

            <p>
             A New York Daily News article from the time, headlined “Lawyer Pays Not A Cent For Palatial East Side Digs,” said Fisher had stopped paying rent after learning that the State Department had terminated Epstein’s lease as a result of the conflict over Fisher’s subtenancy, and was thus living in the home for free.

            Sounds  like someone got paid in something other than money to avoid a paper trail.  Thus Fisher fuck has no morals and will do anything for a dollar,  probably did a bunch of shit for Epstein and got paid in free rent for at least two years,  which would total $440,000.
