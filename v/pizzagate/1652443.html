<p>&quot;Character attacks against me won\'t slow my coverage of Pizzagate, nice try. They haven\'t so far, and they won\'t, ever.</p>
<p>Most members of the community are savvy enough to spot an opposition research style character attack when they spot one, which is what that is. I\'ve already addressed those claims in numerous videos, and won\'t be too detailed here as I don\'t want to repeat myself:</p>
<p>1) I am not promoting Pizzagate or information related to it to sell an out of print Internet marketing textbook I wrote eight years ago. That doesn\'t make a lot of sense and fails Occam\'s razor test.</p>
<p>2) My Wikipedia page containing my list of prior outlets and work I\'ve helped break was deleted during this ordeal. It doesn\'t make me any less of a real journalist. The &quot;stunt&quot; I orchestrated while an intern at Gawker Media, now defunct, was approved enthusiastically by their video editor at the time. My &quot;boss&quot; at Jezebel, an internship I was no longer showing up for because I considered it a joke, became angry as she thought I was carrying out publicity stunts without her permission, when I had simply gone over her head. She published a second, friendlier piece on me after I met up with her and she saw the whole picture.</p>
<p>3) My choice to cover Pizzagate remains mine alone. It seemed newsworthy, it seemed in the public interest, and I don\'t like the idea of elites getting away with child torture and endangerment. It\'s not the first time I\'ve raised outsized attention for a cause I thought the media as a whole was not reporting properly, nor was I alone in the effort- as anyone with a brain knows, Pizzagate is a global movement with thousands of people researching it and spreading the word. I threw in what I could, which was a popular YouTube channel and an equally popular Twitter account.</p>
<p>4) My research assistant regularly reads this subreddit and others. I don\'t personally come here usually, as the attacks like that one make my blood boil yet I don\'t want to give them any attention with an individual response. Also, I have a ganglion cyst on my hand which only recently burst, it makes typing more trouble than it\'s worth for me.</p>
<p>Keep up your research, recognize the paid attacks and divide/conquer tactics, and thank you all.</p>

            Ironically, my link of Clinton and AdvaMed was too weak for you but David Seaman endorsing one of the worlds biggest Gold stock companies was a good enough link for you for to tie him with George Soros.  You are so full of shit it is actually amusing.

            Get real, if that MKULTRA sick video of traumatic abuse hurt your soul, you have no business in this investigation. Yes it hurts, now get objective and wipe away the fucking tears. I have had countless victims confide to me. I am censored, and you fucking people praise "David's Seamen" holy shit is this real life? Yep, and all I see are mindless following drones.

            The problem with the majority of you "Investigators" is that you don't question much if the person seems "Nice and genuine" nor do you dig very deep. Again, read my comment. Screaming satanism and lucifer worship with no evidence of such. It is druidic, it is masonic, it is "pagan". A pentacle or a pentagram doesn't equate to satanism. Also, why not make a separate vid for the Gold and bitcoin?
You are a follower, a "sheep" if you blindly support this guy because he's "Nice". He will fuck us all, mark my words.

            If you read Seaman's tweet and examine this whole thing went down, this is all on him.  He seems kind of narcissistic, expecting special treatment.  And posts aren't going to be removed just because they attack David Seaman (that's called censorship).

            Note, this Talmudic Jew prick David Seaman doesn't seem to have a problem with pedophilia, that's covered by the Talmud. "I don't like the idea of elites getting away with child torture and endangerment" - only the torture and endangerment part.

            David Seaman has said things from the beginning which have turned me off of him. His wild claims of "SATANISM" and "DEVIL WORSHIPPERS" are completely ridiculous. My main function on twitter is to help interpret the occult symbols which are so prevalent, and their origins are not fucking satanic. A pentacle is not satanic. MOLOCH worship isn't satanic. You are making us ALL look like loons. Also his refusal to acknowledge my work (this rant is not about my ego) and absolutely ground breaking research at times showed me what the fuck he's all about. Also, his name? Completely masonic. David's Semen. Get it? Davidic bloodline nonsense (Sangreal, Holy Grail garbage) Google "harp of david eliphas levi". This WOULD NOT have been possible without wikileaks" K. Best way to get rid of a whistleblower? Have him leak classified gov. docs. My research, the majority, was done without the aid of fucking wikileaks. NOTHING.
I am working with REAL survivors. You put that poor fucking girl in danger by the way, didn't advise her to protect her identity. What in the world is wrong with you?

            Nothing I said in that post was factually inaccurate.  You can call me and the moderators a shill but you can't change that. I've had two posts categorized as new evidence which is more than you have ever contributed.
            <em>
             You also forgot when you stood up for the Chapman Bros kiddie porn "artwork" and called Hillary Clinton a defender of free speech for wanting the museum that showed it funded by taxpayer money.
            </em>
            Your debunking has been and will always be shit.

There is no leader of this community.. and if there was, it certainly wouldn't be him. I don't know what you think he's contributed and researched, I don't see it. W/e tho

             He's not connected to Soros. He advocates using Goldmoney which Soros is invested it. If you want to boycott everything Soros invests in you'll have to drop Time Warner, Facebook, T Mobile, Intel, and all kinds of other shit in your home.

We all make mistakes. Good on you MF for admitting you did and most importantly correcting and moving forward.

            Well now it's missing the best comment that the original had.
I guess I'll have to copy/paste it:

           </p>
           <p>
            Its not paid attacks. Good try though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is real.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when you go on twitter and act like you're gonna die every week, and that theres ppl out to get you, when all you do is post a couple videos fluffed with nonsense and 10% of research that you took, no one is gonna kill you. You're doing that because ppl are gonna worry, and you'll get more followers. It works. You know it. But you're manipulating people.
           </p>
           <p>
            David is reaching ppl, but he could reach three times the amount if he didn't act like a useful idiot, and his cries of wolf.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point you are a useful idiot, like Alex Jones almost.
           </p>
           <p>
            You literally deleted your twitter account for like 8 hours, reactivated it, then blamed twitter for suspending you. So where's the screenshot of them suspending you for your tweets? (You dont have it, cause it never happened.) You claimed twitter stole your followers. But in reality, when someone deletes their own account, and reactivates, they start at 0 and slowly regain them over the hour. Which happened to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            You constantly spam twitter with findings from "sources" which you cannot name, which are wrong 90% of the time. You even go by 4chan sources which are wrong 90% and tweet it as fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            David, if you're going to appoint yourself as leader of pizzagate, you cannot tweet baseless findings and only use your following to shout things that we already know. All you tweet is "JOHN PODESTA IS PEDOPHILE SATANIST WE WILL HANG YOU." "CLINTON YOU'RE GOING DOWN WE WON."
           </p>
           <p>
            then you tweet stuff like "I'm done reporting on pizzagate." every week, but you literally start again in hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are recruiting ppl on the pizzagate movement who only want to hear emotional cries, and not facts. You need to focus on facts and use your following to educate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tweet research, but factual research. You're making almost 60,000/year on donations and all you do is cry wolf, and say JP is a pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone wants to read seaman's history, and why a lot of us are fed up with this guy,, go here:

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1650713
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not paid.. I've been here researching pizzagate before Seaman gained a following from it. Back when wikileaks released that first batch.
           </p>
           <p>
            This fair criticism of David will be used by David to manipulate his followers that we are paid, and he is the good guy, and that this criticism is unfair. He will use it to create more buzz. He is already doing it look (he literally just posted this min ago and claims his response is being censored. No david upvotes take time and it wont be as high as others if u posted it 6 min ago idiot):
            <a href="https://twitter.com/d_seaman/status/832275263568240640">

           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is real.. but seaman is distracting and playing a useful idiot for views.

             " like Alex Jones almost."  The AJ/Rogan podcast was more epic than Technoviking....David Seaman has a voice and he has used it in a consistent manner to promote PG..even if you don't like him, 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend".

              Okay, I'll look for George Webbs.  Dave seems to be getting emotional and he's rather vehement, but he lost his job and has to be under a lot of stress.  I'm giving him a pass.  I'll be giving George Webb a pass too.  Thanks for the recommendation.  It'll really help catch me up-to-date.

            Why is Seaman all of a sudden the gatekeeper to Pizzagate? There is just something off putting about this. There are many others promoting pizzagate as well. Sorry, but hard to respect someone playing the victim all the time. Stick to credible journalism and away from the off the wall theories. (I don't consider him disinfo, he's just been plain reckless). Also, I am not dismissing what he has been through, but he needs to keep his head in the game.

             He's not any such thing.  He is one of several people doing daily video broadcasting of Pizzagate.  His are less boring than some but he has a new vid every day or so.  Even if you don't "respect" his work, he has red pilled a lot of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been hard on the case since the summer FBIAnon threads so I rarely watch any videos...just lurk aroun voat, 8ch and 4 chan for several hours every day.  People who don't do that..,find vids helpful
            </p>
            <p>
             Newcomers find everything so shocking, they don't bother to see if it is already discovered so there are often multiple thread Of same stuff.  David's shit helps inform those people.

            We need to stop lending an ear to these the "Divide and Conquer" tactics. How did "exposing" Seaman serve to add credibility or help the overall pizzagate investigation?

            David I am a loyal fan because you took our suspicions SERIOUSLY, unlike 99.99% of reporters out there. We must ALL persist no matter what the media mouthpieces say about us as the PG investigative community.

            I use logic and common sense. I have always defended David. Something I cannot say about Alex Jones. But whe someone posted Alex inerview with Rogan, talking about pizzagate, I had only positive things to say. Now is not the time to divide - Soros has done that already, let's not aid him further. Go after the monsters who torture and rape children, they are the enemy, not David who tries to expose them.

            Oh fuck Mods here. Can't be bothered to analyze your fucked up reasons(paranoid,  jealous, alphabet cunts) but Seaman, as fucked up as he might be is the best thing we have in some ways yet ya wanna destroy that??? Are you that fucking stupid?? I was pissed at him for not talking to a SRA victim, then, he did(not her but someone). I don't give a crap if I am banned form here but dickhead shills are wrecking this. Concentrate on the task at hand, exposing pizzagate and child trafficking otherwise fuck off! Oh and by the way, armyseer, fuck you!! You put me on some shill list, FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!!! Do not trust this phony fake armyseer.

            Even for the most synical, who the hell cares if his actions are what we want journalists to do, regardless if he has ulterior motives he's massively spreading awareness of pizzagate and lobbying to get pedophiles arrested.

            is only human and has put in a lot of work here trying to 'keep face' for this community.  I know he is human because I argued with him many times about him being a bot or AI or Stratfor or Dyncorp or CIA. He is not just demands the best of this community.  I do think David Seaman was feeling the wrath of the M_F's almost over reaching demand for integrity and was a bit corybantic with his response.  Many

            contributors have probably felt this way about threads being deleted, sometimes justifiably.  There have been instances of victims who try to come here for refuge and get 'pissed on' by the community during 'extreme vetting'.  I guess the best thing we can all do is work harder provide more sound evidence so those with lots of $ and questionable ethics get the chance to have 'all' the evidence presented against them in trial.

            I like the exposure pizzagate gets through Mr Seaman but maybe less drama and a thicker skin would make him seem more grown up.

            David is doing more good than bad. He is a journalist ,and has a right just like any of us to make video's or try and create business however he wishes. He doesn't owe it to us to dedicate his life to Pizzagate. And I would be gutted if he decided not too . 
How much publicity do you think we would get without him talking about it?
Keep going David , do what you do . As long as the guy keeps reporting and getting the message out , that diligent researchers behind the scenes have uncovered ,thats fine by me . If he was claiming it was all his research ,then I would have a problem .
He is a damn sight more useful than 100's of little You tube channels that reach 1000 or so views . Not to say that the small channels are not respected . Just have to recognise that the guy has a more mainstream following , which is what is needed . We don't need to keep  preaching to the ones who are already clued up . Plus the fact ,the guy needs to cover other things to stop the crowd being switched off by hearing Pizzagate vids all the time . The more subjects he can cover that reach other audiences the more chance of teaching them about Pizzagate

            Why are we wasting time on this? I could care a crap about this guys hurt feelings.  Who cares? He is not the victim here.  Get over yourself.  This isn't about you or any of us.    If I somehow could find a way to save these children or even one child I wouldn't give a crap about being recognized for it or care if anyone knew I was involved.   This isn't about becoming some frickin' pizzagate celebrity.

            To the shills and petty arm chair quarterbacks...Don't muzzle the ox!  David has put a ton on the line here being as aggressive as he is against the pedo-monsters.  Let him do his thing, and if you disagree or don't like it...tune out.  David's work on this subject has had a major effect mainstreaming the topic so get off your high horses already and do you own research and Vlogging.

            Even of somehow, allllll of the coincidences are wrong, and there is not a huge pedophile ring running the world, which I truly believe there is... the worst thing that will come out of this is a lot of children will be saved because suddenly so many more of us are totally aware of this issue.  I'm look out for it everywhere.  We will stop these fuckers.... whoever the hell they are, their time is coming to end.  More and more people eveyday looking at pizzagate.  Just how this sub has grown in the last two weeks makes me so happy.

             It doesn't erase the facts, though, and that is that we have some signs of serious bias against him by the mods. People aren't going to see Voat the same, regardless.

            Great. I'll consider this the first step.

           <p>
            Now, can we do something like a montage with timestamps where you're documented as having deleted posts where we can match that with the times Seaman's posts showed up?

            It sucks you have to hold people's hand through this, but when people talk about how technically illiterate the average US citizen is, they aren't exactly joking. Work a held desk job, I assure you that my point will be proven on the first day.

            's point, though. It sucks that this has come up, but the mods need to continue to be honest with us, need to be willing to go out of their way to prove themselves when the need arises, and need to be

           <p>
            I know I'm annoying a lot of you guys, but this whole scandal with Seaman is most likely to happen again. Even if I have to take the hit this first time, proving to you how important this type of dedicated transparency is will really set the ground work for how

            Y'all need to cut the DS some slack.  How many of you have the balls to put your name and face on YouTube and call out some of the most powerful on this planet as being Satanic child-eating pedophiles?
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end of the day, it's the only thing that matters - public awareness.  There is a theory that it only takes 10% of a populace to believe in a theory in order for it to take root in the culture.  We need that to happen.  And it is, just not fast enough for most of us.  As they say, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
           </p>
           <p>
            DS isn't some magic seer who can predict what is going to happen to the second.  He deals in open source intelligence (OSINT) as well as human intelligence (HUMINT).  It is not, I repeat NOT, an exact science.  You never get it right every time.  But most of the time, no one knows.  DS has to put his meat up on the table.
           </p>
           <p>
            And regardless of his motives, he willingly put a target on his back.  And that is no fun to live under.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep up the good work DS and I hope to buy you a Yuengling some day.

            I don't know if he genuinely cares . He likes making things all about him though. He makes the pizzagate community look unstable. I actually never said anything remotely negative about him but his last bullshit claim about "high profile arrest" was the last straw for me.
I think we should stop making threads about this guy and focus on more important issues. I feel like this is a distraction.

            Imho, David's continual defensiveness and paranoia is excessive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I stopped following him awhile ago when his solid and relevant 45 min videos morphed into 5 minutes simply mentioning Pizzagate followed by 40 minutes rants about who he is, who he isn't, what he's accomplished, what's he's done, ad nauseum.  That's pretty much all it is.  The 5 minutes he does spend on PG is info from here and/or from the chans.  His guest, yesterday, was someone who appeared on the scene quite early and, in my mind was "debunked". It doesn't mean that her contribution is also not valuable in some way but it's old news.
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems desperate and paranoid and may very well struggle with some type of mental illness, as do I. I see a lot of myself  - when not well-medicated --in him. My heart breaks for him but I've had to move on.
           </p>
           <p>
            He made a significant contribution at the beginning by rallying people to the cause. That can never be diminished or taken away from him.  But he has gone off the rails. There could be many reasons why but, to me, he seems unhinged.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesn't mean that I necessarily think that he's a detriment to the movement, I think it has passed him by.  He has many supporters and followers, which is a good thing because I think it grounds him to some extent.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the future, he may become a true researcher. If so, I will follow him again.

            since when does a mod repost as a measure of good faith even though the same mod shows the very rule that it broke. I've seen many other posts that have been deleted within minutes and they were 'hard-hitting'

            I have seen all this drama unfold and have to say this was a very fair move from Millennial Falcon and I am convinced shit just went wrong on both sides and nothing about it was intentional.

            He hasnt presented any research. No journalistic integrity. A cretin out for publicity. Hes super wishywashy in his stance towards Trump. Kid is really starting to get on my nerves. I wanted to like him, too. Theres just no actual tangible delivery of information going on there. His 140k subscribers seem to really like hearing him say jon podesta is a pedo, as if we all dont already realize this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like a concentrated effort to pimp this character out, but its not like he actually offers anything and his base hasnt grown all that much in a while. Somethings askew
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: he literally scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Mandela effect, flat earth, aliens in antarctica. Is pizzagate just more crazy bullshit to him? Is he REALLY on our side?

            I proudly support David Seaman's work in getting more attention on this investigation. He does not hide in anonymity like so many of us take for granted. Put the importance of putting these pedos away above your own ego issues.

            If the shilling for Gold stuff that if he isnt getting money from it he should just stop it would look better.

             Well its mainly the fact he has lied about arrests multiple times and he keeps telling people he's going to be assassinated which makes him look crazy which in turn makes pizzagaters look crazy because he's the most popular pizzagater

            So it's all about David Seaman once again. Not the kids, not the pedo power structure or plain ol' research, just sickening kikeface Seaman leeching off other's work and suffering.

           <p>
            You do nothing whatsoever to further the investigation. You only whine and bitch about yourself without ever getting your hands dirty with journalistic work, and you muddy the waters with your Alex Jones type tripe.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are a fraud, a charlatan and a pizzagate profiteer. I for one hope you die a painful death along with the rest of them.

            Hi David -
           </p>
           <p>
            Basic well wisher here.   However, I've got to say that unless you really up the level of material you present, even well wishers like me are just going to tune out.  Your research assistant should PM me and I will provide  research leads and materials on topics that people are talking about and actually merit a wider public discussion which is your forte.   Look through my comment and submission history it speaks for itself if you have any doubts regarding me.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to start exploring things like:
           </p>
           <p>
            Documented instances of censorship around the investigation of pizzagate.  NOT JUST YOU or your friends on You Tube, but what has happened to hackers and investigators Reddit, Twitter, what is happening on 4chan and here at voat, etc., the Titus Frost stalkings, the Pegasus death threats  These things need exposure to actually keep people safe including yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CPP linked Heavy Breathing videos and website content which show instances of pedo culture linked to CPP.  It is not an innocent pizza shop after all.
           </p>
           <p>
            How international shipping, port ownership and embassy personnel could be playing a role in the wider picture of pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            -the Clinton Foundation and the Laura Silsby bust and prosecution
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a hella lot more topics, these are just three off the top of my head.  You probably have a loyal core audience, but you have seen a recent expansion of your audience.  If you don't start using what investigators have uncovered regarding pizzagate, you are going to lose that expanded audience.   I am willing to help, take me up on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best of luck.
           </p>

             Find it strange that armyseer is so determined to 'expose' Seaman. I like you, you are truthful Viebleu but this voat pizzagate is fucked now. Not stcking up for Seaman but WTF?? How is he harming pizzagate. He needs to expose new shit for sure but he ain't doing us a disservice. Good post by the way. Fuck armyseer, they attacked me for no reason

              Armyseer is king of the shills.  All he ever does is derail conversation and call other people shills, instead of just letting people discuss the merit of ideas and evidence.  If he dislikes David that says more for his credibility than anything.

            I think he is making a very positive impact and people are just sick of his narcissism.   Blowing up on negative criticism ('make my blood boil') and constantly making grand statements against anonymous posters is the sign.  God bless this wacko child man.  If it gets results I'll put up with this shit.  May he find his way.

             I'm glad he's speaking out against the pedos. The more the merrier. I just wish he could focus on Pizzagate and not bring up so many side issues like what people think of him and giving attention to side issues that have nothing to do with Pizzagate. That video about Flat Earth was annoying because prior to that, nobody was talking about flat earth, now I'm sure that 90% of people who look up Pizzagate will see that David has to pick on flat earth as though it's some kind of prominent part of pizzagate research which it never was. I've never seen anyone talk about Flat Earth in a pizzagate video besides him. That is why people think he is a disinfo agent. Also, why doesn't David post his journalism curriculum vitae or republish his own journalism on a blog so people can see his extensive history as a journalist. I don't care what Jezebel (a leftist website named after a demon) says. I only care if he helps our cause.

               I've never seen a flat earth comment on any pizzagate related thread. He put out a video claiming that Flat Earth was being brought up with extreme frequency and that disinfo agents keep bringing the conversation back to flat earth. Then he called flat earth stupid and claimed no reasonable person could disagree. I don't give a crap what anyone believes about Flat Earth, and I've never seen any comments on the topic prior to his video, so I couldn't even imagine WHAT he was talking about. SO it put me on alert as to his intentions. I know we don't all trust each other on here, as we shouldn't. I think that Pizzagate research needs to continue no matter what, and we shouldn't get caught up in who is promoting us or attacking us as this is not about us. This is about how we can rescue these innocent children and stop the evils of our elites in the shadow government from getting away with this ever again.

                He got swarmed on twitter by FE cultists and he responded when he should have ignored/blocked them. Also the title of that vid re: FE could have been more explicit as to his opinion. As it is it just has FE in the title along with a few other new age buzzwords so it's no wonder so many thought he was going off track.
               </p>
               <p>
                But he should never have bothered to make that video. The FE people are connected to Cult of Siduri and they're obsessive and tend to swarm when they're noticed.

                If David's friend is reading this, please tell him to ignore trolls. Reactions and responses like his please them and cause them to stick around for more of the same. Be a fucking professional and don't respond to every twitter taunt or troll army. And keep the new age crap on a separate channel ffs, why does he even have to be told that. He's a bit oblivious so maybe his friend can explain this to him.

                Yes, I've followed your comments and I like your thinking. Flat earth topic is huge on the internet right now and there are two factions. They both vie for attention. So I think they were chiefly just using David as a platform to get their theory out. And they then turned into a real headache for David, and threw him off his game.

                  Some of his you tube clips were being hit w/ lots of flat earth comments, that's what made him so mad, and made him mention them. (You wouldn't have known it unless you looked at the comments, which I did.) They were kind of driving him crazy. He thought he was being trolled hard by 'opposition' to pizzagate, but most of them meant no harm, just were trying to get publicity, and also probably hoping to get David 'on board.'

            We all have to come together. David Seaman has done tremendous work in exposing Pizzagate. He's been very vocal about it since the beginning. We are on the same team. There are people who call him a disinfo agent, this is non sense. Recently he gave an interview to a sex trafficking survivor called Beckie Percy. This is awesome. We have a journalist on our side, people should welcome him HERE on the PG subverse instead of attacking him. This guy is on our side and can really help us in this investigation.

             David has 150 000 subscribers, he has no need to cover a subject that can potentially put him in harms way. Look what they did to Michael Flynn. Who is brave enough to cover it. Not Megyn Kelly, or Bill O'Reilly, or Alex Jones himself!

             I just hope he doesn't "turn" on the investigation at a later point in time. I'm not calling him out as a disinfo agent, however, this is a tactic used by them that is exremely damaging. Only time will tell. I don't think we should make him out to be the spokesman of PG though. That would be giving him too much power over it and it could end up being very harmful to the investigation. I'd say put him on a watch's list, only because I've recently learned that George Soros is an investor and big backer of the GoldCoin business and David's been pushing it very hard lately. I'm still subscribed to his channel, but a little bell is ringing nonetheless.

             He's still a histrionic retard who makes pizzagate researchers look crazy. He didn't address any of the major points in the recent post against him. Go read it if you haven't already.

             Good job, keep up the good work. You're not technically a "pizzagate researcher", more an ambassador, a vulgarizer, a democratizer. That's alright, we need those (badly). Producers still usually don't like advertisers, they feel they earn undue glory. That's alright too.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I kindly may, some quick advice: 1) stop referring to people following you as your "fans", 2) stop talking about yourself in your videos, 3) stop getting offended for what people you don't know have to say about you, and 4) you don't need that ad/announcement at the end of the videos, it's very annoying - if you want to include the woman include her really.

             I used to go to his yt page for pizzagate news too but recently he's been acting so weird. Claiming there are police cars outside his house , implying he has been "poisoned" , "high profile" arrests happening soon bullshit. He also has no research of his own even though hes a journalist. He  looks like an attention whore unfortunately.

              Journalists have died exposing this, breitbart, Monica Peterson, many witnesses and investigators during the franklin cover up. Don't make light of threats on anyone's life here this is dangerous to expose.

             I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until this week, but he threw his own credibility out the window and stomped all over it.  Now I think he's mentally ill.

              Mentally ill? That's rude. The man has been under intense stress for awhile now. He lost his job at the huffington post, saw his wikipedia entry deleted... and dedicated 100% of himself to the most dangerous topic for a public figure: Pizzagate. Ben Swann had to delete all his social accounts for reporting about it just once. Seaman is the only public figure that speak loudly about Pizzagate at the moment. We cannot afford to lose him.

               Yes, and all of that incredible stress has mad him come unglued.  I have nothing against the guy, but he's a fringe whacko who nuked his own credibility and he shouldn't be taken seriously.  I'm not saying that to deter anybody from investigating pizzagate, but rather to get them to go to reliable sources so we all don't look like crazies.

               I have some issues with the way this sub is being moderated. It seems lots of stuff gets deleted, like this post. You are wrong about the threads being permanently deleted though, you just can't search them past 8 days. Everything is still on voat, we just have to notice the good deleted threads before 8 days pass. Here is an example of a thread that I created to initiate a rule change, it's 24 days old and still here.

                I am sure most of the mods are decent people and they just have either a different opinion to others as to what this sub should be for and which posts should remain prominent (it's meant to be for investigating, sharing information, leads, evidence etc) or maybe sometimes they make mistakes, like with this post, but I really think it's not fair that people call us shills all the time! The mods are changing all the time too, people who do dodgy things, like the mod who deleted TONS of great submissions, get kicked out. I know I am really really against the pedo-creatures and want nothing more than for people to discover evidence and get it out there to the public. I don't see why they would let me be a mod if they are all trying to put PG back in the box. From what I've seen of the way things are discussed and thought about, they are trying to do a tough job that can't possibly make everyone happy, but they really try. Maybe there are one or two who are bad, but if there are I've not had any interaction with them. I wish people wouldn't jump to the conclusion 'they're all evil and out to get us' right away, what about giving people the benefit of the doubt? We'll never get anywhere if everyone's thinking everyone else is a fraud. :-(

                 Fair enough, maybe I shouldn't be lumping all the mods together. I'm sure you're right and some of you are great people who are against this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My real beef isn't with the mods anyway, it's with the rules that don't allow people to say "hey, I think I might have a lead", then let the community decide, like the other thread we talked in. Right now we have a very small minority deciding for the community what's important and what isn't. The rules are too tight, it's like the government telling it's citizen we don't trust you to make good decisions,  so well make them for you. You guys should let 1 of each topic go through, if it's bullshit it will get debunked. The you can flair it and refer all the spammers of the same shit to that thread. Investigations involve dead leads, they always will.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In other words, I don't do well with rules enforced my an "elite" group of nobodys. I say elite because mods are selected in secret, not by the community.

             If you can somehow link it to child sex trafficking/abuse, feel free to post it.  Otherwise, maybe make a new subverse about the topic of U.S. politicians with ties to terrorism, or a general "Clinton scandals" sub.  We need to avoid "conspiracy bloat" here and stay focused on what this sub is about.  We had a stickied discussion post up for over a week so the community could define what the sub is about, and this is what we came up with:

              I agree with you in some perspectives but the problem is narrowing to much the content. When you narrow you can't establish solid connections. The part "conspiracy" regarding Abedin make me laugh! You have a crush for her?

               But  now I can see why there is so much spam...its to make the removed submissions disappear forever from site since it only took 8 days of deletions to remove posts.  It would only take one day if there was enough manufactured spam to hide removed posts.

                Yes! The posts are still online, but you need the exact URL to see them. The purpose of the modlog is to have a list to go through, so the mods will say "the posts aren't gone!" but they really are, because if they're not on a list, they're effectively lost.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, the mods want to solve the problem by using that archive site, but that site's been known to go down/lose certain things

              Looking around on the forum, the kerfuffle has barely caused a ripple.  The community is strong and the majority of the serious researchers not too phased by Operation Dissent.  Carry on :)  We're good to go.

               Nice one, fuck these cunts that call themselves Mod's. FUCK OFF!! Stop pissing on pizzagate you fucking huge cunts. As long as Seaman isn't a pedophile or a Soros puppet(prove it you cunts) let him be. He was a dick to someone I met here, yes, but maybe he is paranoid, is that so strange?? Most Mods here are fucking paranoid. You can't stop our movement, our care for the children. Fuck off

              I dont really give a fuck about him. I am the guy who brought Dyncorp to light and the first person going against david seaman! But I agree that Falcon should be banned from the mod team.

               I've watched Seaman's videos for a week or two and he seems legit to me. What proof is there to the contrary?

                Yes and no, good because the support base and bad because he is trying to build is own channel. Exploiting the delicate situation, this is why I have left my research on pizzagate, many troubles with the mods.
