<p>&quot;The \'pizza connection\'</p>
<p>Before the prosecution of the New York Mafia leaders, Giuliani took part in a case known as the &quot;pizza connection,&quot; which involved an international heroin ring housed in U.S. pizza shops in New York and other cities. In April 1984, federal agents arrested 31 suspects charged with smuggling at least 330 pounds of heroin worth $1.65 billion into the United States over the course of five years.</p>
<p>Although the case was prosecuted in New York, evidence and witnesses were scattered across the world. The heroin came from Afghanistan. The Sicilian Mafia led the operation, and the top suspect, Gaetano Badalamenti, was arrested in Madrid.</p>
<p>Giuliani offered protection to Italian witnesses, and his cooperation with Italian authorities yielded a breakthrough later that year: Law enforcement officials uncovered an arm of the Sicilian Mafia operating in the U.S. independently of American organized crime.</p>
<p>The pizza connection trial stretched on for 17 months, which was at the time the longest criminal trial in federal court in history. Freeh secured 18 convictions with one acquittal.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General William French Smith called the pizza connection &quot;the single most devastating assault on the Mafia in its entire history,&quot; according to news accounts.</p>
<p>But Blakey said Giuliani\'s best move against the Mafia was still to come.</p>
<p>&quot;The pizza connection is retail,&quot; he said. &quot;The commission is wholesale.&quot;</p>
<p>Like the pizza connection, the roots of the commission case existed before Giuliani took office. Ronald Goldstock, head of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, met with Giuliani soon after he took office to tell him about recordings he\'d collecting from a bugging device installed in a reputed mobster\'s car, according to Barrett, author of the Giuliani biography. Goldstock, who declined to be interviewed for this story, told Giuliani that the mobster referred to a Mafia &quot;commission.&quot; The FBI had also planted a bug in the home of Paul Castellano, who ran the commission, according to Barrett.&quot;</p>',

            I would agree that drugs are very much in play in Pizzagate.  Children are often drugged for transport and other purposes.  Also if you are running a brownstone out of Comet as has been speculated, some resistant politicos would need to party before either passing out or committing a pedo act.
