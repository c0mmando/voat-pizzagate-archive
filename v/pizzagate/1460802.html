<p>So I went to the twitter of Jorge Puello Torres.
Jorge has 5 followers. So I looked into one of them which was <a href="https://voat.co/user/Casamiafs">@Casamiafs</a> a restaurant in the Dominican Republic right near where Laura Silbsy was planning on opening her &quot;orphanage&quot; in the Dominican Republic.
I then looked into 1 of the 40 people <a href="https://voat.co/user/casamiafs">@casamiafs</a> follows. I found <a href="https://voat.co/user/jgpichardoc5">@jgpichardoc5</a> and decided to research him since he\'s from the DR and perhaps he knows Jorge Puello Torres who was Laura Silsby\'s &quot;lawyer&quot; who was involved in sex trafficking in El Salvador and trafficking in Canada. He also worked undercover for the government of the US and I believe Canada as well. Now who randomly will take on Laura Silsby\'s case for FREE especially when they aren\'t really a lawyer? I repeat he was NOT a lawyer! On top of that why would the parents of the 10 convicted of kidnapping Haitian kids who were NOT orphans want to be represented by a sex trafficker and all the other problems 
Jorge Torres Puello has?</p>
<p>Inside job? I mean he did work undercover work for the govt at one point and Clinton helped get them free as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WaStateGov/posts/10154672428814063">https://www.facebook.com/WaStateGov/posts/10154672428814063</a> (Everyone should read his posts without harassing him. His english isn\'t great and he is very redundant but hes been talking about high up politicians for the last 2 or 3 years which I found very interesting. He even asks Bilderberg group to help him)</p>
<p>So I google Jonathan Pichardo and find his Facebook above. Supposedly, he has lots of family in the US and DR government. I see he checked into Washington DC and read a lot of his posts which he constantly talks about politicians and asks to keep certain politicians safe when they come to the DR or when his family is in the US.</p>
<p>One post I quoted from his FB</p>
<p>&quot;I want cia director working on this I get inform thath something bad happen to mr ron DON’T TOUCH DON’T TOUCH MR RON MY EX SALVATION ARMY BOSS&quot;</p>
<p>So I looked up his ex boss Major Ron Bursoe from the salvation army. <a href="http://www.multivu.com/assets/63223/documents/63223-Major-Ron-Busroe-Bio-original.pdf">http://www.multivu.com/assets/63223/documents/63223-Major-Ron-Busroe-Bio-original.pdf</a> (Was the the second link to show up. I WILL COME BACK TO THIS LINK)</p>
<p>&quot;Busroe was the director of the Haiti Recovery and Development Office. While in Haiti, Busroe coordinated a team of seven Salvation Army officers and directed all post earthquake recovery and development initiatives. He had previously served in Haiti and used his experiences there to ensure that all recovery efforts incorporated both the needs of the community and the mission of The Salvation Army. &quot;</p>
<p>Now lets rewind to my post last week...</p>
<p>Is this Jorge Puello Torres? The fake lawyer who was a sex trafficker that helped Laura Silsby...
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/george.detorres1">https://www.facebook.com/george.detorres1</a> Here is his Facebook (Joined 2012 which is 2 years after the whole Haiti situation) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedetorres">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedetorres</a> Here is his LinkedIn. When you go to Laura Silsby on LinkedIn this guy shows up in &quot;People also viewed&quot;</p>
<p>Do these people look similar?</p>
<p>George De Torres Facebook pictures and pictures on google of Jorge Puello Torres. Picture him with a shaved beard and 3 years later.</p>
<p>Do these names not look very similar?</p>
<p>Gerorge DeTorres and Jorge Puello Torres</p>
<p>Keep in mind he is known to fake many documents and goes by a million different names so it wouldn\'t be a surprise for him to switch his name especially since he used to work undercover for the govt...CIA? I don\'t know but I can\'t rule that out.</p>
<p>Now what gets weird is where did George De Torres work?</p>
<p>MUTLIVU, PR NEWSWIRE! Which I find extremely odd this news wire that I never seen in my life had news at the top of my google search when I looked up John Pichardo\'s ex boss Major Ron Bursoe. Also, Ron Bursoe was in Haiti the same time Laura and Jorge Puello Torres were. Lastly, Casa Mias who follows John Pichardo has a restaurant in the DR close to where Laura Silsby planned on moving the &quot;orphans&quot; to and I believe when Jorge Puello Torres lived in the DR he lived close to Johnathan Pichardo .</p>
<p>I could be totally wrong but as soon as I saw MULTIVU I felt this was something to really look into. Let me know what you guys think. If you plan on researching this...don\'t harass any of these people, screenshot everything in case we have something here and keep it in Voat for now.</p>',

            At 4:25 the mod labels it  "Dead End?"
           </p>
           <p>
            If it is then by all means lets push it to the side but the reactions are clearly mixed. How are we jumping the gun on labeling it "Dead End?" when this post was only out for 3 hours with a mixed reaction?

             Yeah, it's too early for a dead end. I suggest giving these things at least a week.

             I'm just pointing out things in his posts. Of course that comment is absolutely ridiculous. He still worked for the govt and from what it looks like he has family working in the govt.  It's not really about him though. The point was when I searched his ex boss the 2nd link that came up was from a PR company I've never heard of where George DeTorres works for.

              Eyebrows and eyes for sure.   Also, I would think if he were concealing his identity, he would make a more complete change of his first name.  (Jorge is Spanish for George).  I think OP has only found someone who looks vaguely similar, and shares a rather common name.

              Keep in mind he hasn't been seen since 2010.  Is it possible he has color contacts?  If Geroge had pictures before 2012 on his FB we would be able to tell.
