            Hi dtneslo. Killing babies by itself does not satisfy our Rule 1 requirements. If it did, the scum who are paid to spam this board to slide valuable content into oblivion would post every story about murdered children they could find and we'd have to leave them all up. So: Rule 1 means you have to explain how your post is important to help stop the sexual exploitation of kids by the global elite. The Satanic sacrifice is one angle. Another, much more concrete one is that fetal tissue harvesting for profit by abortionists further incentivizes them to overlook and perpetuate the sexual abuse of young girls who become pregnant. This link you have provided establishes the fact that companies are indeed profiting from fetal tissue harvesting. All you need to add is the link that showed Planned Parenthood turns a blind eye to underage pregnancy, and you've got a direct link to Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to remove this per Rule 1 so you can add these bits, since MF will probably do it anyway. You'll need to work the PG connection into the title, as well.

             Abortionists are inherently incentivized NOT to report underage pregnancies they terminate, allowing the cycle of abuse to continue, unless the prospect of jail time becomes sure enough to outweigh the profit motive.

              By Josh Brown - The Washington Times - Tuesday, February 1, 2011
A Planned Parenthood manager in New Jersey has been caught on video helping a person posing as a pimp trying to hide his underage sex ring, according to a video posted Tuesday by the pro-life group Live Action.
The video was shot at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Perth Amboy, N.J., on Jan. 13 by two undercover operatives — a man pretending to be a pimp and a woman posing as his prostitute.
In their video the “pimp” had a conversation with Amy Woodruff, the clinic manager, in which he said he was involved in “sex work.”
When the “pimp” tells Ms. Woodruff the girls are around 14 and 15 years old and speak no English, the clinic manager is shown saying “so long as they just lie … we just kind of play it stupid.”

            And this thread below posted earlier proved relevant to pizzagate because child sex traffickers can take their underage trafficked children to these abortion mills, have an abortion, and then the fetuses are sold.
