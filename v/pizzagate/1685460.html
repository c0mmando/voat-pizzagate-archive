            Yes I was involved with a MCA or Museum of Contemporary Art and they had Child Pornography passing as art.  I can see why JP would be into this as well.  I happen to know a lot of high end power people involved in this shit.  I knew they were passing around actresses, models, and women at the time.

            Speaking of moving freight, the owner of what I'm remembering as a very large freight company was a guest at the White House, along with Alefantis, a porn star, a porn video documentarian, and the owner of a large realty company. It could be postulated that the freight company moves the goods and the empty real estate is used to stage events, maybe like what I believe was an empty house where a handkerchief and some pillows got left. I can't chase it right now, but the visit date for that particular gaggle might have some bearing on other events.

            That said, the main character in the OA is kidnapped and trapped in a basement dungeon, effectively a human terrarium, in which the cells have a natural river running through them, no larger than the stream depicted in the image which now appears to be merely from a Museum in Norway.

            Unless shopped, JAs photo looks a little bit to me like something post landslide. But no splatter on walls and perfect symmetry of the angle plus just dirt and rocks,.   Forget it,  makes no sense really.

            People are weird! I must not get out much, because my eyes are opening to the strangest people and their ways of life. Even just Instagram or Tumblr profiles! They are everywhere. This has all changed me. I swear. I'll never look at people, celebrities, charities, adoption agencies, orphanages, childrens programs, or organizations that supposedly provide relief for disasters the same again. Anything to do with helping trafficked people especially! I can't imagine how many organizations that we have donated to where our money went to evil people's bank accounts. I guess this world isn't full of good and decent people like I thought. So many have that appearance but are fakes!
           </p>
           <p>
            On top of that, this election has shown me how evil people can be. Especially liberals. Our country is just being ripped apart. The Obama administration and our media have focused on things to make us hate each other. BLM, cop haters, Trump haters, protests, rioting and this burst of feminism. Obama could have tried to calm us. Instead, the media instilled fear and hate in us. Celebrities need to keep their traps shut. My point is, that I was blinded to all this sickness and have got a major wake up call, especially in the last year. It's very sad.

            Hitler was big into art too. No seriously, Adolph Hitler considered himself an artistic genius:

            Very interesting. I am reminded of the allegations of Steven Kelley from a few years ago regarding the Getty Museum here in the Los Angeles area.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOnIzawFmiI">
             Underground City at The Getty Museum
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I was very into learning about D.U.M.B.'s (Deep Underground Military Bases) back then and came away with the feeling that many museums do act as covers for such facilities.

            Do it in a modern way. Digital spelunking. Livestream urban tunnel exploration. Better to use the law than going in black and using violence on pedos.

            OK..so this just sparked something weird..about a year ago my wife and I were staying in downtown Denver.  We were out walking and noticed as we were walking over street grates around the Federal Mint...we heard animal noises.  It was so startling and out of place we stayed and listened.  It appears that the Denver Mint has recorded animal noise emanating from under the mint.  We left it in the truly weird category..but might make sense now.

              I have been all through the baggage tunnels.  One time after the commuter flights shut down on the B concourse I heard some construction work echoing in the vents.  There was nobody in this area as Skywest had no late night flights at the time.  I went to every known level and could not find the source of the noise (i was security)  Btw security besides TSA is HSS or "Hospital Shared Services'.  Thats about all I can say since I signed a non-disclosure with Homeland Security and they mean business!!!!!  I will tell you that the closed down baggage tunnels are just a buffer and scapegoat if anyone mentions underground base.

              Every Day around noon there was a classified craft landing in downtown Denver.  Look it up on youtube.  Local news confirmed it, and CNN came and filmed the same craft.  I've been to that location in town is a great vantage point.

            The young girl seems to be afraid, looking for a way out, or possibly fleeing from something or someone. To the glass blocks (tiles) on the ceiling over the child's head are lights attached (used to illuminate the upper level ground.) I imagine that from the opacity of the tiles, only shadows could be seen moving from the underground level if looking down at the tiles from ground level. This is a very creepy picture to me and I don't know what to make of it or find out its location. I've looked at other pictures of buildings and homes included in the flickr album, but I can't seem to find pictures with such tiles on any of them. At least, none was ever captured or posted, it seems.  I still think it's worth looking into.

             This is going to sound random but in the interest of total objectivity, do you see any similarity in the ceiling of this building:

             Remember the Mansion found on google earth that is underground? Now look at the picture again. rocks and water on floor. look at the ceiling again. It's like the ceiling you see in those aeriel photos.

             That ceiling reminds me very much of museum architect David Chipperfield's work. Almost certain it is his.

             Holy shit that's creepy! Why is there a rock floor with a river running through it? Why is she mid-step, looking over her shoulder with a fight/flight look on her face? Anyone seen The OA? Know what I'm getting at? Where is this place, indeed? Looks like a dungeon-maze!

              I don't know if this is the place or not, but I saw this video yesterday about Podestas "Pizza Mansion" in the woods in CA near Bohemian Grove.  Lots of makeshift buildings in the woods with a river nearby called Bone River.   Very strange.

              . This could possibly be some kind of makeshift building over the river bed area?  I hope this helps.  I am definitely not a researcher but wanted to share what I saw.

               Appreciate the response. Neither am I, but we all chip in how we can; I know i'm starting to call out shills and am articulating my own ideas a little more in the comments section. Maybe one day we'll be researching, one can hope.

               Re: the mansion, I trust nothing Podesta but didn't see a river over either of the complexes in their construction stages, and thought the domed one looked like stables, which wouldn't be unheard of for a rich prick like Podesta. But yes, I am very curious what the origin of that photo is. Can anyone who knows what they're doing search the origin of it? Whethe rit exists elsewhere on the web?

            The Guerilla Girls strike me as your run of the mill SJWs. They explain on the website what they mean by "women in the museum basements:" Artwork by female artists is underrepresented in museums and often is in storage, out of view.

            What if we found out what their contracted or "approved" freight companies are? We could then see who's involved with those shipping (and storage, likely) companies. A way to collect the information would be to cold call the museums and pose as a new shipping company eager to outbid their current provider and naturally ask who that is.

              one of the DC PZG targets was linked to a web developer
             </li>
             <li>
              that web developer had 'speciality' shipping companies as customers too
             </li>
             <li>
              I am sure it was a DC web developer, and Im sure it was related to one of the suspicious DC pizza companies
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             My point being transport has to be key in this business and we should do more research there
            </p>
            <p>
             HELP NEEDED: Sorry I cant provide better detail so does anyone know if its possible to find all my old comments? If so i will be able to dig up the original info.
            </p>

            Good find, but would be better without the fake tabloid title.

            Wonder if someone could quietly chat with people who work at this museum about that basement? I imagine a basement could have legitimate purposes, as well, but the question is if anything abnormal is reported in that place.
