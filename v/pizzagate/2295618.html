<p>VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has blown out his birthday candle on an extra-long pizza at the Vatican to the delight of children.</p>
<p>Francis, who turned 81 on Sunday, then told the children, who use a Vatican health service, to “eat all four meters (13 feet)” saying it will make them grow.</p>
<p>Later, thousands of children in St. Peter’s Square shouted birthday wishes to Francis. He replied from his window overlooking the square: “Thanks a lot, thanks a lot.” His birthday coincided with his weekly Sunday appearance to faithful.</p>
<p>Pizza for parties in Italy is often baked in long form, instead of round pies, which are meant instead for individual portions. At the Vatican, rectangular-shaped pieces of pizza were stretched end-to-end on a table and a tall, white candle stuck in the middle.</p>',
