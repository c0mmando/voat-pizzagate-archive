<p>Here\'s Cusack ostensibly calling out PedoWood. He doesn\'t like it when the sicko cabal uses the same standards on him that they use on everyone else in town. Did Cusack not know he was going to age one day? Oh, well! Can\'t stay a Lost Boy, forever! </p>

<p>Now you\'d think that anyone who saw the truth of what PedoWood was all about would be on our side ... like Feldman, for instance. But if you thought that, YOU\'D BE WRONG! Yes, just like Feldman, Cusack is a manwhore and LOVES the fornication with Hollywood! That\'s why in the next breath ... or tweet ... whichever comes first ... there are strangely disturbing things. It is my first glimpse of what will come to be known as quote THIS CUSACK SHIT unquote. It surface in relation to Bill Chapman\'s tweet about LIDDLE KIDZ. You know, the company that trains ANYONE to massage castrophically ill and completely defenseless babies! What a grand idea! And it\'s supported by Killary so we know it\'s legit! I hear that Chelsea is thinking of buying her next white dress in honor of them! </p>

            This sub is a joke. You guys continually promote that certain special politicians are fighting for you. That is something only shills and dupes would push. Trump is one of them, not one of us. Keep pushing Trump and the storm because it exposes you for what you are.  Cusack calls the bussiness out but you condemn him for including Trump. Typical of this sub. Tell people white hats are fighting for us and ignore all their connections to the cabal. Condemn anybody that points out Trumps connections and blame everybody else for the same connections. It shows how desperate they are to get us to buy that the Potus is fighting them, and to believe that the things he does are good and not what they want. Epic fail.

            Help me out here, as maybe I'm missing it somehow, but all I see here is Cusack hating on Trump and basically confirming pizzagate in the GOP. It sounds to me like he's against it. How exactly does that make him a part of it? Is this one of those all-hail-Trump type things where he's guilty because he's not a Trump supporter? Or am I missing something?

             I've gone through the same disappointment, but I don't want to hold these scumsuckers in high regard, don't want to believe they're something they're not. Better to let the dreams fall by the wayside and wait until real heroes come along.

             Awesome photos! Thanks for these. And, of course, the first question that comes to mind is WTH is Cusack in any of these shots? He's a freakin' actor, not a politician! What was he doing for the Clintons ... I wonder ... I wonder ... I wonder ...

              The reason they want access to the hospitals is because they have insider doctors that can actually create illness and get the parents to sign away in case of death. Most people actually believe what their doctor says without even researching. Her job is to get as much information as possible from the parents and facilitate. The kids don't die ...yet.

                Not only that, but they could attack a family for political or wealth reasons. Highly profitable, I would imagine. I mean, look at who we are dealing with. You could have a perfectly healthy child on a routine checkup and the next thing you know, spinal tap, chemo, rare diseases, family fights about what to do, divorce, ect. I am suggesting that they are faking the death certificates and stealing the children with this particular group. Because they are allowed into hospitals like celebrities, no one checks the bags. Syringes, powders? They could be allowed into a perfectly well run hospital with reputable staff and no one would suspect that they are agents of Satan on a mission.

            Laughing Horse posted his contact information. It was circulated as "Anthony Weiner's" laptop list.

            If anyone knows which contact list it actually came from, you'd probably be pretty helpful.

             Yeah why the fuck are we playing where's waldo and why is cusak being compared to Corey Feldman like it's a bad thing. If this is a frame up, that's some real sick shit what's happening here. I guess they want to show this to cusak to scare him about how much of a dumb fuck sheep we are.

              There's another jpeg circulating of a screen shot of the liddle kidz website saying that Microsoft, Google and Bill and Melinda gates foundation sponsors the organization but if you look on the website, there's nothing of the sort! What shitty witch hunt are we on.

            - I can’t dig right now, but note that the Cusacks are from/or lived in Columbia, MD and graduated from Wild Lake HS. Check into the parents’ background. Possible they were CIA thought Columbia is more NSA territory. Worth a shot. Sucks, Gross Pointe Blank is one of my favs.

             The fact that Stephen King and hack Anne Rice are burrowing in and bolstering this POS let's me know he's somebody that's protected by his allegiance to the Horned God.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know, for years there've been questions about how it is that King writes all the shit that's published and why the writing isn't consistent. Questions have been raised about whether he does write it. Of course, anyone asking those sorts of things is immediately gaslighted and called an idiot, but --- ???

              Everything Stephen King has the stolen origin of H.P. Lovecraft and the friends/ books he read. Godzilla is Cthulu. HG Wells tried to warn us about the Morlocks. Now you see that they exist, live underground, and eat human flesh.

              Yeah I have had my doubts about Steven King too. I have read some of his stuff. In interviews he doesnt strike me as intelligent enough to write what he does. He just has that bat shit crazy look. Not to mention his crazy family look to have been put together and based off characters in his books.

            Why does casack's tweet "accurate - Moloch" mean that he sold his soul? It sounds like he's trying to wake people up and he's spoken up alot against pedowood. I see no reason here to say that he's a bad guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            You called that tweet was him showing that his heart was a demon? It sounds like the opposite. Sounds like he understands that abortions are sacrifices to Satan and wants other people to understand too.

            <p>
             The subject was changed by the attributing of abortions to Moloch. That wasn't Coo-coo-sacks original point. His point was that the gun as protected by the GOP and NRA is Moloch, and that children who die in false flags are the sacrifices. You need only look. I can't possibly link every single tweet because I'll go over the word limit for posts.

            It's jumping the gun.  Accuse your enemy of your exact transgressions when you know you're about to be caught.  It's an attempt to make any investigation into you look like retaliation.  Just like "Russian Collusion"

             It sounds like everyone here is jumping the gun on burning cusak, i don't see anything here except a guy that speaks out against pedowood and shining a light on Satan, i definitely don't see anything pro Satan and i don't see anything on this liddlekidz website that says cusak is a donor.
            </p>
            <p>
             All i know is that cusak has spoken up against pedowood and now will be attacked 24/7 by shills.

             No, the GOP is not a deathcult.
            </p>
            <p>
             Certain members, and there are a lot of them, are. They are the infiltrators of the outside Luciferian group controlling things. But, historically, this Luciferian DEATHCULT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY!

             Jim Jones came out of the same CA branch as Jerry Brown and Pelosi. Then there's Heaven's Gate, another crackpot, lunatic CA home-grown suicide cult. And weren't the members ordered to be an androgynous? An NYT retrospective affirms this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/heaven-gate-mass-suicide-20-years-article-1.3008847">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              They cultivated androgyny. Men and women wore cropped hairdos and were cocooned in baggy clothing. Applewhite and at least five male adherents proved their fidelity to the cause by undergoing castration.

               Mig is right, the Democratic party has been more of a problem from the start. They were the KKK. Just because we have a gaggle of Luciferians and extremely compromised individuals, (by the Sataners), does not make either party bad per say, except for the compromised life choices, but all they got is like 5 guys and a few chicks. They have been taken over by the Progressive/Moloch team. They chose them for the weakness of Liberalism.

            We brought this stuff to the surface, planted the seeds, and now we're actually seeing the results in real-time. Amazing. I can't wait to watch these people eat each other alive with their identity politics, coupled with the fact that half of them have Kuru (a disease you get from eating human flesh) and they're always jonesing for a fix of Adrenochrome.

             What have you brought to light? That cusak is like Feldman? Feldman is non-stop attacked by liars and shills and always speaks out against pedowood, who raped him and his friend River from stand by me. It looks like you're treating cusak like Feldman, who i think is a great person and exposing the truth.

              Corey Feldman is not on our side. Look at what he does. He teases that he's gonna drop "the big one," and then he never does, and instead he just begs people for money. If Feldman was really about "fighting the pedo empire," first fucking off, he would completely disband this "Corey's Angels" bullshit, because it makes him look like a creeper/perv just like all the others. Why is he always surrounded by a gang of emaciated looking chicks? Second off, he wouldn't be requiring donations of MILLIONS of dollars from his fans in order to "finally expose these people and name names." If Feldman was any kind of MAN, he would grab his dick and balls firmly in his hand, and then start SCREAMING the name of every single top-level abuser that he could name, shouting their names to all who would listen. But he doesn't. He sneaks around, begs for money, teases information, and even when he does deliver, he's not naming off big people like Charlie Sheen, who we KNOW at this point was the one who raped Haim. Also, there are stories floating around that even Feldman encouraged Haim to "get with the program" and advised him to pretty much just shut up and take it if he wanted to make it big. There's a reason Corey Haim's mother HATES Corey Feldman and wants him to stop parading her son's name and death around like a circus sideshow. She even said something like "he either needs to name names or shut his mouth about the whole thing," and that's
              <em>
               completely
              </em>
              accurate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cusack seems like a crazy man on the edge of complete madness. Feldman strikes me as a guy who looks at this whole PedoGate thing as a way to keep himself relevant and in the limelight. A true hero wouldn't need money or anything else to go out and speak the truth. Fuck Feldman.

               So sounds like you're upset that one man didn't single handedly take out the entire Hollywood elite. We have no idea what someone thinks. Your opinion is nonsense.

                My opinion is nonsense? And what's your opinion? That Corey fucking Feldman, who probably sniffs pills and fucks hookers, is going to save all the children being caged in underground chambers overseas by the Rothschilds? A person like Feldman only hurts, he doesn't help, because he goes on TV shows and looks like a

                  Yes let me just pull up the building plans and high-resolution photos. LOL, just a joke, sorry. Obviously I don't have concrete evidence, but I think we all know that the children have to be stored somewhere during periods when they're not needed. And to support the existence of these chambers, let us never forget that good old Tony Podesta

                 I see a man that is up against the devil himself and i could do more to support people who aren't evil like him. You just hate everyone that isn't Jesus Christ your lord and savior. Pretty nonsense opinion if you ask me.

                 No, Feldman is the crack in Hollywood that will bring them down. I'm not going to burn a guy just because he didn't single handedly do it. He can't anyways, they'll just rebuild it, only the public can take them down. Where we go one, we go all.

                  Well, that's great. We're all entitled to our opinions. That's what you see. What I see is a pussy. I see a man who could potentially break the whole thing wide open, but he's too scared to do it. If I had the power do spill the beans like Feldman could, you bet your ass I'd do it. So I'm a pussy because I'm not a celebrity with clout in Hollywood? If somehow I lived in an alternate reality and I was famous, even marginally, I would speak out until I was straight up murdered. I would name names and not give a single shit, because that's who I am. I don't care if I get killed; I would give my life to expose these creeps.

                  By your comments, I take it you're an atheist, or at the very least, you hate Christians, so YOUR opinion is nonsense to ME. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is a religious, spiritual battle. This is a battle that takes place on not just a physical front, but a metaphysical one as well. I can just tell by the way that you speak that you have no faith in God or the supernatural whatsoever.

                      For me, intellectualism is simply the ability to think outside the box of what you've been taught through the GOVERNMENT FUNDED school system. We were all brought up in a twisted web of lies, I'm just the one fly that managed to wiggle free a little bit, whereas the other flies have simply accepted the fact that they're stuck in the web, and they decide to just make the best of it. In terms of PG, intellectualism would be the ability to fathom and accept things like Satanic Cults without feeling the need to downplay their role in the whole thing, or dismiss them completely. That's the issue with atheists, they don't believe in any kind of religion, so they have a hard time believing that hardcore organized Satanism even exists, much less that the elite are followers of it. Atheists are very fucking stupid.

                       Atheists definitely believe people worship Satanism. Atheism is the belief that man created God and not the other way around so they pretty much dislike all religions. But some like Scott Adams really likes Christians and just believes religion is another  road map to life and success, actually i don't know what he believes but that was the idea behind his book God's Debris.

                    Oh, because I use naughty language? I'm not a "turn the other cheek" kind of guy, sorry. I know people have this idea that Christians are supposed to be mild and weak, but that's not me. I stand up for my beliefs and I use harsh language at times, get over it. You think you're the first knuckle dragger to say I'm not a Christian? What the fuck do you know?

                     I agree with you 100%! Christians have been systematically taught to be weak wimpy and passive, and if you're not then idiot God haters tell you that you aren't a "good" Christian. As if they have any flipping clue what they are talking about!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It's all designed to keep Christians docile and lessen their ability to put a stop to the evil doers in this world. It is not a sin to have justified anger. God gets angry after all and he is perfect! We need to get angry and be motivated to do something about the evil in this world that is preying on our children! I for one am SICK of being told I have to act a certain way to be a Christian and I'm not taking it anymore. I'm done, so watch out assholes!!!

                      I throw rocks at myself constantly. I know I'm loud, pushy, I don't think before I speak, and I give very little care to how other people are going to react to the things that I say. I never claim to be a perfect person, not once have I said anything even remotely similar. If you don't believe me when I say that I'd expose these people if I could, that's your business. But if I had the power that someone like Feldman has, I'd wield that power like a fucking Buster Sword and swing it at anyone that I possibly could. I would literally go on an exposing rampage, spilling all that I could spill, until I was taken care of. You can call me nuts, that's fine, but I will always feel like I'm on the right side of things because I pray to Christ at the end of every single day. If you have a problem with that, kindly take your opinion and shove it up Lord Rothchild's ass.

                       Probably what would happen is that you'd be given a ton of LSD until you either walk out or get pushed out a window and they'd call it just another weird celebrity suicide we all hear about.

                        Yes, but the possibility of my life ending that way wouldn't deter me from spilling the beans if I had beans to spill. That's what you don't seem to understand. I don't give a shit about dying. Death is not scary to me. And I'm not trying to sound edgy. Of course death can be painful and horrific, but I know where I'm headed when I leave this shit-hole planet. I don't fear physical death, and neither should anyone else, especially when the cause is so just. I walk a very fine line where I want to be Christ-like, but on the other hand I want to choke every single one of these elite banker types with my hands until their windpipes are crushed in. At least I'm willing to admit my imperfections, you seem to just like to suck your own dick.

                         You sound more like a psychopath that wants any excuse to kill people and bonus points if you die in the process. And like a gun grabber, your only excuse is, why don't you think of the children?

                           The issue is that i see no evidence that John cusak is a Satanist and only blatant lying such as John cusak is a liddlekidz donor.

                We know that he begs for money. We know that he says he's going to name "big" names and then never does. We know that he parades around with a group of strung-out looking women (his MKUltra dolls perhaps?). We know that he SAYS a lot a DOES very little. Why are you so adamant about defending him? I like Friday The 13th Part 4 as much as anyone else, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to just automatically believe everything out of Feldman's mouth.

                 Corey Feldman tells parents not to put their kids in Hollywood because they are pedophiles who raped him. It's pretty obvious he's a good guy. I'm sorry he's not Jesus Christ himself.

                  If he's such a good guy, why doesn't he just pull the fucking ripcord and spew out every piece of information that he has? "He's scared" is not an option at this point, because he already put a target on himself by exposing this stuff even just a little bit. So why the hell doesn't he just completely drop the biggest bomb that Hollywood has ever seen? The reason I ask is because he CONSTANTLY says that the information he has could "bring down some household names." Yet he never fucking delivers. If he supposedly has the power--in his own two hands--to bring down at least a portion of the pedo rings, and he remains silent, he's not a good guy in my book. I'm not expecting him to be Jesus, you fuck. I'm expecting him to make good on his word to EXPOSE these people, not just tease about it and beg for money from his fans who can't admit that

                   It's pretty obvious that Hollywood will torture kill you, your family, your friends, their family, and they'll make it look like you deserve it to the public as well. If you're so tough why don't you clean it up? IED yourself hot shot.

            Good, another faggot off my list of people/movies I won't ever spend another red cent on. I really should be thanking these scabs. They're saving me an incredible amount of money now that I stopped going to the movies, stopped paying for cable &amp; renting from redbox. Also freed up alot of my time.

            As always their strategy seems to be to blame your opponent of your own wrongdoings. We've seen this a thousand times these past two years. This strategy works when the public is unaware of aforementioned wrongdoings. It's an absolutely vile, frustrating, yet brilliant tactic - there's nearly no defense. There's only one problem: the public has become aware. Or at least, a large enough portion of the populace has.

             It sounds like you're accusing cusak of being pro pedophile and pro Satan even though he speaks out against pedowood, and i don't see any evidence here that he is pro Satan or pro pedophile here. This is just a mountain of nonsense and why the fuck are we playing where's waldo with a donation list? That list should be on the liddlekidz website of proud donors that we can control f on and i don't see John cusak on this list.

              “People would look after you when I was a kid,” he says. “There were good people in the business. When I came to LA Rob Reiner said: ‘Come stay at my house.’ He taught me. I worked with Pacino [in 1996 crime drama City Hall]. Pacino would talk to you and mentor you. Now it’s different. The culture just eats young actors up and spits them out. It’s a hard thing to survive without finding safe harbour.”  A Safe Harbour?   Mentor You?  Wow.

                Yes, RR is so very much involved in all of this.  He has a Ctr. in Perris Ca.  where those 13 children were found. the Turpins.  Remember the accident at the Railway Park?  It was across the street from that Ctr.  I had to post my submission somewhere else, but there was another woman that was rescued 20 yrs ago kept in a family of 13 children as well.  it was in Perris too.  That is where RR has a footprint of all places.  His Ctr has a number of minus 2 children.  How can you be minus 2?  I am getting that headache again.

                  Yeah.  Nothing is coincidental where they are concerned.  It is all on purpose.  All created for a reason.  Perris is another one of their Little Cesspools Towns.

               I guess what crazy coo-coosuck is saying is there used to be kinder, richer, gentler pedos lurking about. Ones that didn't just pound the shit out of your butthole and leave you to tank in some shooting gallery when life got to be too much.

               Hence the draw of being befriended by MJ. He provided that safe harbor that wasn't really safe -- only self-serving.

                Also remember his Footprint in Perris that I discovered in my post.  He has the RR Center there and a minus 2 as his total of signed up kids.  Something is going Come Out soon.  It just has to.  There is too much in his background waiting to be released.  Also in that comment it said DeNiro met up with Cusack as well.  God you can't make this stuff up.  Would make a good movie. Would have to be NFSW

             i am an ex-massage therapist. (pro only, i worked in a chiropractic office) and baby massage seems like an excellent idea. however, you need real massage therapists. (like myself)

              When he brags about his sister being cast as a pedophile   And I'll tell you, my all time favorite part for Joan, is the one that actually allowed her to step out from under the "wacky female best friend" stereotype into the "wacky female pedophile" stereotype.  AND then with the same mouth that says   And Cusack throws a lot of meaningful words that mean absolutely nothing when strung together... patterns and words mean a LOT. Together with Snowden - a black op being played on this Hollywood tool. He's a patsy, they eat their own or self implode.   I AM just saying that his words make no sense nor does his allegiance,  Why is he even speaking out about this?  It makes no sense.  It is just as strange as the statement by Bill Chapman who talks about a baby massaging place Liddle' Kids.  Just an example.

               What does that even mean? You sound unbalanced. You are the one guilty of throwing words together that make no sense when strung together. Nothing you posted exposes Cusack. We know what most celebrities are and who they serve. Seems like you are attacking him because he includes POTUS as a piece of shit pedo.

               Trying to piece together what someone is thinking using patterns and symbolism is what liberal English teachers use to brainwash you into thinking they know what a writer is thinking when he says the drapes were blue.

                 Looks like you've mis interpreted his tweets. When he says "accurate -  Moloch" he's not saying he loves Satan. He's saying that Satan loves child sacrifices. That's called shining a light on the devil, and its a good thing.

              For those that are Woke, it is easy.  Bingo!  Others, hmm.  I wonder what they think, none of what he is saying makes much sense. Maybe we are too Woke, if we were not it would just sound mixed up and they would blankly stare and move on.  These people send out these Mixed Messages for a reason.  To Confuse The Masses.

                The problem with their thinking is that more and more people are getting Red Pilled and Woke every day.  To the others they are speaking a foreign language.  The evidently are not getting it.  They are using the same old tactics.  We are gaining on them.

             ( who is a legend and deserves great respect ) for 'Grosse Pointe Blank'.  Not only was he a sloppy and uncoordinated fighter, he was an asshole and never talked to any of us. We were all very highly skilled fighters and Urquidez even complimented each of us on our skills. Cusack had an annoying habit of groaning while fighting.  We laughed and laughed. lol

              Yeah,  Describes him to a T.  Totally Self Absorbed.  He walked into a store I worked at dressed in some form fitting black ski outfit with a black tight cap and black shades.  I totally ignored him even though I had no clue as to who he was.  I was on to the idiots that came in trying to act like they did not want to be recognized, but then did everything possible to draw attention. Publicity Hounds.  The girl next to me said, Do you know who that is?  I said no and I don't care.  After I totally ignored him, he came up to me and said Happy New Year.  I said Same to you.  She told me who it was and then I immediately knew the reason for the Big Show.  This all happened in about 1 or 2 min.  Total Jerk.  Ugh this brings back bad memories.

                Which is why they wear their sunglasses inside.  Ha Ha.  They know they attract attention.  Are they not onto the fact that we are onto it?  Probably, but they don't care. So tacky when it is someone well dressed.  They should know it is rude or not stylish inside.  It's all about their vanity.

                  Yes, you could tell he wanted us to fawn over him.  And the other girl did.  I was having none of it.  We had to dress very elegantly and wear nice shoes as well.  Very fancy store and he stood out like a Sore Thumb  all in black.
