<p>Brown University has placed a fundraising director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190909200851/https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190908/brown-university-director-with-ties-to-jeffrey-epstein-placed-on-leave">on administrative leave</a> while investigating his work with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Cohen, director of development for computer science and data initiatives at Brown</strong>, was previously director of development for MIT Media Lab, which received donations and assistance from Epstein while concealing their relationship with him.</p>
<p>The MIT Media Lab’s Director, Joi Ito, resigned Saturday amid uproar over the scandal.</p>
<p>Cohen began working at Brown in 2018, according to university spokesman Brian Clark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We are aware of the content of recent news reports about Mr. Cohen’s work at MIT’s Media Lab, which received funds from Jeffrey Epstein.</strong> </p>
<p>Brown has not in its history received any funds from Jeffrey Epstein,” Clark wrote to The Journal in an email Sunday evening. </p>
<p><strong>“We are engaged in a review of available information regarding Mr. Cohen in the context of Brown University policies, core values and the University’s commitment to treat employees fairly. Mr. Cohen is on administrative leave pending this review.</strong> </p>
<p>The review does not constitute any adverse determination, and it would be premature to speak to any potential outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New Yorker story published Friday <strong>included 2014 emails from Cohen to colleagues at the MIT Media Lab titled “Epstein money” saying donations from Epstein, who was disqualified from the school’s official donor list, “needs to be anonymous.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Yorker reported that Epstein arranged at least $7.5 million in donations to the MIT Media Lab from donors including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and private equity investor Leon Black.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In general terms, I can share that Brown conducts reviews under a range of circumstances, which include assessing alignment with Brown’s values, the University Code of Conduct and other policies, compliance with any applicable regulations, laws and statutes, and capacity to perform the requirements of an appointed position,” Clark wrote in his email.</p>

              Epstein was the front man of a blackmail operation that used minors. But he was also the one to launder money for a group consisting of billionaires and CIA and Mossad operatives. Also, not all of the hundreds of girls Epstein brought in from war zones like Yugoslavia were used for parties and as prostitutes, many were trained as spies to extract secrets that could be sold. Narrowing the story to child porn seems to me to be a red herring.

                No smoking gun. But after the OSS merged with the Gehlen Organisation and the Mafia into the CIA, it was all about making money, and not only with drugs-for-weapons deals. Nuclear secrets from the Manhattan project were proliferated, not only to Israel, but also to Pakistan, India and China - a big business. Student visas were used to infiltrate the science community with foreign operatives, so the extraction of secrets could continue.

                  It's true that he is pro Israel, saying Netanyahu is the lesser evil compared to Ehud Barak. But he talks about how Israel got the bomb - if Mossad, he would have get retired already, even if he just had said Israel has the bomb.

                     I'm pretty sure he said it when he was quite sober. Also, he always mixes real info with disinfo, like any good limited hangout would do.

                      He is the front man for hundreds of people that do the digging, they would correct him if he spreads disinfo. The most dangerous disinfo agents are people who deceive by knowingly omitting facts, who make us think that we now all and there is nothing more to dig for. Like Luke Rosiak from The Daily Caller, who wants us to believe that Imran Awan was just a thief, omitting the Awan's PAK ISI connections. Or like all the people who tell us that Epstein was just a pedophile, omitting Epstein's intelligence and financial connections. George Webb has called out many of them.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Most disinfo about GW comes from Jason Goodman. I've seen JG omitting facts, so I think JG is dangerous (I think JG is a plant, but GW says JG does it unintentionally).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      GW talks about many things Mossad doesn't want to come to light, like Marc Rich, Maxwell and Leslie Wexner, or the infiltration of Silicon Valley and of research institutes. He says he distinguishes between good and bad guys in Mossad and CIA, so he is not anti Mossad, just anti cabal. I don't know if there are really any patriotic good guys left in the intelligence community, but if he is really connected to Mossad, then I assume it's more to the good guys.

              There was an allegation, way back in 2012, that Concordia University in Montreal, noted for gaming software, was involved in kiddie porn used by the "Intelligence Community" in man-in-the-middle attacks to entrap and blackmail elites. It involved the murder and dismemberment of a Concordia student from China by a Canadian psycho who mailed two body parts to Canadian politicians, and one to a paedophile (friend of current Prime Minister) at a school. The assertion was on the Abel Danger / Field McConnell site, so who knows, but what's coming out about MIT it seems possible. Montreal was also involved big-time in CIA MK-ULTRA activities.

               I worked on a game while in Montreal, 'Deus Ex Human Revolution' that was produced by Eidos Montreal. I had been outspoken on social media about child abuse and child trafficking but while in the studio, I kept ,my mouth shut and did my job. However when the game came out I was strangely omitted from any credit and although later nominated by online gamers for a best voice in a video game, I never got another job! I didn't work at all again and my voice agent, Susan Glenn (now deceased) at Glenn Talent would not submit me for any work again. her excuse was that she wouldn't submit me for fear of what I might say on a job. When I asked what have I ever said or was there ever a complaint, she starred at her desk, tears welling up in her eyes. The truth is what happened to my own children is OFF LIMITS to that industry.I was fired although I was one of her top voice actors, certainly the most prestigious campaigns I hate all of it. Weak pathetic people. I now know a lot about Eidos and even about the the door they built into Human Revolution where 'they' can see every choice you make when playing and what tactics you choose. Games and the people that run the show behind the scenes are fucked.After the way I was treated NOTHING would surprise me and I believe the spy agencies are all over the games. Some of them are also used as a recruiting tool. If you have children that play video games keep an eye on them. Talk about sneaking in mind programming. Much to add but won't bore you, just be warned. These people, certainly some of them, are scum. They attacked me for years after I spoke out about what transpired.

                Wow. Great intel. The part about how “they can see every choice you make when playing and what tactics you choose” I never realized it was that deep before but I get it now. No wonder those Columbine kids were so fucked sadly. Yeah definitely a way into the brain for mind kontrol for sure. Montreal is a big one, yes the hospitals and ‘specialists’ if you want to call them that, education system, political structure, everything about it is like a different part of Canada entirely. Numerous stories about occult activity and sacrifices regularly with the higher ups in certain sacred spots not deemed for the public, even the Queen attending back in her earlier years, this has been going on for a very long time. Your agents were weak, the industry is weak and rulers of Hollywood are weak. You were the strong one throughout. It took an enormous amount of strength on your part to survive what you did. Living a simple life is freedom compared to carrying the weight and burden of their sacrifices for money and fame. It’s laughable reading Frank Guistras credits as being the founder of Lionsgate in articles, we all know the truth, hes a lying sack of shit. He knows it too and it bothers him what’s being said that’s why he’s suing Twitter or whatever it is he thinks he going to accomplish. You can’t stop or hide the truth. He’s beyond pathetic. Everything about him is a lie and a scam, he’s no billionaire from what he claims he made it in either. One day, in time, young boys will become men and they will talk and the real truth will come out about how evil this man really is...

              I am sure the update will automatically show, For some  reason this topic has huge traffic today (&gt;200 views) ...   so your link should be well read too.
