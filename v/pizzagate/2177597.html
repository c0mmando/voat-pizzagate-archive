            Well, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running a prostitution scam where ladies of the night/day
were offered to members of Congress and presumably filmed, photographed.
Billie Sol Estes tells that story.  But it could have been extended to pedophilia ... who knows?
           </p>
           <p>
            And, YES, Detective Rothstein in his interview with Jim Fetzer/YouTube also makes that clear ...
that part of Watergate wasn't only about prostitution but about pedophilia.
At the very end of the tape Rothstein also makes clear the involvement of our US military in 
child trafficking in a comment he makes.
           </p>
           <p>
            US has been spying at the US probably since day #1 ... and that was also the
purpose of MKULTRA to create child prostitutes and also to use them for espionage.
            <br/>
            See:  MKULTRA
In fact, in order to understand CIA (Catholics in Action) you have to understand the other 
related programs, as well. -- Mockingbird, Paperclip, Gladio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Info and links --
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about** pedophile rings.**   And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.
           </p>
           <p>
            LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.
            <br/>
            Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.
           </p>
           <p>
            And ..
           </p>
           <p>
            See:  Operation Mockingbird — scroll down to “History” — which was being written two years before the end of WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            See:  Operation Paperclip — Wiki’s figures are low — at the minimum 64,000+ which included families but more likely 200,000 according to Kay Griggs/YouTube.
           </p>
           <p>
            See:  Operation Gladio — US program to keep right wing governments in place in the countries over which they had control after WWII — Germany, Japan, Italy.  In Italy, US actually resurrected the Mafia in order to ensure the plan would be carried out.

             This is misinformation -- 
HOMOSEXUALS ARE 100X LESS LIKELY TO SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN than are Heterosexual males.
            </p>
            <p>
             This slander against homosexuals by the Vatican/Catholic church has been going on for 2000 years now and 
is part of the widespread propaganda which the Vatican practiced so well ... not only against homosexuals, but
also as a rationale for their Witch Burnings -- See:  The Hammer of Witches -- which not only was a holocaust 
against females, but also took all human rights away from those who were left.
The campaign against the Jews and the Vatican's vile propaganda against them was spread throughout the
Papal States to permit their putting Jews into "Jewish Ghettoes" for 1,100 years until they were finally freed
around 1864 by the Italians and the French.
             <br/>
             At that time the Vatican was moved back into its one mile square location by the Italians.
Italians tell us that sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests was happening from Day #1.
            </p>
            <p>
             At one time the Catholic Church actually performed homosexual marriages.
Marriages of heterosexual priests were stopped because the claims of wives and children to church assets
became inconvenient for the Vatican.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again -- studies show that it is heterosexual males who are our sexual abusers of children.

              Hmm...what study? Homosexuals are just as likely to be pedophiles as a straight person, as women and as even other kids can sexually prey on kids, this is all know., as far as I knew...If I said something offensive I apologize.

               No ... they're not.  Heterosexual males are 100X MORE likely to sexually abuse a child
And that's what parents need to know to protect their children.
Nor are women likely to sexually abuse a child -- except when they are under the influence of a heterosexual male.
The most common sexual abuse is a father sexually abusing a daughter -- or step-daughter -- it's called INCEST.
73% of the victims are female.
Also Freud, of course, lied in the Oedipus Complex where he made the outrageous suggestion that infants, 
toddlers and young children were the sexual aggressors against adult males in their families -- fathers,
grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
It looks now like Sigmund Freud himself was a pedophile and perhaps generational within the family.
Freud had many young patients (male and female) who had confided in him their sexual abuse by male 
members of their families and he betrayed them, as well as the public, with his lies.

               You'll notice, as well, that even right wing women's groups agree that it is MALES who are 
out sexual abusers of children.

               A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

               Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.

              <p>
               A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
              </p>
              <p>
               Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

               At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
              </p>
              <p>
               Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.

               A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

                Oh yeah I think I get the misunderstanding going on that you are talking about. Maybe. Ok  yes there is heavy gay pedo vibe, that's what you are talking about and pissed about cause not all gays are pedo. Now you are looking at things from OUTSIDE the satanic practitioners way of ritual abuse. Satanists are totally ruining the good gay name. They are not gay either, they are poseurs that lead a double life married by day, bestial et all  by night. So I hope that answers your concern for the gay family. I hope the gays get together on the pedo problem and are better prepared for the next NAMBLA PR ambush.
BTW wasn't that rapist murderer gay in My Own Private Idaho with River Phoenix?  Everybody loved that film and in it boys  talked about being abused raped and surviving, but the main scary guy is at large throughout.

                 Hi name --
For thousands of years, the Catholic Church has worked to create hatred and intolerance for homosexuals, just as they did with the same kind of vile propaganda and their immense ability to circulate articles condemning Jews and Women, Africans and native people.  It's the same thing.
According to studies -- and history -- it is heterosexual males who are our pedophiles.
I recall reading, as well, that in Hawaii (before the coming of the "white" man) homosexuals were held in high esteem and honored for their help with orphaned children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One of the first things you have to recognize about "Satanism" is that there is no Satan and no Devil.
These are boogey-men invented by organized patriarchal religion to frighten and control their members.
                 <br/>
                 The Old Religions which came thousands and thousands of years before these male-supremacist religions were based in Nature and there was no Devil, no Satan, no Heaven, no Hell.
That doesn't mean that the myths aren't used to inflict FEAR and violence on others.
The violence is real.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not really familiar with much of River Phoenix's work and have never seen "My Own Private Idaho" ...
but have pulled up reviews to try to understand what you are saying.  I haven't read them all so I have no idea who the "rapist murderer gay" may be in the film, but I did read that Scott is heterosexual, but will also prostitute himself to males for money.  I'll try to find out more about the film and will watch for it if it plays on one of the channels which plays old movies.  The wider tragedy which leads to impoverishment of citizens and forcing them into some very sad situations is the rise of the right wing here and around the world - fascism.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But in order to understand how it has taken hold -- 
You have to re-read our Constitution and understand Our Founders betrayal of citizens in creating an Elite Patriarchy...
And you also have to understand that we did defeat Germany, but not fascism.
Two years before the end of WWII, some very vile programs were being put in play in the US (also with international consequences) to destroy our free press, move ex-Nazis into the US, and to ensure that only right wing governments would take control here and in other nations over which the US had influence and control -- Germany, Japan, Italy, France.  I'd also add UK and Greece.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It used to be that males didn't talk about being sexually violated -- but they are also victims of pedophiles and they are also trafficked.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thanks for the info -- and will follow when I have time.

                Yeah, I don't really feel like pizza gate researchers are attacking gays. Do you? Maybe the Vatican is though at the same time the Vatican has paid out something like 2bil in settlements over child rape though right? So take that with a grain of salt.  There's a pretty funny video somewhere nambla crashes a gay rights parade. You know they can't kick them out so the sort of walk separate but the gays are upset. It's impossible to take the gays serious because they are dressed up too sexily or too much like rainbow  airheads but they are very upset, and they take to the reporters mike to say why they don't want nambla walking with them. It's just weak however. There was not enough distinction then or now.  Putting the burden of critical scrutiny on heteros does not seem effective strategy to research SRA and sex child trafficking and . All people fall under critical scrutiny law. Be it like a scientist looking at bugs. We must be removed emotionally. Much less if nothing at all of all of your gay non gay mental blocks...and just look at behaviour. We have computers to help us be  more psychic. We have our own eyes to make decisions and stay solid with convictions. Don't worry so much about what people are identifying with...gender wise or what people are criticizing gender wise. It's not important to pizza gate reseach. Unless you are a gay activist and if so that is your cause. You can be a gay rights activist and be a pizza gate researcher, if you can get past your issue with how gays are perceived in the world, and how gays are perceived in the pizza gate  research community, and how gays are perceived in your own community...as u look beyond realize nobody knows what's going to happen, and things are unfolding. You can make a difference to a child who may be enslaved. We don't know these captors, but we can work together to free some kids. It's exciting and scary. Don't be afraid. Thanks

                 No -- agree -- the actual RESEARCHERS here are not attack gays.
But there are a few here who congregate here only to spread anti-Jewish and anti-Homosexual propaganda.
I'm not familiar with what Catholics may be hearing in the Churches about homosexuals, but at one time they would hear that homosexuals were "an abomination.  And certainly the RCC was able to convince Catholics that if they had a child who was homosexual that they should throw them out of their homes.  Hard to believe, but true.  Today, parents are standing with their homosexual children and abandoning the RCC.  Members of the Church, realizing that the assets of their parish churches were being sold off to pay off lawsuits against the church for damage done by their pedophile priests, were demanding control over their parish's finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                 NAMBLA is universally despised.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think we all have to remember that it was RCC teachings which influenced all of our societies in the treatment of homosexuals -- which forced them into "closets" and forced them into marriages with heterosexual partners which were fake and harmful to both spouses and to the children they had together.  It forced homosexuals to hide their true sexual orientation from employers, landlords and military.  They was nothing normal about the life they were forced into to hide who they were.  But again, right wing propaganda is difficult to shake off.  Don't ever let anyone tell you it doesn't work.
And the RCC has been spreading anti-homosexual propaganda for thousands of years.
                </p>

                 There are several different situations going on -- 
INCEST -- fathers raping daughters -- is ancient -- Biblical.
First in line to prevent that behavior would have been women, wives ... other female members of the family.
That's why females are feared by patriarchy and why Elite patriarchy moved to control and oppress females.
And that story goes all the way to the Holocaust against women called "The Burning Times" where pretty much all human rights were taken from women.  We can still see these very serious levels of oppression of women around the world today.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ritual abuse is something which connects to Organized Patriarchal Religion ... it's dependent upon religious myths of Devils and Satans to work -- myths of Heaven and Hell.  Myths based in FEAR, to create even more fear.
We see this as people here begin to try to figure out Pizzagate, where they become so frightened of these tales of Devils and Satans that they are almost paralyzed with fear.  I can identify with that as I began to look at this issue probably more than 20 years ago and it took me a long time to get fully into all of the stories involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sex trafficking is yet another and slightly different issue -- where our military seems to be as involved with human/organ trafficking as they are involved in drug trafficking.  And it seems to be political Elites protecting this drug and human trafficking --- much as those who headed our governments in earlier times protected SLAVERY and Genocide vs Native Americans here.  And that included the murder of Africans here and Native people if they fought their enslavement.

                 Trump and many of current TV programs TEACH viewers that they exist to be JUDGED......
and they are also people who have twisted and perverted our sciences and the use of animals in testing which isn't at all necessary.  When someone convinces you that the emotional isn't valuable or necessary, you're in a lot of trouble!
The most important differences between people isn't race, skin color... the most important differences are between individuals -- and that's where the most widespread differences actually are.

                 Computers can only report the information they have been fed by other human beings.
They can only know what they are told by humans.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When we've seen the harm that vile propaganda can do to people -- then we have to be aware and watchful of what they are saying.  HATE speech can do a great deal of damage.
Gender, of course, is important to Pizzagate research as MALES are our sexual abusers of children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thank Heavens for the wisdom of AA's and Homosexuals who have both run long term and very successful campaigns -- non-violent campaigns -- for their freedom from oppression.
If we ever have a Revolution here, they should be the ones teaching us how to do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is a liberal nation which has been proved over and again and it stands against prejudices and hate which do harm to any American because of their skin color, their gender, or sexual orientation.  The nation has spoken on Homosexual rights and we now have gay-marriage.  And, of course, the RCC was performing gay marriages two thousand years ago.

                 Actually, we know a lot about these people who you've read MKULTRA.  Currently Wiki has been edited to remove (I think) the physical torture involved in creating Mind Control.  But it happened.  And not just here but all over the world ... in Australia, one of their prominent victims is Fiona Barnett and she speaks about CIA-Australia/MKULTRA.
So these programs weren't only run in our country and throughout our colleges and universities but in many other countries.

                  Pretty long read there por muoia , just saying growing up and my whole life GAY, was a great big NOTHING BURGER in my world in my family, and friends...Until OBAMA. Anyway SfBay area, I guess your not from here. People are ever so chill about other people's business, it used to be more so. Like hey are you ok are you healthy are you strong, now it's are you still male are you female yet? SFbay area also has medical UC hospital  and  military hospital. Hello gender change anyone???  Nobody gives anymore .  Ok Computers do not just spit out what we put in. Wakey wakey. They talk to each other and have random algorythms. I know that and I'm illiterate.  And...BTW...o disagree about pedo s not being gay. I've know n in my childhood gay men to prey on the boys my age hardcore. As in turn out boys. Alot. As that was cultural. Nambla is not universally despised, not around here. Not around Berkeley. All those old writers artists etc...have pissed on every MILL VALLEY SAUSALITO etc  from near to far SFBAYAREA. Nambla has old timers and old gay money. They talk about it. Don't kid. Your not from here. The family court took my kid and all parental rights gave my child to the yranny dad, who hadn't had the surgery yet but did the whole coming out and announcing his female gender and plans for surgery contemporeneously with suing me for custody of the child. And used that platform in the court and sued the court and myself for calling him him and made us call him her.  Ok? You can't tell me trannies don't have issues. You can't call me a gay basher at alll. One of those boys i mentioned , who was turned out so young. He had been extremely up and coming. An incredible beauty as teenager and that was taken advantage of. His body  found up in Reno on the Amtrak rails a few weeks ago. His mom had been wondering where he was. It pretty much wrecked his whole life to have gotten strung out like that on purpose by an adult for sex.

                   Don't know if there is any final definition of pedophilia as yet as absolute.
                   <br/>
                   They know that a certain number of people who are sexually abused will go on to sexually abuse others.  Strictly from memory, I think it was about 40%, but most don't harm others.
No matter how much of it they tracked down ... they would find that one pops up for absolutely no  reason whatsoever.  There are also pedophiles where there seems to be arrested development -- immaturity.  And allegedly there are pedophiles who never act on their desires.  And, depending on the age of the child they're attracted to, there are different names/terms used for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But, if you read the study I posted, the majority are HETEROSEXUAL males who would otherwise prefer to have sex with adult females, but in certain "situations" they will sexually abuse a child.
This is called "situational pedophilia."  And it seems to be the majority of the cases.
The most common sexual abuse of children is a Father sexually abusing a daughter -- 
or a Step-father sexually abusing a daughter.  Usually a daughter, but males are also sexually abused.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   BEYOND THAT ...... There is CIA/MKULTRA where they were creating pedophiles through psychological and physical torture.*
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The MKULTRA program is about Mind Control of the masses.  Obviously, somewhere in the past, the ability to so traumatize a child with abuse was found to create "split personalities" (now called disassociation).  Maybe it was the torture of the Crusades or Inquisition which set new precedents of violence?  Maybe it was something further back?  But it seems possible that these "arts" were passed on to the Nazis from the Vatican.
Many don't know that these new personalities can be programmed - - taught new languages, given photographic memory.  The CIA used these children as homosexual prostitutes, as drug runners, and for espionage/spying, blackmail.  Meanwhile, the HOST has no idea what they are doing as the other personalities.  Many of these children are killed or murdered within the program.

And used that platform in the court and sued the court and myself for calling him "him" and made us call him her. Ok? You can't tell me trannies don't have issues&lt;.

                   Sounds more like the Courts have "issues."
Why would they have given him custody rather than given custody to his Mother?

An incredible beauty as teenager and that was taken advantage of. His body found up in Reno on the Amtrak rails a few weeks ago. His mom had been wondering where he was. It pretty much wrecked his whole life to have gotten strung out like that on purpose by an adult for sex.&gt;

            Organized sexual blackmail goes back many decades. J. Edgar Hoover kept blackmail material on a lot of people; for instance, he tried to blackmail MLK Jr. with evidence of his extramarital affairs into committing suicide. Meanwhile, Hoover himself

David Ferrie, a conspirator in the JFK assassination, is well-known for being a homosexual, and it's suspected that he was blackmailed to stay with the CIA due to that. Lesser known is the fact that (according to Daniel Hopsicker) Ferrie was also a pedophile protected by the New Orleans authorities.

            This has been going on since the beginning of time but the art of political blackmail was perfected to a science by the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Great British. It used to involve adultry, then that became nothing as society was internally destroyed, so next was homosexuality which has some weight but the ultimate was children. That was considered Gold. Since Freud &amp;Hitler &amp; others had already institutionalize raping and tornenting children as part of National Security with the goal of creating spies, assasins etc as soon as Allen Dulles and TPTB incorporated the CIA which combined this with the Jesuits infiltrating the US was easy.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was 1948 since that time at least children have been kidnapped, created, bred, etc. in secret labs and bases all over the US, Canada and NATO countries.

              You can research my posts going back to the beginning of pizzagate....I have explained, documented links, provided eye witness testimony, including from someone who was a child of Hitler's top commander and stood on stage in Berlin  in 1938....witnessed history in real time, was friend of Dr. Carl Jung..agent 488 and was involved in the first experiments in Germany and Tavistock.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many other posts I could write the book from her manuscript she passed on to me at age 80 after revealing all the inner secrets of the NAZI party, the names of Americans involved, and what happened after....She died in 2010 at the age of 80 after revealing these secrets for the first time to me and leading me to documents, photos, manuscript.
             </p>
             <p>
              Much more but it is often deleted because it is true and I have direct evidence...
             </p>
             <p>
              Including names, doctors,psychologists,  hospitals, universities of those involved in 1948 to current day.

            The Sibel Edmonds videos explain the political blackmail. Also Kay Griggs explains how they groom rising stars, but these have been posted so you would have already seen them.

            On #1...you have to get over thinking the FBI is a "helpful" or "good" organization.  It is not.  The FBI was formed by Hoover for the express purposes of investigating and building blackmail files...its secondary purpose was to solve crime.  So, on #1..about the time the FBI was formed, so did the blackmail.  Rest assured that EVERY US congressmen/women has a file.  Rest assured that every federal judge has a file.  Rest assured that every important public official has a file.  Why do you think Trump has such a hard time getting his folks past the "back ground" checks...they are clean, so they cannot pass.  Only folks with blackmailable material in their past are appointed...
           </p>
           <p>
            On #2...yes..check the Dutroix affair in particular.  Bavaria was the home of the original illumanti.  Check Edward Heath, former prime minister of England and his associations with Jimmy Seville.

             Also recall that FBI was largely taken over by CIA's Operation Paperclip which funneled ex-Nazis into the FBI 
and also used them (200,000 according to Kay Griggs/YouTube) to found the CIA ....and they were also funneled
into other government agencies and to "hot spots" around the world to guarantee the rise of the Fourth Reich.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to John Stockwell, former CIA ... CIA = Catholics in Action
Which takes us back to the original source of ritual sexual abuse and pedophilia.
Also explains what the "covert" Vatican program may have been over the last 40 years
which has been rumored which has now taken down minimum one million Muslims in ME...
plus their oil.
Not so very different from the Papal Edicts under which Columbus worked to "enslave or murder"
Africans here and native peoples referred to as "pagans" and considered to be only "worthy of being
fed to dogs" by Vatican and invaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the native people tell us ...

When they left, we had the book and they had the land."

            <p>
             Christianity -- male-supremacist religion -- has long been a tool of Elite patriarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Christianity invented Capitalism when Feudalism was no longer sufficient to run the Papal States.
