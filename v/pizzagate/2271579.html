<p>In this final part in our three-part series, as we have discussed the Sex Panic of 2017, the sudden interest on the part of the MSM to expose sexual harassers in Hollywood, major media outlets and the political establishment, after over a decade of helping them cover-up these scandals, yet refusing to report on the rampant pedophilia and sexual child abuse occurring in some of these same fields, we ran across a shocking number of deaths of people that spoke of, reported on and/or were investigating pedophiles, sexual child abuse and child sex trafficking rings, which turned what was supposed to be a two-part series into three parts.</p>
<p>A TRAIL OF DEATH......</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Breitbart:</strong> Usually a piece like this would be done according to a time line, but since Andrew Breitbart is perhaps one of the most well-known names in Independent Media, we will start with his death, which occurred on March 1, 2012.

            Both the Republicans and Democrats are desperate above all else to protect their precious places at the Taxpayer Money Pig Trough. They have turned "public servant" into the art of theft.

            BOTH sides, and that includes the Republicans, will literally have to be forced to bring the pedophile blackmail network to light. Right now they are riding around in golf carts together knowing damn well they do not want Pizzagate bringing down their system.

            I hope we don't lose our way and get caught up in the fake two party squabbles. If we do our message of Pedophilia will be lost.

            This is essentially why I refuse to claim victory at this point. I want a pedophile blackmail system dismantled that includes BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. Some people are cheering Victory because the left is taking a long overdue ass whipping, and they deserve it (scum), but this is not victory.
           </p>
           <p>
            IT IS ALSO NOT OUR GOVERNMENT SLOWLY PREPARING THE PUBLIC. IT IS THE PROTECTION OF THE SYSTEM ITSELF.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The left pissed off a lot of people, namely Donald Trump's ego, and they are getting some payback.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't want the pizzagate goal to get lost in a party politics cheering match. Some people feel like I am "black pillng" and stunting their buzz. I don't think so.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I am simply trying to stay on point. The Right giving the Left an ass whipping is not the Pizzagate point.&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS A ONE SIDED POLITICAL ASS WHIPPING. I THINK WE NEED TO STAY ON MESSAGE DEMANDING BOTH SIDES BE UNMASKED AS PEDOPHILE ENABLERS.

              Is The Left Self-Destructing, Or Is Something Else Going On?

            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The temptation to revel in the implosion of the extreme political Left is high, and it's understandable. I could go through a long list of insane offenses by the cultural Marxist cult of the church of "social justice," but I think this latest example summarizes the problem nicely. In this video, teaching assistant Lindsay Shepard at Wilfred Laurier University in Canada is reprimanded and brow beaten by two professors for daring to commit the heresy of showing her students BOTH sides of the debate over transgenderism and pronoun politics.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The social justice cult is running into the same conundrum today.  The backlash is reaching epic proportions and the term "SJW" is becoming a household joke, when only a year ago most people had no clue what an SJW was — all they knew was that "political correctness" was furiously taking over Hollywood, the internet, politics, etc.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The laws of social physics at least partially explain the current collapse of the Left. However, I believe there is another underlying agenda taking place here, and it is working to the detriment of all people, regardless of their political affiliations
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             In my article "Order Out Of Chaos: The Defeat Of The Left Comes With A cost," published just after Donald Trump's election win, I warned of the potential danger that the Left is being exploited by the establishment as a sacrificial appendage, a tool used to push conservatives to their own extremes and their own zealotry.  Meaning, conservatives could be manipulated into embracing government power and totalitarianism in order to crush the zealotry of the cultural marxists. Essentially, we would become monsters in order to defeat monsters.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next stage in this theater of fourth-generation warfare would be for the Left to hit rock bottom and then rise again from the ashes as something new, and entirely more dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, has the Left hit rock bottom yet?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I would note that the tidal wave of mainstream media reports on sexual deviance and misconduct on the part of celebrities and politicians has been composed primarily of people on the left.  Celebrity icons that are long time representatives of Democratic party money and support. I find it interesting also that many of these celebrities are people who attacked Donald Trump for his rather minor recorded discussion of sexual activity, the same recording the mainstream media used to admonish him as akin to a rapist.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Whether or not the accused people are guilty, or even require a self-flagellating apology, remains to be seen. I am not one to take the court of public opinion very seriously. That said, I wonder why there have not been more accusations against Republican icons recently? I mean, Republican figures have certainly not been strangers to sexual misconduct in the past, so why are the vast majority of pariahs being exposed today, including Harvey Weinstein, major Democratic players?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             My theory is that the establishment and the controlled media are being very selective in their targets and are going after mainly leftists who represent low hanging fruit. But why? As mentioned above, the extreme Left must hit rock bottom, and then mutate into something else. They must be molded into something even more extreme. The social justice cult must be pressured into doubling down.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The people who supported attacks on Trump over his sexual commentary now look like idiots because some of their favorite Hollywood idols are being exposed as allegedly much worse in their behavior. What will their response be, I wonder? Admit they were wrong? Or become even more zealous in their political correctness and indignation?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The obviously fraudulent and completely fabricated Russia-gate issue is also disintegrating. But, contrary to what many conservatives and liberty movement analysts assumed, this piece of propaganda was NOT meant to take down Donald Trump; not in the slightest. In fact, it was meant to help radicalize the Left, to make them more aggressive and violent and to give them false hope that there was a way to get rid of Trump without waiting for another election. That hope is being taken away from them as Russia-gate fumbles.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The people who blindly supported the Russia-gate narrative now look like idiots. What will their response be, I wonder? Will it be to admit they were wrong? Or, will they become even more angry and violent?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The U.S. government is clearly ready to help this narrative along. The FBI and DHS officially classified ANTIFA activities as "domestic terrorist violence" back in September. And, according to Edward Klein who is publishing FBI documentation on leftist groups in his new book, the government is also asserting that leftists have been traveling to Europe to meet with Al-Qaeda and ISIS representatives, apparently to form ties with said organizations and to learn terrorist skill sets.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Do I believe this to be true? No, not really. This kind of agency propaganda reminds me quite a bit of the propaganda used against "patriot groups" over the last decade, including the not so subtle insinuations that "right-wing extremists" would work with Al-Qaeda and form an alliance. Which is, of course, absurd, because right-wingers are pretty adamant about opposing the tyranny inherent in Islam.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The claim may be more believable in the case of cultural Marxists, but still unlikely. What is MORE likely, and what I have been warning about since before Trump's election, is that there will be terror attacks in the name of leftist ideologies, but that these attacks will for the most part be initiated by the establishment. Just as the establishment funded and trained Al-Qaeda and ISIS and then set them loose to create havoc, and just as the establishment has engineered false flag attacks that were automatically blamed on a designated bogeyman, it now appears to be the extreme Left's turn.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             If we see catalyzing events like war and continued economic downturn, the chances of Leftists being swept into an engineered fervor are even higher.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The Left is plummeting into the depths of embarrassment and despair. As Trump's first term goes forward, these feelings are probably only going to fester. Civil unrest and rioting are inevitable, but the greater threat is the issue of Gladio-style terror that is obviously being prepared. The narrative is being carefully set. And, at this point, conservatives are all too happy to believe that the Left is capable of almost anything. With the madness they have displayed so far, why wouldn't we think the worst of them?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Again, the danger is that when this begins to happen in great frequency, conservatives may respond by acting against their own ideals of limited government and individual liberty. When terror attacks are blamed on the Left, how will we react? Will we question the validity of the narrative? Will we apply suspicion to the Trump administration, which has only increased the number of swamp creatures in "the swamp" since its inception? Will we seek out solutions to the problem by staying true to the Constitution and without turning to state power? Or, will we embrace the narrative, embrace the Trump administration without question, throw our full weight behind government power and say "Let's stomp lefty faces into the dirt!"
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I hope this will not be the outcome, because if it is, then the last vestiges of liberty in America are doomed.
             <strong>
              Hating the Left could be seen as reasonable and rational in our era, but abandoning our principles is not.

             As we are seeing with the YouTube pedophile scandal now engulfing the platform, there are only small mentions by the MSM about how prevalent the problem really is, before they start blaring the sex scandals involving celebrities, politicians and their own MSM industry sexual harassment issues, because they are more than willing to sacrifice the low level rats, the celebrities, the media personalities, the politicians, rather than expose the worst offenders, the child molesters, the pedophiles and the world of child sex trafficking, which would engulf an entirely different segment of society, the heads of states, the billionaires, the uglier truth than what is already being exposed.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             As to why the majority of those being exposed right now are far left liberals, Brandon Smith over at Alt Market, offers a warning about why the left is being used as a "sacrificial appendage.:
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             At  least 11 mayors have been accused of child sex related crimes, and in May 2017, a de Blasio employee was arrested for child pornography, and in September 2017 it was reported that a former senator was facing charges for child sex trafficking and child pornography. In October 2017, it was reported that former "Glee" star Mark Salling admitted to "possessing a massive cache of child pornography and agreed to spend up to 20 years in federal prison and register as a sex offender for life."
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, lower level rats, but sometimes you have to start at the bottom and work your way up, but note that many of those stories were reported on locally, or by Independent or conservative media while the mainstream media has been busy showing us shiny objects, dominating the headlines with sex scandals, to distract us from the uglier truth of PedoGate, where high level, elite figures, are pedophiles and being protected by other establishment figures and the MSM.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              BOTTOM LINE
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              We are watching media personalities and Hollywood members and even some politicians now become embroiled in this Great Sex Panic of 2017, but  there are much bigger fish to fry, and they have been protected for decades by the "elite" and the their media puppets, and the reason as to why we are seeing these low level rats being sacrificed at this point in time, may very well be an attempt to provide cover and a distraction from PedoGate.

            We had a very sad and mysterious (not to us) death that was brought on by one of our members getting too close to the truth.  I am so tired this morning from last night's research I cannot remember the name, but he is a Hero in my book.  I know one of you will come to my rescue. I feel Horrid not remembering.
