            The really interesting thing about PizzaGate is how the whole of the Deep State's high-level propaganda apparatus, led by CNN, sprang into action to defend a grubby pizzeria and its owner. Including silencing a news anchor on a local CBS affiliate. As evidenced by the Atlantic article the debunking effort continues to this day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Fox News never bothered to fully investigate the interesting parts of the scandal, which were the Instagram pics and follower's comments, John Podesta's related emails and brother Tony's strange taste in art, some of it cannibalistic, his connections to trendy spirit cooker Marina Abramović and both brothers' connection to the late paedophile Clement Freud.

            I’m so tired of all of this. Nothing gets done. We read about it everyday- the abuse. The horrors. Nobody helps the kids. CPS is evil and is still able to go about removing kids and putting them with abusers. I’m literally at a breaking point. My abuser was able to foster then adopt a child and my warnings about him went in the garbage.

             I totally empathize. Happened to my children. My ex wife was a vile woman who was ritually abused as a child but she worked as a prostitute  behind my back and I believe was trafficking children.I went to police, Children's Rights organizations but got nothing in return and she was 'helped' to steal my children forever and I was dogged,tracked, death threatened and harassed for years, ending up homeless. I too am so sick of all of this. I have had so few wins in 25 years now. I did discover an orphanage she was partners in located in Cambodia. I mentioned it in a radio interview and others looked into it. Their website was taken down within a week so possibly I saved a few children. That orphanage was def.a child trafficking NGO. But after so many years, the hate directed at me,the smears and so little that was ever done. My children I fear were also ritually abused. Lately I can barely keep my head up and honestly, I now think that almost all of the Billionaire's Club are involved in this. MY ex wife was so connected it is absolutely mind boggling. Police records changed, safety box break ins at banks and even the Hague fucked me. The power that this filth has is unreal. I honestly did the best I could to keep going but now, I just want to cry most of the time. "My children my children"...it all fell on deaf ears. I was once a successful actor and I found out, from first hand experience that Hollywood is really really involved. They must have hired something like Black Cube to follow and harass me but back in 1995, NO ONE would believe me. Amazing I never went to the loony bin. Sorry to go off but I feel for you. I don't know why God has allowed this to get to this point. It is almost like hell has been emptied and now they are living amongst us.

            Not nitpicking but I think it's more accurate to say that the opening paragraphs are a defense of Comet Ping Pong Pizza Parlor from pizzagate research (not that executive editor of The Atlantic Adrienne LaFrance would have a word to say about the research into elite pedophile cases and pedophile organizations and worldwide cp rings that would shed light as to the motivations of those who persist in talking about 'pizzagate').
           </p>
           <p>
            LaFrance's laborious piece is an installment in Atlantic's
            <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.theatlantic.com/shadowland/">
             "Shadowland" series
            </a>
            .  Ironic timing, given the latest revelations casting sunlight into the murky treasonous acts emerging from Obamagate, the persecution and framing of Gen. Flynn by any means necessary and the unmasking of American citizens, the US Constitution, Bill of Rights, Rule of Law be damned.  All snuggled at the heart of the criminal Left's own whole cloth conspiracy theory: Operation Russia Collusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the Shadowland series is the brainchild of The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, I found the reference to it here:
            <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/shadowland-introduction/610840/">
             https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/shadowland-introduction/610840/
            </a>
            but the link was
            <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/shadowland/">
             dead
            </a>
            (it's unlikely that it's due to the contributors seeking to correct their errors. /s)
           </p>
           <p>
            And I suspect The Atlantic will stand by their claim, that they are solely motivated to insult the intelligence of Americans for their own good, just as they claimed they were forced to endorse Hillary, to protect America from the Elite Left's greatest fear:  DJT.  In the obvious enthusiasm to carry water for the Left (despite the fact that in its founding statement, The Atlantic promised that it would be “the organ of no party or clique”), they have no qualm using the largest political broad brush they can find to characterize Trump supporters as unhinged mental cases.
           </p>
           <p>
            One wonders if the editors at the Atlantic are wavering from their stand for Americans' freedoms laid out in August 2018:
            <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/08/the-freedom-of-the-press-is-yours/567655/">
             'The Freedom of the Press Is Yours It is your right as an American to read what you will, to write what you think, and to publish what you believe
            </a>
            .  Will The Atlantic have the stomach do a series pointing out the MSM's printing and hourly catwauling of outlandish theories dangerous to America's freedom? (The targeting of Americans by the Obama shadow government actions, his attempted coup to destroy a duly elected president?).  I won't hold my breath.

             This is my problem with Pizzagate - it's so closely tied to far-right nutjobs calling Obama treasonous for investivating treason.  I find much of the elite pedophile ring stuff quite believable and wish the media would look into it further.  However I'd like to find just ONE liberal like myself who approaches the topic rationally and doesn't spout off about Jesus and the devil and how the Jews are going to take over the world.

              You're new to this issue.
             </p>
             <p>
              The watchword here is "far-right nutjobs," indicating you are still brainwashed and think in terms of "RIGHT BAD LEFT GOOD" i.e. what the mainstream media has been parroting for decades. The Left's current major philosophies are not at all conducive to helping children (they promote murder of children aka "abortion"), whereas Jesus Christ commanded it and good Christians follow that example.
             </p>
             <p>
              The people who speak out about Pizzagate are largely from the Right which begs the question why? I think this is the answer: Liberals want to change reality to fit their beliefs, whereas Conservatives want to change their beliefs to fit reality. You're living in a fantasy of your own making:
             </p>
             <p>
              -You are a materialist who does not believe in the supernatural. You only believe material causes exist---in spite of clear and abundant evidence which would contradict your philosophy.
             </p>
             <p>
              -You don't understand that Atheism is a religion and a philosophy, not science or logic.
             </p>
             <p>
              -You automatically demonize people who speak against the apparent Jewish monopoly instead of looking at the evidence for such and considering the logic behind it. Not surprising as Atheism dispenses with logic and evidence when it's convenient for the ideology.
             </p>
             <p>
              -You view the issue in terms of "Antisemitism" as if the Jewish religion is untouchable in terms of criticism---the common phenomenon of Atheists defending Jews when it suits them, and hating Christians (which always suits them). Which is hilarious given the fact that the Left hates Israeli Jews.
             </p>
             <p>
              -You automatically demonize Christians----your greatest allies in the fight against pedophilia and government corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              -You ignore the Left's growing support for pedophilia under guises such as "child-rights" (which apparently only extends to them having sex as opposed to protecting them from murder before or during birth).
             </p>
             <p>
              "However I'd like to find just ONE liberal like myself who approaches the topic rationally"
             </p>
             <p>
              When everyone except you is stupid and irrational, maybe that says more about you than it does about everyone. And please note it is extremely arrogant and delusional to think you're the only rational person to grace these forums just because you're the only outspoken Atheist.

              It looks like you are new to this subject - do you know about David Seaman? He's not popular here but he is socially liberal. There are others as well, if you look for them, but I don't think you'll find any Obama fans. What you are likely to discover is that most people conform to a predetermined set of ideas and won't adopt an idea from "the other side", even if it's true.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...I just remembered Nick Bryant - he's quite liberal and very knowledgeable on this subject, but he hasn't wanted to say much about Pizzagate specifically.

             It is remarkable how the left-side still spends time debunking PizzaGate while they have wasted almost 4 years "bunking" up the whole Russian collusion and Michael Flynn affair which started with an obviously absurd pee dossier concocted by MI6 and paid for by Hillary and the DNC.

              "It is remarkable how the left-side still spends time debunking PizzaGate" When you paint with such a broad brush , the details are left out. The clintons have nothing to do with the left. In fact, the ones who were rooting for g bush who gave us the false flag of 9/11 and subsequent middle eastern wars were hardly leftists. BUT they are now cheering on joe biden and hillary clinton etc. Pedophiles extraoridinaire. Think about it.Excuse my spelling.

            Pizzagate was never about basement. It was about strangely worded suspicious emails and Alefantis being in on of those emails + his pedophilic, disgusting Instagram and his friends similar Instagram profiles. The so called basement as researchers later discovered - could be anywhere, Whitmore Farm, Pegaus Museum, or even Comet, or somewhere else. But it wasn't that that raised alarm on "basement" or just walk in fridge described as killroom, it's how people commented on it and how they were interested in deviant toddler related stuff, alarm was raised because it was posted by suspected pedophile, doesn't matter where that walk in fridge is. Media are disgusting by not looking into this topic deeper, they're truly disgusting, treasonous - journalism is dead.

             "Who talks this way about pizza?" "Their symbolism will be their downfall. " I think these people have lost touch with reality and symbolism has a different meaning to them. Reason why pizza is mentioned so often and in different ways.We make a big mistake in trying to think logically about them.They have an evil alternative reality and want all the world to be like them.One Deviant Patch of Scum.

             When I spoke with Clinton recently about QAnon, she said,
             <strong>
              “I just get under their skin unlike anybody else … If I didn’t have Secret Service protection going through my mail, finding weird stuff, tracking the threats against me—which are still very high—I would be worried.”
             </strong>
             She has come to realize that the invented reality in which conspiracy theorists place her is not some bizarre parallel universe but actually one that shapes our own. Referring to internet trolling operations, Clinton said,
             <strong>
              “I don’t think until relatively recently most people understood how well organized they were, and how many different components of their strategy they have put in place.”

            The “Root” of Pizzagate is not at a pizza parlor in DC, the real “Root” of Pizzagate and the entire Agenda beyond 21 and 2030 of Eternal Enslavement forged through the Great Deception of Sustainability (Satan’s Ability) with the Mark of the Beast enforced by 5G+ AI, Smart Cities, Resilient Communities and Community Policing is:

            The False Prophet Q never dug into Racine and has lied to everyone telling them to Trust Sessions, Wray, Huber, Pompeo, Barr and others, Trust the Plan, sit back and eat popcorn. Q lied and told you that elections are safe. Wisconsin and other states proved they are not. Q lied and told you that you and your families are safe. Your rights have vanished. Why would you be targeted with bioweapons and tyrannical force if Q said there is nothing to worry about and to enjoy the show?
