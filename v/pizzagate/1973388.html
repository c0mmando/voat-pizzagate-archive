            Lol people are just finding this out? Ive known this since I first heard about neon nettle. If you aren't familiar with a news source look into them a little first before you post they're shit. There's alot of people on here that post from crazy bullshit sources.

            According to your mongoloid logic, people like Dan Rather and Brian Williams are "serious" journalists..

            Again, according to your mongoloid logic, things like the CIA / military doing mind control and radiological experiments on the population and their own soldiers are must be "ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theories"

            I wish people would realize that all they do is take old articles from other media, sensationalize it, add some unsourced bullshit, and spin it into something we
            <em>
             want
            </em>
            to hear. It's not helpful to post things we
            <em>
             wish
            </em>
            were true.

            Jay Greenberg from neon nettle is a kike shill look him up. He's part of other big disinformation campaigns. My guess is this, these people are testing the waters. They are trying to see how long it takes for info to be disseminated, this news to trickle down to facebook from more underground websites like this. They are trying to balkanize the internet. It started with pizzagate getting deleted from Reddit, they wan't us stuck in echochambers... What about GAB? That was another honeypot used to suppress conservative opinions

            Of course they are.. they steal articles right out of other sites, even mainstream "fake news" sources without giving them credit..  but when i pointed this out, some moronic sheep attacked me..

            I posted that article and have posted others from Neon Nettle that I think are relevant to our investigation here.  I am far from young and far from naive.  I have also posted tweets from VictoryOfTheLight as again they seemed valid and relevant.  I would think this forum is about a freedom of ideas and sharing information rather than pushing any "narrative"..but whatever...I am no advocate of Neon Nettle, but you are wrong about sourcing as that last article was sourced...

            "Kremlin spokesman and Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, highlighted some of the "deliverables" for the meeting to a Moscow audience: "I proceed from the premise that Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump understand their national interests,""They want to overcome the current abnormality and start negotiating specific issues that affect bilateral relations, including business interests and the resolution of international problems.""The foundation of support for pedophilia within US politics is a global issue that must be eradicated.""This level of unethical corruption must be stopped, and we have the means expose it if the US Government is unwilling."
           </p>
           <p>
            Sourced better than a WAPO or NYT article...

            As a mod are you now the regulator of what journalistic integrity is?  I'm just doing what I have always done and very PROUD of my history on this forum and what we have been able to accomplish together...just saw that Google was referencing a /pol/ article this am..so who is to say what sources are providing "real" or "fake" news..ya?

             You can push back, for whatever reason.  the simple truth is that anyone who spends time online knows to automatically disregard anything from neonnettle and sorcha fal at the very least.  So if you just want dumb kids to take you seriously, then go right ahead and keep using them as a source.  A better idea would be to use them as a lead, but find corroboration elsewhere and use that as a source - generally you won't find corroboration elsewhere.  Neonnettle makes up fake sensationalist headlines and passes on unfounded rumors, like the FBI/CIA shootout in washington DC streets a few months ago.

                  When I read "that article", I'm assuming it to be a recently linked article, I see the names Sergey Lavrov, Maxim Suchkov, Heather Conley, and a host links in "that article".  Articles which have no sources do not name names and quote the individuals, nor do they contain links.  To say that article has "no sources" is clear bullshit.

                   I said the central claim is un-sourced. The central claim concerns the quotes about "exposing elite pedophiles." The article never cites anything for those quotes.

                     Hey dipshit, if you take two seconds to pull your nose out of your asshole, you'll see that the "claim" I made, which I was referencing in that comment, regarded the "central claim" of the article.

                        Yeah, when you figure out what a source is, maybe you could grace us all with one regarding your slander of Neon Nettle.  Maybe there's an online course you could take.  Retard.

                           Those are names. Source means verification. As in, where did these quotes come from? What information can I provide that corroborates the real life existence of these quotes? Pulling names out of your ass does not back up anything you say about what those names said. Does that make sense?

                            You are clearly retarded.  So if I provide the quote,
                            <em>
                             "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
                            </em>
                            and tell you Abraham Lincoln said that, Abe is not the source.  You're a one man idiot routine.  Too bad the circus isn't in town.

                             Correct. If that were a news story, and you were the person writing it, Abe would not be your source. The source would be the people at Gettysburg, all of whom saw the speech (while you did not), and everyone they talked to, and most significantly the numerous other publications that reported on it, and subsequent historians who all said the speech happened, and the document itself, written in Abe's handwriting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Edit: that's if you provide those sources, of course.

                              Holy fuck, first of all, Abe Lincoln is the source of that quote.  Second, if you want to say that my quote is wrong then you had better have a source upon which to base your claim and not just pull that statement straight out of your ass.

            One of the most frustrating things about this forum is that people post shit from sources that are obviously not verifiable or reputable. All that does is discredit the real investigation. I've seen a bunch of posts here and elsewhere from this Neon Nettle place. It's scary how easily people fall for it.

              The problem seems like it could be a culmination of confirmation bias, as you said, as well as a flaw in the current content aggregation model. Website like this one not only allow users to vote on content based solely on the title or thumbnail alone, but the design essentially encourages it. I'm sure you're right about the naive younger population, but I think it's because some individuals views this similarly to something like Twitter. Voater fraud is also also much more than likely to be a cause of some of the poor content finding itself on the front page.

                I think you need a real wake up call. You wouldn't know what's behind these satanic rituals if it came up and bit you on the ass. Open your mind not your mouth.

                  You are obviously still wet behind the ears. I have been studying this shit for over 30 years. Trust me the Illuminati is very very real. The world is upside down and inside out, you my friend have been deceived. Satanists are everywhere you look in high up places.    If you can't see this by now then you are still fast asleep. Believe it or not, what satanists do is perform satanic rituals. As for aliens and lizards, I will no longer shut my mind down to things that sound completely crazy. I have gone from being a complete atheist and believing in nothing, to keeping an open mind and ready for anything. One thing is for sure, this world is stranger than any of us could ever know, you only need to. look at quantum physics to realise this. When you get chance take a closer look at quantum computing, be prepared to have your standard world model blown apart.

                  There is a TON of historical evidence proving the existence of the Illuminati.

                  On Aug. 22, 1798 George Washington received a letter from G.W. Snyder warning of the Illuminati.  Excerpt -
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Our present Time, pregnant with the most shocking Evils and Calamities, threatens Ruin to our Liberty and Goverment. Secret, the most secret Plans are in Agitation: Plans, calculated to ensnare the Unwary, to attract the Gay and irreligious, and to entice even the Well-disposed to combine in the general Machine for overturning all Government and all Religion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It was some Time since that a Book fell into my Hands entituled “Proofs of a Conspiracy &amp;c. by John Robison,”1 which gives a full Account of a Society of Freemasons, that distinguishes itself by the Name “of Illuminati,” whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all Religion, even natural; and who endeavour to eradicate every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distinguish Man from Beast by his Shape only. A Thought suggested itself to me, that some of the Lodges in the United States might have caught the Infection, and might cooperate with the Illuminati or the Jacobine Club in France."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Washington responded.  Excerpt --
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “I have heard much of the nefarious, &amp; dangerous plan, &amp; doctrines of the Illuminati, but never saw the Book until you were pleased to send it to me. The same causes which have prevented my acknowledging the receipt of your letter, have prevented my reading the Book, hitherto; namely—the multiplicity of matters which pressed upon me before, &amp; the debilitated state in which I was left after, a severe fever had been removed. And which allows me to add little more now, than thanks for your kind wishes and favourable sentiments, except to correct an error you have run into, of my Presiding over the English lodges in this Country. The fact is, I preside over none, nor have I been in one more than once or twice, within the last thirty years. I believe notwithstandings, that none of the Lodges in this Country are contaminated with the principles ascribed to the Society of the Illuminati. With respect I am Sir Your Obedt Hble Servt Go: Washington” (ALS, PWacD; letterpress copy, DLC:GW; LB DLC:GW).

                  Not having heard from GW, Snyder wrote GW again on 1 Oct. from Frederick: “Some Weeks ago I sent you a Letter with Robison’s Proof of a Conspiracy which I hope you have received. I have since been more confirmed in the Ideas I had suggested to you concerning an Order of Men, who in Germany have distinguished themselves by the Names of Illuminati—German Union—Reading Societies—and in France by that of the Jacobine-Club, that the same are now existing in the United States. It also occurred to me that you might have had Ideas to that Purport when you disapproved of the Meetings of the Democratic-Societies, which appeared to me to be a Branch of that Order, though many Members may be entirely ignorant of the Plan. Those Men who are so much attached to French Principles, have all the Marks of Jacobinism. They first cast off all religious Restraints, and then became fit for perpetrating every Act of Inhumanity. And, it is remarkable, that most of them are actually Scoffers at all religious Principles. It is said that the ‘Lodge Theodore in Bavaria became notorious for the many bold and dangerous Sentiments in Religion and Politics that were uttered in their Harangues, and its Members were remarkable for their Zeal in making Proselytes’; (and no Wonder since the Order was to rule the World.) Is not there a striking Similarity between their Proceedings and those of many Societies that oppose the Measures of our present Government? Even in this small Place the French-Faction is very numerous—their Expressions are like those of Bloody-Lutetia [Lutetia Parisiorum, or Paris]: their Sentiments in exact Unison with those of the Jacobine Club: their Hearts panting for Faggots and Guillotines. The Foundation of their Sanctuary is laid with Lies, and every Stone of the Superstructure reared with Falsehood. They are laboriously employed to excite Discord—to extinguish public Virtue—to break down the Barriers of Religion—to establish Atheism, and work the Downfall of our Civil—and Religious Liberty. Should their perfidious Schemes succeed (I tremble even at the Imagination of the Consequences) what would become of our Columbia?” (ViMtvL).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  GW responded on 10 Oct.: “Sir: It is more than a fortnight since I acknowledged the receipt of your first letter, on the subject of the Illuminati and thanked you for Robinson’s account of that society. It went to the post office as usual addressed to the Rev’d Mr Snyder, at Frederick Town Maryland. If it had not been received before this mishap must have attended it, of which I pray you to advise me, as it could not have been received, at the date of your last, not being mentioned. I am, &amp;c. G. Washington” (typescript, ViMtvL).

                   Still no real evidence.. nothing more than ancient rumours and hearsay from over a hundred years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Just because there were rumours about the "illuminati" over a hundred years ago, doesn't make them true.

                  <p>
                   Should we start believing all the non-sense people used to believe in ancient times, just because they did?

                  <p>
                   This is the same non-sense as the retarded "creationists" who believe that the world was created in 7 days and that evolution doesn't exist, because it says so in the Bible, LOL

                    If you call those historical letters rumours then you don't deserve to be here. Your intuition/research skill must be zero.
Illuminati are a very real society.
I can tell you this ¯+-+++++++++++++++++++++++when he was drunk. And the various books that were part of it. They are tied in with the OTO.. They are very serious people. I saw photos also of various rituals they performed. They summoned what they called spirits and demons and were very very serious about it.
The Illuminati exist. I don't expect you to believe me.
And even if someone could prove it to you.. You would just say .. "So what" cause your an idiot.
Kind of ironic some of the real idiots here thinking people who know Sandy Hook was a setup and other such false flags etc, calling us idiots when we do know the truth about some things.
 When you look into certain things like sandy hook and see all the evidence of crisis actors and faked injuries it becomes obvious.
But people will only see what they want to see.. It doesnt matter how much evidence you show them.. So when they say oh theres no evidence or show me the evidence.. They don't actually want to see the evidence anyway..
Its pathetic.. A waste of time.. Why even bother saying such things.. Why do these people even bother.. Its pointless?!

                      So who do you think the "tribe" is? Or would you prefer to keep that vague.. Would it surprise you to know the tribe consists of the illuminated members of various fraternities like skull and bones at Yale for example.. Which is illuminati controlled..
The Trilateral Commission.. The CFR also.. They are all illuminated fraternities.. So yes it does matter.. History matters.. Because none of this is a new thing that just happened.. Understanding who they are and what their motivations and long term goals are is vital to doing something about all this.. Don't be so narrow minded or short sighted.. The big picture includes them and others.. It helps to know these things.

                     Don't be a retard, just because i don't agree 100% with your phony "illuminati" non-sense doesn't mean i am a shill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Do you realize only a few hundred years ago, people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Nat Geo is not a source of reliable info anymore.. they have been taken over by the Juden and mainstream media.
The Nat Geo cable channel is a joke.. pure CIA / Juden disinfo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Find me an article in Nat Geo that is critical of Israel and zionism.. and we will talk..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The fact that the fat idiot Alex Jones is always talking about the "illuminati" tells me that the whole thing is completely fake.
As i said before, there is no real evidence, it is all hearsay and rumour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize" .. so if you are allowed to talk about the nameless Illuminati, but not talk about the Jews, what does that tell you???
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Illuminati  theories are promoted  by the Juden, to divert attention from themselves.. so basically anyone talking about the "illuminati" is either an idiot or a Jew Shill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So which one are you?

                   The Illuminati Arrives in America (1785)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In 1785, the Columbia Lodge of the Illuminati was established in New York City. Among its members were Governor DeWitt Clinton, Horace Greeley (politician and editor of the New York Daily Tribune), Charles Dana, and Clinton Roosevelt (the ancestor of Franklin D. Roosevelt). Roosevelt wrote a book called Science of Government Founded on Natural Law, in which he wrote:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "There is no God of justice to order things aright on earth, if there be a God, he is a malicious and revengeful being, who created us for misery."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   He referred to himself and other members as the "enlightened ones," and said that the U.S. Constitution was a "leaky vessel" which was "hastily put together when we left the British flag," and therefore needed revision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In 1786, a lodge was started in Portsmouth, Virginia, where allegedly, Thomas Jefferson was a member; followed by fourteen others in different cities of the thirteen colonies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On July 19, 1789 David Pappin, President of Harvard University, issued a warning to the graduating class concerning the Illuminati's influence on American politics and religion. In April 1793 France sent new ambassador Edmond Genet to America so he could collect payment for the American debt incurred during the American Revolution. The money was to be used to finance France's war with England. However, his real reason for being here was to gain political favor for France and spread Illuminism, which he did through the establishment of 'Democratic Clubs.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Washington said [the clubs] "...would shake the government to its foundations," while John Quincy Adams, oldest son of the 2nd President, John Adams who became our 6th President in 1825, said that these clubs were "so perfectly affiliated with the Parisian Jacobins that their origin from a common parent cannot possibly be mistaken." Because of the Illuminati threat, Washington and Adams lobbied Congress to pass the Alien and Sedition Act which was "designed to protect the United States from the extensive French Jacobin conspiracy, paid agents of which were even in high places in the government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In a letter from Adams to Jefferson dated June 30, 1813 he wrote:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "You certainly never felt the terrorism excited by Genet, in 1793 ... when ten thousand people in the streets of Philadelphia, day after day threatened to drag Washington out of his house, and effect a revolution ... nothing but (a miracle) ... could have saved the United States from a fatal revolution of government."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Thomas Paine, author and political theorist, helped the Illuminati infiltrate several Masonic lodges. He revealed his loyalty to them when his book The Age of Reason was published in 1794 which dealt with the role of religion in society. Although he believed in God, he could not accept the entire Bible as being fact. A second volume was published in 1796. An unofficial third volume subtitled: Examination of the Prophecies also appeared, which seriously questioned the deity and existence of Jesus. In 1937 The Times of London referred to him as "the English Voltaire."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On May 9, 1798 Rev. Jedediah Morse, pastor of the Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina preached a sermon at the New North Church in Boston about the Illuminati:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "Practically all of the civil and ecclesiastical establishments of Europe have already been shaken to their foundations by this terrible organization; the French Revolution itself is doubtless to be traced to its machinations; the successes of the French armies are to be explained on the same ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Jacobins are nothing more nor less than the open manifestation of the hidden system of the Illuminati. The Order has its branches established and its emissaries at work in America. The affiliated Jacobin Societies in America have doubtless had as the object of their establishment the propagation of the principles of the illuminated mother club in France ...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I hold it a duty, my brethren, which I owe to God, to the cause of religion, to my country and to you, at this time, to declare to you, thus honestly and faithfully, these truths. My only aim is to awaken you and myself a due attention, at this alarming period, to our dearest interests. As a faithful watchman I would give you warning of your present danger."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Later in July, Timothy Dwight, President of Yale University, told the people of New Haven: "Shall our sons become the disciples of Voltaire (a French writer) and the dragoons of Murat, or our daughters, the concubines of the Illuminati?"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To infiltrate the Masonic lodges in Europe, Weishaupt had enlisted the aid of John Robison who was a long time, high degree Mason in the Scottish Rite, a professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland, a British historian, and Secretary-General to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. When he went to Germany, he was given Weishaupt's revised conspiracy plans to study, in order to expand the Illuminati's influence in the British Isles. However, Robison didn't agree with their principles, and after warning American Masons in 1789, published a book to expose the organization in 1798 called Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All Religions and Governments of Europe, Carried On In the Secret Meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies which presented the Protestant view.

                I believe in ufos 100% too many people have died trying to tell people what's been going on. Phil Schneider and Karla Turner to name two. Unfortunately it's one of their main discrediting tools. Throw the aliens in with X conspiracy and then everyone who believes in X conspiracy is a loon from another planet.

              Nope...Neon Nettle used that symbol about a month before Ben Swann did;

              check the date - December 27, 2016
             </p>
             <p>
              And Ben Swann "went dark" January 27, 2017 first showing that symbol;
             </p>
