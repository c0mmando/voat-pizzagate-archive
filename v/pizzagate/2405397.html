<p>I mean, WTH?!!!! As you probably know, a gun was found and the Secret Service detained the driver. All the drivers in the motorcade were replaced as a safety precaution. Here\'s the story for those who haven\'t read it: </p>

            No. I said what I wanted to say and am fine with it being deleted. Do you hear me complaining? I wanted to get this out there. If others are not shocked that this random woman hit the nail on the head in terms of a gun actually being found in the POTUS motorcade, then I'm flummoxed, but fine. I'm calling attention to it because I didn't want it to go by unnoticed. I noticed it. Here it is in print, but I can't force others to think the way I do -- nor will I try.

             Well, I think it was somewhat strange that he tweeted about the President and we know that he has tweeted about him before and also slammed him on Fox News.  So when this woman (never heard of her before) comes up with a statement that applies Assassination Attempt on President's Day, it is somewhat suspect.  Followed by a Found Gun it is somewhat questionable.  No, we do not know or have proof, but it begs to question.  But I guess that is a matter of opinion.

              well several people on here have inferred that this post doesn't make sense. Just a bunch of non sequiturs and exclamation marks. I'd be more interested if I knew what you were on about.

            Hi there, MP. So what's your Pizzagate premise, here? Are you saying that Reiner was in on an assassination attempt because Trump is taking down the pedocracy? If so, come out and say that -- or however you think this might be related to the abuse of kids by the global elite. Otherwise, we've got to remove this per Rule 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm giving you the 24 Hour Removal Reprieve flair so you can edit the body of the post. Please reply to this comment when you clarify the connection to Pizzagate (don't forget that you need linked support for major claims supporting the thesis). If you don't think this is pizzagate related after further thought, you're welcome to remove it yourself and repost in

             Please don't take offense, but imo the majority of the downvoats are due to a) the title not being directly relevant to pg, b) the content of the post not being directly related to pg, and c) the lack of clarity of your post.

              Rob Reiner calling for a patriot to take out Trump is not relevant to #pizzagate? Hahahahahahhahhahha ... that's a good one.

              Yup, the POTUS being threatened has nothing whatever to do with draining the swamp. And Scalise just wandered in front of a bullet ... and Seth Rich was randomly attacked ... and Rand Paul walked into a fist --  repeatedly ... and Kathy Griffin was holding up a severed head as part of a new bicep / lat workout ... and Reiner just happened to invite Cusack to stay at his home when Coo-coosuck first came to PedoWood and was a minor ... and Coosuck just happened to call the POTUS a child-eating Nazi and RT an article that alluded to guns being Moloch ... and Stephen King just happened to pile on and had nothing whatever to do with Reiner directing two King novels-turned-into-films ... and James Franco,  the actor accused by multiple women of rape, just happened to star in 11.22.63 ... and a random woman just happened to chime in and accurately predict the date of an quote incident unquote and a gun was found in the possession of a motorcade driver who FORGOT that he had it on the date predicted ....

               Exactly...you think like I do. It ALL comes down to Pizzagate, because that seems to be the currency they trade in. They HAVE money so that is of no value to them. Kids are their currency. That said, I am learning the mods kind of want you to spell it out for everyone. We take it as a given, but not everyone else does.  I got a post deleted too, when I didn't do that.

               i'm not saying all the events you listed couldn't possibly be related in a grand conspiracy against the US president, just that there is not much evidence to directly connect them to PG at this point--with the exception of the Scalise attack (due to the human trafficking speech he gave shortly before), and maybe Franco for
               <em>
                possibly/likely
               </em>
               being an elite pedo.

               i appreciate the fact that you can see how people are having trouble following your post.  similarly, if you are having trouble following the sub's guidelines, i encourage you to revisit the rules in the sidebar (particularly #'s 1 and 3).  thanks!

            According to a White House pool report, the Secret Service’s screening that led to the discovery of the gun took place across the street from the Mar-a-Lago resort an hour before the press vans actually joined the presidential motorcade.  THIS could be......Nah there no coincidences. This is Super Sketchy.  Odd I just sent you the comment about RR and Cusack.  RR  inviting him to crash at his place when he first came to Hollywood.  Wow.  RR is In Deep.

              When they started Falling Like Flies, I purged all of them from my existence.  There are a couple on a back burner, but I have already decided they are all a bunch of pedophile rapists or protectors.  I feel much lighter and unburdened. They were all picked for their rolls.  They have groomed us into loving  them for decades and I refuse to bow down any more.

             Yeah, I do not like this one bit. Like I said, I stumbled across it. I wasn't even looking for anything, but there it is! And the dates are clear. RR and Joy's tweets were sent yesterday.
