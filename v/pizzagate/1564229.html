<p>In George Webb\'s latest video, he asserts that child ritual murder and rape is a psyop to prevent trafficking victims from talking. He postulates that most of the trafficked children are used by the CIA for Brownstone operations (blackmailing government officials and employees by entrapping them into illicit acts with children). </p>
<p>According to Webb, the captors scare the children into silence with a fabricated narrative of torture and ritual abuse.   He says that this pattern is a &quot;time honored, classical psyop&quot; which dates back to the Israeli army scaring captured Muslim terrorists by making them believe that they will be killed by a woman and therefore not go to heaven. </p>
<p>He further points out that Ted Gunderson was doing great work in the Franklin Scandal investigation until he delved into MK Ultra and ritual abuse, which Webb believes was a mistake and misguided.

            I suggest you check out Wall Street and The Rise of Hitler.    Seriously.   I suggest anyone lapping up the Jews are responsible for all evil propaganda to read it.   There is a free copy on archive.org I believe.  Easy to find online anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Germany relied on technology transfers that were given long before WW2 started to have the necessary tools to wage war.   The National Socialists received money directly from a number of Wall Street figures and their entire warchest was a result of Wall Street money.
           </p>
           <p>
            You operate with a view that Jews are all actively conspiring with each other as a large group.   They are not.   It doesn't take many to move an entire group of people in a certain direction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite frankly, the leadership did not care about what could or would happen to Jewish people because their people are actually devil worshippers.   Not Jewish.    And those people are out and around all over in various colors.    Including but not limited to a large number of "Jews".   The holocaust provided great insulation for Jewish power at the top who as we know are not really Jewish.   Or as I'm sure you'd say, Holohoax.   I do not believe it was a hoax.   I believe the numbers are somewhat fictitious but that is irrelevant to me... if it's 1 million or 1 person, it's too many.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Hitler is notorious for his love of the occult.    Because he was part of the gang the entire time.   And those who created the conditions for German's to be upset knew full well what the result would be.   They are much smarter people than you or I.

            I think he's saying that going down the Alefantis road isn't going to lead to the biggest fish within or closely tied to gov't (which is his focus). I also think he's misinformed about Alefantis. I wrote a comment to him telling him that I think Alefantis and surrounding issues are real, but may not tie directly to the way he is going. Might be more DC insider and some overlap rather than the broader thing he is working on. I really don't know, but I'm glad he took it down. Of course he could be psy-opping us. Ugh.

            Exactly, why not say with all this bounty it will be put into a trust fund for any traffic victims so they can get the help they need for life if need be?  After all the money came off their backs~
Not that the bounty will ever exist...just sayin.

           <p>
            Very interesting/just listened to today's vids/he deleted #5 82 bc ppl misunderstood what he meant about satanic things plus it was on a low quality laptop.  Well, if he ever wants a copy/bc he doesn't backup right/ I have one lol.  Took him till part 3 today to correct the Egyptian mansion is in NYC/his ah ha moment lol. Poor Abby kept asking him to correct it in earlier parts today,  he was still pushing the Muslim Brotherhood meeting at the mansion slightly revised, not really them but the dyncorp police who then met with the MB (something like that anyway) And he's still pushing the IRS Lottery but he won't take any of the money/what a guy eh.  He's going to turn it over the facebook ratline to distribute it accordingly.  Graphic included of how much you get for what highlighted in yellow.  Let's all be millionaires!!!!!
When I take off the blinders from a limited hangout it looks like a whole different world/catch little things that slid past me before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well that's it for me today/beautiful fog in the woods...I'm going to go play with the animals.  Thanks EVERYONE for your comments and enlightenment's.  Such a nice group of folks and fello seekers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ciao~
Oh, and hey George...waving to you :p  Do stay safe since your life is on the line :p

             Ah, just scanning comments for today part one and this comment...
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Also, unless something has changed, the Muslim Brotherhood people are not popular with Sisi in Egypt.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Which would explain why he changed his tune part 2 about MB didn't actually meet at the mansion in Egypt which by part 3 was oh my gosh, it's not in Egypt.  A quick, like first page search, verifies what the commentator said/sheesh.  Not sure what the point would be steering in that direction unless it's a sloppy limited hangout.  Then again something I'm not seeing.  Could just serve as a distraction from this ritual stuff/have not a clue.

              The deal is he's telling the fbi if they will just release the emails and drop him off the JTTF target list (he supposedly got on it a few years ago) and leave him alone he will drop the dyncorp thing.  He knows it's terrible for his listeners to hear and girls are being murdered (yeah that does suck) but he 'believes' it's had enough exposure they will have to clean it up.  In the mean time sucks be to you if you're one of the girls right?  He knows he's being selfish for himself and his family.  Is this the family that is clueless he is risking his life daily???

             <p>
              Oh, and at the first of the vid he mentions someone commented on his case comparing it to ufo's.  I'm pretty sure I saw that here?  But his case was more like a stinger and ppl pointed him in the right direction and he would strike.

               Make a screenshot of the comments if you can. I would upload it to the PG sticky on 8chan. I can make a webm of it after you upload it to YT and post it there.

            if you take your whole world view from one person whom we know not who he really is then you should buy this beach front proptery i have available.  Its torture these people are witches and alot of witch ritials involve little childern sacarfices.  Hell MK ultra with the teddy bear is a prime example  they give this bear so much power over the child then it psychally breaks the child when they destory it.

They've been working on this for over ten years and have loads of vids that are both professional and sourced. Sibel was FBI and became a whistleblower. Instead we get Uncle George from CIA.

            There may be some freaks, and of course it's possible there's a larger proportion of jewish freaks than say, christian or muslim or hindu freaks (I have no idea), but let's avoid generalizing.

            That whole scam was laffable.  Right, IRS bounty will be billions, some of you will get 10 million, some 1 million and others 1000 for each tweet.  One lady posted she did Instagram, did that count
            <em>
             roflmao
            </em>
            .
To top it off we only have 7 days to do this bc once Trump is installed game over and we have to wait another 13 years for some brave representative like Cynthia Ann McKinney to start the process all over again.
First, what the heck is this 13 years?
Second why do we have to wait/bc everyone in congress is compromised/not asking tough questions?
And my god, Feinberg is an advisor, not cabinet.  But let's all hit the panic button (fear controls so well) bc if we don't pull it off in 7 days doom doom doom.  And btw, you could be rich someday, millions even.
           </p>
           <p>
            So all the folks are tweeting up a storm to Trey, Jason, Trump, Fox and every other damn twitter they can think of plus writing emails, making calls (all together now panic 1, 2, 3) and THAT is what makes the investigation look stupid.  He has done his best to make everyone look like friggin fools and quite possibly derailed the movement.  Let's hope the awake ones in congress don't fall for his bs.

           <p>
            We need to spread the word he's cia and stop this shit in it's tracks.

            You are seeing thru your bias (no offense intended I promise).  I like to believe the best in ppl too.  But if you listen to his latest vids he hammers away at certain key points, inconsistencies and down right false and/or misleading statements.  He tries to paint Stephen Feinberg (dyncorp) as in cahoots with the Muslim Brotherhood.  When I saw that I'm like wtf?  He's Jewish.

            I don't know if he's in denial or what, but it seems like implying there's ritual abuse and murder is counter-productive. Murder threats alone would be enough for anyone from talking to the public, it's unnecessary to put the occult satanists in black robes slant on it. I could only see the boogie man angle working on powerful criminals, like kingpins, who fear nothing else. He has changed his tune before, he might do so on this too.

            IMHO we are being hoodwinked.  He keeps talking about willing to die blah blah.  Someone asked him if he has told any family so if he is suicided they can let his followers know.  He said he hasn't told his family bc he doesn't want to scare them.  So are we to believe that his family doesn't use the internet?  Or if they do they are so 'limited' all they know is fakebook and the likes?  Nah, I don't buy that at all.  He's very dramatic about laying his life on the line for the greater good/ppl praying for him daily.  If he was exposing something so dangerous he wouldn't be around today.
            <br/>
            I think the plan is to focus on child trafficking and steer folks away from the satanic stuff.
Lately he keeps saying (he's so altruistic) that he doesn't care if immunity is given to all, just stop the child trafficking.  Now, if you and your co conspirators were facing serious prison time wouldn't you want that idea to be planted into mass consciousness?  Just let them all go, it's okay, just save the children.  You can keep your fancy homes and lifestyle (Hill transferred 1.8 billion to Dubai).
Save the children...now where have we heard that thru out history?  Including all the draconian rules here with forced vaccinations just to name one.

              That's another good point I missed.  I'm learning so much.  Is he really disinfo or plagiarizing stooge/who can say.  throwawaa just posted they did a search on him and thinks he might be legit/I replied.  None the less, mirroring is a good thing to remember.  Yates suggested George served to scare ppl from researching.  That kinda fits too.  Geo latest vid where he goes on about his years of harassment by the fbi.  How many want to take that one on?  Oh what the heck, my millions will be waiting for me/now I just have to learn how to tweet lol.
I appreciate that we can have this kind of discussion, mods haven't busted us yet
              <em>

              bc we all learn something/least ways I certainly have.  Even if it's just learning how to spot black holes so we don't get sucked in and waste time.  Better to spend time doing what you want right?  Upvotes to all if I could but I'm on restrictions.  It's the thought that counts right?

            Yes. Another thing, I am certain his Braverman vids started weeks after Eric went missing. I paid very close attention to that story and he started the vids around the early 20's or so.  CIA always lie.

            Well, this certainly explains all the slaughter I see of Palestinian children, like young, and some babies (couple that was burned in their home with infant).  Of course no blood libel in these cases but still the total disregard for children.  Not to dismiss it also occurs on the Arab side.  Mercy, the slaughter that goes on between the groups is absolutely mind boggling/horrifying.  Regardless of individual beliefs I still can't wrap my head around how anyone anywhere cannot see the innocent in children's eyes, I just can't fathom it AT ALL.
I would up-vote you too (and some others but I need more contribution points).  I'll return in 24 hours to up-vote you all.
Thanks so very very much for

            It is a solid strategic move, whether he believes it's truly psyop or not. It is best for him to stay focused on what is most legally factual and understood. The dark occult aspects that we know to be true will emerge as time goes on. Let's keep supporting George in his investigations because they ARE having an impact.

             You can support him if you like but I'm tired of people gushing over his shit videos to the extent that important threads are shoved down the catalog. What, you want to hear more about arms sales? Really? This is a pizzagate sub and he is off topic. Too many damn cheerleaders for George and it's very suspicious. Same people squeal with delight when his vids are posted and I'm not buying it, it's a contrived audience and he is manipulating everyone here. Remember it's the CIA that is intimately involved in this, so now we have an "ex" CIA guy that lies about it and yet has become the focus in the sub. He is the very description of CONTROLLED OPPOSITION. He needs to have his minions post his vids in another  PG sub that is less strict  about submissions. Fuck this spook downplaying the most important aspects of this mess. Look at his twitter, he follows several dozen self admitted MKUltra survivors, targeted individuals(TI's), victims of the deep state, abuse victims, yet he downplays it here? No man, not buying what he's selling.

            As an aside but interesting 'game fake' storyline.  There is a Ted Gunderson in Fallout New Vegas (Obsidian games) wiki info here
            <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Gunderson">
             http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Gunderson
            </a>
            &gt;While accompanying his father to the Ultra-Luxe, Ted Gunderson was mistakenly kidnapped by the faction of the White Glove Society loyal to Mortimer, who intended to serve him at a special dinner designed to convert the society to cannibalism.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When Ted's identity is discovered, however, Mortimer voices his new unwillingness to serve Ted, and requests the Courier to find a new "main course" to continue on with their plan. Mortimer also gives the Courier the option of killing Ted, and framing his father for the murder

             Not as new as he pretends to be.  He has very skillfully painted the picture he didn't want to go there (kids) but now regrettably has too and then starts the spin.  I know I know, he comes off as so sincere, can't help but feel sorry for him (life in danger ya da)...but listen to what he is saying and the direction he is leading ppl into.

               I picked up on George somewhere in the late 60's or early 70's vids/can't remember.  He had me hook, line and stinker (grin).
Few little naggins here and there that made me go um...but I wanted to 'believe'/bias works like that.  Day 82 series was so over the top STUPID my bias crumbled.
It's a bitch when you believe in someone but even more of a bitch when cognitive dissonance keeps you from seeing thru the ruse (been there and done that way too many times
               <em>
                grin
               </em>
               ).
He's CIA and somewhat skilled at pulling a limited hangout.  He just lost his focus and rushed it.
The question is why the rush?

                Once you're caught up in your own success it's hard to balance the work with quality. I always work on the premise that if you throw shit at the wall and it doesn't stick 9 times out of 10, then that 1 time out of 10 is often worth the listen. I find his videos informative as much as tedious, only small doses for me.

            If anything is a psyop its OPs post.  Theres most definitely a sprawling satanic cult thats the root cause of this abuse. No matter where you look its what it leads to and it appears to involve the international banks and the elite political cast of nearly every country.  To say otherwise is nonsense.

            blood libel~this is the first I've heard of this/and geez I thought I've heard of everything.  On search mostly claims it's propaganda (to be expected).  Can you direct me to information that is not speculation or best guessing?  Something concrete I can dig into?
thank you~my inquiring mind

              Thank you...downloading now.  Search kept bringing up blood libel is a hoax and instead of wading thru this and that (bc I do take responsibility for searching) thought what the heck, go ahead and ask.
Much appreciated :)  I would upvote but apparently I can only upvote 10 in 24 hours till I have more contribution points.

            While I won't disagree that there are a disproportionate number of "Jewish" (I use that term loosely) people involved in this, I wonder what your thoughts about WW2 and Hitler are then?    Because I often see those who attempt to pin everything on Jewish folk worship Hitler as some kind of savior.   But the truth is he was run by the bankers and wouldn't have existed without them.   He basically did what they wanted him to do.   You can read Antony Sutton's work on that.   It's pretty well done IMO.   I even went through and independently verified a bunch of the documents he used.

            Which brings me to my next point - Trump kind of scares me.   I see a lot of people getting on board.   That's fine, I have some hope for him too.   But then he brings in some real scum along with him that makes me raise my eyebrows.   Because to me, it would be way too easy to get the general population to vote for a populist anti establishment demigogue if they really wanted that to happen.   And all the free air time etc that he got... it just feels too perfect to me.   The folks responsible for this nightmare have been running the world for a very long time and they are very intelligent people.   Some of the most intelligent in the world (whether we like to admit this or not).   They would not be in the positions they are in if they were not - regardless of their willingness to break laws etc.
           </p>

            They controlled their biggest opposition the last go around (Hitler).   Why not this time too (Trump) ?

             Extreme WW1 reparations caused a Jewish backlash in Germany. But the greed of Zionists outweighed consideration for their own people.

              They lacked concern because they knew what was going to happen to them.   They now use this as insulation for criticism as a lot of them are in fact of Jewish ancestry.   And they still basically run the Nazi side of the equation because it's real easy to discredit all of this when you start to blame everything on a single group of people.

            That's an aspect of this which will indeed be a bitter pill to swallow for many.  World view alterations are usually difficult, and the more radical they are, the more difficult they are.

             That is very interesting.  Yes, what is his agenda?  Day 83 part 4 see Abby's comments.  George says Feinberg has an Egyptian mansion in Egypt that is the hub for the Muslim Brotherhood.  A quick search says Feinberg bought the 103 year old Egyptian mission to the UN/renovated it/complete with interior pix.  Abby points out a few other 'errors' in reporting.  Either he is not that good at fact cking or what???

              I think he's typical CIA. He's here to do a job so his agenda trumps facts. He seems to be flooding the investigation with too much info, muddying the waters. So many here are new to the red pill and can get lost in all the stuff he presents and end up straying far away from PG.
             </p>
             <p>
              In his early vids he discounted the trafficking and said pizza meant arms which is why I stopped watching his vids and probably why he deleted them. Who the fuck doesn't save their YT vids to a memory stick or something, c'mon, he had to rework his strategy because with that tactic no one here would listen to him. Funny how he's slowly coming back around to that in this vid but after he has flooded this sub with his daily vids and earned the trust of some here.
             </p>
             <p>
              His twitter follows many ex-cia and also  quite a few people who are MKUltra survivors and gangstalk/deep state victims so his attempt to minimize that is suspect. CIA created MKUltra, you can read the declassified CIA docs online.

              interesting reading, he seems to be sowing doubt that Trump can battle the rogue intelligence agencies but he's subtle about it, yet that attitude is consistent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also he speaks positively about Obama in several past vids yet his timeline in late 2016 was all pro Trump

              He needs to come clean or stop spamming his vids here. Fucking hell, a CIA guy has become one of the most prominent PG YTers but it's the CIA that is so intricately involved in this and they're dirty as hell. He presents himself as a retired entrepeneur with time on his hands, just some regular guy with life experience, wants to help. This is called CONTROLLED OPPOSITION and I would bet that he's also a mod.

               Ah see, I didn't watch his early vids.  Sure, he deleted them and restructured the narrative.  He says he releases a bit each day to monitor the reaction/too much too soon ya da.  How about CIA operative seeing how well the story-line is going?
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, right, when I heard his vids had mysteriously disappeared I thought everyone keeps backups unless they are noobs/which he obviously is not.  Note to self, quit ignoring red flags.

               Yeah on Obama, keeps saying he voted for him twice, likes him.  Sure, Bama is just a nice guy potus who is clueless how to control his SOS and all the other war mongers/drone, who me (children no less)?  I guess in his frustration the multi-million dollar vacations and golfing help relieve the stress.  Poor guy.  Let's not forget 65k for hotdogs.  Or that his mother in law will get 160k for life as former staff/wtf?

               I had serious concerns when Trump shifted on the Israel situation.  I did not realize all his family ties until one poster enlightened me.  The good news is that it's bought the masses some time.  Hill would have trust us into WW3 in a flash.  Consciousness is shifting/the pendulum thing.  Ultra liberal to ultra conservative but eventually balance will prevail (I really do believe this).  I'm seeing too many signs globally and even in the animal kingdom...

               The important thing is we keep steady to the course.
Not buy into the fear matrix/bc that gives it strength.
Remain true to our hearts and do whatever we chose individually to keep raising our consciousness.
There are so many lovely 'tools' out there to facilitate the process.

                he changed it right before he started with PG. It's the CIA that is involved in this so why did he hide it? Why would you trust them?

                Day 82 is what blew it for me/5 parts.  Since George is so fond of storyboards/look at day 82 like a storyboard and see how it leads you.  Read Abby's comments day 83 part 4/George's fabrications.  For someone who is so supposedly meticulous those are glaring errors.  But ppl keep wanting to give ol'George the benefit of the doubt, make excuses for him (I was one of them).  It had to smack me in the face to drop my bias.  When I did it was clear as day.  Reason I came here looking for 'more'.  Boy oh boy, did I find MORE lol.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here's another on for you.  George tweeted on Jan 10th...Hillary leaked Trump Epstein video to the Russians. Do you understand Putin has the Bill videos?
               </p>
               <p>
                Some questioned wtf?
His reply...Two Trump videos. 1993. Bj and full deal later on. Hillary leaked it. She won't stop.
               </p>
               <p>
                Even tho tweeters asked for more he let it drop and that was it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is there a vid/I have no idea.  Trump seems a little too cautious to fall into that trap/but how would I know.
But why would Hill leak it to Putin/that makes no sense what so ever.  And when Putin didn't release it (assuming he even had it which is a huge stretch) what's to stop her from having it leaked elsewhere/not like she doesn't have major news sources to leak too.
Hill wanted her coronation.  Podesta wanted to be SOS.  Huma was the Muslim Brotherhood handler.  Bill, ha, he was probably just excited over having new interns.  Chelsea was being primed for her rise in politics.  And not to forget as long as Hill was in power it means billions in donations which of course translates to extortion or pay to play.
Plus steady stream of fresh children necessary for a whole host of ventures.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, George is very skilled at dropping cryptic sound bites.  He leaves you hanging and there ya go, tails to chase your tales.
               </p>
               <p>
                When he said Bundy, Gacy and Dahmer were part of a brownstone I asked how does that work/didn't make sense.
Of course, no reply.
               </p>
               <p>
                The problem we get into with George is he plays on sympathy...his life is in danger, willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.  Every morning I along with many others would ck for a new vid/oh thank god, he's still alive.
Now he's the golden boy of alt news.

                 You mean day 82 I assume?
                </p>
                <p>
                 If it's true that he's making this up, where does that leave us.  It's so confusing.

                <p>
                 I mean, it sure looks like [someone] is doing this pattern of country topples to exploit the resources.  Is he just pointing at the wrong conspirators?  He is demanding the release of Huma's emails, and pointing to true stuff.  Is he just trying to distract us with some stuff that isn't true?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is it possible he's onto something but is just clumsy and careless about the proof, and letting a lot of false information slip into his videos?  Or is he trying to discredit us by showing 50% truth and 50% rubbish, so that when we quote him, people can easily debunk us and show us as wackos?

                  Yes, disinformation is always partly true but the effect is what I quoted. Also he's hoping to get the best and most curious investigators to start looking elsewhere. When he drops statements with no backup and doesn't reply to queries the investigator goes down another rabbithole and time is wasted or they become overloaded and confused and quit.

                  Right, sry, day 82.  Part 4 look for Abby's comments.
In a limited hangout much of the info is true (the hook).
Once hooked the disinfo is subtly inserted.  Steven Pieczenik same deal.
George starts with a casual comment here and there (I like Obama, he's a good guy or Bill Clinton is likeable minus the rape, yes he really said that).
Limited hangouts exist to control the opposition.  Since there is opposition the best way to handle it is by controlling it.
“The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.” Lenin
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So you give info that is already in the wild and add some more.  Ppl sense the 'ring of truth'.
Then you take them off course so they go in the wrong direction or make them look like fools.
George's billions dollar lottery from the IRS is of the looking like fools category
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course he's demanding the release of Huma's emails...him and thousands others/nothing new.
Re the 50/50, it's not unusual to find it more like 90% true and 10% false.
Plus attitudes are shaped by casual comments.
George said, Bama and Bill C, good guys basically/qualifying except for Bill's rapes which is just a minor character flaw.  Some stupid stories to justify such that they would go to bbq's and really get down with the voters.  Okay, I'll have a bbq on bun, side of slaw and sprinkle of drones on kids, weddings, funerals etc.  George saves all his vilification for Hill/the good, bad cop thing.  Masses need a villain.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Steve P said Kissinger, Nixon, good guys.  Chelsea C, good kid, straight up kinda gal.
What I have found for the 2 most recent (bc thankfully I'm not caught in limited hangouts all that much anymore) is the absurd angle/like George with the IRS windfall.
With Steve P is was, prior to the election, Chelsea is our only hope, I've known her since she was a kid.  I'll talk to her and get her to convince her mom to drop out...remember, our only hope.  That was another red flag, the first 2 being Kissinger and Nixon (but my bias and wanting to believe brushed those off).  With this 'only her daughter can save us' I'm like oh right, mom, let's have a talk, you simply must drop out of the race.  Okay daughter dear, you are absolutely right.  Sure, completely plausible.  Steve's last vid before the election was preparing us for the peaceful transfer of power, meaning suck it up, no riots etc.  He worded it carefully enough that what he said could be taken either way (Trump or Hill win) but I know what I felt...and it was oh shit/she will steal the election.  Steve had his bases covered.  I'm not the only one who interpreted it as oh shit either.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The reason limited hangouts work is that for the majority of us we simply like to believe the best in ppl.  So we get duped here and there, so what.  It's a testament to our innate good nature.  Oh, one more thing about limited hangouts.  By watching them you can see who is expendable and being tossed under the bus so I'm still going to watch George now that I know what's going on...it's popcorn time

                 <p>
                  I 'think' and it's only guessing, that Hill was the chosen one, would have speeded up NWO in rapid fire (pun intended) but the momentum of Trump made it too hard to rig the election in the numbers needed bc so many eyes were watching. The very ratios of elector to popular votes that he got were the ones predicted for Hill.  She would win the electoral college but he would win the popular/which would somewhat placate the masses.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think that Trump is basically patriotic and cares about this country.  He loves money, likes being the big time builder, loves attention and adoration. He's a narcissist and they like to be perceived in a good light.  So is Bama but his hands were tied by his handlers so he had to do really stupid and unpopular things.  How much Trump's hands will be tied is yet to be seen.  The other thing with Bama is he is a NOC, created by the CIA, Communist radical Muslim so he really didn't give a flip about any of us/but he still wanted adoration/must have been a real catch 22 for him.  Honestly, look at the way he's acting out now, giving himself some Medal of Honor (yep gave it to himself) and all he can talk about is himself in the farewell address.  I 'think' Trump will be more susceptible to popularity polls (I think he would love the popularity Putin enjoys) and ppl do expect delivery on promises.  This could create some 'come to jesus' moments in relation to his family.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hill couldn't give a flying you know what about any of us.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I went from not liking him but anything better than Hill (nuke war and baby eating were more than I could handle) to growing quite fond of him.  I have friends who think he's an answer to prayers and others that express caution.  With the shift in Israel and his family structure, plus the strong influence of Ivanka and her crooked hubby, well, unless he goes rogue, she was the one who got him to soften his approach on Israel...
Or has a plan to play them all, but I just don't see that with his adoration of Ivanka and praise of his son in law.  With Trump it 'seems' like his first loyalty is to family.
Still it seems logical we can expect some improvements bc this country is a hot bed.  The masses need to be calmed, business thrives better in a functioning economy rather than digging out from nukes and radiation.  It 'seems like' the neocons have figured out how to make lemonade from lemons.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And who knows, what if he is being played by his fav child and if that is the case and he sees such (if he's being played and not playing along) then I go to an older interview I saw with Ivanka last night on Jimmy K's program.  She said she was listening to the radio and the interviewer asked Donald if he would fire any of his kids if they blew a job.  He said absolutely and fire them like a dog.  Jimmy asked if Ivanka thought he was sincere and she said oh you bet.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The other thing to factor in, so don't lose hope, is there is presently a mass consciousness awakening.  It's a reflection of the 'times' and has nothing to do with who is POTUS.  Trump is not and never was the solution, he's the wake up call and frankly I think he does a damn good job at that

                  It's also a perfect time to sharpen our skills so we don't go around in hero worship of fill in the blank, whether youtube poster or government figure head or one of my friends that keeps sending me 'the space beings are going to save us, any day now, really any day'.

                  The beauty of the internet is the narrative cannot be controlled any more.
Already there is web 2, Zero Net, bc ppl have been expecting censorship and constant surveillance.  Bright young minds are making new avenues as we speak.
This is train that cannot be stopped.
Stay strong, find joy in your everyday life, learn to spot false avenues.  It's how we learn to think for ourselves.  I personally lean towards meditation (I love guided meditations, makes it easy to quiet my mind) and come spring will incorporate yoga once again.  Martial arts another good one for centering and finding balance.  If I didn't have esoteric 'stuff' I'm sure I would go completely mad.  It helps me to see the expanded picture and not get lost in the daily details which other than my personal life, are out of my control.  The contribution I make to the 'out of my control' stuff is the more balance and harmony I manifest is added to mass consciousness/that is my part to play.  I wish Trump the very best that he can reach his best whatever that is for him/lots or little doesn't matter.  It's much more productive than sending him negative vibrations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Find the avenues that bring you inner peace.  Don't know where to start?  Ask and unseen friends will light your path.  It could be a chance encounter, a book you stumble on, so many magical ways the path starts opening up.  I've been at this over 50 years and never once has a path failed to open up once I asked.  Sometimes it hit me on the head when I wasn't asking stumbling around in my illusion, delusion and confusion lol...hey, you...see 'this' and the magic begins.

                   So I took a break and then came back and researched george webb some more.  I'm not certain of course, but I think it's possible he's legit or at least not intentionally working for the bad guys, even if his stuff isn't all accurate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'll admit that:
- he's tossed out false leads, like the Rahman connection that has no proof
- his whole bounty thing is ridiculous
- his thing for obama and bill clinton is odd, but honestly I half liked obama myself until I got into pizzagate
- he's said a lot of things that might intimidate people or scare them away from researching
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think it's possible to chalk these up to some level of ignorance/delusion/carelessness.  We don't all see the same set of information so we don't all see things the same way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   His linkedin shows that he's had a lot of jobs and been recommended by a lot of people:
                   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwebb">
                    https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwebb
                   </a>
                   So if he was a fake person, that would be a very long con.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   He seems to have started talking about FBI informant stuff in mid 2015 based on his youtube channel and social media / blog / forum posts I've found from him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is possible, sure, that he was taken control of by the CIA at some point, and they got him to start doing this stuff in 2015.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But it's also possible he's just a mid-fifties guy, retired in 2013 apparently, who got interested in this stuff until it became an obsession.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm trying to judge whether the whole "regime change investor club" he talks about is legit, even if not all of his details are correct.  All the other information I can find leads me to believe it is generally accurate or at least completely plausible.  Then again, the CIA is probably a large odd number of reverse psychology layers ahead of me.  :p

                    I never thought he was a fake person.  Didn't consider CIA until coming here, seeing his previous twitter handle and some of the folks he follows.  I don't have linkedin so wasn't able to see that w/o signing up.  I don't even tweet
                    <em>
                     grin
                    </em>
                    .  It's like Steve P...I didn't know about him till late October, his famous we are here to save you black and white vid (using b and w has certain qualities for imparting an intended message).  Heck, at that time I would grab on to anything/I was in a panic about the election.  When the choice is between an entertaining, rabble rousing narcissistic megalomaniac and a narcissistic child eating psychopath hell bent on WW3/the choice was easy.  So Steve sucked hub and me both right in.  Catch a few breaths.  Shortly before the election he does the Chelsea vid that was absurd and frankly 'felt like' he was preparing us for the big let down.  Toss in praise of Kissinger and Nixon, more bitter mind candy.  Started digging around on ol'Steve, ex spook, lots of questionable information.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    True I haven't researched George as much/enough tho to have doubts.  As far as liking coke head Bill C...he's a violent rapist for christ's sake.  I have to wonder what kind of man 'likes' that kind of vile creature.  Says a lot to me about character.  Add to that the trail of dead bodies, it wasn't all Hill's doing/they are a team.  So yeah, I don't like murders and rapist/call me old fashioned.
Bama, he has been behind so much murder/take just the drones he has ordered/on teenagers none the less/US citizens.  He's gay, which is fine, but having one of his lovers killed (that we know about)...that just doesn't sit right with me.  Having Briebart off'ed, that sucked, and the other kinda coroner.  Is this really necessary?  Libya cannot be blamed on Hill alone, or Benghazi.  He's POTUS, he's supposed to be in charge.  Add to that bummer care that has ruined so many lives (I know some personally).  Again, maybe I'm the odd one out, but I just don't like murders, destroyers of families and pathological liars.  Don't like destroyers of countries either.  Maybe I just don't mix well with psychopaths.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As far as George is concerned/why did he change his twitter handle/but perhaps it was a joke.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The thing about limited hangouts is they hang around till needed.  Alex Jones, limited hangout.  Plenty more I've stumbled on over the years.  Ones not as known as Alex just show up as needed/like Steve right before the election supposedly showing his face for the first time.  Lots of the limited hangouts are kinda like sleeper cells.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Or, he has a flare for drama (they're coming to get me any day), has some good information that others have written extensively about (he mentions such) and throw in erroneous information bc well, he is kinda stupid.  I saw too many errors in his ramblings not to take notice.  Finding out his original explanation for pizza was arms...he's either an idiot or trying to frame a narrative.  Maybe cia is to generous, how bout paid troll?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    One thing that does catch my attention, just like with Steve P, or Alex who scared the living shit out of ppl with the fake 2000 scare, not to mention Bill Cooper, who was imho the real deal, explains how Alex is disinfo, is when someone like George who has a growing following comes up with this we only have 7 days to pull this off or we are doomed for 13 years.  Maybe he just likes to spread fear porn/that is a distinct possibility.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And now we are to believe that he's offering the fbi a deal to back off dyncorp in exchange for the 650 K emails if they agree to take him off the harrassment target list?  If he seriously believes this then he deff is stupid.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm just not comfortable with someone who has so many holes in his narrative.  CIA, disinfo, limited hangout or idiot/doesn't matter in the long run I guess.  Do consider tho the govt has a huge multi million dollar budget to keep trolls on the payroll.  They seem like ordinary ppl and do ordinary things.  Thats the beauty of it, they walk among us.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I also question when the throws out things like Clinton leaked a tape of Trump having a bj and later full deal in 93 with no follow up even tho his twitter fans said what?  Can you say more?  What would be the purpose of such a statement?  And why in the world would Hill leak it to Putin instead of leaking it to one of her news buddies?  Somethings not right is all I can say.  Dots don't connect and when they don't I get suspicious.  I'll keep watching to see how this plays out.  I appreciate your research and input.  I think this discussion, while straying from pizzagate is beneficial/we are formulating new ideas.  Expansion is a good thing.  Thank you~

                     His proposed deals with the FBI are of course nonsense.  The "pizza is arms" thing was so obviously wrong that I assumed he just hadn't really looked into pizzagate yet... if he's really a clever fake, you'd think he wouldn't try something so silly.  But I dunno.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I can't really make up my mind whether he's a kind of delusional ego-maniac who has some good info (I know that type exists), or a paid shill of some kind.  But you're right it doesn't really matter.  I guess what I should do is try to find other sources around the "regime change investor club" and see if that narrative holds based on other sources.

                        I followed Libya start to finish.   It absolutely broke my heart.  Cried more than I can remember.  Horrible what they did/inhumane does not begin to describe.  Libya was as close to paradise that I have seen in a country/and the most democratic, Jamahiriya, which is true to Islamic law, equal rights for women, illegal to charge interest on loans, so much more,amazing doctrine.  Check out The Green Book online if you are interested. Even thinking about it and I feel a thud in my heart/I'm still not over it.  Did Hill bring in a private army...I watched it happen.  Did they knowingly let ISIS get the sarin gas and use it in Syria/absolutely/it's the reason she off'ed Stevens/the Libyan ppl loved him, held candlelight services holding beautiful signs saying he loved Libya and they loved him which is stark contrast to 'at this point what does it really matter'.  The story is easy to trace on reliable foreign news.  Brownstones, you bet.  This is a matter of record.  Epstein, absolutely. CCC and petrofac, again all documented.  The big Allepo thing going on/there was a push to get there before the Russians to move the gas.  Russia got there first, discovered an entire warehouse, can prove it's from the US and plans to present it to the world court/reason bama is trying to stir things up with Syria, Israel too bombing the airport out of Damascus.  Reason the fake news is once again trying to blame the sarin on Assad (who is highly regarded by the majority of the population by the way).  The biggest complaint about him is they call him 'soft heart' and wish he was tougher like his dad.  The first lady is an amazing woman/true servant of the ppl.  They live in a simple apartment, no special guards or anything.  Kaddifi road around in an open car waving to the ppl and they followed him adoringly.  Never see anything like that happening here would you?

                        What George did, and he even says such, is put it into storyboard form where it's easy to connect the dots.  It's an effective approach.  When George stuck to tried and true info all cked out.  It's when he went off script that things got strange.  Did he get carried away with his delusions of grandeur or have an agenda/I really can't say.

                       George Webb used that expression a few times on his posts here on voat, IIUC it's basically the people who are blackmailed via brownstones or whatever, and knowingly support the topples, and make a profit off it.  e.g. all the people who got a chunk of Gaddafi's money in return for their support on libya, etc.

                   I don't trust any of them.  What I'm trying to do now is put together a collection of pretty reliable facts that ought to wake up anybody in America.  Mostly not pizza-related.  I started drawing from George Webb's videos, but some of his key points don't have any proof I can find.  So yeah... I dunno.  Maybe I should just go meditate.

                    That gave me good laff, thanks :p
I know it sucks at first.  I've been thru this so many times, every election looking for some signs of life.
I never thought I'd have the privilege to see another cultural revolution like the 60's.
Imagine my utter shock when I discovered that movement was a CIA brainchild.
But still I grew from that revolution.  Lot of my friends morphed to yuppies/I said screw it and moved to the woods and here I've stayed ever since.
Revolutions go thru a lot of shifts/this one is just coming out of the birth canal.
These things take 'time'/time of course being an illusion so we can experience this matrix.
Just hang in there, really, you'll be fine.
I used to read from so many sources that we wanted to come at this particular time/a hot topic so to speak.
Friends I would commiserate with we'd go oh yeah, what the fuck for?
It's all pretty clear to me now.
It's as Ed Sullivan (that dates me doesn't it) would say 'we have a really big showwwwwwwww'.
This is the big show/enjoy the ride.
I love Bill Hicks...he and 2 friends went out to the country to experience the harmonic convergence and he had an epiphany/very cool story (I watched a docu on his life).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    maybe this will cheer you up :p

                    This one is pretty cool too...CIA tried to discredit the anti war movement with psychedelics.  Problem was it opened our minds and we saw even more the horrors of war so they shut the movement down.  Few suspicious deaths rapid fire, Hendrix, Joplin, Morris and the mind expanding drugs disappeared virtually over night.  I never understood how until my discovery several years ago who was pulling the strings.  But we made lemonade out of lemons
                    <em>
                     wink
                    </em>
                    .
The cool thing with meditation is I can hit that expanded state without the psychedelics/which is good bc I don't trust anything offered on the streets these days, haven't for over 30 years.  I gave up trying :(

            Whatever the accuracy of Webb's take, it's a good opportunity for us all to take stock of the DIVERSITY within the paedo community. 
Yes, there is Satanic Ritual Abuse, on the periphery, and the rich-boys-club ‘initiation rites’ and re-commitment rites. Then there are despicable Intelligence agency blackmail programs to entrap powerful people. Back in the 60’s they used to use extra-marital affairs and homosexual encounters for coercion, but since these activities became widely accepted, the programs had to ‘change up’. 
Then you have ever larger successive generations of survivors-turned-perpetrators. These are the type that are more commonly prosecuted – and reported on, as these underlings do not have the resources of their progenitors to keep their activities as well hidden. But they will keep being spawned until the media at large has the courage to defy the establishment, stand with the children and the parents of the world, and demand a stop to this holocaust of innocence.

            The ritual abuse could easily be a scare tactic by the CIA or whatever to scare the victims into submission, but think he was a bit off about the spirit cooking. Those type of people believe in that crazy shit it seems. He hasn't done too much research regarding pizzagate I'm guessing though. The side of satanic rings seem fringe to the average person. He referenced in his earlier videos how they are overwhelmed with this information and will not believe it at all, so he breaks it down like he does. It's a lot to take in. Same strategy we need to do. We got lots of stuff that seem "fringe" to the average person, but once you get to reading, it starts to make sense. Of course, if you starting throwing around satanic rituals and illuminati, to a general audience you would lose them. His advice is to stick to the child trafficking stuff. At least that's what I gather from his last video. Also of note, he does not absolve Alefantis from his crimes, he thinks there might be something there.

            Anonymous5 from 4chan claims Webb is a honeypot due to him saying that the gas leaks are related to child trafficking when they are really linked to ISIS attacks. I do not personally know what the truth is but after hearing this about Webb I think both Webb and Anonymous5 have their own agendas they are pushing to the public. 
We must be vigilant in our hunt for truth and decide for ourselves what the truth is.

             The purpose of isis was always to destabilize regions in the middle east in order to get oil and kids.  It's very possible the gas leaks could be related to both.

             We must have listened to different vids then.  He said it's a classic psyop &amp; some bs story about how it's used to keep victims silent.  Listen again.  I am basically trusting &amp; give the benefit of the doubt but something isn't right, imho.  He also said David S who focuses on pizzagate is disinfo.  I'm not familiar with David per se/but that is a rather condemning statement.  Just because someone has a particular focus of research (which George seems to encourage) doesn't make him disinfo.  Is there something about David I'm not aware of (since I don't know his research)?

             Your right I believe George is thinking about the endgame now, how will all this end?
            </p>
            <p>
             Through his entire series he's been very very careful. guiding his viewers on what to investigate and keeping himself credible.
            </p>
            <p>
             He wants this to end! As said above the quickest way to get convictions is via the Clinton foundation not at comet ping pong.
            </p>
            <p>
             People shouldn't take it to heart that George appears to be dismissive of the occult ties, he's just playing it smart.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have to always remind ourselves to look at the bigger picture.

              He maybe thinking that, and it solves the problem of the moment  but to me the endgame is exposing satatists and occults and making society understand their existence, then hunting them down like post-war nazis, for it is the only way for this to be tamped down for generations. Otherwise, if you cut off the head of just CF and associates, you'll get more heads growing in its place.

             I believe George is doing great work but also agree that he obviously hasn't looked into pizzagate in any relevant capacity if he can't even pronounce Alefantis' name properly. Satanic ritual abuse is most definitely real and has been documented for centuries.  I find when it comes to a lot of this truth stuff, most people will have a limit on what they can actually swallow.

            First post, but I feel like he's a bit off base on this one.   I've been watching his videos pretty closely and I feel like he still has some level of internal denial going on in regards to this stuff when he talks about the State like it actually can work for the people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway all this PizzaGate stuff has me seriously rethinking many things.   Including but not limited to my support of homosexuality.   Webb brought up a very very strong point about these operations.   In that it used to be easy to blackmail homosexuals.   This is no longer the case.   And with the nature of power, it's not a slippery slope argument.   It's just a fact that if you normalize something previously abnormal than those who blackmail the folks in charge will be forced to go even darker.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also a highly hedonistic self absorbed lifestyle where you live for no one but yourself by and large.    Kids are a rare thing in these couplings.    And even when they do have kids the kids do measurably worse than they would in a normal heterosexual family (by all studies... even ones designed to show support for homosexual pairings, when you examine how carefully crafted they are they fall apart completely).
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway this is just my little piece about that.  But it seems pretty clear to me that this is all being done in a blatantly satanic/occultish way.   Putting it out in the open for all to see.   And then if they do nothing well, you just gain more power - don't you?    I also think this could be a proverbial gun being put to a lot of folks heads who have been involved with this for a very long time who do not want to go to nuclear war with another superpower.   But yet, this is on the agenda it would seem...
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this shit is way too biblical for my tastes but yet there it is.

             So perhaps our aim should be to make some really benign thing utterly taboo to ensure that the evil fuckers in our society will only blackmail people with pictures of them getting their toes licked by a baby sheep or something?

             That is not true, what you say about studies showing children of same sex parents faring worse than those with heterosexual parents. The vast majority of research shows that there are no differences between children raised by same sex vs heterosexual parents. Here are some meta-analyses of various studies and reviews of the literature that demonstrate this fact.

             Really I think what we need to get rid of is the kinds of people who do all this unimaginably evil stuff. They all have certain neurobiology in common, so it should, with enough research, be possible to eradicate sociopathy from the species and then we won't have to worry about what kind of hideous unimaginable horror they will cook up next for their nefarious objectives.

              See, the problem is, most of the studies they are referencing are tiny self selected sample sizes that correlate roughly with average results on larger studies done in heterosexual populations.    In other words, they don't really show what they claim to be showing.   At least the ones I've actually read.   Those are all paywalled.

             I have to jump in and say I have a lot of gay/lesbian friends, one couple has adopted children who are doing well.  Anecdotal, but my point is that I don't think homosexuality is fundamentally wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with it.  I think it's fundamentally different from pedophilia, where there's a built-in power imbalance between the people involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             No doubt there are people (straight or gay) who engage in homosexuality just because it feels more perverse to them and they're into perverseness.  But let's not demonize the millions of legit gays who are doing no one any harm.

              In a world without government there's nothing wrong with it.   A world with government and we normalize it and kids become the victims.   This is not something you can just dismiss IMO.   It's not the same as pedophilia, but it is not the same as heterosexuality either.    A large majority of gay folks never have kids and live predominantly for themselves.   This isn't me making stuff up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Society has one primary function though above all others.   And that's the raise good children so that society can continue.   We have lost the plot on this completely.    100% completely.    And the ideology behind this is the same one that's raping these kids.   The whole subjectivist movement is basically a denial of anything bigger than oneself.    It's an ideology that is polluting minds left right and center and a lot of folks aren't even aware of it.   Further... there's nothing more rewarding than having children.   Not that you would know it watching television.   Everyone seems to think owning a cat or a dog is somehow equivalent... it's not.
             </p>
             <p>
              And it's a mindset deeply rooted in the LGBTQ community as well.    I too have friends who are gay.   Most of them are party animals.    That's fine for them, but I actually believe this is pretty destructive behavior for society as we have it setup currently.    Anyone who expects to get government handouts but who isn't having kids... well, that's just another level of selfishness right.   I mean, it's the future generations who are on the hook for all of this stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry, kind of a rant but I feel like this is a topic that needs to be explored with all of this .
             </p>
             <p>
              When homosexuality no longer works as blackmail then the kids come out to play.

               Weird replying to myself also, but since most people don't realize government also has one function and that is to maintain power.   With that dynamic, of course blackmail becomes par for the course.    Without power, no longer government by definition.    I think perhaps in a world without government homosexuality is just fine.   But with government I think you can make a strong argument it is not and never will be.    And I don't see a counter argument that is obvious and I am pretty good at finding those.

             I completely disagree.  Good ppl and not so good ppl exist in all aspects of life.  Broad generalizations like this only serve to divide us.

              If you're not having kids willingly to pursue your own interests, you're pretty hedonistic by definition.    There can be some exceptions if people devote their lives to charity or some such thing, but that isn't the case most of the time.

               Well, I guess I'm hedonistic bc I chose not to have kids.  I now run a non profit but that wasn't why I originally decided against having kids.
               <br/>
               Some ppl want to be parents and some don't.

                It gives cause greater than oneself.    You certainly don't have to, although if you support government force taking money from people you should certainly at least have your own kids to contribute to the bottom line.   Should also add that continuing the human species is a good thing in my eyes.   Like I said, sometimes people do charitable work in lieu and that's noble.   But most don't.

            Webb said that ritual abuse does exist, but not because the Clintons are satanic. It's more of a side effect of the child trafficking. It exists mainly because people need (psychologically) to remove guilt from the abuse they partake in.
           </p>
           <p>
            His point being he thinks people get lost in the satanic stuff, and art stuff, like spirit cooking, when we should focus on following the money, the kids, the oil, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has also said in one of his videos that he could be totally wrong, but that's his opinion. So maybe he is just reiterating to stay focused on things that are easier to prove.

             Exactly this! Don't get distracted by the parts of this story that you think are "juicy"
            </p>
            <p>
             The term "Pizzagate" is ridiculous, can we just call it what it is? A Brownstone operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             these operations clearly didn't pop up over night, they have been running and evolving for god knows how long. becoming these disturbing entanglements of rape, black mail, fear and any other fucked up shit they can throw into the mix.
You don't have to disbelieve that some of it may be "satanictic" or appear to be, it's just not the driving force for this cluster fuck. Or at least the public will find it hard to ever truly get onboard with this topic all the time people talk of "pizza" "satanism" it's too easily disregarded as conspiracy theorie by the majority.

              I think replacing the term Pizzagate with Brownstone is a bad idea. We have no proof that intelligence agencies of any country were involved in this particular pedo ring in DC. By using the word you are saying it was.

               Yes your right but can we assume it's more likely to be a "brownstone" style operation with the goal of blackmail etc. Rather than a satanic thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               My main point is I don't think the term "Pizzagate" or the talk of occult is helping.

                I'm not convinced it's a satanic thing either, although there's some disturbing art that appears to back that somewhat. I'm just not ruling out that the high prices, pizza codewords, and one time use phone apps involved were to prevent blackmail, not to cause it. If anything, if the CIA is involved, it seems to me it might be "anti-brownstone"... providing the "service" to keep the pedo's in power from seeking "service" elsewhere. Straight up pimping or drugs sales hasn't been ruled out. I'm hoping for some real evidence and less speculation.

                 The satanic shit is real.  Make no mistake about it.   Whether it's just cover for an intelligence op is irrelevant if the people involved believe it at all.   I also think it can be useful in recruiting Christians as pretty much all of this is straight out of the bible.

             Yes, and that's why satanism and art are useful, although "psyop" may not be the right word.
The "cool" satano-pedo subculture which emerges in current research willy-nilly serves purposes. Art - outside purely aesthetic consideration - is PR.
There could be also functional needs like creating dreamlike/scary environments so that victims burry memories which could later get triggered at will...
How far it goes on in reality everyone is speculating here. Has to.

            George Webb does not present a convincing or logical argument here. Who created this psyop, and why do so many people in the public know about it? Is he saying that Satanic ritual abuse does not happen, and that it is only something invented by the captors of trafficking victims to be used as a threat against them? That simply does not make sense. This does not in any way explain the hundreds of victim testimonies of ritual abuse. If the psyop were against the public for another reason, it would be different, but he is not saying that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is he saying that the leaked emails showing a relationship between the Podestas and Marina Abramovic of Spirit Cooking fame is part of a psyop? How does this scare victims into silence? Are the dozens of images associating pizza and Satan part of this psyop, placed years ago so they could be accidentally found by us now? Is Satanism itself a psyop? George Webb's statement does not make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Several people publicizing pizzagate have been threatened, and were told to say that pizzagate is a psyop. Perhaps this has happened to George Webb as well, and is the reason he can't give any kind of reasonable explanation for his statement.

             I don't think he means that it doesn't happen.  I think he means they're using it as a psyop to intimidate and scare people, and also to make their story sound more un-credible.  It's a little easier for the public to dismiss someone as a crazy idiot if they're claiming satanic ritual abuse than if they simply claim that they were molested or tortured.
            </p>
            <p>
             No doubt some of the people involved actually are into the satanist stuff for real.  But also, there are probably a lot of people into the satanist stuff who aren't actually raping and killing kids.  At least, I hope so.

              That isn't what Webb said, though, and he had the opportunity to explain himself in the Richie Allen interview. He said something I've never heard anyone say before, which is that Satanism is used by the abusers to make themselves feel less guilty about what they are doing to children. Does this make any sense? Would sexual abuse be any less bad in anyone's mind if it was part of a Satanic ritual?

               It wouldn't be less bad in my mind, but I could see that being similar to christian crusaders or islamic jihadists.  Convince yourself that you're doing it for a higher purpose.  It wouldn't work for everyone but it might make it easier to get certain people to do it that way.

                That means that it would only work with people who really believed in Satan and that ritual abuse served a higher purpose - rendering it no longer a psyop, but a genuine religious practice.

                 Yup.  I imagine some people view it as a psyop, some view it as a religious practice they're doing, some see it is partly both, and some probably just see it as abuse and do it anyway.  All four categories are equally horrible to me.

              It looks like you are saying that Webb is a CIA mole or disinfo agent whose purpose is to infiltrate and misdirect the public effort to find the truth. This actually seems plausible. The amateurish presentation of his videos with the shaky camera work and cheap looking infographics seem like they could be contrived to help make him look like a "regular guy".

               He has said himself in his vids he's just a regular guy trying to help. Yeah right, trying to help by throwing every conspiracy theory ever into the mix. This sub has strict parameters on what can be posted in it so we can keep our focus, yet his vids immediately get upvoted to the top and are posted daily, sometimes several times a day.

               and there is a chorus of fan posters that seem a little too enamoured with him tbh. Our savior, George here again with the facts, but where is the evidence?

             A past few threads I read from Anonymous5 from 4chan, he states Webb might be a Honeypot. In my opinion Webb is just an investigator that uses his own personal knowledge in most of the details, then assumptions in others, but any assumption that might be listened to some people might take it all as facts, that is why I linked to his google doc with all his sources in a submission, as these are more important then him spouting stuff out.

             We know that Podesta is all up in Aleister Crowley like satanic rituals that inspired the birth of spirit cooking. One of the Clintons mentioned in one of their books that they portake in VooDoo rituals as well. Cheryl Mills said she was gonna sacrifice a chicken to Moloch. As for Secret Societies it says a shadow government called the "7th Floor Group" in the FBI files for Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for victims we might have Cathy O'Brien as a possible person that was part of this. There is a video somewhere that shows her cut up vagina. And I think in one of her books she says she got oral as a child from Hillary as Bill watched. In the book I think Hillary sees the scars from the abuse, and it makes her horny. There might be more, but I know we went through Cathys history before on eddit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can these things make us be portrayed as crazy loons? You betcha. But there is some proof of secret societies (7th Floor Group).
            </p>
            <p>
             As for ritual abuse and spirit cooking, not every celebrity you see is a child diddler, and some are actually are there for the weird fucking performance art they think some of it is. Also we would need to expand off of this and research pedowood in the future after Pizzagate is near finish to see if this is actually true, and find out who are the actual fucked up people in Pedowood. There seems some connections to actors in shootouts that the media pushes (CCP shooter and father), Epstein, Marina Abramović and celebs, etc.

             I think he is partially right...Its somewhat of a psyop to keep the kids quiet if they ever escape before they reach an age where they are killed so they make them watch the ritual killings.

              Yeah it's in the same line of reasoning as making the children bond with an animal and making them kill it, or I believe they'll do that child on child unfortunately but anyways it's a way they use to dissociate people, make alters terrify and control.

              But these assholes also believe that they gain power through these rapes and murders at least to degree and they seem to use it in a ritual way often.

               That's why it doesn't make sense to say that the Satanic ritual abuse is a technique to keep people quiet - it hasn't worked, and if this was why they were doing it, they would have moved on to some other way to silence victims. If Webb said it was a technique to make the testimony of victims unbelievable because of it being so bizarre, he might have a point, but he did not say this.

              I think the definition of "psyop" is being stretched here. Psychological Operations are part of military strategy - does this term really apply as used by George Webb? How would Satanic rituals keep the kids quiet, and why would they go to such great lengths and do this specific thing just for this purpose when killing or threatening them is so much easier?
             </p>
             <p>
              I have listened to some of the Richie Allen interview now, and what George Webb says there is much more intelligible than what he says in the above video.  I know there has been a valid debate about whether Satanism is used as an excuse or front for child abuse, or if it is actually the cause for it, and this seems to be what Webb alludes to in the Allen interview. In the specific case of Hillary Clinton, it is difficult to say with any certainty. It's possible too that George Webb is just not familiar with Satanism and the practices and goals of people like Aleister Crowley and Michael Aquino, and is therefore speaking out of ignorance.

            This doesn't have to be an "either or" situation.  Rather,  it's likely "both and".

            Within the context of what George is discussing,  what he is saying may be true.  But I know few people coming at this from strictly non-geopolitical perspectives who would agree with him.

            MKULTRA is not abstract. Its existence is supported by extensive official documentation and testimony. If you read The Search for the "Manchurian Candidate" by John D. Marks this will be very apparent.
