            It looks like someone set Paddock up deliberately.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was originally requested a room ending in 235. Paddock knew the hotel, so he was asking for a corner room that overlooked the quieter back area of the hotel where the swimming pools were, instead of a room on the front that overlooked the noisy highway and concert grounds, as well as the airport in the distance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hotel gave him a room 235, that didn't even overlook the concert, but a little while before he checked in, his room was changed on the hotel computer system to room 32-135.

            Yes, Paddock and his brother are a link to the world of CIA and pedophile entrapment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there's more going on than just what Jake has in his video.
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems to be unaware of Paddock's longstanding CIA career, and the fact that what happened in Paddock's hotel room was a controlled sale that went south, whether intentionally or not.

             Are you a regular viewer of Jake's videos? In previous videos he has explored the idea of paddock being a gun runner and that it was a deal that fell apart. He is on the Vegas case like no other investigator I've seen.  I've personally watched his videos for about a year now. He has some very good videos about pizzagate related stuff - Franklin scandal , crowley, sra, etc in a series he does called "out of the darkness and into light"  they're highly informative and easy to follow.

              Yes. Jake is doing excellent stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't have time right now to put links up and write a lengthy post, but if you want to look at the CIA thing more, here's a quick summary:
             </p>
             <p>
              Paddock has been a CIA operative for decades. His last documented employment was with a defense contractor over 30 years ago. But he could afford a very fancy home in Northern California, and owned a series airplanes. DAS
             </p>
             <p>
              He has been involved in Middle East operations, including undercover work with ISIS. DAS
             </p>
             <p>
              Jake is right that Paddock was doing some kind of undercover sale operation. Possibly FBI-managed, probably to Middle Eastern types, possibly similar to the Fast and Furious shitshow that the FBI and DEA screwed up so royally.
             </p>
             <p>
              A guy who did controlled sales to criminal organizations did an interview on YouTube in which he describes why the description of Paddock's room matches the way he set up the rooms he did the sales in. DAS
             </p>
             <p>
              He also said that the drug dealers who got guns from Fast and Furious quickly found the tracking devices installed in the guns, and that he suspects that after that anyone buying from a dealer who may be an FBI or ATF plant knows to look immediately for tracking devices. He speculated that the Middle Eastern guys found them right away, or at least soon enough that they shot Paddock and absconded with whatever weaponry they got from him. What happened after that is still under investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's unlikely, though, that the CIA or FBI used pedophile entrappment to force him to participate in the sale. He was an operative working in high-risk environments for more than 30 years. I agree with Jake that he had pedophile interests, but he was probably rewarded with pedophile activities as a perk of the job. I also think he
