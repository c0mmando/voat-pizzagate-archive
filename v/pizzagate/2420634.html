<p><em>A children\'s den is a shelter or hideout built by children, often involving spare wooden boards, nets and sticks. It is often built in a bush or tree. A classic den uses a panel of wood for the roof, wooden boards for the floor and a net with leaves on it as camouflage. It is often used as a hangout for children and children can design and decorate it however they like.</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_den">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_den</a></p>
<p><em>A maternity den, in the animal kingdom, is a lair where the mother gives birth and nurtures the young, when they are in a vulnerable life stage.

            Let me get this straight; you've taken a post that someone has made about Little Red Fox, next to Comet, having a spiral design in the masonry (which it doesn't, it's a flower) and then ran with the word 'Den' being somehow related to pedo's?

            If you're pedo hunting my advice is to look in  mini cooper motoring forums.  They post pics of their minis. Minis=kids   But you have to keep in mind that not everyone posting on the forum is a pedo. You have to read between the lines.

             I'm interested in seeing an example of what you're talking about. It's impossible for their coded language to just stop at food like pizza, pasta, and walnuts.
