<p>(Link to PART 2 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2773728">Here</a>)</p>
<p>I recently wrote a couple articles (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2712717">here</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2712727">here</a>) on Voat about the network of protection (possibly CIA-sponsored) that enables somebody like Larry King to work at Thomas Moorehead’s car dealership in the DC suburbs. I just came across some other information that might be significant to sheading more light on the actual relationship between Lawrence E King and Thomas Moorehead.</p>
<p>There is a blogger and “motorcycle enthusiast” by the name of Amy Irene White, she has a couple of potentially important posts on her blog (<a href="https://amyirenewhite.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/aa-pedophile-worked-for-the-washington-harley-dealer/">here</a> and <a href="https://amyirenewhite.wordpress.com/2015/09/11/open-letter-to-thomas-moorehead-of-hddc/">here</a>) that get into that possible relationship, albeit very briefly. I don’t know if other people have already posted about this on Voat, so apologies if someone already brought this up, but I do definitely think this relationship is worth exploring here on Voat.</p>
<p>Important to note, Thomas Moorehead owns a Harley-Davidson dealership in Fort Washington, Maryland, also in the DC suburbs. On October 10th, 2015, Moorehead’s Harley-Davidson dealership hosted a “Ride for Justice” motorcycle ride, which was held in conjunction with Louis Farrakhan’s “Justice or Else!” March, that the Nation of Islam (NOI) hosted on that same day in Washington, DC. Amy White wrote a couple posts critical of Moorehead’s involvement with this march. </p>
<p>Specifically, in this post <a href="https://amyirenewhite.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/aa-pedophile-worked-for-the-washington-harley-dealer/">here</a>, Amy White claims that she has a source who is an employee of Moorehead’s. White isn’t specific about what dealership this employee works at, but because in the blog post she is focusing on the Harley-Davidson dealership, one could presume it is an employee at this specific dealership, though I don’t know for sure.  Amy White claims that this source told her the following about Thomas Moorehead’s supposed relationship with King:
<strong>“According to this employee who called me, Larry [King] allegedly was Tom [Moorehead’s] banker in Omaha years ago.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>So if this source is correct, then that would mean that Thomas Moorehead must have had a bank account at the Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, which Larry King was the manager of</strong>. In addition, in this other post on the same blog, Amy White wrote an “Open Letter” to Moorehead, critical of his support for the motorcycle ride, and says the following:</p>
<p>“We are sorry you yourself have all that history in Omaha with your friend, the alleged child sex ring pimp, <strong>Lawrence E. King, Jr.</strong>  We are sorry you were obtuse enough to think it was okay to hire that disgusting person after he got out of jail and that no one would mind.
We are sorry your first car dealership just <strong>HAPPENED to come about the same year as he got caught embezzling money from a credit union  and then you suddenly are Mr. Richest Black Man in America.”</strong></p>
<p>Nick Bryant’s book “The Franklin Scandal” pretty much backs the timing of this up, its only off by about a year. As Nick Bryant documents, in November 1988, the “The National Credit Union Association and FBI closed the Franklin Credit Union- <strong>regulators quickly determined that millions had been embezzled and the credit union had a second set of books.”</strong></p>
<p>As I documented in my previous <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2712717">post</a> about Moorehead, an <a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/12/08/profile-thomas-moorehead/">article</a> in Washington Life Magazine states that in 1987 Moorehead opened his first auto dealership, a Buick dealership, in Omaha Nebraska. <strong>So putting this information together, (and assuming Amy White’s <a href="https://amyirenewhite.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/aa-pedophile-worked-for-the-washington-harley-dealer/">source</a> is correct), is it possible Moorehead financed the opening of his first car dealership in Omaha through his bank account at the Franklin Credit Union?</strong> All of this presumably would have had happened while Larry King was in charge of the bank and BEFORE it got raided by the FBI for embezzlement. <strong>Again, the bank got raided about a year AFTER Moorehead opened his dealership in Omaha.</strong></p>
<p>The Washington Post itself <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/04/01/omahas-hurricane-of-scandal/f762dad7-c72c-415e-a17c-bd4ece10fa44/?utm_term=.242d03fccda5">reported</a> that Larry King looted $38 million out of the Franklin Credit Union. Henry Vinson documents in his book that there were long-standing rumors that the Franklin Credit Union could have even been used as a front for money laundering operations connected with the Iran-Contra “weapons-for-arms” scandal that also broke in the 1980s. </p>
<p>Clearly huge amounts of money were disappearing down some very shady rabbit hole, at the very same time that Moorehead might have had his bank account at the Franklin Credit Union. <strong>I know this is speculation, but is it possible that Moorehead’s “seed money” for his first car dealership in Omaha could have very well been a chunk of this embezzled money stolen from the bank</strong>?? </p>
<p><strong>If Moorehead does really have this level of criminal association with the Franklin Credit Union and hence with King, this could go a LONG way in explaining why over 20 years later, Moorehead would feel compelled to hire someone like King as his employee.</strong> If Moorehead compromised himself to this extent in his association with King, then he would forever be in the pocket of King, and presumably in the pocket of the people lurking in the shadows who are protecting Larry King.  Also, important to note that Moorehead has stated in interviews that he himself grew up in poverty, raised in a poor family in Monroe, Louisiana. If Moorehead doesn’t have the family connections or family wealth to back him up, it makes his ability to finance, open up, and own a car dealership, and rapidly expand to owning more auto dealerships, all the more questionable.</p>

            Excellent post. Thank you. I agree 100% and everything fits pretty well. Sounds like Moorehead had his fair share of kids too sick fuck. Yup, they have all this cash because they laundered millions and made huge profits off the backs of kids in pornography, rape and snuff films. Not to mention getting political allies by blackmail with them. I do believe there are many who were not into kids who were drugged at parties then taken to rooms, undressed and filmed with kids sadly enough. Being shown the film later on would be awful for them but worse knowing all their family and friends would know about it so they do what they are told and likely further blackmailed again down the road to keep them in line. King is one vile piece of shit.

            One thing I definitely should have mentioned... On May 12, 2017 a user (abcdefg222) dug up the current whereabouts of Larry King. LESS THAN 7 days later, on May 19th, the same user found that King's bio on that Opera Nova website had been scrubbed off the face of the Earth. (Links are

            I was able to find this again.  Very interesting info on King, and his connection to Franklin and his connection to Susan Buffet Warren's wife.  All the snippets are interesting but #13 is of special interest.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            King's wife was an early supporter of the credit union; Warren was on the board of FirsTier Financial, which laundered $50 million of Franklin's funds; the Buffett's hosted the Kings' 10th wedding anniversary; King hosted a fundraiser for Buffett's son Howard when he ran for county commissioner; Buffett's companion was a waitress at nightclub used as a site for King's orgies; a former Omaha city employee reported that when King was crowed "Queen" at the club The Max, Buffett was his escort.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Backing from Buffett's socialite wife, Susie, came early in the rise of Larry King. Susie Buffett was a volunteer at the credit union in the early days. According to the Lincoln Journal-Star of March 19, 1989, King 'liked to tell the story of a woman coming to the credit union to see him and being told to return at 7:00 the next morning because he was so busy. The woman was Susie Buffett, wife of billionaire Warren Buffett, and she did come back to offer her help at the credit union.' For years, it has been part of Larry King lore in Omaha, that the Buffett's hosted a tenth wedding anniversary party for him and Alice."

             Here is another very interesting source on Warren Buffet, Sherman Skolnick. I don't know if folks on here know about Skolnick, but I think he is a very good source, in many ways, for our cause. Sherman was a long-time political activist and conspiracy researcher based in Chicago. He had this activist group called "Citizens Committee to Clean Up the Courts" which investigated judicial corruption. In 1969, Sherman's group unearthed evidence of corruption, that led to the resignation of two members of the Illinois State Supreme Court. I believe to this day, those are two of the highest-ranking Judges taken down by citizen activism. The Special Counsel who investigated this corruption just so happened to be John Paul Stevens. This case brought Stevens to fame, and he would go on to be a Supreme Court Justice (resigned in 2010). Sherman passed away in 2006, here is his
             <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-05-23-0605230116-story.html">
              obituary
             </a>
             in the Chicago Tribune.
            </p>
            <p>
             Skolnick wrote a 16-part series called "Coca-Cola, the CIA, and the Courts," where he goes into detail about Warren Buffet's "relationship" with the CIA and Coca-Cola. Here is what he has to say about Buffet:
            </p>
            <p>
             "A major player in The Coca-Cola Company has been Warren Buffet. If you are naive and believe in fairy tales, then you believe he made his great fortune through crafty operation starting with a department store in Omaha. To heckle him, some of his critics pronounce his name,French-style, phonetically Buffay. Buffet became a major owner of Coke stock and held a position on their Board of Directors.
             <strong>
              Few, if any, dare even whisper that Buffet's fortune is reportedly based on operating companies that are money laundries and propaganda horns for the American CIA.
             </strong>
             The list would have to include CIA adjuncts such as the Wells Fargo Bank, helping CIA's Pacific basin operations, and the CIA-apologist, The Washington Post Company. (Read, if you can find it, Deborah Davis' book, "Katherine the Great" about the Washington Post and the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             **To understand Warren Buffet, who mouths off his wonders at universities training so-called would-be business stars, you would have to be a profound investigator, from mostly secret sources, on the worldwide dope trafficking by the American CIA. When you are knowledgeable on that, then, and only then, do you understand the financial buffoon, Warren Buffet. **
            </p>
            <p>
             VERY interesting how so many roads lead right back to the CIA, eh??

              The real truth about Buffet would probably not be believed.  Also there are so many connected to him they will surely attack the truth.  I have heard of his connection to Cocoa Cola before and it sometimes make me think of "Coke" since the CIA is known for passing out the drug to many of our poor young folk.  Wonder if he is hooked up with that too.  Anything to make money.  If you read the report I sent then you also know the part about his son, possibly being made available for sick fun.  So he peddled his own kid.  They have no morals only love of money and fame.

              Very interesting. Have you read the book Operation Gladio by Paul Williams? He says a lot about the deep ties between the CIA, international organized crime, and the world of finance, among other things.

               Heard of the book, will check it out. I'm currently reading the Phoenix Program by Doug Valentine, another expose of the CIA I would highly recommend to investigators.

              I believe that's how Buffet got his start too.  Stealing the money.  Just like Moorehead.  I hate the people that were responsible for the Keating Five debacle and also Neal Bush's Savings &amp; Loan, robbing and stealing money and jobs from people that had next to nothing.   Next to the pedos and traffickers they are the worst.  John No Name. The truth needs to finally come out about Buffet.  I remember seeing something about how he met Tom Cruise on the tarmac somewhere.  Hmm.

            was getting more traffic.  GA and the other subs taking a lot of bandwidth.  I'm confident that many of these people will eventually be arrested.  You'd be amazed how all of these criminal networks connect to each other.

             Thanks Blacksmith21. I did put it together today, but it was kind of a rabbit hole I've been digging down for a little while. Yeah I do hope more folks will explore this. I'm sure all these networks connect way more than we can imagine.

            Excellent work. I assume you know about King's involvement with Opera Nova:

            I looked into the organization superficially but couldn't find anything that stood out as being nefarious other than Larry King working for them. Do you know anything about how or why Larry King became involved with Opera Nova, and if its leadership is also criminal or CIA-connected?
