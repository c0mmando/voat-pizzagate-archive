            This must be the most comprehensive information/vids/newspaper cuttings/reports etc., on the British pedophiles ever. I have not read all of it as it would take months!

            I asked my British friends this a while back and they say its because of male boarding school system, especially the super expensive 'posh' ones? Many of these alum then enter politics. They are men who have skewed views of dating women and never got over their first same sex crushes when they were kids.

            People need to realise how the system works. It's not a coincidence that there are dozens of pedophiles in all high up places in almost every society. There are people working around the clock surveilling politicians/actors/royalty/police/judges from a young age, only the filthiest bastards with the most dirt on them are allowed to succeed, they then use them people to blackmail and keep the rich rich and the poor poor. It's been going on for centuries. They have perfected it to a tee. It's the most successful business in the world.

            The Thomas Hamilton/Dunblane massacre is a key story. Connections to Police, Freemasonry and the UK Political Establishment. Growing up Catholic in Scotland in the 80's and 90's gave some of us good advance notice of what was to come, the Dutroux affair really woke me up, by the time Hautes-de-la-garenne broke there were no surprises. Leah McGrath Goodman is a highly regarded journalist worth checking:

            This is really interesting and horrible would be great to see more on the uk pizzagate stuff and Europe ...might be easier to research if we live near certain places and institutions also does any one have any recent statistics of pedophiles/sexual offenders in the general population so I could compare them to politicians and other groups

            Our Establishment is a cesspool of iniquity.  This list is a real eye opener but makes you realise that if it's this common, there literally must be hundreds of thousands, possibly &gt;million paedophiles in the UK alone.  The Talmud and its ideology has so much to do with this global epidemic directly and indirectly and through an understanding of the over representation of Jews in the porn industry, Hollywood and the finance sectors, is it time we started being honest with ourselves as to what the driving force behind all this is?

            Alan Watt (the owner of the website cuttingthroughthematrix.com - where the list is from) has been warning us about this for "donkey's years."
           </p>
           <p>
            While Alan Watt is wrong from time to time, he was the guy who woke me up more than 15 years ago. A lot of what he was saying back then is coming to light today.
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate Alan Watt.

            Maybe there are loads of them in most governments and the U.K police are actually doing a better job than other police forces.
           </p>

            I would like to believe that because I live in the U.K. but actually I suspect that we are one of the worst, our aristocracy, the old boys networks, the elite private boarding schools, Eton, the Tories I think are all rotten to the core.

             I would love to think that its because our police are on the ball too, but after the Hampstead Cover-up I am beginning to see how corrupt our system is.  My 2 little brothers at the age of  9 &amp; 10 were sent to a boys 'detention' centre for hanging around with a group of about 12 slightly older boys (all under 16), who were into, what they called in the 60s 'gay-bashing'  The 'gang' of boys would hang around in the town and when a pedophile would ask for a little boy (the only reason these boys let my brothers hang around with them was to entice the sickos, which sounds like there were plenty) they would go to a discreet back part of the carpark to assault the little boy, but the 'gang' would then assail them and rob them of their money and beat them up in the process for being pedos. Obviously my family was oblivious to this, as in the 60s we all hung out on the streets playing, until the police came and took my brothers away for 6 weeks.   I was only 12 at the time but I remember my mom was livid because the lawyer representing my brothers was, in my moms words 'so bent' and she worried about my brothers wellbeing.  She was right to be worried, my brother, now in his 50s only recently told us that the men in authority at that place made some of the boys go out to them in the night and he was made to stand in front of the main guy who sat behind his desk with another man behind him, and ordered to take down his trousers and pants.  He said the 2 men just laughed and made fun of him and he felt so humiliated.  I don't know if anything happened to my younger brother as he has never said. We saw last year that the main guy of that home was convicted of pedophilia while working there.   I HATE these people with a passion, the sooner they see 6 feet under the ground the better.
