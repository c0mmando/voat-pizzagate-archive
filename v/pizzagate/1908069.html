<p>One of the majors named in the lawsuit (Curtis Flaherty) was one of three majors announced recently concerning the &quot;retire or be demoted&quot; shakeup. The city council is in an uproar concerning one of the other majors who was also given the ultimatum (Jimmy Harper). This is where former DC chief Charles Ramsey comes in:</p>
<p>Members of the RCFOP board of directors recently had an opportunity to meet with Charles Ramsey, former chief of police in DC and Philadelphia. AT THE VERY MOMENT these board members were telling Chief Ramsey about Major Harper’s courage and leadership ability, Major Harper was being notified of the scheduled meeting at which he would learn of his demotion.</p>

<p>After this story broke the LMPD suspended the youth program and took down the website:</p>

<p>Thanks to our friend the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; I was able to do some digging into the 4 officers named.</p>
<p>Flaherty was the LEAD advisor in the Explorer program at least since 2004 according to this screen capture:</p>

<p>Betts, Wood, &amp; Schumann were all in leadership positions during their time as explorers according to this screenshot:</p>

<p>Schuhmann listed as an advisor to youth explorers on this screenshot from Nov. 2016, along with Wood and Betts whom had also been advisors.

<p>For the record, the Louisville police department isn\'t the only one that has had problems with this program:</p>
