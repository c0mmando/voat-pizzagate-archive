<p>One of the majors named in the lawsuit (Curtis Flaherty) was one of three majors announced recently concerning the &quot;retire or be demoted&quot; shakeup. The city council is in an uproar concerning one of the other majors who was also given the ultimatum (Jimmy Harper). This is where former DC chief Charles Ramsey comes in:</p>
<p>Members of the RCFOP board of directors recently had an opportunity to meet with Charles Ramsey, former chief of police in DC and Philadelphia.

<p>After this story broke the LMPD suspended the youth program and took down the website:</p>

<p>Thanks to our friend the &quot;Wayback Machine&quot; I was able to do some digging into the 4 officers named.</p>
<p>Flaherty was the LEAD advisor in the Explorer program at least since 2004 according to this screen capture:</p>
