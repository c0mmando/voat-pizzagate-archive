<p>This is key, people.  
</p>
<p>The biggest argument against pizzagate is &quot;no abuse victims have come forward.&quot;  <em>Au contraire</em>, but they have! and are coming forward more and more - in fact we may see a spate of people finally coming forward as happened with Cosby, Bill Clinton and others.  
</p>
<p>I would like to ask everyone who visits here to just add one or more names and/or links of any survivor you can think of, but especially more recent ones, coming foward with a personal experience of pizzagate style trafficking, SRA with mind control elements, involvement with blackmailing high profile politicians, etc.   List all the ones you know of with a link if you can.  ~~~</p>
<p>~~~An example:  Cathy O\'Brian is a famous survivor of MK Ultra mind control and wrote extensively about it.  But she is speaking out again with a new book after years of silence.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvA2ED1FkR4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvA2ED1FkR4</a></p>
<p>I know these list threads don\'t always work out because the thread disappears off the front page, but bookmark it please and keep adding when you run acrosss.  If we reach a critical mass of numbers, I\'ll go through clean it all up and keep reposting it at regular intervals.  The best examples should be folded into our Executive Pizzagate Summary of Evidence.   This will greatly assist in red-pilling a lot of people.   
</p>
<p>THESE VICTIMS ARE OUR SMOKING GUNS, AS MUCH AS OTHER EVIDENCE.  AN AVALANCHE OF VICTIMS COMING FORWARD WILL BE UNDENIABLE TO THE WIDER PUBLIC.   
</p>
<p>A word of caution:  Keep it US based for now if possible, as we want to focus on red pilling the US public about pizzagate, not Jimmy Saville or the Profumo Affaire or Hempstead.  Use some discrimination and post good information.

<p>We have to expect the &quot;False Memory Syndrome&quot; argument to rear its ugly head again sometime soon, we need good evidence of survivor testimony to combat it.

            Another article implicating other "Televangelist' leaders as possibly indulging the same stuff:

            "Barbara identifies the imposters pictured above-
           </p>
           <p>
            Henry:   I went to Jason's web site "WakeTheChurch".org and the first thing I looked up was his statement of faith. This same statement of faith would be found on every religious leaders web site he was criticizing making him just a different flavor of the same system. (I also noticed he recommended Steve Quayle as a link who posts many false and ridiculous prophesies on his web site).
           </p>
           <p>
            But, yes,  I can identify most  of the false prophets.  Mike Murdock, who is on the bottom row right next to the logo "SO4J", was one of Judy's original handlers when she was used in rituals at ORU.  She remembered seeing him at Roy Clark's ranch outside of Tulsa.  Ken Copeland (Oral Robert's private pilot for a while) is another one who she was in a ritual with and told me it is one of her worst memories.  Blood splattered everywhere.  Ken is smack dab in the middle of the photo pointing his finger in the air. He also has been to the Vatican with Pope Francis.   Paula White is right below him and I believe that she is MK'd.   She has a condo in Trump Towers. On the top row two I don't know, but the second one in is Rick Warren, Jesse Duplantis, Creflo Dollar,  Joseph Prince; T.D. Jakes, Sid Roth, Joel Osteen, I forgot the last guys name but he was the one caught in a sex scandal a few years ago.  I talked with a woman on the phone a few years ago who was used in a [satanic] ritual with Billy Graham and Rick Warren's father.  The second row has John Hagee, Todd Bentley (from the Lakeland Revival scandal), Ken Copeland's wife, Joyce Meyer and Benny Hinn.  I forgot the first guys name.  On the bottom row is Robert Tilton (look up the farting preacher on you tube), Rod Parsley, I forgot the guys name next to Paula White,  Mike Murdock and Marilyn Hickey.  Christianity today is like entering the twilight zone.   So few will ever be able to come out of the religious mind control programming, it's so deep and entrenched, being passed on from generation to generation.

            What happened to me is still being put together like a big puzzle with large finished areas and many still empty. But one thing I know. It can never be framed and passed off as a photo. They ruined my life. But I do the best I can.

            Here is a good video of two other demonically possessed individuals close to Oral Roberts. It gives you a quick glimpse at some of the spiritual infestations in this rabbit hole.

            </a>
            by the way Oral Roberts has been dead since '09 yet this woman speaks of having a conversation with him in a "vision" aka necromancy (speaking with the dead). Same hobby Hillary practices with the spirit of Helenor Roosevelt.

            There is a huge connection between The Vatican, These Pedophiles called the Charismatic Movement (Prosperity Movement, Once Saved always Saved Movent, and Word of Faith or Name it and Claim it Movement) and Theosophy which deals with the highest ranks of Satan's fallen angels. 
What this lady described as a drug or hallucinogenic is actually a Spirit Induced-like trance called Kundalini.
Google False Preachers and Kundalini and you'll see what I mean. If you thought it couldn't possibly get worse than PizzaGate... You better say your prayers each night if you go down this Satanic Rabbit Hole because you WILL get attacked by stuff you thought only existed in nightmares. Keep Psalm 91 in mind when it gets bad.

            Oral Roberts is 100% not Christian. At best he is a demonically possessed charlatan at worst a demonically possessed child rapist who may very well have murdered children to Satan. He is also the mentor of other well known demons pushing false doctrines such as Joyce Mayers, Kenneth Copeland, and Paula White. The last two demons have infiltrated the Trump cabinet and need to be exposed as well.

            It is common practice for the abusers to "dress up" like someone the individual trusts or has received hope from in order to inflict the most pain and to be beyond crewel.  Fake jesus rape pretty much every Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) survivor.  The abuse really happens.  It's not a false memory (but drug induced paranoid delusions are also given).  The state of mind of the one receiving the abuse is of course very vulnerable to suggestions about who is doing the abuse.

            That is really the crux. It is so heinus an act and so unconceivable, that a normal brain can not even fathom it. 
It is so hard to understand how a person could think of a child in that manner, let alone act on it. Sadly its all to true. Where are those darn red pills.

            Did a google search : oral roberts pedophile.....and came upon this...most of it is about Billy graham and his connections, written from a Christian perspective....interesting....but related to PG and trafficking is the paragrah re Amish and Mennonites...and their sometimes adopting out, giving away of children, and that when twins are born, one may be sold, and never appear in the information system to have even been born....note, I am not familiar with this site and to be honest, there are some 'out there' subtitles in their headers....

            I think we are going to start hearing about more and more "localized" acts of pedophilia and SRA in various combinations.  This is a religion to these people, just as any other religion.  They have convinced themselves (the Satan worshipers) that they are absolutely absolved of their actions as it is an act favorable to their deity.  Just like suicide bombers.  They are ideological and motivated.
For example::

            . She states she was a mind controlled sex slave of the CIA. Her story will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. I heard her story last year some time. Thanks OP well done. I am older and I need a class on adding links again. I knew how to at one time. Edited to add link. Thanks OP.

             just copy the url in the address bar on the webpage you want to link, paste it into your comment - that's it!  it will automatically do the work when you hit the reply button.  please give it a try : )

            Sorry about that. I know a family that went through it, two teenage girls, they were involved a long time. The girls are a bit nuts, but they were a bit that way in the first place. I don't trust any 'celebrity' Christians.

            A lot of people are stuck on hampster wheels in life, running and running to make ends meet.  Having your world turned upside down takes some reading time, the curiousity to investigate for yourself, and trust - all in short supply these days.  So I hope we can be understanding to those who come later - we need everyone.

              thanks bopper!  When I heard the Oral Roberts testimony I looked at the date 2012, so not because of pizzagate.  But I had never heard it before, and I realized how that actually gave this witness even more credibility and it so describes exactly what we have uncovered.   And now maybe this witness and other new ones will be emboldened to come forward with their names because they know they have some safety in numbers with us.

              Oh good grief now I gotta go down that rabbit hole? Didn't know that, but I know Gothard. Edit: That idiot probably spoiled homeschooling for a lot of people. That's how we know about him (homeschool connection).

               Yes! Gothard was the Duggar puppet master! They still speak at Big Sandy.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had a lot of people try and talk me into Gothardism. But some of them (fellow homeschoolers) were involved in Charismania. So I thought, "If Gothard was worth a plug nickel he wouldn't take money from these people he doesn't agree with doctrinally." That's when you had to be approved to do the Gothard homeschooling. So I figured out right then, since he would compromise when the price was right, I was not buying whatever it was he was selling.
