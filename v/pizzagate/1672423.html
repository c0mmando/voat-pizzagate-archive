<p><a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/wcbn_news">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/wcbn_news</a> preview.mp4</p>
<p>It\'s a &quot;news show&quot; with a caucasian guy wearing garbage bags and sunglasses as a costume and some voice effects doing news segments at a desk talking to the camera with a GameCube beside him.  He says:</p>
<p>&quot;You know what really bothers me?  Janitors.  (then it shows a screenshot from YouTube to them: &quot;Dear Worldcorp Enterprises, Thank you for submitting your video appeal to YouTube.  After further review, we\'ve determined that your video is in violation of our Community Guidelines.  Any associated penalties will remain on your account.&quot;)  See, the thing is, with pulling(not sure if that\'s the word) it, I can understand, it can be interpreted in some...negative ways.  Janitor comes over, spills his bucket. (someone off-camera hits him with something harmless) See what that guy just did?  He\'s getting sued.  Recently, somebody in our offices (from here the voice gets warped and slowed down) made a little mistake.  They did something bad.  They (can\'t make it out).  I don\'t wanna talk about it...A better place, we\'re buying(not sure if that\'s the word) out your world, so you don\'t have to.  But some people, they don\'t appreciate it.  And you know what, they, should be fired.  They should be fired!  They are NOT acceptable.  They will be removed! (he pushes his desk over, the desk appears to just be a cardboard box)&quot;</p>
<p>The overall vibe of the whole thing is late-teens early-20s...from the way the guy speaks to the fucking around hitting him and the GameCube etc  Couldn\'t picture this person being CIA/FBI or anything like that and definitely couldn\'t see this being the person in Fatherhood or Each.  It looks like Worldcorpo isn\'t happy with getting YouTube flags on their channel.  I\'ve noticed elsewhere that they use the term &quot;janitor&quot; a lot, I think usually to describe their employees or moderators but not really sure.</p>
<p>So that\'s the video.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/">http://worldcorpo.net/content/</a> there\'s an EXE file (called &quot;logger: jumping game.exe&quot;)...but no way am I downloading or running that, it sounds like it could be a keylogger or something.  Any brave or crazy people want to risk running it and report what it is?  Don\'t do it if you don\'t have the setup to run something like that safely.</p>
<p>And two new images from the worldcorpo CEO apparently (both SFW):</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/X5tPR2c.png">https://i.imgtc.com/X5tPR2c.png</a>
<a href="https://i.imgtc.com/nMcnboj.png">https://i.imgtc.com/nMcnboj.png</a></p>
<p>First one looks like a bottle with a label of some kind and parts of someone\'s body and is labelled &quot;saved frame from cut part of video&quot;, and the second image is the textured shower.</p>
<h2><strong>Remember that we already know Worldcorp probably didn\'t film Fatherhood and Each themselves, the shills are going to say &quot;look see, Worldcorpo is just some teenagers fucking around so that\'s them on the Fatherhood and Each clips everyone stop looking into this&quot; but we still don\'t have an explanation for who originally filmed those clips and regardless of whether it\'s Podesta or a Worldcorp employee or whatever, you can clearly see and hear that kid terrified (especially if you desaturate and brighten the video, the kid running around scared is incredibly clear), the colored lights coming from a light source on the floor match CPP\'s stage lights, there\'s a frame of the arm holding the broom and it\'s skinny like Podestas, the shower can be small and hidden away somewhere because we know the CPP gang are good with construction, and any shills who tell you the audio has been altered needs to post the original videos and the current videos side by side explaining exactly what specific parts of the audio have been added/changed/removed or they\'re probably lying...verify everything for yourselves.</strong></h2>',

            You can totally download that file, but no need to. I did, and analized it after discovering it would not run. Unsurprisingly it is not an exe file at all, but just renamed this way to make it look like a trojan horse or some kind of virus. Really twisted, and obviously aimed at tech-savvy folk who can recognize this just by the filename and size, and jump to the conclusion that it is in fact a virus...

            I did a post on this very file

            I'm new to the Worldcorpo stuff but could all of the references to "janitor" be a broadcast to clean up crews to begin taking out people who are being named?

            ~NO GPS....I was praying for it to be there. But unfortunately it was stripped. Which ol' skippy just isn't good enough to do, remember his password.....was p@ssword (He's a fucking idiot). "This fact" (Meta GPS Stripped) also leads me to believe that "Worldcorpo" are friendlies.....trying to help us. A few clues there. It was filmed with an iPhone + Original date of 2011 then modified in 2015 for fatherhood was left unstripped. The other one was stripped but we can safely assume that it was around the same time.

            I'm downloading the "jumping game" to my virtual machine - will let you know shortly.
            <br/>
            <strong>
             No one else download it unless they know what they are doing!
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:
            <br/>
            I have run it in a virtual machine (windows 7) and it returned "program is too big to fit into memory"......... So still clueless..... My guess is someone tried to merge a logger with a flash game or something and it corrupted...

             Or just going to DL it to a hacktop over public wifi and then kill your net and examine the file. Even though I think it's a RAT.....RATs are useless if they can't communicate with home base. But the possibility of it being more than nothing are also good as well.

             Or just DL it directly to a flash or sd/micro sd card. (Then with net off you can examine) (Which I am going to do tomorrow after picking up a new pack of micro sd's)
