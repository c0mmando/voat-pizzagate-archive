            The little girl seemed extremely maladjusted even before she was rehomed with the pedophile.  I really have to wonder what sort of stuff Justin Harris did to her considering she was completely normal once she was adopted by normal people.  I don't know if he is a pedophile himself or just a pimp but either way he is a truly horrible person.

             Also if you haven't already look into the "daycare" center Harris runs, that looks like a concentration camp.

            <p>
             This place looks much worse than the pictures show in the article. And by that I mean spiral wire on the top of fences, no grass, literallly looks like a prison camp.

             Rehoming still occurs in some states and can be done easily with only a Power of Attorney reassigning guardianship to an interested party.  There was a big expose by a team done a few years ago when adoptive families were advertising their adopted children on Yahoo message boards.

             There currently are FB pages who continue to rehome through a third party.  Here's one of the pages:

            <p>
             Rehoming or adoptions through the foster system are ripe for pedophiles to acquire children .  Bio parents are constantly sharing horror stories in FB groups that are specifically set up for parents dealing with the system.  Here's a comment I read today from a mother on the Americas' Taken page:
            </p>
            <p>
             "He can look into Canadian County, they love kidnapping kids or getting paid off by child molesters and rapist who pay them to keep the kids in their hands instead of giving them to the parent who tries to protect them. They physically attack children and threaten them and dont get charged with anything. And its pretty sad when the juvenile family court judge is the only one and says "the constitution does not exist in MY court room" and the so called D.A. says and 11 yr old is old enough to know right from wrong so she can consent to sexual activity and if she didnt want to be raped she shouldve said NO!!! This is an 11yr old we are talking about!!!" -
