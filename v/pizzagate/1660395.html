            That's an interesting theory.  My main counter to it would be the absolutely ridiculous amateurish but fascist way MSM shut it down.  You might say they planned it that way, but I don't think they would have come so strongly to Comet's defense if the purpose was to enrage mama bear.  Anyway it didn't work with the Hillary moms so much.

            And as to the video being super slick, the people who made it have more or less been identified and they don't seem slick or very professional in a corporate way.  They are more mature than the average band.  And they originated in San Francisco and have been at it a long time.  They are more hipster artists than anything.  But I do agree that you have identified a lot of elements in it coming from intelligence and intel.  I think that's because the creative force behind it was brought up in Intel and is surrounded by operators.

             the intel people might realize at this point that CNN is toast anyway,  the whole plan may be to pretend that the Pizzagate geeks are counterculture rebeles etc., when they looks like a team of 'instant rollout geeks to me.
David Seaman and 'Titus Frost', all worked up about hotdogs at the whitehouse, and they can't stop drooling,,,
the whole thing is fucking ludicrous

            Hillary went to Epstein's Pedophile Island too and allegedly is on tape with an underage female.  This isn't men under attack, this is pedophilia under attack.  And since when can a man have an infant and sell it to a baby broker for money?

             but everyone knows that the average Mama Grizzly sees MALES at the root of it.
Take a team of feminists from  your local teachers union or from the nearby bureaucracy of your choice, be it any bank or govt office or school or whatever.
Give  your team smart phones. Take the team to Walmart on a busy day to search for a suspected 'pedophile perv' in the store
            </p>
            <p>
             Tell them to collect pics and video of the  prime suspect of their choice.And then to meet to compare notes after, at a set time hours later.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guarantee you that 100% of their chosen suspects will be MALE. and on top ot that , probably 95% white.

              That may be true.  Think in terms of drugs.  The drug user is a lawbreaker for using controlled substances.  There are more of them than drug peddlers.  But what about the drug producers, the makers of the drugs.  The creator of the drugs.  There would be no drug user (who is a criminal) if it were not for the drug producers and traffickers.  Whom is the most guilty?  Who is harming the most people.  These drugs weren't stolen.  These drugs were sold!  Who is the bigger criminal (though all involved are criminal).  It is the child trafficking business that is the real criminal.  And the producers of the children...are they all men?  Think about it.

             You remind me of something I have observed, which is the men here are incredibly awesome.  They are ideal men, in that they are intelligent and stand up for the vulnerable.  I think there are as many men as women here.

              I agree.  It's not a time for sexism.  Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.  But the innocents (children) are always innocent.
