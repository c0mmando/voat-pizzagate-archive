<p>The G184 was led by two of the country’s most reviled multimillionaires, who are both of middle eastern heritage: (1) Andy Apaid, Jr., a U.S. citizen and the owner of Haiti’s largest sweatshops, and (2) Reginald Boulos, owner of a Haitian pharmaceutical firm whose products had killed dozens of poor Haitians.1 Both are linked to influential media corporations2 belonging to the National Association of Haitian Media (ANMH).

<p>Subject: PLease convey my thanks to Secretary Clinton for the visit</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier in the day Boulos and seven other prominent business people met with Preval and urged him to adopt the OAS\'

<p>Cheryl,</p>
<p>We believe that our &quot;behind the doors actions&quot; have been so far more effective than the usual public
statements of the past. The business community has played a major role in helping to get the November 28
elections back on track, by convincing President Preval to request the OAS mission, by publicly denouncing the
results of the 1st round, and as late as yesterday morning (3 hours meeting with Preval) by convincing him to
drop the idea of annulment of the elections.</p>
<p>As you know, President Preval has not been happy about the position of the Private Sector. But to his credit,
he has kept the dialogue open with us. For the first time in a long time, the position of the Haitian Private
Sector is based on principles and not particular interests. As I mention to you many times, we need your
support to continue to build a strong and ethical Private Sector. Everyone in the diplomatic circles and among
the Haitian political leaders will confirm the role played by the Private Sector Economic Forum over the past 6
months. Our published polls ( controversial for some) has contributed in modernizing the way elections are
monitored as the results confirmed the quality of the polls and the OAS results were consistent with the quick
counts we organized on November 28.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Haitian Private Sector, I want to thank you for the commitment you have shown toward Haiti

             Seems like Reginald Boulos is just a corrupt politic with many influences. The real deal here is the ex haitian president Michel Joseph Martelly, Clinton's puppet. Now we know that top politicians are in control by The Clintons.

              The biggest international project aimed at helping Haiti rebound from the 2010
earthquake.
Those involved hope the South Korean garment manufacturer Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd. will set an example and urge other foreign businesses to invest in Haiti, a country long ignored by outsiders because of its
cumbersome laws, heaps of red tape and occasional political tumult.

            Saw the proof of life video! What is the best way to help him? In this video it was the first time I had heard him realize that all of this is a continuation of the original CIA under DR . Mengele from Operation Paperclip. It is this is important to understand is the drive to create genetic elite exists as well as a spirititual component &amp; commitment to occult, Thelma, Crowley, or straight out Luceferian. They believe this, justify their own behavior in this way.
