<a href="http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/05/06/girl-kidnapped-sexually-assaulted/">http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/05/06/girl-kidnapped-sexually-assaulted/</a></p>
<p>&quot;police found the 7-year-old girl inside a halfway house about a block away.&quot; -
&quot; The search led police to the Catholic Charities St. Christopher Place just around the block. “Intially he didn’t answer the door, so officers — in effort to find girl as soon as possible — started dismantling the door,” Steve Linders of St. Paul Police said. “That’s when the officers looked in the room and saw the little girl, and it was apparent she had been sexually assaulted.”
How did he have access???
Catholic Charities CEO released a statement regarding the incident at St. Christopher Place:</p>
<p>“What we know of the situation is tragic and unacceptable. St. Christopher Place is a fully independent living apartment building … Catholic Charities does not accept Level 3 sex offenders at any of our housing locations.”</p>
<p>Sure...sure...</p>

<p>then at the bottom of that article is says this same church has had a history of child sex abuse; (COVER UP)</p>
<p>&quot;The St. John the Apostle Catholic Church has experienced at least two other sexual abuse scandals in the past.
In 2003, Joseph Magone, the church\'s director of liturgy, was sentenced to five years in prison for raping a 13-year-old girl. The church also settled a lawsuit in 2012 filed by a man who accused Philip Magaldi, a former priest, of sexually abusing him starting around 1994.&quot;</p>
<p>Still digging on this one, and to include how i got to this info: here:</p>
<p>I started looking into the Pedo rings stuff in Australia, there is found this article detailing the work of Dr. Reina Michaelson:
Australian Pedophile Ring
Critical Information on a Secret Pedophile Network
<a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/australian-network">http://www.wanttoknow.info/sexabuse/australian-network</a></p>
<p>She said this : &quot; &quot;The members of the network include senior management and executives from a major television network, media celebrities, high-ranking politicians, police officers in charge of pedophile and child pornography investigations, senior management representatives from the Department of Education, directors of &quot;child-focused&quot; service clubs, wealthy businessmen, and others&quot;</p>
<p>i later googled &quot; -directors of &quot;child-focused&quot; service clubs-&quot;
And saw what comes up :there\'s a lot of possible places, and people, but she said &quot; senior management&quot;
so look all those folks up and down.
