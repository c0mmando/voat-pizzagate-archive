            Yes, the dollar is still the standard for the oil trade.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, Saudis are pedos. And yes, it is true that precious white kids are often a preferred "type".
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, the Saudis are linked to CF probably in many ways through funding and geopolitical influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the pedo trade w/ Saudi's is a small component. The pedo trade is NOT based solely on pedo currency w/ Saudi's. There are plenty of wealthy patrons all over the world who literally place an order and the rings fill it.
           </p>
           <p>
            And components of the pedo trade here at home work a little differently. You need to dig into the multiple crises going on right now in children's public services (Child Protective Services, Foster Care, etc.) The feds have provided public services financial incentives that can bring up to $1M over the course of a year for one child, depending on his/her circumstances and health status (most notorious is psychiatric conditions that require medications---so these kids are conveniently diagnosed AND drugged up). Here is a previous post I made re: CPS crimes:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1472074/7135253">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1472074/7135253
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             ETA:  Meant to include this statement ---due to the corruption within these services and the continued and increased funding that is being awarded them, YOUR tax dollars are being funneled to these rings, make no mistake about it.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ironically, you also hear of CPS acting negligently (literally the opposite of taking kids from homes w/out cause) and doing nothing for kids because they are underfunded and understaffed. I think these significantly extreme and inconsistent conditions scream corruption and expose how some kids are trafficked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you have the teenage group - these are kids on the street - runaways. And this is also the age group adjudicated through the court system - detention/training schools, halfway homes... this is what people generally think of when people talk about trafficking - the "barely legals" and for several reasons this group is targeted a little more easily with fewer complications involved, particularly the street kids). People are astonished when they realize that infants are victims of these crime rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other source for kids is war zones - all ages and young women who are forced to prostitute and used as baby factories.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yet another source is through pedo crime families, particularly those involved in the satanic ritual abuse. It's generational and they 'grow' their own stock.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             ETA: My 2nd edit is this statement---I think the Saudi history with the Bushes is pretty well established (look into 9/11) and I thought Saudi campaign donations as well as CF investments had also been established?
            </strong>

            That's where all the kids who are reported missing go. On a diplomatic Jet, for a holiday in the sun. The cops get paid off to look the other way. The rational is that these kids would only end up as wards of the state and cost the tax payer , no one will miss them anyway so why not make a few bucks.

            Apparently our currency is propped up because it is the standard for oil sales. The 'petro dollar' - and the theory is that we are giving the Saudis children (pedo dollar) to keep the dollar their currency of choice. Otherwise, if they switch to Chinese currency you'd be buying a loaf of bread with a wagon full of 100's.
