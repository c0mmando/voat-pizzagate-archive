            How is this a confirmation of anything?  Seth Rich was obviously not a witness in their lawsuit.  If he was, it's no surprised it was thrown out of court.  They filed three weeks after he died.

            Shawn Lucas was not a witness in the main lawsuit.  Dude was a process server.  Literally someone hired to transport a piece of paper.  He misfiled the lawsuit with the wrong Rebecca, a Rebecca who was not authorized to be served on behalf of the DNC and a judge said if the reserved the DNC the case could progress.

            Lucas or anyone else could have done what he did.   What special knowledge could he have?

              In the case of Seth Rich this is ridiculous.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the case of Lucas.  He had knowledge about one subject, serving the lawsuit.  The judge let them reserve it.  So the subject that was no longer relevant.
