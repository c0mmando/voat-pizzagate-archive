           I'm pretty sure we have enough to get something going. Enough people would want to join. If it is done right, there would be several on the same day around the world.

            I agree with your line of thinking.  May I suggest a candlelight march ? there are many groups who would support this cause and it would also get us away from the fake news label. This is about missing and exploiting children at the hands of some corrupt officials who use it for the purposes of blackmail and hazing. This is not far fetched but actually common practice in a smaller scale with sororities and fraternities at most colleges. I think a march is a great idea.
