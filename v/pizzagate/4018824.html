<p>The U.S. Marshals Service recently launched a nationwide effort to recover missing and exploited children. Three major operations rescued over 100 children, many of them from sex traffickers. But a disturbing trend discovered during the operation should launch a nationwide investigation into the American child welfare system. PJ Media reached out to USMS for details on the rescued children and was told that the majority of them came from foster care. This information was ignored in the initial media reports on the operation. Dave Oney, press contact at the USMS, responded via email to questions about the rescued children.</p>
<p>For the Northern Ohio Operation Safety Net: 25 of the 31 children recovered were in DCFS care in either a group homes or foster case. Additionally, seven children have been confirmed victims of sex trafficking.</p>
<p>For Operation Not Forgotten in Georgia: 28 of the 39 recovered were in the care of DFACS; 15 were victims of sex trafficking</p>
<p>For Operation Homecoming in Indianapolis: Of the eight children recovered, two were in foster homes or group homes.  Five were runaways with risk factors. One was a noncustodial kidnapping.  The bulk of the cases still being worked are foster/group home situations.</p>
<p>The State Department recently confirmed that a large number of children involved in sex trafficking in the United States are coming from foster care.</p>
<p>In the United States, traffickers prey upon children in the foster care system. Recent reports have consistently indicated that a large number of victims of child sex trafficking were at one time in the foster care system.</p>
<p>Why is the foster care system not under federal investigation? For the last several years I have investigated child welfare cases all over the country and have found glaring violations of constitutional rights by family courts and child welfare agencies. I discovered child welfare agents conspiring with doctors to illegally seize custody of newborns. PJ Media columnist Jeff Reynolds and I exposed disgusting living conditions in foster care group homes and incidences of horrific abuse that led to the murders of children in the system.</p>
<p>Child welfare departments have been found to remove children regularly without cause from good parents who struggle with health issues or addiction to put them into the homes of actual abusers. Social workers have been caught mocking parents’ rights online and modeling “professional kidnapper” t-shirts, lying to judges to intentionally keep children illegally, and actually abusing children themselves. Social services agencies regularly get sued and lose huge amounts of money for endangering children and violating rights.</p>
<p>What more will it take to convince the powers that be that there is a serious problem in our child welfare agencies?</p>
<p>If you are not a subscriber to my weekly VIP podcast, “The Fringe,” I encourage you to sample this week’s free show, where I interview a survivor of the foster care system.

Please listen and share it far and wide. Maybe one of our law enforcement agencies will hear it and finally do something about the foster care nightmare terrorizing American children.</p>

            I'll probably get denied this post because I don't care to put up supporting proof since if is readily available through your own research if so decide to do so. But I'm quite sure the reason they don't do anything about it this is all because they use the system for their satanic ritual abomination crap and that's just that. It is sick and that's what they enjoy.

            what I think is happening is that the hollywood propaganda movies seep in more towards abused distressed people like foster care kids. So, they feel emboldened to do what adults do. Imo, I have seen foster kids, which  deeply fall into media brainwashing and are prime victims. They have a strange mentality to them.

            Bylaws of the Order of Child Saviors
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The purpose of these Bylaws is the total annihilation of pedophilia.  The legitimacy of these Bylaws is the preservation of the future of humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any shall become a Member of this Order by swearing an Oath to annihilate pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Upon swearing such an Oath unbroken, all votes due a sworn Member shall immediately be recognized, but all votes of such Member shall be destroyed upon death or disloyalty, yet no vote once destroyed shall ever be recognized again.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Member shall as Spotter have 1 vote per supporter, 10 votes per consumer, and 100 votes per producer of pedophilia identified by such member and 1,000 votes per child rapist identified by such member.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Member shall as Executioner have 1 vote per supporter, 10 votes per consumer, and 100 points per producer of pedophilia or its' legal facilitator killed; 1,000 votes per child rapist or its' legal facilitator publicly executed; 10,000 votes per child rapist or its' legal facilitator tortured to death; and 100,000 votes per child rapist or its' legal facilitator publicly impaled and left to rot by such Member.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Member shall as Isolator have votes equal to the real market value of funds contributed to this Order, votes equal to the real market value of property that promotes or distributes pedophilia destroyed, votes equal to the real market value of plunder stripped from pedophiles and their supporters, and votes multiplied 100 times by the real market value of government property used to provide freedom for pedophiles or their supporters, consumers, or legal facilitators razed by such Member.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Spotters by majority vote shall appropriate funds in exchange for acts that annhilate pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Executioners by majority vote shall elect the Strategos who shall deliver Order funds according to Defiler Appropriation &amp; Plunderer Direction.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Isolators by majority vote shall direct Commanders from which Members shall choose their direction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two of three Member classes shall veto by respective majority vote any Spotter Appropriation, Strategos Delivery, or Isolator Direction.
            </p>
            <p>
             This Code shall be suspended upon the perceived total annihilation of the pedophilia but shall restart upon any report of the same.
