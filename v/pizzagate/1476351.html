            Also when they hit the Pizzagate researchers again ALL OF US need to be ready to strike back - that means if a "Stephen Colbert - Pizzagate people are loons 2.0" video gets put up or an MSM site covers us we need to be ready to redpill people in the comments of the video/article. The Colbert Pizzagate video now has over a third of dislikes and most of the thumbed up comments are pizzagate truthers, so I imagine a vid with almost 2 mil views like that can bring a lot of people to our side.

            But Google search is censoring us and shows a bunch of nonsense, so there will still be a bunch of people who believe we are "tinfoil hat crazies". Stay strong everyone, we know we are right!
