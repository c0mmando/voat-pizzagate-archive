            by ur name I wonder...but look for your self I won't click open any of it. Go to search voat if you cant find that on the site like I couldn't you can Google search voat andbitbwill give you the search bar. Then type in jailbait. Regarding what I posted about the top trending hashtag board being a message board for pedos on Twitter and the image of the follower I got was from using hashtag PANCAKEDAY. I posted the followers acount to make a point about Twitter soliciting child porn via use of the hashtags.after I reported it to FBI. What would be a dick in vagina is a detail, but that has no bodies attached. There's no torso, nor hips it's just a dick going in a hole you cannot tell if that's a little girl or adult being penetrated. Or a man. The links are blocked out. This is ridiculous that I am defending myself to PORN PERPETRATORS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS SITE. SHAME ON YOU!
GOD PROTECT US FROM THIS TYPE OF TRICKERY!!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The point that I am making, is that I was on to the code, together if the post weren't removed it could have actually been possible to bust at least a few pedos peddling their wares on Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            It made NO SENSE to try to say I was intending as stupid

            keeps sayinh to get people into pressing CP links.
           </p>
           <p>
            VERY odd!!! So I looked at what they are hiding on voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep indeed. PEDO shit. And they are all about it. They know all about it all this time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meaning the mods know very well and

            </a>
            ...said something weird to me, ill go find it...I wonder if they fired mf cause he hated the child predators chat subs on voat?
           </p>
           <p>
            found out abt the pedo subs the day nameof was banned. I was nameof. The post listed alot more than just jailbait but I was too busy to read it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although i was banned from Pizzagate only. Im sure that indicator fucked with my password so I cold no longer log on to voat at all from any device. Hence namodam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I see the mods have written to me on the hour I shit you not &amp;, i can't post cause they got some kind of 24 hour ban on me Them talking about reporting me to Law Enforcement Is Good cause then the FBI will take care of all the pedo subs on voat!
           </p>
           <p>
            Please do!
           </p>
           <p>
            Call the police on yourselves!!!!!

            I reported v@vindicator to FBI for posting me that him and

           </p>
           <p>
            Wow, lame a terrorist threat. Not worried. I never posted child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just depressing to spend a year talking to folks who harbor child porn in the style of true creeps, in front of everyone's face. That's how its done by LUCIFERIANS.

            THE OWNER OF VOAT,

             @ATKO
            </a>
            I WROTE TO YOU ABT THIS AND NEVER HEARD BACK. I asked abt the pedo subs no reply.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I posted was a screenshot of a Twitter account page that followed my Twitter account! THE POST I MADE I MARKED NSFW!!! I said it's safe because it was as far as toxic links. The warning was there as far as graphicly.
           </p>
           <p>
            And by the way, the image is not "as child porn as you can get" what garbage spout.
           </p>
           <p>
            go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/VINDICATORS">
             @VINDICATORS
            </a>
            Twitter feed and find it, it's posted to him there repeatedly and as I say it's not an illegal image. His handle is
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindic8tr">
             @vindic8tr
            </a>
            and if it were illegal it would be an issue. And it's not except for here in Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the issue is that I found a pedophile code being used on twitter, that's the info that's getting shut out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted that screenshot everywhere now as sort of a voat meme Right beside the post indicator finger gave me that Threatens me about having my ip AND MACHINE ID &amp; he says that my says are numbered.
           </p>
           <p>
            When i posted, it was taken down for having links within the screenshot to child porn, I was told. SO I covered the links with photo editor!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I reposted it .
           </p>
           <p>
            My post was talking about Twitter top trending hashtags as messages and that hashtag pancake day =  flatchested child &lt;br&gt; That's what im banned for. Catching Twitter using code then voat shuts my post down.  &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY WOULD pizzagate vOAT mods DO THAT? Miss r saying I posted a rape image. Lie. There's a detail on the image that shows a phallus penetrating an orifice. No one can say how old the orifice is or if it make or female.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a reason for the compulsive behaviour maybe why
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/MILLENIAL_FALCONS">
             @MILLENIAL_FALCONS
            </a>
            NOT here anymore. Voat harbors huge pedophile community. Pizzagate is their learning board. These people think they  are smart. &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            JAILBAITANON voat  b is only one pedo subforums here. I've  been taking lots and lots of screenshots and posting them to the FBI too. &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            So anyway anyone who says I post child porn is living human waste.&lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            like I said, perfect example here

            deflecting the fact I call out voat for harboring a sado pedo predatory Zone and safe place.

            KNOWS MY POST WAS MARKED NSFW, the LIAR ALso knows I reported the TWITTER accnt page I took the screenshot of to FBI bc it states in my post, PRIOR TO POSTING THE SCREENSHOT ON VOAT
           </p>
           <p>
            if you read any of that SCRaZY'S  posts you can detect more than a little mania and obsessiveness, .
           </p>
           <p>
            Think logically. There's a small group of LOYAL ppl who mod and post to pizzagate voat, post on voat, and use voat as a psychological tool. Pizzagate is a tool.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  VOAT IS NEITHER SAFE FOR KIDS NOR OPEN TO FREE SPEECH THAT IS THE HOAX.
           </p>
           <p>
            As long as you have sheep herders like sCrazie and

            </a>
            blowing up all this nonsense in your face, like Q posts and voat rules... so nobody sees what's up with all this JAILBAITANON. Children sex video/pictures you guy$ trade. It makes my stomach turn. Un American. As long as that's what's up you GOOD PEOPLE are being DUPED AND used.
           </p>
           <p>
            LETS SEE SCRAZY Make ATIF COLO take down the pedo subs, why don't you instead of slandering me and trying to make me vanish. Evil.

            hears my voice on the Chans and warns mods here that I am everywhere. Flattered as well as weirded out.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's real is I don't have alts, and I don't block people.  This may change because Now that vindy &amp; scrazy have banned me from several forums for raising my voice against the false disgusting lie that I posted CP, since then I can't log on from any other device. Says it doesn't know me. SO NAMODAM IS WHO I AM NOW. Thanks Better name.

            Go look at JAILBAITANON VOAT. THIS STINKNG PEDO PROTECTING  whole site. ITS GOTTA GO. I WAS HORRIFIED WHEN I LOOKED.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I posted TO VOAT is there for anyone to see. So what's in it for O.C.D crazy SCRazie??

            3.Right millenialfalcon got the boot and that was heads up to me that things were weird. The name namodam came to me last night, but guess what it's not my alt it's my new name. So please call me it. I don't have ALTS and I don't block anyone. Those options are for wimps I guess that's not my style. I want to confront this bullshit face first. No I did not post child porn. I am just a little bit offended by that and I won't settle for it from a site that harbors sheist like this

           </p>
           <p>
            You've done it. You have ignored child sexualization on Voat, and focused a weak lame attack on My Name/character. Grooooosss! You. Voat.

            by ur name I wonder...but look for your self I won't click open any of it. Go to search voat if you cant find that on the site like I couldn't you can Google search voat andbitbwill give you the search bar. Then type in jailbait. Regarding what I posted about the top trending hashtag board being a message board for pedos on Twitter and the image of the follower I got was from using hashtag PANCAKEDAY. I posted the followers acount to make a point about Twitter soliciting child porn via use of the hashtags.after I reported it to FBI. What would be a dick in vagina is a detail, but that has no bodies attached. There's no torso, nor hips it's just a dick going in a hole you cannot tell if that's a little girl or adult being penetrated. Or a man. The links are blocked out. This is ridiculous that I am defending myself to PORN PERPETRATORS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS SITE. SHAME ON YOU!
GOD PROTECT US FROM THIS TYPE OF TRICKERY!!!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            The point that I am making, is that I was on to the code, together if the post weren't removed it could have actually been possible to bust at least a few pedos peddling their wares on Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            It made NO SENSE to try to say I was intending as stupid

            keeps sayinh to get people into pressing CP links.
           </p>
           <p>
            VERY odd!!! So I looked at what they are hiding on voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep indeed. PEDO shit. And they are all about it. They know all about it all this time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meaning the mods know very well and

            ...said something weird to me, ill go find it...I wonder if they fired mf cause he hated the child predators chat subs on voat?
           </p>
           <p>
            found out abt the pedo subs the day nameof was banned. I was nameof. The post listed alot more than just jailbait but I was too busy to read it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although i was banned from Pizzagate only. Im sure that indicator fucked with my password so I cold no longer log on to voat at all from any device. Hence namodam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I see the mods have written to me on the hour I shit you not &amp;, i can't post cause they got some kind of 24 hour ban on me Them talking about reporting me to Law Enforcement Is Good cause then the FBI will take care of all the pedo subs on voat!
           </p>
           <p>
            Please do!
           </p>

            Call the police on yourselves!!!!!

            I reported v@vindicator to FBI for posting me that him and

           <p>
            Wow, lame a terrorist threat. Not worried. I never posted child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just depressing to spend a year talking to folks who harbor child porn in the style of true creeps, in front of everyone's face. That's how its done by LUCIFERIANS.

             @ATKO
            </a>
            I WROTE TO YOU ABT THIS AND NEVER HEARD BACK. I asked abt the pedo subs no reply.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I posted was a screenshot of a Twitter account page that followed my Twitter account! THE POST I MADE I MARKED NSFW!!! I said it's safe because it was as far as toxic links. The warning was there as far as graphicly.
           </p>
           <p>
            And by the way, the image is not "as child porn as you can get" what garbage spout.
           </p>
           <p>
            go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/VINDICATORS">
             @VINDICATORS
            </a>
            Twitter feed and find it, it's posted to him there repeatedly and as I say it's not an illegal image. His handle is
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindic8tr">
             @vindic8tr
            </a>
            and if it were illegal it would be an issue. And it's not except for here in Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the issue is that I found a pedophile code being used on twitter, that's the info that's getting shut out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted that screenshot everywhere now as sort of a voat meme Right beside the post indicator finger gave me that Threatens me about having my ip AND MACHINE ID &amp; he says that my says are numbered.
           </p>
           <p>
            When i posted, it was taken down for having links within the screenshot to child porn, I was told. SO I covered the links with photo editor!!
           </p>
           <p>
            I reposted it .
           </p>
           <p>
            My post was talking about Twitter top trending hashtags as messages and that hashtag pancake day =  flatchested child &lt;br&gt; That's what im banned for. Catching Twitter using code then voat shuts my post down.  &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY WOULD pizzagate vOAT mods DO THAT? Miss r saying I posted a rape image. Lie. There's a detail on the image that shows a phallus penetrating an orifice. No one can say how old the orifice is or if it make or female.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a reason for the compulsive behaviour maybe why

             @MILLENIAL_FALCONS

            NOT here anymore. Voat harbors huge pedophile community. Pizzagate is their learning board. These people think they  are smart. &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            JAILBAITANON voat  b is only one pedo subforums here. I've  been taking lots and lots of screenshots and posting them to the FBI too. &lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            So anyway anyone who says I post child porn is living human waste.&lt;br&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            like I said, perfect example here

           </p>
           <p>
            if you read any of that SCRaZY'S  posts you can detect more than a little mania and obsessiveness, .
           </p>
           <p>
            Think logically. There's a small group of LOYAL ppl who mod and post to pizzagate voat, post on voat, and use voat as a psychological tool. Pizzagate is a tool.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  VOAT IS NEITHER SAFE FOR KIDS NOR OPEN TO FREE SPEECH THAT IS THE HOAX.

            blowing up all this nonsense in your face, like Q posts and voat rules... so nobody sees what's up with all this JAILBAITANON. Children sex video/pictures you guy$ trade. It makes my stomach turn. Un American. As long as that's what's up you GOOD PEOPLE are being DUPED AND used.

           </p>
           <p>
            What's real is I don't have alts, and I don't block people.  This may change because Now that vindy &amp; scrazy have banned me from several forums for raising my voice against the false disgusting lie that I posted CP, since then I can't log on from any other device. Says it doesn't know me. SO NAMODAM IS WHO I AM NOW. Thanks Better name.

            3.Right millenialfalcon got the boot and that was heads up to me that things were weird. The name namodam came to me last night, but guess what it's not my alt it's my new name. So please call me it. I don't have ALTS and I don't block anyone. Those options are for wimps I guess that's not my style. I want to confront this bullshit face first. No I did not post child porn. I am just a little bit offended by that and I won't settle for it from a site that harbors sheist like this

            (twitter) falsely accuses me of posting child porn to voat. This is to distract from the fact Voat hosts pedo forums. It was all getting exposed wasn't it? The day I was banned. Too much. I have been calling it out but was on to it from the start. I politely wrote with questions to ATIF COLO abt it, no reply. STANKY.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did not post child porn, I posted a screenshot hosted by imgbb as all my screenshots are that are loaded to voat, and it was a screenshot of a Twitter accnt that followed my Twitter account.&lt;br&gt;

  Anyone who says I post child porn  is living human waste and a sick demented liar. I won't take that bullshit at all. I will spread this knowledge abt the pedo hiding spaces, pedo talking codes and pedo protectors where I find it. And heaven help those who try to use God's name in vain against me. My vision my path is righteousness and golden life for children. Children are gold children first.&lt;br&gt;

           <p>
            On a side note, even when we'll have discuss posts only, we might still need to pull posts because the title isn't adequate.
           </p>
           <p>
            My experience is that posts that were self-deleted, and reposted with a better headline later, got by far more traction then.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many submitters still don't realize how important a good and adequate headline is.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO we should continue our current policy - when both the headline and the body of the post need to be edited, the post should be pulled. OP can edit and resubmit.

             I'd love to see the traffic on link vs non-link titled posts.  I know I don't click on them generally.  If figure if someone can't take the time to write 5 sentences about what they are posting then it probably isn't worth my time.  I'm sure others may feel the same.

             flair Discuss posts , unless it's a case of blatant BS, or Rule 4 anti-mod bitching (i.e. the whole point of the post makes it belong in another sub). Some people have a really difficult time writing good headlines and it is worthwhile if they can get suggestions from others. We can and should ask them to repost with a new headline and self-remove as soon as they get one. Working on writing better headlines together as a community helps everyone get better at and understand why it's important.

              The problem with this is that then the post will already have a lot of comments, and these will be gone when OP self-deletes.

              I'm afraid I beg to differ here. Then total crap posts would be allowed to stay, and we wouldn't be able to pull those any more. Sometimes OPs intentionally post with a crap headline, and a crap text. I don't want these post be able to stay.

               What do you mean by "total crap posts"? Do you mean posts that are misleading, untrue, or obvious shitposts? If so, we are in agreement (Note my comment: "unless it's a case of blatant BS, or Rule 4 anti-mod bitching"). If you mean not specific enough or poorly worded, I disagree. The votes should decide those, and they can be clarified and improved. That was the whole point of the flair system in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as I know, we've only had one thread in the last two months that had an inadequate title that we decided to leave up because so much good stuff came up in the comments before the OP could repost with a better title. Do you have a sense of the numbers of posts we're talking about not allowing the flair?

                I have been thinking of a specific post, when I will have time today or tomorrow, I will go through the mod log and look for it, and edit the comment, so you'll get an idea what I meant.

            Thanks, kev. We did just have a major sticky on this very topic, which got overwhelming support with 57 comments:

            . People may be confused that we are asking about it again. Now that my taxes are done, I was going to go ahead and add the new Rule 6 and make a sticky announcing it. Just haven't had a chance to do it yet.
