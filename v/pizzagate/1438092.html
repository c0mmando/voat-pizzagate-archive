            Alex Jones will get as close to the truth as they want him to.
If he were any kind of threat he wouldn't be around this long.
Look at his operation it's obvious mind control.
Alex Jones is a gatekeeper.
He isn't going to go deep on the #PizzaGate.

            I'm new to this but I have to say, you're an obvious shill.
Keep digging lads.
Don't be discouraged.
What's the point of a post like this.
We need all the investigation we can get.

            What's wrong with alex Jones? I'm not trying to take up fur him really! But it seems like a lot of things people thought he was crazy for (including me!) have turned out to get true.  Am I missing something? I'm being serious
