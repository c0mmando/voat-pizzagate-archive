<p>Took a trip down there last year. I\'ve been an annual visitor to the Virgin Islands (US and British) for the last 15 years however this was the first visit with Pizzagate fresh on the brain. First day visited Cafe Roma on St. John. We arrived and were the first ones to sit down when they opened. I first realized something was off when the bartender (late 50s, early 60s, gay), brought up a group of elementary aged children (no parents in sight) and had them all sit up at the bar and was teaching them to fold pizza boxes. I really didn\'t think anything of it at the time then I noticed the details in the painted wallpaper (see album) Now I know that the \'hurricane hook\' is a popular symbol down there, could I have been mistaken? </p>
<p>Well fast forward to my visit to Skinny Legs (best mahi-mahi sandwiches on the island) and saw more interesting art. The most damning thing there was definitely the \'illuminati\' eye surrounded by the pedo swirl and LGL double-heart. (see album) Down the street they had a \'masquerade\' night for new years eve at a place called The Indigo Grill. That entire side of the island (coral bay) is very shady. I also hiked to the top of Caneel hill and got some great 40 megapixel shots of Jeffery Epstein\'s island. I don\'t have the ability to upload those now but the biggest takeaway is more detail on some of the landscaping on the island (locations of planted palm trees, stuff like that). I don\'t really have the ability or resources to dig into Cafe Roma or Skinny Legs, looking for some feedback on these pics.</p>
<p>Spent a day talking to cab drivers on St. Thomas, all of them know about Jeffrey Epstein but the gist of their attitude towards him was basically &quot;there\'s tons of rich billionaires around here, we\'ve heard about what he might have did or didn\'t do but it\'s none of our business&quot;</p>
<p>Of course I\'ll be returning later this year, I\'ll be chartering a boat to drive around Little St. James Island to get better pictures.</p>

            Is this the same Cafe ? They were having a fund raiser because they had a fire and needed funds to rebuild ? This was in 2013 according to the story . Would be interesting to find the donors list .

            Perhaps the name of the bar , Skinny Legs, also signifies children.  A year ago the notion of child sex tourism would have been incomprehensible, now its just incredibly depressing. We humans have decades to be sexual creatures and only a small window of time to be carefree children preoccupied with nonsexual  delights and now grownups are stealing  this part of life from them and putting a dark cloud over the remainder of their lives.

             Some days, I wish I had never found out about this Evil shit! I take no joy in anything simple anymore. 
Even as adults we have or should have pleasure in the simplicities of "life". Kids laughing, dogs chasing balls, balloons floating, flowers blooming, simple drawings and whimsical doodles ect..
Now, I see these things and instantly think about abused kids, &amp; fakenews!

             Oh wow, I had not seen this. It made me immediately remember
             <a href="http://imgur.com/hyicyZn">
              this
             </a>
             pic I took at the shop next to Skinny Legs, some type of souvenir ring? Also added another pic of the truck

             . It looks like whatever was in the center of the sun was covered up, but I couldn't help but notice the similarity of the 'sun' symbol which was also surrounding the swirl-rings in the gift shop (this truck was parked outside of Skinny Legs)

            Those are some strange banners and the swirl on the truck seems a little out of place. Of course not every symbol is something sinister, but that place being so close to Epstein's island does raise the suspicion level.
