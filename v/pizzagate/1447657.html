            Yup, these people make it a point to get into positions of trust and around children. But in the case of the Catholics, it seems to have come from the top down rather than the bottom up.

            Back in the 90's our team found lots of connections between the pedo ring and education.
Just look at how many female teachers get busted for pedophilia, and look at the results too, they get a slap on the wrist.
Same with some male teachers. Freelance pedo's get incarcerated big time. But some of these creeps get as little as a transfer to another school.

            interesting find, cant believe there are two of these nonsense articles from the same source. wouldnt be surprised if its a sort of paid advertisement of an article. literally who in the F has ever heard of a afterschool pizza program. they are teaching these kids nonsense and likely brainwashing them or doing hypno arts on them. someone should do a quick google and see if there are any more pizza after school programs... my guess probably not... but very well could be that theres a whole underground network associated with these perverts. absolutely sickening. i have already told my wife we arent anything but frozen or homemade until this shit gets sorted out. someone get on those mellow mushroom fuckers too, there logo is literally a smiling dick thats supposed to be a "mushroom" but literally just the tip of a dick. not kid friendly like comet ping pong but full of wierd hippy bullshit.
