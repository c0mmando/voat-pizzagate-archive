<blockquote>
<p>I got to visit The Biltmore House and Estate - in Asheville, NC for the first time yesterday. From being saved out of the occult and recognizing occult symbolism,. I was scoping things out because I heard alot about the Vanderbilt family and their involvement with secret societies and occultism. I was looking around and looking for occult symbolism hidden in plain site. I saw many demonic looking statues and carvings on the outside. I saw a large angel in the garden holding up his left hand and making the El Cornuto satanic hand sign. We went to the next room and I noticed many pagan and
occult wall hangings ... Another painting that I saw had a woman who held a baby in hers arms, I looked a little closer and noticed it had horns! </p>

<p>According to his biographers, Vanderbilt never made a business decision until he first consulted with demon spirits.</p>
<p>Biltmore Estate openly displays gargoyles and horned devils in stone, paintings of ancient Mystery Religion gods and goddesses, and witchcraft furnishings. Gargoyles by themselves do not denote anything sinister.  Plenty of French (ie Notre Dame) and Italian churches display gargoyles on their exterior. It was part of the belief that gargoyles would ward off evil spirits.  However, when considered with all other facts, it\'s clear that the Vanderbilts were occultists.</p>
<p>As a side note, six months after exposing the occult and the Vatican in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8JXqao7I58">this</a> interview, Meyer was found dead.</p>

            I had no clue that Timothy olyphant was a Vanderbilt. Per Wikipedia:  He currently stars in the Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet (2017). (A cannibal show)
           </p>
           <p>
            Olyphant is a descendant of the Vanderbilt family of New York. His paternal fourth great-grandfather was family patriarch Cornelius Vanderbilt and his third great-grandfather was William Henry Vanderbilt, who doubled the family's railroad fortune. Olyphant's great-great-grandmother was socialite Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, his great-grandmother was socialite Emily Vanderbilt Sloane and his granduncle was music producer John Hammond.[13][14] The surname Olyphant is of Scottish origin.[1] His paternal fourth great-grandfather, Dr. David Olyphant, was born in Scotland and served as director-general of the Southern hospitals during the American Revolutionary War.[15] His third great-grandfather, David Olyphant, and great-great-grandfather, Robert Morrison Olyphant, were both prominent businessmen.

            I posted this in the other thread concerning Gloria Vanderbilt...
Not sure if this ties in with Vanderbilt but I used to work on Sutton Place in Manhattan which borders Beekman Place where Gloria Vanderbilt currently lives. I know the Rockefeller's built 1 Beekman Place but I digress...a friend of mine pointed out that if you're on 51st st. at the very end and you gaze below into the garden there is a big bronze statue of what appears to be satan/lucifer. Pretty creepy...

              I'm sure there are. The statue I'm referring to is in a garden of a private house overlooking the East River at 51st St.
If you walk east on 51st as far as you can there's a railed black fence. If you look down to your right into the garden that's where the statue is.

            Now this is the kind of thread that we used to get at the Reddit site, and the early days here. This is the type of focus, connecting dots to a tapestry of behavior and circumstantial evidence that all points in the same direction. Satanic elite cults running society and having the same footprint. One implausable coincidence after another about the same theme. A rare return to from from the BS media sexual impropriaty revelations, phoney probes and hearings, Cryptic nonsense about Trump fighting them behind the scenes and anons leading people in circles with no resolution. PG is about a once hidden society of elites and their achiles heal, Satanic child exploitation and murder on a global scale.  Thumbs up for once.

             Someone with a way better understanding of the symbolism really needs to go through those photos. A lot of Owl, upside down crosses,a kid in red shoes, the same kid looking like he is about to poke his middle finger on a large needled cactus (cut the middle finger, eat the pain....) the design in the gardens walkway and so much more. Who ever posted those images should probably be looked into as well.

               A good painter should be able to tell if the painting is done from a photo.  Certain distortions will be present.  Maybe someone will chime in and give their professional opinion about it.  You could very well be right.

            Lots of interesting stuff here but the one about the DR chairs doesn't belong as a clue of anything.  Very common to have host/hostess chairs with arms at the ends of the table, and the rest of the side chairs being, well, side chairs.

             Thanks. I was going to same the same thing. Not that the family isn’t in the occult, but the dining room chairs with and without arms means nothing. This is in fact typical.

             I was thinking the same thing about the chairs , but maybe that's where the idea of having armchairs originated from ? I know growing up every dining table we ever had , had armchairs at the ends of the table .
