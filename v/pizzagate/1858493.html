<p>When researching his wife, I came across this article titled, &quot;Patrice Comey: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a href="http://heavy.com/news/2016/07/patrice-comey-failor-james-comey-wife-family-spouse-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-emails-no-charges-collin/amp/">http://heavy.com/news/2016/07/patrice-comey-failor-james-comey-wife-family-spouse-fbi-director-hillary-clinton-emails-no-charges-collin/amp/</a>]</p>
<p>The second fact talks about how their 9 day old son contracted Group B Strep and died in her arms.  Very sad. </p>
<p>The fourth fact is titled, &quot;4. Patrice Comey Works With Juveniles &amp; Has Been a Foster Mother.&quot;  
</p>
<p>From the article, &quot;In March, Patrice Comey testified before the legislative Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would allow unpaid volunteers to counsel children through the juvenile justice system, said ctpost.&quot;</p>
<p>Should we really have &quot;unpaid volunteers&quot; helping children going through a crisis at home?  It goes on to state that she has worked as a Guardian Ad Litem.  For anyone who doesn\'t know what that is, Google describes it as follows, &quot;A “Guardian ad litem” (GAL) is a person the court appoints to investigate what solutions would be in the “best interests of a child.” Here, we are talking about a GAL in a divorce or parental rights and responsibilities case.&quot;  
</p>
<p>So the person who actively tried to coverup and bury the Clinton email scandal, which could possibly expose mass corruption, pedophilia and human trafficking by the Clinton Foundation and associates, is married to someone who has represented minors in court and supposedly fought for their &quot;best interests&quot;?  
</p>
<p>This seems like a fox guarding a henhouse if you ask me.  It would allow them access to children from broken home type situations.  
</p>
<p>I find this connection rather disturbing and wanted to share it.  While trying to do some research on the family, I happened to notice that the children seem to have genetically different traits, especially the daughter on the right with red hair and pale skin.

<p>I was honestly thinking I would find out that they had adopted children, as I seem to find that with numerous politicians, but most articles seem to suggest the children are biologically that of James and Patrice.  However, when Google/Wikipedia lists family members of the children, under &quot;Parents&quot; they list James Comey, but no mention of their mother.  Here\'s an example of one of the children, but for all of them, I see this anomaly for the listed &quot;Parents.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a href="http://imgur.com/mHOtcNq">http://imgur.com/mHOtcNq</a>]</p>
<p>And perhaps this is a stretch for most people, but I\'ve been noticing the possibility that there are significantly more transgender people in Hollywood and politics than anyone realizes, and Patrice Comey is now on my suspect list.  By taking away the wigs and makeup and clothing, I don\'t think it\'s hard to recognize that many of these &quot;females&quot; are actually males.  It honestly wouldn\'t surprise me given the rumors about James Comey and his sexual perversions, and I would be curious if anyone agrees with me on this.  Here are some of the pictures I\'ve found that make me suspicious..</p>

            Nah, Patrice is just a woman who's given birth to lots of kids and raised them largely on her own while her husband spent 23 hours a day at the office and now it's showing on her face.    I could be wrong, but with most of these elites, my opinion is that they think it's okay to rape marginalised little kids who have no adult to protect them, but God forbid anyone touch their own child.

              It seems unusual that such a young baby would get strep and die from it. That seems like a red flag. Tragic if true but we all "know" what they do with babies...

            Per public records: After graduating Harvard Law School Maurene Comey was admitted  to the NY bar in 2104 under her full name Maurene  Ryan Comey. Ryan is her middle name. She has used her first name Maurene as  far back as 2009 judging by classmate type searches.Her mother Patrice was a court volunteer in Bridgewater Connecticutt until her husband's appointment as FBI director in 2013. After moving to the Virginia/DC area following the appointment,  she returned not too long ago to Connecticutt with her husband to testify in favor of a bill before the Connecticutt legislature with regard to allowing unpaid volunteers to counsel children in the juvenile justice system. Indoor and outdoor photos of their former multi- million dollar home in Connecticutt are available online, quite a lavish home indeed. As to other matters raised in this post, I have no info or opinion to offer.

             Wow, I didn't know this.  I find it rather disturbing that someone like this could be responsible for shaping our opinion on so many important topics.
            </p>
            <p>
             From her profile:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Adrianne has crafted hundreds of speeches for FBI Director James Comey, former Director Robert S. Mueller, and top FBI executives on topics including national security, cyber security, intelligence, violent crime, crimes against children, civil rights and civil liberties, the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve, and the rule of law.
            </p>
            <p>
             For nearly seven years, Adrianne has led a team of speechwriters who together help to shape the communications strategy for the FBI Director and top FBI executives. She is skilled in strategic communications, writing and editing, crafting public policy, crisis communications, and messaging for diverse audiences, to include government, law enforcement, the intelligence community, the private sector, community leaders, and concerned citizens."
            </p>
            <p>
             How is she allowed to be responsible for "crafting public policy"??  I'm guessing she has to have access to classified information to know how to spin things??
            </p>
            <p>
             The profile also lists her as a "Foster Parent Volunteer Coordinator" for the "Animal Welfare League of Arlington" with the following description:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Developed, implemented, and ran inaugural foster parent program for underage kittens. Recruited, trained, and maintained all foster parent volunteers. Served as advocate for animals within community; handled animal emergencies. Grew program to more than 30 volunteers in one year and saved more than 50 kittens during first year of operation. Program has been highly successful for 12 years."
            </p>
            <p>
             This looks highly suspicious to me, almost like it has code words.  I mean, what is an "underage kitten"??  Isn't a kitten by definition already a young cat?  How can a young cat be "underage"?  And with "more than 30 volunteers," how can they have only saved 50 kittens??  I can go to my local Humane Society and easily find 50 kittens.  I don't know, this just reeks of corruption to me.  It doesn't make sense, and I can't help but think this is a money laundering operation or something..

            I thought of the French horror film - Martyrs (not for those feint of heart). In the opening scene we see a happy family at dinner table, mum, dad and two teenagers...moments later a hooded young girl stormes in with a loaded shot gun and in cold blood guns down entire family. (absolute gore fest). Later we learn that that same Mum &amp; Dad were in fact members of a cult and there was a torture dungeon underneath the house.,
Guys, Comey and His Wife could be child trafficking/murdering monsters. Do not let 'happy' family photos fool you. They lead double lives! I am not sure about Comey's wife being a tranny (always a possibility - look at Michelle Obama) but Comey has that look about him and his wife is incidently was involved with - CHILDREN! These scumbags are part of global scumbag/pedo/satanic/ring! Make no mistake about it. You think Comey was not invited to attend Obama's gormet $65 000 hotdog party?
           </p>
           <p>
            Great post. Pattern is so clear. With pedo elite - all things children!

             From that "happy family photo" it looks like Comey and his son are taking his daughters from behind.  Looks like some ritual incestuous pose.

               I have a book by Tex Mars - Codex Magica detailing all the masonic &amp; Jesuit signs. That man gave Comey a clear sign of Silence! John Lewis (member of Prince Hall Masonry - for African Americans) also gives a clear sign of death if Comey were to speak. Once public is aware of this treachory their game is over. It is this whah keeps pizzagate under wraps! Expose it!

            There are many, many cases of sexual abuse of foster children. It's a total disaster and a disgrace, and there are undoubtedly elite pedophiles trafficking in foster children. I have been working on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1800925">
             a backgrounder on that topic
            </a>
            , but it's just so fricking huge and awful that it is taking a lot of time. There are literally horror stories and important clues from every state.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I think this might be a case of someone easing their conscience rather than a case of pedophiles infiltrating child protective services. First, look at
            <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/resignations-letters-piling-up-at-fbi/">
             this article about Comey and his wife fighting over him letting Hillary off
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Next, you might want to look at this post I made about
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1770744">
             Glenn Beck easing his conscience
            </a>
            about not telling the truth about the pedocracy back in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a lot of people in the current system who are not pedophiles. They recognize the futility of sacrificing themselves, but they try to do something to balance the crime of not speaking out. (Note that I am not apologizing for Comey or his wife; I would not take the FBI Director's job in the first place.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Something to think about, anyway.

             Thank you for the links and information.  You've done a lot of good research.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, I'm confused what you mean by "easing their conscience."  Do you mean it's possible that Comey and/or his wife have been involved in trafficking or the coverup in trafficking, and that they have spent time "helping" children through the legal system to make themselves feel better about what they have done?
            </p>
            <p>
             I can certainly understand the concept of someone easing their conscience, but I find it to be a rather far fetched assumption that they would have good intentions when it comes to these children.

              Comey's wife looks creepy as hell! All fits in. If it were any other couple I would let it slip but we know what we are dealing with. Trump mada a veiled threat for a reason. Donald knows exactly what these two are involved in.

              I am going mainly by what FBI Anon said, that the proportion of active pedos in Congress is about 20-25 percent, but that pretty much everyone else knows about them. The question arises of how those other people signal their position, how they insure themselves against misunderstandings, and, as I put it, how they ease their conscience.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find it very interesting that Glenn Beck was allowed to donate $1.5 million to Operation Underground Railroad. To anyone with a little knowledge, it's a dead giveaway of what happened back in June 2013. People get killed for investigating human trafficking (e.g. the Monica Peterson case, the Max Spiers case). Why would they let Beck go to Haiti, of all places, at such a sensitive time?
             </p>
             <p>
              I think it's because there's a kind of tacit treaty, a rule, for how the elites treat this issue. Some of them (say, Senator Richard Blumenthal, or John and Cindy McCain) are involved in anti-trafficking organizations as a cover. They've infiltrated the organizations that are supposed to catch them, a standard sort of technique much like Communist revolutionaries joining the secret police. But I think there have to be other people, junior Congressmen and their wives, or civil servants like Comey, who aren't actually pedos but who also are involved in anti-trafficking and child protection for their own reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, these people aren't one big happy crime family. Hillary and Obama hate each other. McCain ran against Obama and both sides in that fight were savage to one another. They are tied together by mutual blackmail, fear, power-lust, and perversion, not by genuine respect or support. So there have to be all kinds of tacit deals built into this system, much like the way the Five Families divided up New York in the Godfather movies. I think one of the tacit deals is that if you decide to volunteer to help kids, whether it is a cover for your pedo activities or a way of silently signaling that you're not a pedo, either way it is allowed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you see what I'm getting at here? We need to be careful not to project too much onto our enemies. They aren't all-knowing, or all-powerful. They are not a monolithic enemy. Often one faction is working at cross purposes to another. So I want to avoid assuming that I know Comey's motive, or his wife's motive, when it could easily be quite different from what I first imagine.

             duh, that's her married name- she's maurene ryan now... the level of homophobic and anti trans bias on here is so stupid and short-sighted. it pushes good sane people away from the investigation. gay and trans people are just like everyone else, and yes- some are criminals, as with every other population!  many have also been abused and exploited as children... isn't that why we are here? to protect children? the majority of abusers continue to be men- of any sexuality. men in power are particularly dangerous and untouchable.... let's keep this focus where it belongs... on the elite. the famous alephantis and a few pop stars aside, most queer people are not included in the 'elite' or powerful class-

              Can I just say that I've struggled with this thought?  I don't consider myself homophobic or anti-trans.  I actually considered myself bisexual for many years, and my best friend for over a decade was gay, and I'm perfectly fine with the transgender female at my work, but I would still find it disturbing to learn that way more people in Hollywood and politics are transgender than anyone realizes.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I look carefully, I think the Queen of England is transgender, and Barbara Bush, and numerous other First Ladies and women in politics and Hollywood.
             </p>
             <p>
              Does it matter?  I don't know, maybe it doesn't, but I still find it to be a form of deception.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also don't believe people are "born that way."   My best friend was raped as a child by his own brother.  I was raped as a child by two of my brothers' friends.  I would definitely see a connection when it comes to child abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              And while obviously most victims do not become abusers, I do believe that 100% of abusers were once victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, I do find it part of the "programming" and propaganda to be that we aren't allowed to discuss or expose people.  Recently on an episode of Survivor, someone "outed" a transgender person, and everyone including Jeff came down so hard on them for doing that, and they had him leave without even voting the guy off the show.
             </p>
             <p>
              In truth, I actually agree with the person that outed the transgender person in that it is a form of deception and could speak to someone's ability to manipulate and trick people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps no one would care if the queen or former First Ladies were transgender, but honestly I think people would be upset.  This would mean they also lied about being the parents of their children.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not saying trans people are evil.  I would agree that they are victims.  But you can have this argument about Katy Perry too.  Perhaps she is a victim and being used as a puppet, but that doesn't change the fact that I think her music is evil and extremely inappropriate for children and heavily normalizes pedophilia and psychotic behavior.
             </p>
             <p>
              Knowing my ex-husband was abused as a child does not excuse his abusive behavior towards me and my children.  I can understand why he is the way he is, but that doesn't change the fact that I needed to separate from him and cut him out of my life.

               I am so sorry you have had to go through so much and I thank you for sharing your story and your take on the relevancy. I concur. We will suffer no fools here as there's no room for "phobia" of anyone or anything nor phobia for NOT sharing information. Anyone who perceives such phobia or bias or is offended by such or by bringing it up probably isn't emotionally prepared or ready to be a part of this investigation.

            I don't see any male to female transgender clues here with Patrice Comey. Their story is certainly sad and I do have a heightened level of suspicion regarding Comey for obvious reasons, but I don't think she looks tranny at all. She seems to have a rather petite figure and a somewhat homely appearance but not manly.
