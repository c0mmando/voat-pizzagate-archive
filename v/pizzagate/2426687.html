             Over four thousand high profile government websites have been compromised by dark web hackers on Sunday across the globe, mining virtual currency secretly, and particularly Monero.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monero has become one of the popular cryptocurrency recently especially on the ‘dark web’– a section of the internet that can only be accessed using a special browser which is capable of anonymizing your browsing location as well as identity. Dark web criminals are taking advantage of this anonymity by trading illegal commodities, substances and services using virtual currencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             4,275 websites including those in the U.K., the U.S., Ireland, Australian and Canada with government websites with hundreds of thousands of visitors were hacked in less than a period of four hours and unwittingly mined for cryptocurrency exploiting a security breach. Some of the compromised websites include the United States courts online portal, the United States Information Commissioner Office; the National Health Service in the United Kingdom and the Victorian Parliament website in Australia. The attack by a cryptojacking code hit common websites which had the text-to-speech accessibility script Browsealoud for the visually impaired from Texthelp company. .... The United States federal government continues to view the privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) as a potential tool for cybercriminals. An agent with the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told CNBC recently that cybercriminals are “looking more closely at other currencies like Monero and Ethereum.” Earlier this year an FBI agent with the bureau’s Cyber Division told reporters at a conference that the FBI fears criminals will begin to increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies that protect financial privacy, such as Monero. Since the introduction of the world’s first cryptocurrency in 2009 newer, more private cryptocurrencies have been developed. What is perhaps the most privacy-enhancing cryptocurrency currently is Monero. Other privacy-centric cryptocurrencies such as ZCash and DASH do not seem to provide as much privacy for every single transaction as Monero does.

             When Bitcoin first debuted in 2009, many mistakenly believed that the first cryptocurrency was as private as cash. This misconception arose from a misunderstanding of the underlying technology, the blockchain, which publicly records the bitcoin addresses of the sender and receiver, as well as the amount and the date and time of transactions. The realization that Bitcoin was not nearly as anonymous as was popularly believed led to the creation of mixing services, also known as tumblers. These services help to anonymize a user’s bitcoins, but researchers have discovered ways which can make even mixing services incomplete solutions to make Bitcoin transactions private. In 2011 the Silk Road launched, becoming the first darknet market to accept cryptocurrency, when it made Bitcoin the official currency of the marketplace.

            I'm flaring per rule 2 and 4, you have half of a very informative and interesting post here, but you fail to show sources that support your argument "we were told" crypto was hijacked by criminals and pedophiles. Also you have made no connection to pizzagate whatsoever. Please improve this post or it will be deleted by mods in 24 hours, thanks!
