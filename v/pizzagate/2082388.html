            I agree to the divisiveness. I believe although you might not support all theories laid out in the posts please allow for some discussion allowing the community to add insight and evidence they are in possession of regarding these posts.

            For instance yesterday the tweet from Donald Trump regarding the term "convfefe" was posted, along with a tweet a vetoed tweet a few hours later from a personal account of Mike Pence stating this "covfefe" was the password for Comet Ping Pong secret child porn located on its server.
For those unware a hacker gained access to this secret server at the very beginning which was registered under the name of James Alefantis, Big Cheese LLC, a know proprietary of his. The hacker also discovered very disturbing directions about ordering "cheese pizza" including fresh, used or surviving from last session, and other code words we have seen for little boys, race, etc. The hacker was able to break the code and observe grotesque child sex acts and connect it 9 additional servers in different locations. This information was passed to Washington P.D. And the police report and communication is documented and has been shown as proof on several youtube channels including Titus Fost who was an acquaintance of the hacker.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hacker has agreed to testify in court with great risk to himself and family for justice for these children.He has received death threats and been gang staulked ever since.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after this was reported to Washington PD the false flag shooting occurred at CPP. The shooter allegedly fired one round that just happen to wind its way in impossible angles strike a closet, door pass through and lodge in the hard drive of that computer server. This diversion allowed the area to coordined off and J. Alefantis to bring in a van and equipment to have the server removed from the premises.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been numerous attempts for ballistic reports, and shooting analysis but there has been not response.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the covevfefe tweet by Trump. There was a a nation wide hunt as to what this termed meant to no avail. The tweet the best day by Mike Pence stating it was the password to Comet Ping Pomet secret server was missed by most because he silently affirmed this on a private account. This occurred on June 1, 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have researched covefefe extensively. The term is in the Bible referencing satan's rebellion against God. In Satanic rituals especially regarding child sacrice the term covefefe is chanted by Satanists during the ritual. I think this post should be left up to allow other's to contribute. There is a lot of information people want to add.
