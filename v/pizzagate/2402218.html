<p>According to this article, &quot;Cruz told investigators he heard the strange demonic voices in his head instructing him on how to conduct the massacre, according to a report by ABC News.</p>
<p>MK-ULTRA or the “CIA’s mind control program” — was the code name given to experiments on human subjects, designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p>It’s not the first time that a mass shooter has reported hearing voices shortly before and during a massacre.</p>
<p>As we previously reported, Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock told a Las Vegas escort that he was a “government experiment” and the CIA could “hack his brain and take over” in a series of text messages shortly before he gunned down 59 people last year.</p>
<p>“There’s messages where Stephen is telling her he’s a government experiment and that they are listening to everything he says and does, and they can hack into his brain and take over,” the escort told Radar Online.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Cruz\'s past is quite sketchy. 
&quot;Cruz is an orphan and recently bereaved. His mother Lynda Cruz, who adopted him as an infant alongside his brother, died last November, and his father Roger had died a number of years earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His mother sought counselling for him when he was younger, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Broward County mayor Beam Furr told CNN Cruz had received some mental health treatment but had not attended a clinic for more than a year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He described Cruz as an introvert, but one who showed no signs of potential violence. Cruz rode his bike to and from work, spent his breaks looking at his phone and would leave it to others to start conversations, Mr Vukelich said.</p>
<p>“He was a timid introvert. He didn’t bother anyone. He was cordial. He was nice. He was shy, timid, had some anxiety,” he told The Independent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It had been reported that Cruz was linked with a white nationalist militia organisation called the Republic of Florida but police in Tallahassee, where the group is based, said they were aware of “no known ties” between them.&quot;

<p>It is my opinion that Cruz is not white. He has very similar features of an acquaintance who is Brazilian/Portuguese/Jewish, sometimes called &quot;Murano&quot; or &quot;Sepharti.&quot;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the high school he attended and attacked is 40% Jewish according to The Yashiva World:</p>
<p>&quot;As YWN has been reporting, 40% of the student body at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, are Jewish students.
Chabad of Parkland as well as other local Chabad Shluchim have literally been on the scene since moments after 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire inside the school, leaving 17 dead, and wounding many others. The dedicated Shluchim have been working around the clock comforting grieving parents who lost loved ones, and helping others cope with their injured children.
Among the 17 victims are 5 Jewish victims.&quot;

<p>Representative Debbi Wasserman Schultz (who identifies as an Ashkenazi Jew) had this to say about the school terror:</p>
<p>&quot;MSNBC’s Chris Matthews spoke to Wasserman Schultz: “My youngest daughter [is] a ninth-grader at a Broward County high school. We live just to the south of Parkland and Stoneman Douglas is a rival of our high school,” she said. “I’ve been there so many times, I have friends whose children go to school there… I’m actually nauseous even talking about this.”

THE SHOOTING HAPPENED IN BROWARD COUNTY, DEBBIE\'S DISTRICT!</p>
<p>Why is this important?
Until this horrible incident took place, the news was dominated by the FISA MEMO. This revealed treasonous activity by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, headed by Wasserman Schultz, who funded the FAKE &quot;Trump Dossier&quot; used to deceive the FISA Court in order to unmask and SPY illegally on Trump\'s campaign. The plot was to assure the Presidency for Hillary or gain info that could be twisted in order to impeach Trump.
Also, was Wasserman Shultz &quot;flipped&quot; so she could spill the beans on the Awan Bros. spy scandal?

            MORE REASONS TO KEEP AN EYE ON DWS!  This is from Jan. 1 2018
"At key points throughout the QAnon timeline, Google’s Schmidt reappears as: the person responsible for developing Clinton’s campaign computer technology, a major funder of the Clinton campaign, a common link to Perkins Coie, the Seattle-based law firm that laundered for the Clinton campaign and for the DNC payments to Fusion GPS which were essential to develop the dossier.
           </p>
           <p>
            QAnon directly suggests that the heist of DNC emails, including the emails from Hillary campaign chair John Podesta, was an inside job perpetrated by Seth Rich, an IT employee of the DNC who became disillusioned with Hillary and the DNC. Rich realized Hillary and Debbie Wasserman Schultz had rigged the Democratic primaries for his preferred candidate, Bernie Sanders, to lose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shockingly, QAnon claims Debbie Wasserman Schultz put out a contract to MS-13 Hispanic gang members to murder Seth Rich, both to punish him for the heist, and to prevent him from doing further damage to Hillary’s campaign and the DNC."

            I haven't read all of the comments but this was very interesting what George Webb found about the "shooter"
He came through a house where a lot of kids were given the same name / fake identity as foster children, and the mother of that house died in November. There were 39 911 calls from that location, and I am pretty sure Imran Awan used to live there.

            "Lynda Cruz was a good women. Who knows how many babies she fostered through 6166 80th Terrace In Parkland, FL. Did she know they were “Kosovo Kids”?  Probably not. Did she know they were being mistreated after they left her care. She probably was convinced in Nov. when she died"

            To be honest I would link hes symptons closer to the likes of EEG Heterodyning and SCALAR Wave Technology than MK Ultra.  MK is more direct and tangible, and what he descrives seems more remote.

             Could be a combo. They are continually making advances in this area. MKUltra "primes the pump". Drugs and technology gives the specifics. Just my opinion.

             Florida AG Bondi: My Office Will Pay for Funerals of Murdered Students
"At a Wednesday evening press conference, Florida Attorney General Pamela Bondi said her office will pay for the funeral expenses of the 17 deceased students that were victims of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."
            </p>
            <p>
             "We will pay for the funeral expenses of these poor victims," Bondi said. "We will take care of it."
Bondi also issued a stern warning to scammers, saying she is working with GoFundMe to prevent fake charity drives from duping people into donating money they believe is going toward victims."

            <p>
             We can now confirm how many students actually had funerals!
With this in place, no "actors" can be paid off through Go Fund Me's.
I believe students were killed. Otherwise, Debbie wouldn't get the warning.
            </p>
            <p>
             They now have Nicholas Cruz's younger brother in custody at a mental hospital. This could be a good thing. It will protect him and hopefully the "white hats" can get info on possible MKUltra techniques used.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it's the black hats, I will pray for him.

              I  say  the investigation  is new  and  ongoing,  none  of these reports  can  be held  as  truth  until  they  are  vetted  over the  next weeks, in   light of  what  we  have  already  seen  as major media  complicity in FAKERY &amp; FRAUD with  numerous  other  obvious fake  shootings we  must  assume it  is  part  of  the STATE SPONSORED  TERRORISM that is  ongoing-why would you assume  it was anything  else?

               Pizzagate pedos already target children for harm. "St.Valentine's Day Massacre" would be nothing for them. But, I do agree with the principle "trust but verify". VOATERS, TRACK THE STATE OF FLORIDA SPONSORED FUNERALS. If any family refuses the money, did they have a "Go Fund Me page?

            Watch the news now showing a core group of students demanding gun control.  One of them reads off cue cards and i suspect on a segment run this morning had an ear piece in repeating what he is told to say.  This whole think stinks to hell.  I believe kids died, but the shooter and now others involved after are solid possible mind control.

            I have doubts that anyone died at at the Stoneman (Mason) shooting, There are the usual hallmarks of a hoax/false flag; a drill the same day, lack of CCTV footage, smiling crisis actors with weird stories. These things don't rule out an actual mass shooting, but it feels like another Sandy Hook to me.

            Hearing voices should first be assumed to be a symptom of a mental illness rather than reaching to MKUltra as an explaination. This is not pizzagate related.

             What are the odds that this mass shooting took place in Wasserman Shultz's district, at a school where her friend's children attended, right in the middle of a news cycle on the "FISA memo", which pointed to possible corruption and treason by the Clinton campaign and the Wasserman Shultz run DNC? Wasserman Shultz was also involved with the Awan Bros. scandal. Some of her "friends" might not want her to talk.  Again, what are the odds?

            Guys, everybody hears voices.  They are yourself, but some people can't recognize their own voice.  They take good voices as being angelic and bad voices as demons.  Good being help people and bad being kill or hurt... You get it.  You don't need MK ultra to get there at all, there are other things that causes this and non of them involve this.

             ""Unconnected Dots — Allen Dulles and the CIA's MKULTRA Program
            </p>
            <p>
             While Lily Kay provides an excellent analysis of the development of the Caltech molecular biology program, she provides us with many dots peripheral to this focus that she never connects. She states that in 1948 the Council on Foreign Relations under the leadership of Allen Dulles undertook a research project for the shaping of the industrial and agricultural development of the post-World War II world that supplied guidelines to Rockefeller Foundation interests abroad, while his brother John Foster Dulles was simultaneously a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1953, however, John Foster Dulles became the Secretary of State under Eisenhower and Allen Dulles became the head of the CIA. Allen Dulles was head of the CIA until 1961 when he was forced to resign by JFK and was later appointed to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of JFK. Under Allen Dulles, the CIA imported hundreds of Nazi scientists into the military-industrial complex as part of Operation Paperclip. Dulles also oversaw the infamous MKULTRA program, which used LSD and other drugs as mind control agents, and was the basis for the Bourne Trilogy in which Matt Damon recently starred. These programs were documented by the Senate's Church Committee in the 1970s.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kay quotes F. E. Lumley's 1925 tract, Means of Social Control:
            </p>
            <p>
             Ideally social control would be in the hands and the interests of the inclusive group whatever it is; practically, however, it is in the hands of, and often in the interests of, some few members who have usurped power and know how to use it.
The mere mention of a connection between the Dulles brothers and the Rockefeller Foundation makes one wonder whether there may have been a dichotomy among the Foundation's trustees between those who wished to wield social control in the public interest and those who wished to wield social control as nefarious conspirators towards their own corrupt ends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kay reports that the Foundation's influence over research waned after World War II as the federal government's influence increased, but it appears that the Dulles family simply moved its pursuit of mind control techniques underground as the new CIA, being the first such organization to persist during peacetime, provided the opportunity for scientific research hidden from public view.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Dulles brothers were also lawyers for Union Banking Corporation (UBC) before and during World War II while Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker sat on its board. UBC brokered many deals in support of the Hitler regime right through the end of the war, and Bush was prosecuted for them under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The support for the Hitler regime and the MKULTRA program indicates that the Dulles brothers may have had much more extreme and nefarious ideas about eugenics, social control, and human engineering than other Rockefeller Foundation leaders like Raymond Fosdick had.
            </p>
            <p>
             These connections deserve to be elucidated by reputable, scholarly research of Kay's caliber and it is unfortunate that Kay chose to avoid going down that path."

              That is exactly what I was looking for, septima. Thank you.

              To edit the post, look at the spot right at the bottom of the text body that says Number of Comments. Right next to it, you'll see "Save" and "Edit." Save lets you pin it to your Saved list, which is available on your profile page. "Edit" opens a box that shows the source text, which you can add to, reformat or change at will. Just highlight the ABC reference, click the little button that looks like a chain (#3 from the left) and paste the hyperlink you just provided in the little box that pops up and click save. To see how it will look, click "Preview". Easy peasy.
             </p>
             <p>
              If none of this is showing up on your screen, you are probably on a mobile device. You'll need to open your mobile browser settings and click the "View desktop site" button.

              Ah...the glories of the Voat labyrinth. ;-)

              Let me know when you've edited and I'll remove the flair.

             Bill Cooper may have had his brain tweaked by MK Ultra tactics himself.  He also believed that Aliens and the US Government, as well as Russia, worked together to establish intergalactic space travel and set up a human colony on Mars.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On May 22,1962, a space probe landed on Mars and confirmed the existence of an environment which could support life. Not long afterward the construction of a colony on the planet Mars began in earnest. Today I believe a colony exists on Mars populated by specially selected people from different cultures and occupations taken from all over the Earth. A public charade of antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States has been maintained over all these years in order to fund projects in the name of national defense when in fact we are the closest allies.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He claims JFK was murdered because he threatened to expose our governments and the NWO's secret collusion with the Aliens.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another excerpt to demonstrate that Bill Cooper is likely either a CIA asset or a CIA victim.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The aliens explained that they had created us through genetic manipulation in a laboratory. They stated that they had manipulated the human race through religion, satanism, witchcraft, magic, and the occult. They further explained that they were capable of time travel, and the events would indeed come to pass if the conditions were not met.  Later exploitation of alien technology by the United States and the Soviet Union, utilizing time travel in a project named RAINBOW, confirmed the prophecy.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Not disputing the contentions about Orion, just don't want to get caught up in a CIA psyop while discussing their ability to carry out psyops.  This story is supportive of the idea, more so than the case of Cruz imo.

             Suspected Fort Lauderdale Airport gunman Esteban Santiago, 26, told FBI that CIA was forcing him to join ISIS

              He was also investigated as part of a child porn investigation in either 2011 or 2012, law enforcement sources told CBS News. Three weapons and a computer were seized, but no charges were filed, sources said.

              No one knows who the FTL shooter really was as best as I can tell.  The perp was some guy from Alaska who worked on a Disney cruise ship and went so far as even posting on his FB that this was a case of mistaken identity.  The news was even using the photo from his FB page.

              This is an excellent article on the Navy Yard shooter by Jon Rappaport. It sounds eerily like Cruz.

              "I obviously can’t prove or conclude that Aaron Alexis was MKULTRA-programmed.
