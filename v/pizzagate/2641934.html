            I think we need to be clear that what consenting adults do in private is their business.  But what is done to kids is the business of society.  They are vulnerable and need protection.  They are not capable of consent, and even teens are not mature enough for true consent.  I am less concerned about bestiality than pedophilia.  How many sheep kill themselves over being raped?  The damage to the psyche of kids who are abused is hard to even imagine.

            .  It is the damage that the abuse causes that is the most important thing to focus on IMO

            I was arguing recently that using their terminoly is wrong headed and that is a main component of these people...watering down/changing language.  I can't remember where we settled but I think "wannabe kid fuckkers" was in the top 3

            If anyone on here knows any gay people, relatives, friends, close co workers, Demand they spread the word.  They Must Speak Up and Out.  Keeping Quiet is not the answer.  Their own people have to attack these fakers.  It's just like the stupids leaving religions.  Instead of outing the fakers they just keep quiet.   There must be a push to push the gays to Speak Out about the infiltrated fakes at the top of LGBTQ.

             Most of the lesbians I've known have been put off by even the inclusion of trans. They're having this shoved down their throats like they are like pedos and trannies.  Every group is under attack.

              I know progressives that think there is a small group of people that are really in need of the operations, but most are mentally sick.  They are mixed up and need serious help.  And the sicko normalizers are making hay while the sun shines.  They are pushing this big time.  Here is the thing, if anyone knows someone that is male or female that is gay, Please Ask Them To Speak Out and to Speak To Their Group.  This must be spread all over before these poor people that are so sick get operations that they can not turn around.  The thing that those wannabe trannys don't understand is that they will never be a male or female, they will always be what they were born.  In order to attain that New Sex, they take meds for the rest of their life.  They are still what they were born.  They are being Bamboozled and that is Really Criminally Sick.

               I honestly don't understand how one could come to the thought process "I should cut off my dick" on their own. Ever.  The whole transgender idea is supplanted into the minds of the poor victims.

                The children are my main worry too.  How will this affect them all?  They out of the goodness of their hearts will be taught to accept them all.  Which of course in a way is the right thing to do.  Acceptance of others is a good thing.  The problem is that these people are being manipulated to believe that there IS something wrong with them, when there is not.  It CAN be fixed, with the proper help.  This is Oh So Cruel.

                 They are playing the kids against the parents. I think the teachers are asking kids to bring up LGBTQ related things at home and to question their parents "outdated thinking" just like they do with every new generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've seen the questions raised at home and they are not phrased as a child would; the questions are framed like an adult speaking. These are clearly not original thoughts but regurgitated garbage they are teaching to the children.

                 That is what scares me.  It isnt about the gays. This is about normalizing criminal behavior.

                  Exactly.  But a lot of people that are not up on what's going on will start blaming the gays for this and brand them as pedos too.  Which some are, just as in any group.  BUT you are also correct that these kids are being fed Normalization Propaganda.  They started making kids think they are way smarter than their parents through si

                    They are very protective of their teachers.  I worked in a school with kids.  They LOVE their teachers.  We have put many in authority positions on shelves and we should not have.  But how were we to know what would happen.  We have put many in authority positions on a shelf.  Try your best, I have sometimes felt like beating my head against the wall.  Try to have a talk at another time about authority figures.  I remember I was at a family gathering and there were kids around.  We had a talk and later one of the kids came and repeated what we had said.  They were listening and we didn't even know it.  Sometimes that is the best way.  Preaching Never Works.

                     I just wait for them to bring it up. Perceiving racism that isnt there is also true. Seems they are teaching them feelings over facts and knowledge.

                       It only takes one. Some kids see as many as 4-8 teachers in a day.

                      <p>
                       I learned so much from the teacher I know of that got fired it is a damn shame.  He taught life skills and shared stories of when he was in spec ops.  The man taught me skills that paid the way for me to freelance my way into independence @ 17 yet... their fired the guy.

                Some are born with messed up organs (genitals) or other complications, that is not their fault.  But others are seriously messed up, and need help.  That's what I meant.  I am not saying either are bad.

            This post is totally homophobic and wrong in the sense that it attributes blame to the LGBT community for the MAPs acronym.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therapists and psychologists are pushing the narrative that there are 'victim' types of pedophiles who should be referred to by differing names.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you agree that a pedophile can also be a victim depends on your levels of empathy and understanding of the human  psyche and soul.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some creeps are trying to merge a P onto LGBT but that's not the fault of that community.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article from last year gives a bit of insight to people calling themselves MAPs -
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41213657">
             https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41213657
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            We shouldn't validate their urges they need life long help to never act on them. I don't think they deserve their own special name... any day they can go from a MAP to an abusive pedophile so forming labels for pre abuse and post abuse is ridiculous. And many may already have abused but pretend they haven't.

             NO it's not the community's fault that kids are being raped by pedo members, but it is their fault that they have not Outed these fakers and Spoken Out about it.  They need to SPEAK UP.  They have been pretty quiet, although I understand why, but every day that goes by without Their Voices, there will be kids raped and the Normalization Campaign gets stronger.  That's all I am saying, They Need To SPEAK OUT NOW.   For that, they are to blame.

             So now its OPs fault youre a genetic dead end and a result of some really funky shit going on.

             I for one, didnt give a shit for a long time about gay people. Up until the point it became ok for gay males to harass the shit out of straight males and have them booted out of jobs for having to threaten to beat the shit out of them because theyve repeatedly not taken no for an answer.
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember the whole 'slippery slope' debate. I was told its not true. Well guess fucking what? Gays now have now bullied at least 3 entire nations into granting them full access to abuse children, and pedophiles are using the exact same justifications for their shit that faggots used 30 years ago. There is a goddamn reason Doctors left the Australian Medical Association in droves when their media people came out with support for the move, as it legitimised what is
             <em>
              nothing
             </em>
             but a political stance (against the moral and social obligations of the association) and
             <em>
              completely ignores their own fucking research into elevated levels of child abuse among same sex families, and research showing that kids in same sex families absolutely are worse off psychologically.
             </em>

             Motherfucker ive got a mother and two sisters who work in kindergartens. Ive seen this fucking shit start already. Ive
             <em>

             kids be told by degenerate parents what they can and cant play with because its not gender neutral.

             I used to be “tolerant” of homos but now I’m convinced the only reason their numbers are growing is thru molesting little kids.  Why else would we see their numbers grow when they can’t reproduce?   As far as I’m concerned I’m no longer defending fags of any sort.

              Not all gays are pedos.  The reason this is increasing is that the pedos have created other pedos by deep rape.  This is how they become pedos.  There are pedos of all stripes.  The LGBTQ community is mostly clean of this, except for some.  They don't speak out for the same reason they kept quiet about AIDS.  They are afraid of being Tagged as one of Them.  We MUST convince them to speak out and out these perverts.  They are quiet because they are scared to death.
