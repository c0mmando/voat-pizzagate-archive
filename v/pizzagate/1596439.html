<p>They had a post from 1 month ago <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1450672">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1450672</a></p>
<p>Their post mentioned 
&quot;Also, a message from him: &quot;Knowing what county these people live/lived in will help. For example, no divorce records return in DC for \'Anthony Podesta\' (although an unspecified misdemeanor from 1985 does show). The search is on a county-by-county sometimes court-within-each-county basis. Bit of a needle in a haystack without being pointed in a direction.&quot;</p>
<p>Only reason I am making this post is from this cross post, I checked for Anthony Podesta in this sub to see if you guys already had anything on him.</p>
<p>What I have found</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> I was simply trying to find a county of someone totally unrelated to pizzagate, then it lead me down this rabbit hole. There was a really intriguing email called Bawl of Whacks. It has been mentioned on here before, looks like nothing more than a mailing list, very long list. There are more Wax emails, all  mailing lists, I checked the first one and this second one - ONE match for Podesta on both, same address used. </p>
<p>**2) ** Been trying to search WIFLSFI since they use a referable code, thought there might be 1 email that might be weird sent out to people and they would use that specific code, then would search to see list of people who used it. However, it\'s VERY hard to do this. The links that you are able to search open with Oracle Eloqua. I try to search pizzagate for this, nothing - HOWEVER I search oracle and there we see that is heavily used by Dyncorp.

<p>I know the Dyncorp Strat link isn\'t something new, but it is used in all the emails the Oracle log in. </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> I didn\'t notice until the second list that Podesta was even on the mailing list - this opens in xcel with ryans list, wax, and sheet 3 nothing strange.</p>
<p><strong>4) WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW</strong> the listing in the Stratfor mailing list under Podesta results as following: 
Pré-du-Marché 23, 1004 Lausanne, Switzerland
his email is his name <a href="https://voat.co/user/bluewin">@bluewin</a>.ch 
Unsure about significance of bluewin other than it being a swiss email. </p>

<p>WBOW = wax ball ? ? </p>
<p>It may not seem like much and like I\'m grabbing at nothing, but if there are other names we need to search or anything, I think it\'s worth it to have a possible lead on Anthony Podesta.</p>
<p><strong>there are a lot of new terms in here that would be great if someone would help look into</strong></p>
<p>edit: one was titled 5390_wax_ball_2010-05-11 day of right before, does that mean the 10th of may 2010? anything significant?</p>

              "Hey guys - I want to make sure any lifetimers are removed from this
archive list of all paid members I'm putting together. I used the "Title"
field in whole ball of wax to remove anyone called Lifetime in that field.
Is that enough? I know there's ball of wax weirdness sometimes where the
information is related to whatever current product they're on - so if
someone bought a lifetime membership but still had a year left on their
regular membership, would their Title be something other than Lifetime
until that year was up? Is there another field I should use?

               I feel if we could just see 1 of the damn things that links to oracle it might help knowing if we're chasing something or not. Edit: weird email of 5K premium users

                So Stratfor -- which stands for "strategic forecasting" -- does two main things: sell subscriptions to the geopolitical intelligence they gather worldwide, and provide security consulting for corporations and high net worth individuals (how to avoid executive kidnapping, for example).
               </p>
               <p>
                Like many newsletter providers, they offer different packages for different tiers of subscriber. These mailing lists reflect those different subscriber tiers. "Free" is stuff anyone who gives their email can get sent. "Lifetime" would be subscribers who have paid a large one-time fee for a permanent subscription. I imagine the "whole ball of wax" would be the entire database of subscribers.

                You can see them all
                <a href="https://www.stratfor.com/about/products-services">
                 here
                </a>
                . 5,000 premium users doesn't sound like that many, when you consider few companies provide the products they do.
