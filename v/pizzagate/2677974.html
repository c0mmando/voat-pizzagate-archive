<p>Hillary, on a somewhat (but not completely) different track from the one that\'s brought us together of late: [REDACTED]—a
dear friend who\'s been vastly helpful to [REDACTED] in her current &quot;science experiment,&quot; and who, as you know, [REDACTED]

when the time is appropriate, in working for you on issues like PEPFAR (pediatric AIDS in particular), obesity, tobacco, women\'s
reproductive health, pandemics, and global public health in general. These are, as you also know, not subjects on which State
has traditionally asserted or distinguished itself. But [REDACTED] gueses—as do I—that that\'s about to change. If and when you or
someone one your behalf wants to reach out to him, best is by e-mail: . Cheers, Strobe</p>

             Thank You. Your blog seems to be the wiki of Clinton Info. You may want to include the release from when Bill was Governor of Arkansas as mentioned in this old post.

              thanks - I try to keep it mainly on the Clinton Foundation related crimes, the e-mails exposing them and the whole pay-to play theme. Foreign governments give heaps to money to various Clinton charities (most registered unlawfully in various states) then - voila - they get a giant weapons contract from the US.
If I had to do allllll Clinton scandals I'd need a staff of hundreds!
             </p>
             <p>
              By the way, best new info, off-the-charity topic I heard lately was that the FBI/DoJ (I forget which) moved a plane load of docs from Ark. statehouse to storage at OK City Fed. building .... (drumroll).... the day before it was bombed. Plus he said those agents who died accessing hole in the roof at Waco early on .... that started the seige ... those men were connected to Ark. ... maybe ATF district or former state troopers (I forget) and they were sent in to Waco exercise to specifically get rid of them. Suicide mission.
