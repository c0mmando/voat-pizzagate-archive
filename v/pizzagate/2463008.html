              several managers of local children's homes set up the "taxi driver group" to investigate reports that taxis driven by Pakistani men[53] were arriving at care homes to take the children away. The police apparently declined to act.

             The Jay inquiry reported that "most of the victims in the cases we sampled were white British children".[f][68][69]
             <strong>
              However, despite the media focus on "Pakistani men preying on young white girls", a 2013 report by the UK Muslim Women's Network found that British Asian girls were also being abused across the country in situations that mirrored the abuse in Rotherham.[70]
             </strong>
             The unfunded small-scale report found 35 cases of young Muslim girls of Pakistani-heritage being raped and passed around for sex by multiple men. In the report, one local Pakistani women’s group described how
             <strong>
              Pakistani-heritage girls were targeted by taxi drivers
             </strong>
             and on occasion by older men lying in wait outside school gates at dinner times and after school.

              members of the [Hussain] family were "alleged to be responsible for much of the violent crime and drug dealing in the town".

              had access to expensive cars, were linked to a taxi firm, and may have been involved in bed-and-breakfast hotels that were used by social services for emergency accommodation.
             </strong>
             Several girls sent to those hotels had complained of being offered money, as soon as they arrived, if they would have sex with several men. Other girls were targeted at train and bus stations.[58]

             not part of the localised-grooming scene. The most significant group of perpetrators of localised grooming were British-Asian men. Several employees dealing with the issue believed that the perpetrators' ethnicity was preventing the abuse from being addressed, Heal wrote.[125][126]

              There is so much of this going on in the UK (actually here too) but it reminds me of that place that was shut down.  A place were famous people and High Level people like Elton John and others were on a list with secret names and had boys brought in from Care Homes.  Where the boys brought there with taxis, I don't know, but it makes one wonder.  Now we know they are also handing off girls and boys to tempt and satisfy the sick urges of LEO as well to procure their innocence.  Disgusting Beyond Belief.

              Sorry I have had no service in my new sorta "off grid "  location.. I just got a signal booster and finally I have a good connection.  I agree , what can we do ? It seems no matter what though , these people are , and always will be protected by the powers that be .  I got the chance to redpill 5 more of my kids friends ( who are in their 20's) I started with the Michelle Obama being a tranny and that caught their attention lol 😂 then by the end of their visit they were educated on PG thoroughly !

               Oh my God.  5 more people walking the earth that have been woken up.  What an accomplishment!  I somehow think that they younger ones might be easier to get to since they have not been so brainwashed for so long.  They also have more of an open mind.  You certainly have been busy.

                Yes the younger adults do seem to have an open mind . It was like lightbulbs went off on top of their heads . It all started when one person made a comment about wanting to see Bionce in concert , that was my chance to lay it all out lol .. it went well though

                 Beyonce is such a very bad influence on girls.  Her lingerie outfits leave nothing to the imagination and look like she got them at one of those House Parties for Women not girls.  I can't stand her.  She is a Zombie-Tran for Tinsel Town and DC.

            The National Crime Agency (NCA) said five men from Rotherham and Sheffield were arrested on suspicion of raping and indecently assaulting two girls under the age of 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last month, the NCA said its Operation Stovewood inquiry had identified more than 1,500 potential victims of child sexual exploitation in the South Yorkshire town.

               These names aren't common. Several of these names are even in the Gitmo
Files . Maybe  because they're Pakistani names is why they don't seem common ?

                Not common to us, for sure, but easily similar names in those places, but not the same people.  Just like the name Smith or Brown.

                  What on earth! this link DOWNLOADS to your computer immediately.  A totally bias dossier on Trump.  Its like a total script from CNN MSM!  Why would it download without any permission of request?? Needs a warning. Don't know if anything else embedded in it will be downloaded.  I don't know anything about these things, as you can probably tell by my comments.

              I have a feeling these driverless cars they are coming up with will play havoc with our children.  The stupid parents will allow their kids to be taken to school and to games without them and the kids disappear.  I am making myself sick.
