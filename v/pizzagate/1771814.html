<p>Oh, really? Let\'s be clear here. If pizzagate is anything, it\'s organic.

<p>This line &quot;pizzagate is a diversion to make people not focus on proven elite pedophilia cases&quot; is obviously moronic. Obviously people should be more concerned about non-convicted pedophiles on the loose, than already convicted cases. If anything is a distraction and a diversion, it\'s pointing people to these older cases: &quot;oh, look how many elite pedophiles have been found guilty, this is proven unlike pizzagate&quot;. This is a diversion from pedophile rings on the loose. And, the main suspects, let\'s remember, are the Podesta brothers, the Clintons, Alefantis, but also the millionaire/billionaire Herb Sandler, Obama, Tamera Luzzatto and the others exposed by the investigation, Peter J Mattingly, can\'t name any others from the top of my head. </p>
<p>The main strategy of the enemy has been to try to define pizzagate as something that it\'s not: &quot;a pedo ring is run out of the basement of Comet Ping Pong&quot;. Of course no one ever claimed this except them, they have been pushing this lie for months now, and people are starting to believe that\'s what pizzagate is. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/">http://www.snopes.com/pizzagate-conspiracy/</a></p>
<p>We of course know it\'s not that, and we shouldn\'t allow the enemy to frame and define this question, but keep on bringing back to the forefront the never debunked evidence we have on the suspects. Pizzagate is real, despite the controlled opposition alternative media trying to claim otherwise. They are repeating the false definition of pizzagate, given to the public by the lying MSM, John Podesta and Alefantis themselves.</p>',

            Alex  Jones  has  forever   been  outed as controlled  opposition, I'm still  not  clear  on  what Cernovich (a Jew) is saying re: Pizzagate,  but I  don't  believe  he  is discrediting organized  pedophilia  but not  clear  at  this  point-he  does seem  to  be financially backed to  support the  Trump  campaign  which I find  very  troubling

            The shills you've mentioned have and always will be controlled opposition. They do at times raise good points on various matters but they are still working parallel to the MSM. If you really thought Alex "Water Filter Salesman" Jones was ever a reputable source than you have been sorely mistaken. Anyone who truly is anti-MSM will have a very short tenure on YouTube or other popular platforms.

            YES to this post and 95% of the comments. Pizzagate is the key to unlock PedoGate - theres no way around this. Comet was only one of many many leads dragged out of podestas emails, and the term was coined before most of the allegations came out regards comet and JA. To say its debunked dont look here is to piss on the 100's of leads that have been generated implicating high level involvement.  Paul Watson died to me after posting that video.

            Trump is a Rothschild puppet and Alefantis is a Rothschild.  Trump is backed by a side of the Deep State that is dirty also.  So there is only so far Trump will go before the pull his dog collar tighter.

            AMTV just posted a video where Christopher Greene is saying Pizzagate was set up by the CIA. He likes to use the phrase "Pizzagate is a trap" and I've noticed others alt media hosts rolling over and also mentioning  similar phrases.

             The controlled opposition also said Obama's fake birth certificate was a trap after people pointed out many inconsistencies with it, all his identification documents, and his birth story. It's a way to get people to back off something that needs more investigation. There's no "trap" to noticing that something is not right, asking questions, having a legitimate investigation, and getting answers that make sense.

            You guys let's not argue with each other over which person someone follows or does.'t.  It's ok, people will see in their own time or not. There is room in this citizen investigation for all of us. And who cares what we call it.  I call it corrupt and immoral.

            I want to remind you of the parable of three blind people trying to describe an elephant.  One has the tail and views it as a rope, one has the trunk and views it like a snake, and one has an ear and view it like a fan.  It is ALL of this and more.  It's Comet and Alefantis and the Dutch royal family, it's Dyncorp, it's DC police , it's all of this and more that we haven't hit on yet.

            You don't understand it, they are trying to shut down independent youtubers, that's why they are talking now. This is not about Alefantis and Podesta only. You are the controled oposition. Clinton and Epstein, Dyncorp and CIA are the real target. Fuck Alefantis, he is a nobody.

             I mean if the target is Dyncorp, then why is Steven Feinberg from Dyncorp in Trump's cabinet? Shouldn't your hero Alex Jones point something like this out if the target is Dyncorp? Get real, open up your eyes and see what's happening here.

              You are wrong about me as I was about you, I know Trump is as dirty as the rest of them. And nope, Alex Jones is BS for me. If i've got to stand for someone, I stand for that guy of WeAreChange called Luke whatever. But you've got to admit the last video from Paul Joseph is great, he covers almost everything in barely 10 minutes, we need this kind of videos in the net.
             </p>
             <p>
              But you are right, we need to stop this right/left thing. People in the trump train need to wake the fuck up. I had some hope 4 months ago about him, but now its pretty clear he is not on our side.

                If you ask me, i really believe the PizzaGate label was created by CTR/David Brock to mislead us all. We fall for it so bad. Everyone of us spend months looking for shit aorund Alefantis when we were supposed to look somewhere else. Alefantis wont bring down the big ring, Epstein will. And look at it, Epstein sued Cernovich, why? I know, Cernovich is in the Trump train, maybe this means there's a "war" inside the big ring, but what im pretty sure about is that Alefantis is just a distraction.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe Cernovich is naive enough to be in the trump train and against the big ring at the same time... idk. What i know for sure is that Jones is total BS. Pure entertainment for the fool minds.

                this is from a couple of days. can you see the patern? independent youtubers are working together. they are starting to fight. And tbh, the Alefantis road wont lead us anywhere. I think Alefantis is guilty or at least dirty, but we wont achieve anything with that strategy.

             You realise that Trump is controlled opposition right? He's been owned by his financiers since at least his bankruptcy in the 90s. I mean he's been in some resort business with Rockefeller and Rothschild since the 80s. His cabinet is full of Goldman Sachs, Rothschild, Military Industrial Complex, and Big Oil. He's putting even more money to the military industrial complex. 54 billion, while people starve and bridges crumble. And what is AJ? Nothing but a good ol' Trump fanboy, cheering him on. All of a sudden everybody's back in the left-right paradigm, naively believing that both sides aren't controlled. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. But I, on the other hand, am not controlled by anybody.

              About Youtube, look at it. Most of the youtubers i follow almost stopped making videos because of the new age restriction and ad revenue policies. That's the way they are censoring the free speech. And in the last two/three days i saw a cordinated movement from them, they are talking now about pedophilia. They are fighting against that censorship. Please, check wearechange if you dont know them yet. Its the most unbiased channel you can find.

               Yes I know WeAreChange, they are good. I'm on the truth train, and where ever it goes, I follow. To me it seems obvious they're all guilty as hell and the only thing that's going to solve this is a full-on global revolution basically, it's much bigger than anything really. The whole monetary system is a fraud and so on. So interesting times ahead. But now I've got to go to sleep.

            I think they've been threatened, be it with a lawsuit or worse. CPP is a tangible thread that could be pulled to take down Alefantis and his closest cronies involved in day-to-day ops at CPP and Pegasus at first, but with direct connections to Brock, Podestas and other Clintonites, and who knows where the connections would end from there - that is if Newsham and DC PD weren't on their side. It's far safer to talk in generalities about elite paedophilia and people who've already been convicted like Epstein and Hastert. Where we go from here with this I don't know. I'm fairly confident it's not going to stop us poking the beehive though :)

            Thank you for reposting- it is an important issue. I think it's safe to say the pedophilia stuff is going to come out, but the last thing we want is for the media to control the narrative again by burying a lot of our important leads. We have to stay aggressive.

            So irritating! Basically, the Podesta emails helped lead us to Pizzagate. Then, digging into Pizzagate, it became a lot bigger and worldwide, which became Pedogate. The news and people who think this is debunked, are the ones focusing everything on this pizza place. In truth, it's just a piece of the big puzzle.

             Just breathe and believe.  If one supposedly from our ranks drops sides then let 'em go because there's plenty more joining the cause than leaving/betraying it.  Even AJ disinfo can be easily explained to the uninitiated - many of whom won't have ever seen him or any of them before.  They are the ones for whom we should save our energy to spread the word - not wasting it all on the ex/pseudo committed.

            On one hand, these alt figureheads can go pound sand. PG is directly tied into pedogate. CPP and Alefantis are pawns in the scheme, but PG was never about just CPP. They're being moronic in supporting the failed MSM strawman.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the OTHER hand...remember AJ and PJW the other day, reminding us of the "Streisand effect"? Could this be what they're engaging in? Pretending to agree with the MSM strawman while still highlighting the child trafficking, in the hopes that it will finally expose this mess to the mindless masses?

            To those saying PJW was being sarcastic etc. or that he was drawing attention to pizzagate, I'd say you're wrong. He goes on to say that pizzagate is probably mass hysteria or contrived panic, and that all the high level pedophilia busts have "nothing to do with pizzagate". Obviously they do have everything to do with it because this is one giant global octopus. Also, this saying that it's "debunked" is not drawing attention to it, this is dismissing it, and trying to avoid discussion of it. We are demanding more discussion, more investigation, they are trying to shut it down.

             Young Boy at ‘Pride’ Event Praised For Sex Dance To ‘Fight Homophobia’
Where is this child's parents. Is he being passed around by perverts?
What bothers me is that the whole Gay community let this boy be exploited in front of everyone.

            we the people, the pizzagate truth collective, need to replace their Narrative with the actual Truth and spread it far and wide.. show them we cannot be bought off with "consolation" arrests.... we want the giants to fall.

            What does the New York Times, Washington Post, 60 Minutes, and the rest of the mainstream presstitutes have in common with Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, Glen Beck, and now Paul Joseph Watson?  They are all working overtime attempting to steer the public away from what all available evidence and proof suggests could be the central hub of the DC child trafficking operation.  They all declare it debunked without discrediting any of the evidence?  Further than that, they are unwilling to even address any of the evidence, apparently because it is too damning.  It takes real effort to avoid seeing something wrong with this picture.

            Excuse you. PJW said "debunked" sarcastically. Of course he knows it's real. Not wanting to get sued when there's a much bigger child sex ring to uncover doesn't make him a figurehead.

            There wouldn't be pizzagate if there weren't the emails referring to a "pizza-related" map handkerchief, a pizza political action committee, flying in $65k of pizza from Chicago via special channels and then charging taxpayers for it, "waitresses" serving the pizza.  If tax dollars were indeed being used for these "pizza" and "hot dog" parties, somebody needs to explain where that money came from and how the expenses were accounted for. There ought to be a paper trail somewhere.

              Soon. Have patience. When you subject a population to extreme harm in the form of water, air, and food poisoning, and steal and eat the children of the ignorant, you will derive a population of genius beasts who consume you. Our masters are damned. The very basis of the subjection of a people to pure hell forges the strong, and slaughters the stupid. The sheep don't have to wake up. Only the woke ones will be left among the wolves.

             This is the problem that the Confederate slave owners of the United States faced after 300 years of slavery. They bred one of the most fit populations on Earth. Black women in the US have fertility rates nearly 40% greater than the rest of the population. Black men here are known for having 9 inch dicks, being 6 ft, and athletic gods. Stereotypes exists for a reason.

              Okay I aint touching that one.  But Karma is indeed a bitch.  And you dont need even half the people to believe something....you just need a very loud and aggressive minority that wont stop pushing.  Are we that?  I hope so.

            Also look at what David shurter, Alfred webre and Oliver dammagard were saying about pizzagate in November, virtually the same narrative which was that pizzagate was yet another distraction, it seems this is a conscious strategy by opposition to undermine our investigation , be weary of anybody who is a figurehead of the "truth" movement, or anyone who champions pizzagate as a figurehead I e Titus frost v. Libertas Kerry kasaidy Alfred webre Alex jones Milo etc.

            Last time Cernovich ( I think last night )  went at pedophiles he was saying something weird. Here is the video, go to 9:24. He says something rambling with interjects by AJ and the quote is something like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpOjMG5yyH8">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpOjMG5yyH8
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Right now the real story is that Trump can't get his people in, he can't get his team in because deep state won't approve their security clearance because they're (the people responsible for granting security clearances) controlled by the pedophile blackmail stuff (which is getting people responsible for granting security clearances roofied and posing them for pictures with naked children)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Now I don't know that this isn't happening, no clue at all. And yes it would be a crime. But I don't care. I am after the people who willingly rape children. Cernovich is leading us away from those people to offer up these patsies who haven't even committed the crime. He is watering down the child rape angle and making it partisan, I do not want a partisan witch hunt I want the arrest and conviction of anyone who rapes children. And I am done with the pedophilia label. They are child rapists.

              Maybe, but he did say that the "real story" was the targeting of security clearance administrators. That is not the main story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

               The main story is the elite using pedophilia as a blackmail tool. Nobody ever thought Alefantis was the ring leader, more of a showroom or disposal point from what I remember.

            Thought I would add Penn State breaking news today of wrestling coach in Pennsylvania. Do not let them define this. Yes this is about much bigger issues than pizzagate. But this is the symbolic occult choice they made. It is in Hollywood, DC , YouTube, Facebook, everywhere.

            The Pizza symbol means something to them as a wink to their evil against children. Expose it!

             The thing is, no one really takes InfoWars, Alex, or PJW seriously, at least not in my circle. And we never heard much from them here at Voat either until just the past few weeks. I feel like InfoWars sent some people to Voat to make sure his narrative has center stage. Why all of the sudden?

            Agree. #pizzagate LED to uncovering the global pedophile connections. There would be no global connections without Assange's mail drop and those original emails. Those original emails were so outrageous that people responded and found evidence about not only Comet, but they went further. They dug up those connections to pedo rings in Haiti, The Netherlands, the UK, Belgium and around the world. So why is f*cking Alex Jones taking credit for that? We've been talking about it FOR MONTHS!!!! I am FURIOUS, but I'm also confused about Cernovich. He just came out with the Susan Rice stuff, but then he also tweets and says he used to think Obama was a "DECENT MAN"?!!!! What? How? Obama was never anything but evil, manipulative, and a straight up liar! If they think we're getting off digging up stuff on JA and his crew, they are SADLY mistaken!

            In my view, anyone who is calling Pizzagate debunked simply exposes themselves as a tool of the super-rich pedophile satanists who run the world and who want us to stop looking into Pizzagate because Pizzagate is how we will expose them and bring them to justice.

            If InfoWars was a legit operation, they would not only be going hard into the discrepancies around Epstein, Penn State, and elsewhere, but also those surrounding Comet - leaving no stone unturned for any reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            We've been told by Alefantis to stay away from poor lil Comet Pizza and don't touch Pegasus.

            Them's marching orders to me: charge harder in those directions, and MUTE any fuckers who say otherwise.

              Yup. same with InfoWars' Paul Joseph Watson and his new video - repacking well known stuff that does nothing to further this investigation. It hurts the children to water this down like they are doing. All for a dollar.

              He basically said: "Pizzagate has been debunked. That means everyone talking about elite pedophilia connections is a conspiracy theorist, right? Wrong." So he wasn't saying: Pizzagate has been debunked, right? Wrong. Just to be honest.

                "He's speaking in code to me , and I know what he's really saying" sounds 100% psychotic.

               <p>
                This shows how beliefs can interfere with the interception of reality. We see what we want , emotionally, to see? And if what is there is not what we expect nor believe is really there, we'll twist the evidence 'til it proves what we need it to be.

                  Argue if you want that PJW always talks like he's lying. with a smirk? but that doesn't help your weak argument.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're still less than convincing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  People who have "Gurus" will make any excuses / apologies for their idol's back - stabbing and betrayal.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yeah, he always sounds like a twit and as though he's lying, but you have to take what he said at face value.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pointing out that he always sounds like he is lying? Does that cut - it as an excuse for his lack of clarity? [obviously deliberate]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You have to watch him many times and study him to realize he's lying?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  No not at all . His connection with "Jones" and the fact he's a Brit will tell you all you need to know. 
That and about 5 seconds of listening to his condescending babble, if you can bear it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The fact he is lying is something that only his followers realize?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Though he does lie all the time? So you have to take the opposite of what he is saying, if you are "in the know?"
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Is that cult behavior? You talk nonsense then are offended when someone points out your ridiculousness.?.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sorry for being less than subtle (as you claim your hero is [too subtle to even know for sure what he is saying]}.

                   Lying? It's obvious sarcasm, but you can continue your personal vendetta.

                     I believe he was being sarcastic because I see his videos all the time and I, like many others, recognize his personality. Sarcasm is his MO.

                     And you wrap it up with more ad hominem bullshit. I don't idolize the guy, I know his personality and what he is popular for by watching his videos. They're hilarious sometimes.

                      I despise him and Jones. I listened to him once and he was berating his listeners. Disgusting.

                      "More People" doesnt' mean "correct." That's another fallacy,

                      A person saying the opposite of the truth is less than sarcasm especially when his Boss just said the same thing on the Eve of the March in D.C. I guess "Jones'" apology to Alephantis was also sarcasm, according to you?

                       Jones' apology was because of a lawsuit. Joe Biggs reported shit that wasn't true. Anyone who has watched any other PJW video other than this one knows you're a tool. Have fun with that.

                            Yes, he lied about me, called me a "coward" He lied about William Cooper. He lied about Pizzagate. And he lied about leading the 9/11 movement - being a leader who leads everyone in to a Brick Wall.

              Right, 2 million followers. Why does he need to hawk that product line? Is it part of his act? Must be. Makes people think he's poor and like "everyone else" - has to bow to Mammon, on a regular occasion.

               He reminds me a lot  of those crooked televangelist creeps who convince the poor that God is an investment banker, who will make them rich if they turn over all their cash to the "pastor". some of these guys have several jets, let alone luxury homes. Hagee get $50 a year from Israel for PR.

              If InfoWars was a legit operation, they would not only be going hard into the discrepancies around Epstein, Penn State, and elsewhere, but also those surrounding Comet - leaving no stone unturned for any reason.

             Actually, they have been shining plenty of light in that direction. If I was a slave to Youtube propaganda videos like you are, I'd roll out ten occasions where Jones talks about Podesta, Clinton, Epstein and Penn State
             <strong>
              just since his retraction
             </strong>
             . You conveniently ignore my standing offer. Here it is again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Name one other media outlet the size of Infowars that is committing a similar amount of time to covering stories of child kidnapping, child sex slavery, and pedophile rings in the U.S. right now, and I'll let you run your Jones is CIA/pedophile cover upperer program unhindered.

              I can't name anyone that has talked more than Alex Jones PERIOD - but what percentage of the time is he saying stuff like "Alefantis is innocent"? Even if he tells lies only 1% of the time, his verbosity means that there are many untruths pushed by InfoWars, and he is a danger to the truth community, as many have known for a long, long time.

            An observation I have, is that I don't believe that there is a definition of "pizzagate".  People can explain it's origin in Podesta's emails and links to Comet Ping Pong Pizza, pedo symbols from Intelligence, and Spirit cooking.  I believe  that perhaps it a  "pedogate" investigation undertaken by civilian investigators....an investigation that our leaders and those if authority have failed to do.  It would be nice if we had a succinct way to describe it and relate it to pedogate.

             "Pizzagate is an investigation that sprung from strange, obvious code language used in the Podesta leaked emails..." and then maybe something about the connection between these code words and their known use on the dark web (as per the FBI) with activities related to pedophilia and porn?

            PizzaGate is the key to unlocking PedoGate. People calling PizzaGate a diversion or debunked is wrong, intentionally or unintentionally is a question for the Future. James Alefantis is obviously more powerful then most of us calculated. But the Monsters are nervous and it it just a matter of time before they make that significant Mistake. So Stay Focused and Critical.

             Interesting insight there --
and I also feel that the characters AJ, Podesta's, Hillary/Billary would have very much either been involved
in what was happening at CPP in DC or very much aware of what was happening.
Seems like a big center for trafficking and perhaps even very serious involvement at CPP.
We'll see -- one day soon, let's hope.  :)

             Alex Jones said the elites invented Pizzagate as a distraction. So that would mean they started planting pictures on Alefantis' Instagram and had his friends comment on them over the course of a couple of years? They are simply not that good at faking things.

CP is how Organized Jewish Power (the true enemy) finds and keeps "leaders" who can be controlled in the positions they bankroll them into.

              This "It's all the Jews fault" theory isn't helping the children. It's just making it worst by creating more division. I don't know if you guys do this intentionally or not, but just in case you're not, please focus on saving the children instead of pointing fingers at the Jews. Are the Christians better? No. How many thousands of priests have molested and sacrificed children over the centuries? How many Muslims have raped, tortured and murdered children with their "child bride" traditions and customs? Atheists, buddhists, Satanists, every fucking religion or none religious ideology has been guilty of pedophilia, torture, rape and murder of children. Even if you believe that Jews are at the top and are pulling the strings, who cares right now? How is this going to help, if you're going from A to D and are not concentrating on going from A to B and then B to C and so on? You guys need to stop that crap right now, for the kids' sake!

               It is the Sabbetean Satanist that have been there with the Jews from the beginning.  The Golden Calf?  That Evil has finally overwhelmed the Jews and has taken the rest of the World to the brink of total destruction. It is responsible for most of the antisemitism in history.  Getting caught sacrificing kids gets you chased out of town at the point of a pitchfork.

                My argument is NOT about denying any of this is false. My argument is about clarifying that this is only a ONE PART of the bigger global problem. If you want to be BIASED and ONLY point out links to Jewish "nefarious' activity, then that's what I have a problem with. To be fair and balanced, you need to ALSO bring up all Christian "nefarious" activities relating to the abuse of children as well as Muslim's and other religions too. If you put everything together, you get something completely different! It's global, the elites are deeply involved, yes, but so are the lower levels and everything else.
               </p>
               <p>
                P.S Global elites are NOT only Jewish, they also are Satanists, Christians, Muslims, Freemasons, Illuminati, et al.

                  Whatever your beliefs are, you guys need to remember that you can't get from A to D by jumping there at once. You need to get from A to B, first. This is NOT helping. It's spooky, it's too big of a red pill to be swallowed by the masses. You need to slow down and think about what you're doing. You were helping this investigation much more when you used to put your researching skills to good use, into the research itself. You provided us with the "Tom's Creek-is-Withmore-Farm" evidence and also the "McDermott-and-DeSantis-gay-couple-are-adopting-kids-and-making-them-wear-chicken-rabbit-horse-masks-and-letting-the-Clintons-babysit" evidence. That was much more interesting,concrete and logical. Now it sounds too crazy.

                    Again, you generalise. It's a dangerous game you're playing. Why are you trying to blur the possible middle ground? Extremes are the worst of all for stability. You can't expect us to fall for extremism. Not all Jews are bad and not all Christians or Muslims either. I won't discriminate. I won't fall for that trap. Whatever comes out of this, it can't be good. Divide and conquer tactic is exactly what this is. I'll pass on the fucked up NWO agenda, thanks. Keeping my compass close to me and balance in my life and around me is much more important. I am pro-nationalism, pro-identity and culture, pro-family, pro-immigration but against forced mass migration, forced cultural clashes, divide and conquer tactics. Fuck NWO destructive agenda and Go Humanity as a whole. Balance rules!

                     They think they can easily persuade others of something that took them years to understand, here on a simple forum. Not gonna happen. They need to chill a bit. How about I try to cram "flat earth" down their throats right here all at once, and then bitch because they reject it.

              I have no doubt you're right...Been watching/listening to AJ on and off for years now and although I agree with much of what he has said over those years I have never EVER heard him say Jew...I have never heard him mention anything to do with the Jews...I have never heard him say ANYTHING positive or negative about the Jews, however, that doesn't mean he's full of shit. All that means is he's being paid not to say anything either way about the Jews... It's almost like a 'no-go' zone. 
This is only part of the story though. 
Most of those that call themselves 'Jewish' aren't really Jewish at all...this could be a whole topic on its own...these are the real Satanists, masquerading as Jews...the rabbit hole is so fucking deep and all encompassing it's going to take quite awhile to unravel the truth...Be-lie-ve nothing and trust no one unless you have the hard evidence to back it up...is the only way to play this game now...because that's what it's become...a game. 
The way I see it is that they're putting out so much information (disinformation) from so many different angles that it is very hard for the average person to keep up with what is actually going on and that's the INTENTION!
I will also say that none of us have the complete picture. We have parts, or insights into what's going on...just like AJ, PJW, GW and everyone else....and whether AJ is a paid Israeli/CIA operative or not doesn't mean everything he says is disinformation. Neither does it mean that the Jews will escape our wrath...their time is coming too.

               He is known to take the Zionist out of the equation in everything including 9/11. He was exposed as having Stratfor agents on his staff. He was exposed by Bill Cooper during y2k as being a total fraud. Yet PG forum LOVES everything AJ, and analyzes every angle he has to say. Wish you guys would grow out of the fascination with that cartoon character.

                No, that was 9/11 and nobody did a thing and it went away and nobody cares that we murdered our own people. We went on to vote the lot of them in office over the years and watch the media they used to cover it up. You are new if you think anything will ever happen with this. The Hidden hand owns and controls our media, top politicians, alphabet agencies, wall street regulators, DOJ, heads of state police and top generals. Our typing away will never stop them. They only understand violence, and they programed us that that was their job and we were never to revert to it. Sadly, you will see in time. To this day you can give two shits about the fact that we did 9/11, or couldn't be bothered to look into it. And if you found it to be true? It's been too long since...And this will be as well in time. That's the truth. But we need to do what we can regardless. Fight the long defeat and don't question it.

                 No, 911 is NOT the biggest lie and conspiracy of all time, not by a long-shot. And most people still believe it was "controlled demolition" which it was not.

               Both cut from the same cloth. These people aren't even real Jews. They are Talmudic "Jews"- Satanist occultist devil dick suckers who masquerade as Jews to deflect criticism and cry in their made-up victimized history. It's genius, except it doesn't work anymore.

                 You guys sound like tin foil conspiracy theorists and you're not helping the PG investigation. I don't care about all this right now and the vast majority here don't care either. I'm a Christian and I can admit, without shame, that priests have abused and raped children over centuries. Muslims have child brides and have mercilessly abused and tortured children for centuries too. So did jews and Atheists and even Buddhists. It's not about religion. Stop that divisive crap, it's useless to our investigation.

               If he's a member of a very powerful and dangerous satanist family, then nothing would come to light. Their cleanup crew would handle any loose ends and the threat to anyone who wanted to come forward would still exist.

              Wait a minute, you want to savage Jones over and over again for not taking on the "pizza parlor guy", but roll out that he likely belongs to the most ruthless and powerful family in the history world when it suits your purpose. Which is it? You also implied previously that Jones could afford a legal tango with Alefantis. Are you changing your tune there too? You're a hypocrite V____Z through and through, like an overcooked pizza.

                Hmmm... That's a bit harsh. You recently cited a video where Jones cursed like a sailor - for essentially being called a Russian spy and a traitor to the United States of America - as clear evidence of something very sinister about Jones.
                <em>
                 He said: You fucking Goddamn fucker! Listen fuckhead! You have fucking crossed the line! Get that through your Goddamn fucking head! You're the people that fucked this country over and gang raped the shit out of it! Stop shooting your mouth off and claiming I'm the enemy - you got that, you Goddamned son of a bitch?
                </em>
               </p>
               <p>
                You were even good enough to provide me with the transcript. Thanks. Just to clarify, does the rule about using profanity only apply to Alex Jones? Or is it a matter of degrees, i.e., that you use f*** as a noun, whereas Jones uses a verb? Or is it the Goddamn part that I should be most concerned about. If it is, can you specifically indicate why it's worse than your particular choice of profanity?
               </p>
               <p>
                I almost forgot to add that I respectfully decline your request.

             Well.. would it really be ok? I mean, there's actually plenty of proof that Alefantis and his pizza place are involved in this pedo-ring. It's not just about that place, but still, that is pretty central to the whole of pizzagate, the vast amounts of instagram pics, the posters for rock concerts for kids in the middle of the night with pedophilia symbols etc. I mean, if Alefantis is brought down, the whole thing goes down, and the whole of pizzagate will unfold and be proven correct, so even that isn't a diversion in my opinion.

              And BTW do you realize how many bars and venues do all ages shows so that people 18-21 can get in. If a kid 12-16 is going to a show at the bar in the middle of the night especially the kind of bands at CPP then that blame has to based solely on the parents. You can't state that they are having "rock concerts for kids in the middle of the night"

               There's no proof, but there's a ton of circumstantial evidence. If we didn't have a corrupt government, there would have been a real investigation into Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong as soon as these mountains of circumstantial evidence came to light. No doubt a legitimate investigation would uncover a lot more than we can see just by following social media links and reading old articles.

                Yes this^^.  Yep, I want one look at their books. A proper forensic accountant could figure out a lot.  I can just smell that this would be a stupid failing business if it were not for what is REALLY going on.

               really? you think there is zero evidence that CPP and Alefantis are tied to a pedo ring? Well, ok, my suggestion is then that you'd do some more research and just some more thinking about what's going on here.

                I've been researching for four months. Please, enlighten me, what bombshell am I missing. I'm not saying he's not involved in a peso ring I'm just saying all the evidence we have just points to him being a fucking sicko.

                  I'm aware. There is just no proof. I swear, as long as it goes against gays, Jews or democrats, I could say anything on this forum and everybody would believe me. The PG community wants it to be true that bad which makes me question peoples motives sometimes.

                   There is a smouldering pile of circumstantial evidence.  I don't think the anger is against gays or jews but about elites getting away with stuff. If you.or.I offered our kids for entertainment in a heated pool WE would get a visit from CPS - Ms Luzzatto. Crickets.

                    Please read comments before posting against me. What I was simply arguing is that there is no evidence that JA is running a pedophile ring. There is lots to support the theory that he i s a sick pervertd gay dude and quite possibly a pedophile but nothing supporting the idea that he is running an illegal pedo criminal enterprise except fo r plenty of conjecture. Podesta's s emails have nothing to do with this argument.

                 Well neither am I saying that he's involved in a peSo ring, but a pedo one... And I'd say that all of the evidence is pointing towards that fact, like for example the fact that he was posting all those pictures of babies and little children on his instagram and openly posting sexual innuendo in the comment sections. Also the fact that he was organising rock concerts for kids at his restaurant in the middle of the night, with pedophile themed posters, even using known pedophile symbolism from the FBI dossier. Also, maybe the fact that his very instagram profile pic was an icon of pederasty. But really the smoking gun I guess was the "members only" section of his restaurant's website which was hacked and according to the hackers had child porn in it. So I guess all of this and all the other thousands of pieces of evidence is pointing to the fact that he's involved in a pedo ring.

               George Webb also thinks Cernovich is the bees knees. He's also been one in the alt community who doesn't want to look into Comet.

                He doesn't want to investigate Comet Ping Pong because it's a waste of time. The way to take this cluster fuck down is through the Clinton Foundation. Comet Ping Pong is a dead end and will yield nothing of consequence.

                 I actually think it might be the opposite.  The George Webb stuff is to take down the individual rat lines which are hurting people all over the world. But it will be hard to conclusively tie major politicians with these rat lines and politicians will just want to ditch compromised ones and start new ones.  The best way to bring down the political players is through investigating Comet Pizza and its surrounding block.  You need both investigated in order to clear out the corruption.

                  I disagree and here's why. Anthony Weiner labelled the folder containing the 650,000 the NYPD found on his laptop with a special name: "LifeInsurance".

                 <p>
                  He didn't do that by mistake. Those 650,000 emails contain everything required to tie politicians to George Webb's rat lines.

                 I disagree with you. There isn't only one way to take this thing down, in fact, like the mafia, we might actually have to hope for a tax evasion case, or surveillance-gate, to take them down, since as we know, pedos are positioned in every major post and are protecting the whole thing.

                 Comet is not a waste of time, and the Clinton Foundation is already being investigated by multiple agencies.

                  It's already there. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Once the Clinton Foundation goes through a financial audit all that stuff will come out. Between the Clinton Foundation and the 650,000 Weiner emails there will be more evidence than people know what to do with.

                  CPP will seem like a fly on the back of an elephant of fraud. Trust me. A forensic audit and the Weiner males is all that's needed to bring this cluster fuck down.

                   But the argument from Alex that i'm railing against is that Comet is innocent and that there is no reason for is to look at our early research revolving around it.

               Yes it is the tip of the iceberg, but wouldn't you agree that someone who doesn't know anything about the whole thing, the emails and the Comet Ping Pong connections are the logical first step to start, in order for them to understand the investigation and how it unfolded and what pizzagate is in general?

                It wouldn't be a good place to start at the largest red-herring event in the history of the universe. I think George Webb is where people should start. There is plenty of reporting on child trafficking and other sordid details.

                 Well, sure, George Webb is great, and a great place to start, he really shows the whole network of corruption and criminality around the Clinton foundation, but in regards to pizzagate, I'd say it's a bit off-topic. I mean if someone asks you, "what is pizzagate", would you start talking about Libya and Benghazi and the Muslim brotherhood and all that stuff? No, obviously you'd start with the emails and the comet ping pong connections.. if we're talking about pizzagate that is. But sure, there's all sorts of other things to talk about as well, the whole context, 9/11, etc. so it doesn't really matter where you start, as long as you don't claim that Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are innocent in this whole thing.

                  Me personally I'd start with Clinton Cash. That puts everything in perspective. If someone watches Clinton Cash with an open mind it's very apparent the U.S. is run by the Bush and Clinton Crime Families. The U.S.A. we thought we lived in is dead.

                  Only then would I go to CPP and JA but only briefly for context, maybe even show CPP as a red-herring and then explaining people only use red-herrings if they're covering something up. You don't see random people walking in the woods with a bloody fish carcass just for fun.

                   I really don't think it's a red herring honestly. There was this massive scandal, genuine grassroots people were genuinely outraged and rightly so when they saw what was going on at Comet Ping Pong and with Alefantis. I think this excessive focus on this aspect, and obviously it's excessive in comparison to all the other crimes you mention, is not because of the culprits, but because of the nature of internet and the open source investigation... Like I said in my original post they're using the strawman argument, that the pedo-ring is run from the pizza parlor. So this is a strawman, and a red herring, but it's not what anyone claimed.. Also I  want to emphasise Alefantis and CPP because it's so blatant, and so in-your face part of the whole thing with the instagrams and the posters and all that stuff. But sure, everything is relative and people can come at this ring from different angles. But really, to do what the alternative media is now doing, giving up on Alefantis and the Podestas is giving up on pizzagate, which really is something unique because it was so organic and natural reaction by the people... the massive censorship and demonisation of pizzagate I think shows that it's a fight the elite can't afford to lose, because if this one domino goes down, everything goes down. That's just how I see it, but of course there's a whole world of criminality and corruption outside of pizzagate and we can focus on anything and everything and should..

                    Trust me CPP was a red-herring. It was pure genius. It was put there to distract from the Clinton Foundation where all the really juicy fraud resides.

                     "Put there" by who, Assange? Between Wikileaks e-mails, Instagram, weird websites etc., the circumstantial evidence is too elaborate for your claim to make any sense. Those e-mails have been verified, the evidence against CPP is real.

                     Ok, regardless, I think they're guilty, so I'm not gonna say that it's something that shouldn't be dealt with. Pedophilia is horrible and needs to be dealt with, really even if it was just some random guy and a random pizzeria and I knew what I know about CPP and JA, then I'd insist on taking them down, even if it had nothing to do with the bigger picture.

            I posted this in another similar thread, but it warrants posting here as well since the OP references PJW's latest video.
           </p>
           <p>
            PJW's supposed debunking lasted less than two seconds. If Infowars and PJW's CIA directed mission (as one VOAT member is trying very hard to sell) was to really debunk PG, he would have lingered on the topic for more than a breath. Saying it's debunked allows them to work on all other aspects of the child sex slavery story like he did for the next thirteen minutes, unhampered. Anyone who believes PJW believes you'll accept that PG is debunked is mistaken. Jones would love nothing better than for anyone to blow PG wide open and to see Alefantis frog marched off into solitary for whatever time is left on the clock. I'd stake my life on it.

             What? They are still very loudly pushing the story of high gov't level pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Claiming 100% controlled op because they seem to think that the focus was shifted to discredit high level pedophilia investigations is crazy.

             Is James Corbett now controlled op too because he hasn't focused his efforts on Comet?

            <p>
             This is more of a classic divide and conquer tactic imo.
