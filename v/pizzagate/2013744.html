<p>I have filed a cybercrime report with the FBI for cyberstalking and I\'m going to follow up with a complaint with their real names if I can find them.

<p>As far as their efforts go, I tell them, please keep it up, because they are only making their plight seem more ridiculous by the day: &quot;Oh no, poor me, don\'t talk about Pizzagate, you hurt the pedophile\'s feelings.&quot; I guess they don\'t realize that trauma bonding only works on the children they\'re raping. </p>
<p>I will also state that yesterday a number which has been stalking me for the past 10 days or so tried texting me right when I walked outside of my house which was a bit weird. This person called me 5 minutes after I made a report to the FBI regarding the ToyFreaks YouTube channel. It was also only about 20 minutes or an hour after the pedo doxxed me on Twitter. </p>

            If your ToyFreaks report to the FBI is not just a timing coincidence, your harrassment could be coming from the ToyFreaks/Media Freak owner or one of his associates.  His contact information has been posted on Voat--I don't know whether you had that to give to the FBI.  If not, here it is, including phone numbers you could check against the one that's been calling you:

            Okay, here is info for a G. Chism living at 208 Briarwood Dr., Granite City, Illinois, the address of Freak Media:
            <a href="http://publicwhitepages.com/base.php?t=illinois&amp;id=5329431">

           </p>
           <p>
            Assuming this info is up to date and correct, notice that only one person, an adult, lives in the house, so either those aren't his kids or he's divorced and his wife has custody. "Bad Babysitter Minnie" could be the ex or a girlfriend or other relative: Here she is in one example:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1LpGd6mr98YouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1LpGd6mr98YouTube
            </a>
            There are good clues in this video about the house it was filmed in. Two stories, narrow winding sidewalk, brick on the front with white fenced porch, green shutters, a dark colored door, white shiplap siding in the back, big lawn or park-like area in the front, nice house with possibly a pool in the back yard or possibly the neighbor's back yard. Distinctive windows. Btw, watch these few seconds where the bad babysitter says, "You get a panda. Heres' some baby bananas--open wide!" Gross.
           </p>
           <p>
            His phone number is listed as (618) 709-7322.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is likely the guy on Spokeo:

            There is a 90-year-old woman living in Granite City named Virginia M. Chism:

            Granite City is a relatively small community of about 30,000, so she could be related.

            </a>
            :  There is plenty of information available now on this guy, including phone numbers, address, etc. He is apparently Gregory Paul Chism, 208 Briarwood Drive, Granite City, IL, the owner of ToyFreak/Freak Media. Here is the Madison County, IL property record for the business address of Freak Media:

             http://imgur.com/a/xkGPyImgur
            </a>
            Album Chism bought the property from Rodney E. Chism a couple of years ago. More research is outlined and documented in a recent Voat thread:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1994082">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1994082
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The instagram comments above calling him Greg almost certainly confirm that he is indeed company owner Chism and not an employee of the company. They also identify him as having had a previous profession or business in mowing lawns.
           </p>

            I suggest you shut down and scrub all of your social media presence.  I really hope you are using Tor and A VPN.  They may have only been able to trace an IP down to your local ISP in your palindromic town.  But, if you didn't take those precautions, they may have your address.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ensure you keep the house well lit.  Let friends/family know to be aware of this situation.  Especially those with young kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should carry a firearm with you everywhere you go.  Also, search "surveillance detection route" and learn the basics, both driving and on foot.  And be aware of all sorts of parking lot type scams - vans parked next to you, objects left around, etc.

            I am sorry I do not have a Twitter Acct.  and am pretty useless when it comes to sending things except for minimal texting.  I will give you a bit of advice.  You must be giving out too much info.  Do not give any personal info like where you go to school or what you are studying especially if they already know what state you are in.  These people are very adept at finding people.  How did they know you have a fireplace?  Did you post a pic somewhere like on facebook or elsewhere?  Get off facebook they are not our friends.  Post no more pictures.  Have they been able to hack into your phone?  They are very tricky and knowledgeable about those things.  They may have friends in higher places as well.  You can Direct Message me if you want.  Also the others you listed. No point in letting the enemy know your plans.  Edit:  If for any reason you know or feel they know where you exactly live, get protection by letting the FBI know immediately.  Tell them they know your location and you need protection NOW.

             I was advised by a lawyer friend I know to get their names, something I'm not capable of. It doesn't bother me too much if they know that I reported them to the FBI because they've already been stalking me for a long time. I do not have a fireplace. It was a Harry Potter reference. But the last part is indicating that he knows where I live because of the name of the city I live in happening to be a palindrome.

              I just sent you another message.  From now on DM me directly.  You are in danger if they get any closer.  Do not let out anymore personal info at all.  Do not mention where you shop by what you buy, etc.  Nothing.  After you write or tweet look it over beforehand.  We can all make mistakes.They are very sharp.
