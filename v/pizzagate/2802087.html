<p>Australia broadcast an explosive 60 minute report on the Westminster paedophile network on Sunday evening, that has sent shockwaves around the world. 
‘Spies, Lords and Predators’ looked at what the host described as Britain’s ‘biggest ever scandal’ that is likely to ‘rock the British establishment’.</p>
<p>The programme features an interview with Richard Kerr, who lived as a boy at Kincora boys’ home in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Earlier today, Exaro uploaded its own video interview with Richard Kerr, in which he says that child sex abuse at Kincora was all about political leverage.
The programme also filmed an interview with Esther Baker, who alleges that she was sexually abused by two politicians.
And a man identified by Exaro only as “Darren” is interviewed anonymously in the programme. Darren became the third witness to give an account to us of how prominent people carried out child sex abuse at Dolphin Square, the apartment complex favoured by MPs.</p>
<p>In addition, Kevin Allen, brother of Martin, who disappeared as a 15-year-old in 1979, is interviewed for the programme. Kevin believes that Martin was abducted and murdered by a member of the ‘Westminster paedophile network’.
When he raised his suspicions with police many years ago, he says that a senior officer told him: “You keep saying things like that, you could get hurt.”
Zac Goldsmith, a Conservative MP who was part of the initial cross-party group of seven who last year called for an overarching inquiry into child sex abuse, agrees with the programme’s reporter that the ‘Westminster paedophile network’ is the “biggest political scandal in British history”.
Goldsmith tells 60 Minutes: “There is very compelling evidence that very senior people engaged in terrible acts and were then protected by the establishment. I have no doubt at all about that.”
“But I think the genie is out of the bottle.”</p>

            Lots of issues with this. Exaro was shut down. It relied too heavily on the words of 'Nick' who rightly or wrongly was discredited as a fantasist. I'm still undecided. Yournewswire is absolute drivel. Any serious researcher wouldn't even bother reading a link from it. Richard Kerr is credible and along with Esther Baker are true survivors.

              I know right, the truth always gets in the way. Exaro relied upon 'Nick', who was found out to be wholly lacking in real evidence. He did nothing to achieve justice for real survivors. As for Yournewswire, if you trust anything Sean Adl-Tabatabai, you need to get some credible sources. The guy is, was and always will be a complete fraud.

            Hi there fogdryer. I'm going to give this the "Old News" flair, since it's from 2015. It's good redpill material though. If you want to resubmit it with the date it was aired in the title, I will be able to give it the "Share!" flair instead.
