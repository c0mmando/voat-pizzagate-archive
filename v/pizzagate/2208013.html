<blockquote>
<p>Martijn Association was present at the Belgian Lesbian and Gay Pride 2004</p>
<p>MARTIJN Association, founded in 1982, is a platform for discussion about pedophilia. MARTIJN Association fights for the social and societal acceptance of child-adult relationships. In relationships between children and adults that are experienced as pleasant, possible physical intimacy should not have to be a problem. In relation to this physical intimacy, MARTIJN Association proposes four guidelines, namely: 
Consent of both child and adult.
Openness towards the parents of the child.
Freedom for the child to withdraw from the relationship at any moment.
Harmony with the child\'s development.</p>
<p>MARTIJN Association, a platform for discussion about pedophilia, is present at the BLGP (Belgian Lesbian and Gay Pride) to plead for the emancipation of pedophiles</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freddy Thielemans, mayor of Brussels City, writes in his invitation to the BLGP that each human being has a right to respect and esteem. We hope that for him the same goes for pedophiles who give shape to their feelings in a befitting manner. The BLGP organization puts on its website (www.blgp.be) in its &quot;list of demands 2004&quot; that gay and lesbian people support the fight against each form of discrimination on the basis of e.g. age and sexual orientation. We hope they thereby also think of pedophiles (and of children).</p>
