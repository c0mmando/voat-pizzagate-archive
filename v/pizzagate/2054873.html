            Have you ever seen the video where a doctor inspects the demon carved into her clitoris? Nasty. As far as disinfo, probably. I mean, her handler is a G-man, right?

            I suspect O'brien is a real mk victim who was never actually rescued.  Just programmed to read out a script.  Evil doesn't want to rule from the shadows forever.  They'll 'come out' in degrees, to test the waters.  Obviously, so far, there have been no repercussions.

            you got worse formatting than me... and I get critquted for it all the time. The improperly embedded first youtube link is 2 hours long. Can you find the shape-shifting lizard bit too. Because I know people who hate David Icke with a Vengeance. (

            I thought kangagroocourtofaustralia.com was a controlled opposition because others "Bob McDonald" kept saying it to me. He turned out to be the shill and now yesterday that guy got jailed for years for exposing gay judge who think a boy's arse raped is only worth a month's jail punishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying you are wrong here, but don't be quick to be calling people shills until you know for sure.

            Can you confirm or deny if you think I'm a shill / limited hangout? I'm getting mixed messages from you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fetzer isn't as bad as you say he is. Most of the other big names in Alternative media are shills, especially this satanic-left-trio who role play conservative/libertarian of max egan, mark passio, vinny eastwood (and his entourage) and Adam vs The Man Mr OTO staging events to get arrested etc then solicitings $$$ from it all day long.

            This is the same user telling us pizzagate is a psyop. And now he's trying to tell you that Satanism isn't involved. Obvious cointelpro. Even Ted Gunderson talked about how many kids he knew were abused in satanic sex cults.

              You clearly said Satanism muddy's the waters. It's actually the opposite, people aren't talking about Satanism enough. The elite are luciferians. Why do you doubt this?

                Dude the mainstream media called it "satanic panic" to cover up the truth about Satanism. All of those satanic panic cases were true. Now they have you brainwashed into thinking Satanism is not a thing

                 Dude, Geraldo Rivera and Oprah were peddling Satanic panic shit on purpose. I know it was a coverup, stop acting like you know more then me, I know about the false memory syndrome and sll the fuckery with the psychiatrists. They exagerrate things on purpose and use it to discredit.

            Satanism muddy's the waters? haha this post is bs. The elites are obviously into Satanism, look at bohemian grove for goodness sake. Many kids talked about being in satanic sex rituals. Are all those kids lying? Read the franklin coverup and research Michael Aquino.

              So you believe Cathy O'Brien is lying but yet we all know Hilary Clinton is involved with pedophila. Cathy Obrien was talking about this 20 years ago before we even knew Hilary Clinton was involved with pedophile rings. Seems to me like Cathy Obrien was proven right after the pizzagate revelations came out. Hilary Clinton is an obvious Satanist, she even admitted that she can talk to the dead and channeled elanor roosevolt. Larry Nichols also said Hilary Clinton was apart of a witches church and he used to work for her

                Well you can believe that but the evidence points to Hilary Clinton being a Satanist. And since she's a Satanist, it means Cathy O'Brien is correct

            I didn't know CoB and MP espoused the reptilian BS.  However, I was suspicious of them already.

           <p>
            As for the "kidnapped" chick they rescued, I found her family (Mormons) to be unbelievable too, so my guess is that they are also part of the psy-op.

             I didnt kno they were mormons, but that does make sense.Mormons are notorious for being freemasons, spooks and pedophiles. I wouldn't shake hands with a mormon tbh

              My ex-flatmate went to a fancy dress party dressed up like a real Mormon - he even got the laminate badge made up to go with the white shirt. He recalled that nobody would talk to him until after half way through he blew his cover he wasn't really a Mormon. People naturally fear them that much, they can't even realize they were in a fancy dress party.

             <p>
              The book of Mormon they give away for free also makes a nice toilet paper substitute, thin ply! I actually used that in my late teens when I first moved out of home and I was skint.

            I was with you until you blamed the Jews. The number 1 psyop is that it's the Jews fault for everything. We've proven time and time again that it's not Jews running the game and it certainly isn't all Jews that are involved. MK Ultra is actually an offshoot of a Nazi scientific program brought here thanks to operation paperclip. Yet you useful idiots still want to call these clowNs Jews, like they're begging you to.

              The 13 Bloodlines run the game through the committee of 300. They even created the banking system through the Knights Templar/SMOM, not the Jews.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                The warrior monks who invented banking
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               By Tim Harford 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy, BBC World Service
              </p>
              <p>
               On London's busy Fleet Street, opposite Chancery Lane, is a stone arch through which anyone may step, and travel back in time.
              </p>
              <p>
               A quiet courtyard houses a strange, circular chapel and a statue of two knights sharing a single horse.
              </p>
              <p>
               The chapel is Temple Church, consecrated in 1185 as the London home of the Knights Templar.
              </p>
              <p>
               But Temple Church is not just an important architectural, historical and religious site. It is also London's first bank.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Knights Templar were warrior monks. A religious order, with a theologically inspired hierarchy, mission statement, and code of ethics, but also heavily armed and dedicated to holy war.
              </p>
              <p>
               How did they get into the banking game?
              </p>
              <p>
               The Templars dedicated themselves to the defence of Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. The city had been captured by the first crusade in 1099 and pilgrims began to stream in, travelling thousands of miles across Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those pilgrims needed to somehow fund months of food and transport and accommodation, yet avoid carrying huge sums of cash around, because that would have made them a target for robbers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fortunately, the Templars had that covered. A pilgrim could leave his cash at Temple Church in London, and withdraw it in Jerusalem. Instead of carrying money, he would carry a letter of credit. The Knights Templar were the Western Union of the crusades.
              </p>
              <p>
               We don't actually know how the Templars made this system work and protected themselves against fraud. Was there a secret code verifying the document and the traveller's identity?
              </p>
              <p>
               The Templars were not the first organisation in the world to provide such a service. Several centuries earlier, Tang dynasty China used "feiquan" - flying money - a two-part document allowing merchants to deposit profits in a regional office, and reclaim their cash back in the capital.
              </p>
              <p>
               But that system was operated by the government. Templars were much closer to a private bank - albeit one owned by the Pope, allied to kings and princes across Europe, and run by a partnership of monks sworn to poverty.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Knights Templar did much more than transferring money across long distances.
              </p>
              <p>
               As William Goetzmann describes in his book Money Changes Everything, they provided a range of recognisably modern financial services.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you wanted to buy a nice island off the west coast of France - as King Henry III of England did in the 1200s with the island of Oleron, north-west of Bordeaux - the Templars could broker the deal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Henry III paid £200 a year for five years to the Temple in London, then when his men took possession of the island, the Templars made sure that the seller got paid.
              </p>
              <p>
               And in the 1200s, the Crown Jewels were kept at the Temple as security on a loan, the Templars operating as a very high-end pawn broker.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Knights Templar were not Europe's bank forever, of course. The order lost its reason to exist after European Christians completely lost control of Jerusalem in 1244, and the Templars were eventually disbanded in 1312.
              </p>
              <p>
               So who would step into the banking vacuum?
              </p>
              <p>
               If you had been at the great fair of Lyon in 1555, you could have seen the answer. Lyon's fair was the greatest market for international trade in all Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
               But at this particular fair, gossip was starting to spread about an Italian merchant who was there, and making a fortune.
              </p>
              <p>
               He bought and sold nothing: all he had was a desk and an inkstand.
              </p>
              <p>
               Day after day he sat there, receiving other merchants and signing their pieces of paper, and somehow becoming very rich.
              </p>
              <p>
               The locals were very suspicious.
              </p>
              <p>
               But to a new international elite of Europe's great merchant houses, his activities were perfectly legitimate.
              </p>
              <p>
               He was buying and selling debt, and in doing so he was creating enormous economic value.
              </p>
              <p>
               A merchant from Lyon who wanted to buy - say - Florentine wool could go to this banker and borrow something called a bill of exchange. This was a credit note, an IOU, but it was not denominated in the French livre or Florentine lira.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its value was expressed in the ecu de marc, a private currency used by this international network of bankers.
              </p>
              <p>
               And if the Lyonnaise merchant or his agents travelled to Florence, the bill of exchange from the banker in Lyon would be recognised by bankers in Florence, who would gladly exchange it for local currency.
              </p>
              <p>
               Through this network of bankers, a local merchant could not only exchange currencies but also translate his creditworthiness in Lyon into creditworthiness in Florence, a city where nobody had ever heard of him - a valuable service, worth paying for.
              </p>
              <p>
               Every few months, agents of this network of bankers would meet at the great fairs such as Lyon's, go through their books, net off all the credit notes against each other and settle any remaining debts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our financial system today has a lot in common with this model.

               If you look at ‘The George Town Law Journal, Vol 71: pages 1179-1200’ you will see its stated the Norman and Anglo-Saxon Kings own the Jews. It states that Jews are controlled by Gt Britain. It also states the Talmud is now law of the land as of 1066 and its enforced by the Popes and Kings. This is what you would call the Uniform Commerical Code.

                  Those are the sources they make us use here, but you know that. There's plenty of other sources. Even their wiki page admits this. You idiots have nothing but strawman bullshit and propaganda you can't source at all.

                      There's a hundred more sources, you're just attacking a strawman because you have nothing but stormfront or David Duke. I posted the most mainstream links I could find because that's what normies want to see. I've been a member of the truth movement since early 2002, so yes, I know the BBC reported tower 7 collapsing early,  and protected pedos. I also know that wikipedia is mainly edited by shills. You know what else I know? Shit slips through the cracks. Again, what do you have to prove your point other than finger pointing, name calling and stomping your feet demanding that you're right???

                 If you look at ‘The George Town Law Journal, Vol 71: pages 1179-1200’ you will see its stated the Norman and Anglo-Saxon Kings own the Jews. It states that Jews are controlled by Gt Britain. It also states the Talmud is now law of the land as of 1066 and its enforced by the Popes and Kings. This is what you would call the Uniform Commerical Code.

               <pre><code>Oh Shaun of Little Faith,
Luke's not the giving up type.  You're looking at this all wrong despite that being said.  You need to consider the utter amusement that's bought to anyone who's confronted by the comedic---whilst accidental---genius of the Australian Establishment.  It's no lie to say that it takes years off your age.  
Have you seen Garry's emails to MPs and those other ones  (representatives or cenators)  where he's telling them to clean their foreskins,  hide things in it and hinting that they need to get circumcised.

I'm not saying that Bo Selecta's not a great comedy show,  but what part of that masterpiece compares to the laughs these fuck ups come out with?

You need to see the funny side to all of this or you'll end up cracking up,

Tom

Obviously the repeated mentions of circumcision would indicate that Burns and Burn are using Anglicised Jewish names and are tribes members.

                sean silk is always talking about "legal" ways to make guns in Australia. He's clearly a police shill / faggot.

               <p>
                He's got his own set of stormfront groupies now following him on his little op with like 10 listeners a day. I think whatever deal the cops gave him isn't paying divididens.

                Hi Charley,
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll keep this brief.  I'm still listening and finding Renegade to be an impressive platform.  In some ways they look  'a bit too good'  (I think you know where this is leading),  but then there's this man Shaun,  accusing me of being some kind of cointel.  He said the same about Luke McKee,  and now he's saying that this man Brizer from Ireland is.  Brian's mate,  Mammi's Shit used to host your show.  NONE OF THESE ARE COINTELS.  In order of trust they'd come over you.  I know them and they're the real deal.  We can be certain of this as they're all doers.  They actually do things which show that they're all in.  In the case of Luke,  he's a fucking refugee from Australia.  How did he manage that?  Did I mention that his brother was murdered as well?  He's also been chased out of:
China  (where they tried to kill him);
               </p>
               <p>
                the USA  (where a now-infamous child and dog abuser tried to kill him);  and,
               </p>
               <p>
                Korea  (where he learned the language and got married and had to leave due to revealing a massive child abuse ring in a foreign language school,  run by Satanists).
               </p>
               <p>
                There's an international law firm,  called KL Gates who've been either under their own volition or via some other source  (possibly the OTO Austalia)  have given a blank cheque to have him extradited to Australia  (off the top of my head I forget how he demonstrated this,  but it's true).
               </p>
               <p>
                No one's as definitely not a cointel as Luke,  so Brizer by definition can't compete,  but he's put his home at risk by denying he's due to pay morgage in Ireland.  He's refused to have a water meter,  and it goes on.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's just odd that Shaun seems to slag people off without feeling any need to make up some reason to say that he's going to block their calls.  If he's not a cointel,  then that at this stage would be a big surprise.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm sure you're used to this happening all the time,  so probably if I were you,  I'd chose to tactically not get involved.  I'm just letting you know so that you know.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only other thing to think about is that maybe the aim is to  'soak up'  important news about Jews trafficking children into Australia for sexual and murder abuse still  (they used to from the UK,  but that's painted as a past event).  Luke's proven that they're using their top Mossad agents in the  'leading gay activist'  and their deputy chief of New South Wales Police to attack people who are onto their pedo normalization activities.  He's also onto the OTO's David Botrell who heads up immigration assisting in the child transport.  I may have mentioned this before,  but the  'real Crocodile Dundee'  who also knew about this was murdered as a result of speaking about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think it may be a case of  'you're allowed to speak about Jews in general but not mention actual names and actual ongoing crimes'.  Note the  'blood libel'  (to use the most preposterously loaded phrase in history of contrived phrases)  aspect I'm thinking's off the agenda for a lot of people,  as it is the one thing that can turn the tables over night.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm still listening to your talks.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thank you very much,
               </p>
               <p>

              wanna hear me fuck with the jews on and off the last year or so. I was popped in now and then on 4th postition on talksjew until it got censored. You will find updates on the early research into the boylover Garry Burns saga etc.

                Well I been in exile 10 years. I've been talking about my saga for a long time. The first sydney.indymedia.org.au / forum.dadsontheair.com posts got censored so I took down their whole fucken indymedia website when I was in China :) Downgraded the drupal schema so they couldn't moderate comments and by they time they realized it their circular backup ftp had overridden all they had :) They rather take the site down.

                I was saying Catherine Burns was doing dodgy search warrants before the MSM ;) Did you see that bitch going for Mossad training? Read the details on this podcast:

               </p>
               <p>
                The Indymedia faggots were also covering the carrington gate saga back then of a police officer's son raping children. There was some anonymous videos that came about it then too.

                  Don't get me wrong The Waffen Military were fighting for good. Jews Declared war on Germany in 1933 first. The 6 million jews were in the 1917 papers right? The jews were massaring ethnic germans in poland before the war...

                   There was no faggot problem in the SS. Hitler did night of the long knives and solved the gay problem by getting rid of Rohm. Thule society was just Heinrich Himmler LARPing, Hitler didn't approve of neo-paganism

                    Someone needs to work together researching doing a book to fully debunk that pink swastika filth. I have been learning how to detect disinfo like you. Independentmedia.net is fiona barnett's weakest link btw. I forgot about that until recently then I went holy #$@$@# red flag red flag.
