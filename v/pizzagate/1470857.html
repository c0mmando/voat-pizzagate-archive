            Do not take this at face value. For the past month, President Elect Trump has made decisions, or statements that seem contrary to his position, but his true intentions later came through. Flynn Jr is not prohibited from speaking to his father. Flynn Jr isn't being locked away at a Government blacksite. He still has enough access to pass along info that can be used later. The fact is that for the next month, President Obama still has the authority to shield his friends from justice through pardons. You never let you enemy know your true intentions until you are ready to. Right now, President Elect Trump has no authority to act on any of this. Just wait.

             This is true and I'll still remain hopeful but upon learning this my heart fell a little. Either way it wouldn't be a bad idea and prepare for the worse in case we don't get his support.

              Which is understandable. But, remember when the "media" said about him not focusing on locking up Clinton? They ran with that. A week later, Kellyann Conway clarified that Trump himself wouldn't focus on it, that would be up to the DOJ. Again, he is playing 4D chess with these people. As we've seen, nothing from him is as it seems on the surface, he is always planning something.

            I did not vote for him and in no way in hell was I going to vote for Hillary but Trump was elected and I can see the opportunity that he has to become a great and important president by doing the right thing at this turning point in this country and I want to give him a chance. However I don't necessarily have a lot of faith he will actively speak out to try to put these people away. This here guy gettting fired is a pretty sure sign that we are on our own people. We need to convince people who are in law enforcement, military, FBI etc.. to stand together and get this done. I would love if Trump would serve the justice required to remove these evil elements from our great country but this is a pretty bad sign when people in his circle are getting fired for questioning pizzagate.
