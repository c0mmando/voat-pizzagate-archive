<p>Directed by Scottish filmmaker Kevin Macdonald, Whitney - which debuted at the Cannes Film Festival - claims that the singing icon was abused by her cousin Dee Dee Warwick.</p>
<p>The allegations are made in the documentary by Houston\'s half-brother, former NBA basketball player Gary Garland-Houston, as well as her assistant Mary Jones.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian, Garland-Houston alleges - alongside her former manager Pat Houston - that he was abused by Warwick between the ages of seven and nine when Whitney would have been just three or four-years-old. Jones reportedly claims that Houston used to speak of being &quot;molested at a young age&quot; by a woman.</p>
<p>Dee Dee Warwick, who enjoyed success as a gospel performer in the early 70s, was the niece of Houston\'s mother. Her older sister was soul-singing legend Dionne Warwick.</p>
<p>Whitney, described as&quot;the definitive story&quot; of the legendary singer, is said to feature interviews with a variety of Houston\'s relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Macdonald, speaking about the claims, told Deadline: &quot;I first began to suspect that there might be some kind of abuse involved before anyone had actually told me. I just had a sense, having sat watching interviews about her, watching footage of her. I had a feeling that there was something wrong with her.</p>
<p>&quot;That was just an intuition, and then somebody mentioned it off-camera to me. They wouldn’t talk about it on camera, but they said Whitney had said to her that something had happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Houston - one of the most successful recording artists of all time - passed away in 2012 at the age of 48 after drowning in a bathtub. Three years later, her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was found unresponsive in a bathtub and died aged 22 after spending six months in a coma</p>
<p>Whitney will be released in UK cinemas on 6 July&quot;</p>

            Just wanted to add that when I read your post 2 things popped into my mind. Firstly, 'My Best Friends Wedding' (and it's cast) and I also remembered Michael Jackson's relationship with Diana Ross.

            Ooh...and Paula Yates and her daughter.

            dont know bout abuse by Dee Dee, but there are a lot of strange circumstances involving her death and scummy producer Clive Davis.  So if the film doesn't discuss those circumstances, doubt it's 'definitive'

            Does everyone remember how her daughter died the complete exact same way.  It’s so obvious to people like us that it was a sacrifice, but others truly believe it was a coincidence.   How easy it is fool the public.

            The things you find are amazing. I know Dionne was involved in the occult psychic world so I looked.
            <a href="http://www.thestillman.com/stillmanfiles/2012/02/whitney-houston-dionne-warwick-and-the-magical-connection/">
             http://www.thestillman.com/stillmanfiles/2012/02/whitney-houston-dionne-warwick-and-the-magical-connection/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I was totally unaware that Warwick had been involved with Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., the grandson of Samuel Bronfman, of the fabulously wealthy Canadian Jewish Bronfman family.  This is a very intriguing connection indeed, for the Bronfmans made their fortune peddling bootleg liquor during the Prohibition era, according to the book, Dope Inc.  The book also states that the Bronfmans have connections to organized crime in Canada and in the United States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, Warwick is not the only black female Edgar has been involved with, and through one of his relationships, Bronfman has had an influence on black public education in the United States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also found this interesting:
           </p>
           <p>
            These things should concern us.  I don’t believe for one minute that Dionne Warwick’s Psychic Friends connection was solely financially motivated any more than I believe that her affiliation with the animal rights movement is purely out of concern for animals.  And if you’ve read our articles on the Animal Rights Movement, then you know that there is a New Age connection between the Animal Rights Movement, the occult, and the New World Order.
           </p>

            I  certainly do think there was something at play here.  The occult seems to figure in with the family.  Also in her Wiki it mentioned she lived many years in Brazil.

             It looks like the Bronfman's and NXIVM, Hollywood, Music Industry etc.... might be mafia related. It's obvious that they were "protected" for years. Perhaps they were also using SRA and MK Ultra to control people. And is this how the Clinton's are involved with NXIVM too?

              Yep I am sure that's how Hill and Bill are involved.  Her dad started out as a small timer with Capone.  That's how they learned the rat lines.  They just took them over.

              Oh yes, I read in one of the reports that Seagrams is hooked up with the mafia.  Also I remember

               @Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt
              </a>
              telling me over and over that the cheese industry and liquor industry are both controlled by the mafia.  Just about everything is, I suppose.  Prostitution, Trafficking, Drugs, etc.
