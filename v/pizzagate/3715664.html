<p>KAPPY -- Louis Morris Kappy died May 7 in Albuquerque. Born August 13, 1917 in New York City, Liebe Moishe Kaplowitz. Survived by his wife Luz Maria Gonzales Kappy, daughters Sandra Lyn Engoron March and Tamara Veneruso, sons Dale Jay and <strong>Glen Hall Kappy</strong>, ten granchildren, and four great grandchildren. For Louis, a child of the Depression who <strong>dropped out of middle school</strong> to support his widowed mom and siblings, loving was providing. He himself wore holey tee shirts and pants with frayed cuffs, shopped sales, and never had a credit card. But he and his first wife Dorothy provided their children with long vacations, culture, college educations, and more. <em>A son of poor Jewish immigrants</em>, he worked hard at his business but took Saturdays off to watch sports on tv and make potato salad. He felt for underdogs and was proud to be Liberal. He was pleased to pass on to his customers the bargains he got from shrewd and diligent job-lot buying, and thus developed a following. He was passionate in temperament, good at heart, and faithful in marriage. <strong><em>He was cynical about eulogies, but everything related here is true.</em></strong></p>

            Glen Kappy is the name of Isaac's father.  Not verified if this is the right one, I think it may well be, documenting because it may support a theory that I've just heard about:

             Glen Kappy is a founding member of Albuquerque Mennonite Church where, over more than 20 years, he has served as elder, preacher, interim pastor, and spiritual formation director. Since the fall of 2000, he has been a second-career teacher of English, Social Studies, and Performing Arts, mostly in the Albuquerque Public School system.

             A little about me. I was raised in inner city New York. My father was from Jewish background, my mother from Anglo-Protestant background, but both were alienated from their traditions. Agnostic themselves, they raised my siblings and me to make our own decisions about religion. Ironically perhaps, from college on I grew increasingly drawn to “the God question” with my initial interest in the Hindu, Buddhist, and Tao traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             After completing my B.A., I spent much of the next two years outdoors hitch-hiking in the western U.S. Over this time I became convinced there was an intelligence behind nature. At age twenty-five and desperate to know God personally, I had an experience that led me to become a Christian. Now, more than forty years later and with significant change in between, I am associated with a local Mennonite community.

             I have been investigating Project Spade, which appears to be show how the RCMP is willing to go to great lengths to prosecute and end international CP rings. Found this article which ties the arrest of Loskarn, and to a TON of other rings.
             <strong>
              There are ties to UPenn and that scandal (concrete, convicted proof), the Franklin scandal, University of Tenessee, George Bush, Mitt Romney (who purchased Lamar Alexander's company Bright Horizons, Loskarn's boss) and just a whole mess of things.
             </strong>
             Honestly, I am too ADHD to investigate this properly, but this appears to be a very interesting arrest that ties together many rings.
