<p>&quot;Bharara and Schneiderman’s offices have several overlapping probes and remain in regular contact to ensure they’re not stepping on each other’s toes.

Bharara is investigating many of Gov. Cuomo’s associates concerning what he calls the “show-the-money culture in Albany,” and he indicted the governor’s closest aide Joe Percoco for alleged bribery and bid-rigging.&quot;</p>

            Some might want to research as well to a secret meeting involving Schneiderman and Obama that resulted in the war of words between Schneiderman and President Trump in regards to foundations. 
This was revealed in late December very few covered it. It explains a lot as to what was going on during the election. The lies of the MSM, the corruption of rule of law, and keep in mind Schneiderman was on Clinton Advisory Board.

               You mean the former NYC congressman who won't stop texting dick pics to underage girls with his toddler child in the bed who is married to HRC's Saudi raised aide (for 20 years) and was introduced and married to her by WJC, and whose laptop allegedly contains a file called life insurances which was the reason that Comey reopened the Hillary emails / unsecured basement server investigation two weeks prior the election? You are right, he can't possibly have anything to do with any of this!! 
So do you think that Weiner has a shoebox full of old receipts from cheese pizza at Comet Ping Pong or does he get his free?

            Thank you Nana66,

           <p>
            this is a fantastic post.  Schneiderman has been draining key members of the Albany swamp for a while now, so a meeting with him and Bharara has got to be a good sign.

            UN Director John Ashe should be on the clinton body count list, its hard to believe the death circumstances, throat crushed by a barbell while wanted for questioning, even if he lived he wouldn't be able to talk...doesn't get more obvious than that.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Citizens United wanting immunity for Lap Seng, why indeed? Raises a lot of questions as to where that money was going. Not just for Stanley Ho's Macau Casino hotel hookers it seems.

              There are so many connections and Bharara is taking out Wall st too. They are more than likely all connected like, Raj Rajaratnam, who connects way back to Clinton corruption using India in the same way they did Haiti -
              <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/05/11/raj-rajarathnam-found-guilty-how-prosecutor-preet-bharara-got-his-man.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              This article includes Raj and lots of corrupt connections to Clinton foundation (AIF) American India Foundation. I really think the "wall st speeches" $$$ are not just appointment bribes, just like with Ng Lap Seng....
             </p>
             <p>
              "Raj Rajaratnam was perhaps the most notorious AIF trustee. He was convicted of 14 counts of security fraud in one of the largest and most spectacular Wall Street prosecutions in decades.  He is currently serving serving a sentence of 11 years in prison. Gupta passed on insider tips to Rajaratnam."

               Literally the worst hit job ever. The last time I heard of someone getting their throat crushed by a barbell was on Dateline when a husband tried to setup an "accident". No one believes this shit. Putin is actually much more creative.

             Now I am wondering if Mr Seng's cushy lifestyle isn't just rich people influence getting him off easy but possibly in return for information instead.

              Right, he's got a judge arguing about stopping for take out food? unbelievable! What ever he may have to say, he is probably not going to be safe back in China afterward. Makes me think twice about Trump's animosity &amp; possible war with China, this could even have something to do with NYC real estate and/or casinos (his own and in Macau) also, but also involved the UN &amp; Clintons?

                people have been talking about climate change and global warming for decades, o-zone layer and all that, china has a major a pollution problem... claiming it a hoax to assuage the people, very possible. Not sure how that relates to Preet Bhahara's cases though.
