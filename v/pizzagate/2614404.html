             What is now possibly the worst kept secret at
             <strong>
              Columbia’s Morningside campus
             </strong>
             , an intricate network of tunnels connects many of the school’s buildings. The history however, is still fascinating. These tunnels date back to 1900 when the campus was home to another institution: Bloomingdale’s Insane Asylum. The only remnants of this asylum that exist on Columbia’s campus are these underground tunnels and Buell Hall which was an original structure from Bloomingdale’s. The tunnels are still in use today, though the university is increasingly limiting access due to rogue tunnel explorers and other hazards, many of which are remains from another famous use for the tunnels:

             <strong>
              Fermi began the Manhattan Project in Morningside Heights
             </strong>
             with the help of Szilard—and Columbia's 1939 football squad, members of which carried cans of uranium and graphite. "It really was a pleasure to direct work of these husky boys, canning uranium—just shoving it in—handling packs of 50 or 100 pounds with the same ease as another person would have handled three or four pounds," Fermi recalled. Three years later, Fermi decamped for the University of Chicago, where the Manhattan Project was completed. Luckily, he left the football players behind.

             Sure I have mentioned this before., the Smithsonian was formed to mismanage First Nation artifacts, and other, just like National Geographic. Sorry to misdirect from our purpose here. Charles Fort was real in my opinion. Here is a made for TV series that makes him look silly. You must remind yourself that this is in no way part of his books, if you have not read one. Fortean TV episode Part 3. Watch that, and tell me it is not pizzagate related. I actually read someones comments about HP Lovecraft being a Satanist, when in fact he was warning literate people with fictional allegory.  He even got the chants right! EEEeeYa.

             That is one of the most bazaar things ever.  at ll 32 Baphomet jumps in and appears on and off til the end.  I take it there is a lot of symbology in this.  Really crazy.  And if Merkel is their their must be something of importance to it.

              The Gotthard Tunnel ceremony was actually in two parts (one inside of the tunnel and the other outside). The video I posted was of the second bit. Tunnels and bridges (to another world?).  Here's the complete ceremony, this video starts with the first bit which is just as creepy.

             'The building was designed as a bordello,' said long-time resident Professor James Nassy, who first moved in during the early 60s when a few ladies of the night still lived here. Behind the discreet elegant façade, the most spectacular features of the building lay cached. Multiple hidden stairways and secret doorways give the building an air of mystery and double identity. Its layout was conceived for clandestine behavior and was exactly what attracted one of the most notorious tenants, Polly Adler.

            Wow! Nice work, and it really puts it all into perspective. Of all the buildings and apartments, the odds that these creatures end up in the same places is no accident. I wouldn't doubt if there were Luciferian spells cast on these places and they come here because they know there's a level of protection for them, whether real or imagined.

             The only reason I'm aware of which makes people think Hunter S. Thompson is a child molester is the fact that Paul Bonacci claimed that he was introduced to a man who said his name was Hunter S. Thompson on the set of a snuff film he participated in. Anyone could have said "my name is Hunter S. Thompson". As far as I know there is no other evidence against him.

             that's very interesting .... I used to run a website called The Morningside Heights Neighborhood News.
Very few entities control all the real estate in the upper half of Manhattan. Miles of streets in the control one slum lord etc. And Rockefellers, I bet, are behind the germ warfare lab that operates in Morningside Heights. Even the City Council reps cannot get rid of it.
