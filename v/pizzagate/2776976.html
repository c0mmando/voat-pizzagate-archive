            Organs are harvested while the person is alive. Cadaver bone is an exception. Possibly others, but organs yep you are still breathing and have a heart beat when they get them.

             Sadly this is true.  Little Children have been found with missing organs and sewn up sometimes. If people don't believe this is occurring, well, they are sadly mistaken.  They are way ahead of what they used to be able to do decades ago.

              I know this is probably a dumb question but what is the end game of all of this?  It seems there is so much investment by these people and corporations into organ donations etc.  also the focus on Haiti as being “more desirable” somehow as far as this stuff goes.  What do they do with it?  I know about the adrenochrome etc but that seems like only part of it.

               Big Money and an organ supply whenever THEY need one.  That's my deduction, unless someone can come up with a better one.  I think the people that got involved in this have become so corrupted by the sheer wealth that comes from this operation that they could not top even if they wanted to.  These are the most evil people on earth.  No morals whatsoever.  You've heard of the saying, He would even sell his own Mother.  Israel and Turkey and Kosovo.  I have posted pics before of Bill and Hillary with Thaci, the PM of Kosovo who is under investigation for arms and organ and human trafficking.  Biden invited him to the WH.   You will find much info in this thread from myself and others

             Hi Carm. I haven't been around much, and may continue to do so. I just don't care for all the drama and discontent that happens here. I've had my share of drama in my lifetime, so I admit I run from it. I saw you had mentioned WIC, so I wanted to see if you had seen this. It doesn't have anything to do with this current topic, but I thought of WIC when I saw it. Is this something good or bad? That I do not know. He/she always said Racine was the central point for corruption.

              In addition to Foxconn’s Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park in Mount Pleasant and North American corporate headquarters in Milwaukee, Foxconn is building a talent and innovation network across Wisconsin that includes Foxconn Place Chippewa Valley in Eau Claire, Foxconn Place Green Bay and Foxconn Place Milwaukee.

              This makes me sick to read.  I had a feeling this might have been coming.  I don't trust Foxconn nor anyone making deals with them .  I feel this is the beginning of their plan for the Mark of the Beast.  microchips.  I believe they are already doing this in China and even possibly here.  Get ready this is our future.  If people don't wake up and get out in the streets, this is what will happen to you and your kids.  Sitting in a cubicle coding day or night with an embeded microchip.  Just my thoughts. Why do you think they stopped teaching handwriting to Our Children and are now setting up coding classes for even Young Children?  Again, just my thoughts.  What are Paul Ryan's plans after he resigns.  I don't trust that guy.

                    8K is not merely a technology to make images high definition and clear. It is expected to develop not only the broadcasting / video field but also medical care, security, etc., and there is also the possibility of changing society.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Therefore, this time, I talked with Hirokazu Nishiyama, Head of 8K Ecosystem Business Strategy Office, about the potential of 8K technology and our “8K ecosystem” strategy.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    (Nishiyama) Since developing and introducing Japan’s first television in 1953, Sharp has always been developing the latest technology of television for more than half a century. We have been aiming to create the “ultimate television” to display images closer to reality by advancing colorization, large display size, slim sizing and high definition. As the resolution reaches 8K, we found out that the image appears as close as possible to what we actually see with human eyes, and the sense of reality is almost the same as the real thing.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you display the scenery of mountains, you can see the fine parts of the trees clearly, and it will make you feel as if you are actually there. If you display a person, you will see clearly the larvae and little black pigment (mole). You can see what you did not see before, and the impression you receive is totally different from the images you have ever seen.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think that you can understand if you actually see 8K images. We are exhibiting 8K at the event “White Sacas” which is held at Akasaka Sacas and at the Yaesu Exit of JR Tokyo station, so please take a look if you have the opportunity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think they have hijacked the ecosystem label.  This is not nature.  It is the Tech Ecosystem.  Yuck.  They have already lost me.  There is nothing on TV that I need magnified anymore than it already is.  Such Narcissistic Elitist Morons.  What do you think?

                     Thanks for the info. I looked up 5G too which is related to speed of devices such as cellphones along with other devices. It even mentioned dog collars in the article. So I guess with all those together..AI with defined images with lightning speed responses. We are living a sci-fi movie. Who knows what's next.

            BLOOD SUCKING FREAKS:  THE RIGHT WING BILLIONAIRES AT CERBERUS CAPITAL LITERALLY SUCK BLOOD FROM THE POOR
           </p>
           <p>
            Cerberus Capital, one of Wall Street’s most notoriously ruthless leveraged-buyout firms (or “private equity firms” in PC-speak), recently made a $1.8 billion killing on their human plasma investment, a company called Talecris, which they bought for a mere $82.5 million just four years earlier.  Meaning Cerberus made 23 times their investment on human plasma. They did it by the most savage, heartless means possible: by paying peanuts to their impoverished human plasma donors, who increasingly come from Mexican border towns to blood-pumping stations set up on the American side, jacking up the price of plasma by restricting supply (a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission accused Cerberus Plasma Holdings of “operat[ing] as an oligopoly”), and then selling the refined products to the most desperately ill, patients suffering from hemophilia, severe burns, multiple sclerosis, and autoimmune deficiencies. The products cost so much—one, IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) cost twice the price of gold as of last summer — that American health insurance companies have been dropping or denying their policy holders in increasing numbers, endangering untold numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Profiting from ruined American lives is nothing new to Cerberus — which takes its name from the legendary three-headed attack dog of Greek legend who guards the gates of Hell, making sure no condemned soul ever escapes. How appropriate too.

            In 1999, Dan Quayle joined Cerberus Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar private-equity firm, where he serves as chairman of the company's Global Investments division.[51] As chairman of the international advisory board of Cerberus Capital Management, he recruited former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who would have been installed as chairman if Cerberus had successfully acquired Air Canada.[52] In early 2014 he traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in an attempt to speed approval for a deal where Cerberus acquired nearly £1.3 billion in Northern Ireland loans from the Republic of Ireland's National Asset Management Agency. That deal is being investigated by the Irish government, and Quayle's involvement is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York as potentially a "very serious" misuse of the vice president's office.[53]

            Quayle is an Honorary Trustee Emeritus of the Hudson Institute and is president of Quayle and Associates. He has also been a member of the Board of Directors of Heckmann Corporation, a water-sector company, since the company's inception and serves as Chairman of the company's Compensation and Nominating &amp; Governance Committees. Quayle is a director of Aozora Bank, Tokyo, Japan.[54] He has also been on the board of directors of other companies, including K2 Sports, Amtran Inc., Central Newspapers Inc.,[55] BTC Inc.[56] and Carvana Co.[57]

            Cerberus has been investigated before in relation to CIA contracting scandals and companies under investigation had close ties to former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfield.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cerberus now owns Dyncorp, one of the worlds largest data collection agencies. Dyncorp snoop on citizens behalf of the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies. Dyncorp has been at the centre of allegations of running sex slave rings in countries such as Bosnia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chairman of Cerberus is Dan Quayle, the former Vice President in the George Bush administration. In 1987 during a US customs seizure of a plane belonging to a major drugs smuggler linked to the CIA- backed Contras, an address book belonging to Robert Owens, a one-time aide of Dan Quayle, was found. Owens began working for Quayle in 1980 and left in November 1983 to work on ‘project Democracy’, which oversaw US Arm shipments to the Contras. The CIA used the profits from cocaine smuggling to fund this enterprise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meetings between Robert Owens and link men to the Contras and cocaine smuggling were held in Dan Quayle’s office.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been claimed in books, that George Bush used the CIA to bring down Jimmy Carter and it was during this period that it is alleged those loyal to Bush and the CIA began infiltrating law firms, senate houses, PR and lobbying firms. One of those persons was Dan Quayle. His work for George Bush earned him the vice Presidency in 1988.
           </p>
           <p>
            A major source of Quayles political power in Indianna is a man who moved within the highest echelons of the CIA, Beurt SerVass. SeRvass was a close associate of former CIA Director William Casey. SerVass was a member of the Executive board of the Veterans of the O.S.S which it has been claimed, runs the CIA from behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Questions must be asked around what interest Cerberus really has in Northern Ireland? Why is this CIA hedge fund investing in Northern Ireland and why did Peter Robinson, and those around him in the DUP, go to such remarkable lengths to assistCerberus  with their late bid?
           </p>
           <p>
            Cerberus and Dan Quayle’s road to the NAMA deal started way back in the 1980’s, when Quayle was part of a ‘secret group’ running covert operations on behalf of the CIA and George Bush. That is when they found their man in Northern Ireland.
