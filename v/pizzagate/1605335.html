            That red thing is a welder and the metal bottles in front of it are oxygen/acetylene bottles that are used for welding. The long "hoses" look like welding Leeds.

            Is there anyway to use the licence plate in order to search for details about the car? If so, we could really make some headway, likewho owned / hired it and even if the equipment was rented and by who / for what purpose.

            It's weird to me that this truck appears to have an oxygen tank and a carbon dioxide tank on it both with very long hoses. Now I'm certainly no expert and I'm sure one that is can clear this up and explain it, because my sinister side is taking over and I could see how that would be useful. I'm not even sure I want to go into further detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also it appears to have a generator, and some other wand looking hose. And what also appears to be some sort of video and audio wires or something. Not sure what those are. My point is not sure when this picture was taken, what location the truck was servicing, and why. But were it to work/dig on the ground it doesn't really seem like that's its purpose. It's mostly full and I see no jackhammer, shovels etc and it's also very clean.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also from the front you can tell there is someone sitting in the truck, and also from the back it appears the window is covered by a white plastic, maybe the window is out. as well a few houses down is a second truck that is a construction truck and they appear to be putting up cable wires in however a messy way as they are. What a damn mess, not cable company would do that. However this appears to be not related.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I said maybe an electrician or some other specialty could explain the configuration of the truck, it seems weird..

             It is a welding truck. Those bottles are oxygen and acetylene that are used for welding. The hoses look like welding Leeds. Seems like nothing sketchy, pretty typical work truck. However, JA has the associate who welds the coffin "coffee tables".maybe it's his truck?

             This guy has a typical steamfitter/pipefitter/welder set-up. Chanes are his window was busted out so someone could steal tools. D.c. is a hell hole for service vehicles. Ive seen homeless people literally sleeping inside of the beds of trucks on windy nights. The long cables are called leads...and some hook up to different power sources...say 3 phase 480v. The tanks are oxygen and acetylene, which is used to braze and cut metals. The ladder is typical for someone of that trade. The Generator is actually a generator/welder which looks like a Lincoln brand welder/gen set up. Sometimes you don't have power..which is why you have a generator and long long long leads...I've seen leads ran almost 100+ft depending on how high or low a job is.

             In also seems to have wheels and an internal combustion engine.  I don't have to tell you how useful that could in a trafficking operation.

             I don't see any audio or video cables.   If you are referring to the black cables, those are either hoses (because this is a plumbing and gas truck) or heavy duty electrical cords to run from the generator.

              Inside the truck is a welder with an oxi torch as well as gas containers and a ladder, but i'm not sure what the purpose of these is if this it to believe to be just an empty room. If anyone could link the photo of the inside of the "museum" that'd be great!

               The picture gives you enough to identify the work done by truck's owners: to make sure the building is properly connected to the sewer and gas systems.

                Well not to mention that but I believe they have used this building for an actual metal shop in the past possibly before it was used for what it is now. Hence the modeling of the modular tracks and other stuff. So certainly a welding truck makes total sense. If it's a metal shop as it has appeared to be from other photos.... I mean, wasn't that how It was identified the Pegasus as the dig site? Using pictures of people doing metal works here making art and possibly..... well.... modular floors..
               </p>
               <p>
                So if that's the case then it is not in the lest bit suspicious at all, and even lends to the theory that Pegasus is a metal shop.
               </p>
               <p>
                Then again I forget to know how to check the date the picture was caputured.
               </p>
               <p>
                That might lend to the theory it's just a welders truck....

                 I don't think Pegasus is a metal shop, though I'm not familiar with everything you mention.  I think they just did custom metal work on site.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think they know the guy who did the metal work and his shop is elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyway, the reason, I said the truck relates to plumbing and gas is that the truck has to do with with this local utility www.wsscwater.com.
I think it's a contractor who is licensed to do sewer and gas work around DC.

                  WSSC runs the dc metro area. They stretch from southern maryland into d.c.  anything related to water, and sanitation draining is WSSC. Baltimore is BGE. TBH that truck at the time of the picture...was not a WSSC truck. The stickers are peeled off and residue was leftover. WSSC wouldnt have a truck with the numberes greyed out...it's usually blue or black numbers which indicate the jurisdiction in which they are licensed to work.. AA,DC, MHIC. WSSC has a massive footprint in the DMV, to say it's a sub contractor...I do not believe that..as they have PLENTY of lazy turds already working there...they RARELY sub work..unless it's demoing, or constructing. A LOT of home depot harrys, illegal contractors, and 1 man companies purchase vehicles from these companies. The typical policy is anything after 150k miles is sold off. My company personally practices this policy.

                   Can you just explain how one would read the WSSD text?   I didn't think it was an official truck, but was thinking this meant they were a registered and licensed contractor of some sort.   I think you're saying, this is probably an old truck in private hands.

                 There has to be a way to link it, I mean suspected pedophile digs in two sites roughly 4 miles apart from each other? I doubt there is a tunnel connecting the two sites.. Is it possible that one or both of the tunnels could lead to an associate's house / establishment ? Perhaps even a warehouse? He's denied that he has a basement so something isn't right.
Unrelated question but is it possible that the "kill room" is what Anthony Podesta was discussing in that guardian piece in the first place? an underground 5 x 4m subterranean vault? Anybody done digging on this?

                  There is another photo of them I think orior to this photo, where his metal working buddy is in there working on some art piece that later shows hanging above the wood table. It's a bunch of metal rods the guy has spray splayed out and welded together into an art work... anyway there is a photo of this guy working on the metal, and that's how they initially matched this picture to the location at "Pegasus" before James took it over and started digging it was a metal shop. So if this google capture was also from before this it would make sense if it was his truck, however I think someone has identified the letters on the side as plumbing related now. We just need to date of capture and we could then connect it to the actual dig, which would validate the dig was for plumbing. Which even then again tends to lead to what "James" online or impersonator of him, (it's really him) has said... look it was just plumbing...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If it's just plumbing though why does the floor posted appear to be designed to drain at the centers similar to a drunk tank. If you piss or puke the floor is angled so it goes to the center and a drain, and the floor pic posted has the same design. As if it's intended to have a drain in the middle... has anyone else noticed this about the floor drawing?

                  Two sites? Wait digs in two sites? I haven't heard the theory that there are two sites being dug at.. I think the basement denial was just him stating the facts and not clarifying. There certainly is a basement at bucks which James owns. It's not unreasonable that it was a misunderstanding. That mr A was being honest in both the interview as well as when he claimed they don't have a basement, since the focus was on comet.. and the basement was at bucks. Technically he would have been honest if he said we don't even have a basement since the topic and focus was comet. If comet does have a basement it's very well hidden because he gave a walk through if most of the place and nobody has seen any stairs at any point.

                  No.  The "Killroom" is a standard walk-in Cooler used in restaurants.  There's zero evidence it was ever used as anything other than a standard walk in cooler.  The whole speculation about this comes from what appears to me to be an obvious joke.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There's a photograph of Anthony Podesta's underground video room with his now ex-wife in it.  I think it was in the Washington Post.  It looks nothing like a standard walk-in cooler.  So they are not the same.

                   It very well could have been a joke. Just a walk in that people with a liking for the creepy stuff making unfounded jokes. People do this all the time on the internet and it doesn't prove anything... it's creepy yes.. but proof.. unless you find the actual room there is no proof. Especially since you would think James has at least two walk in coolers since he owns as many restaurants. I mean James posts a pic of an update to one of the coolers and jokes about it being a kill room, and others go along with it. It is impossible to tell if it's a joke or not really.. not trying to shill just trying to be a skeptic both ways here....

                     True. But didn't James say murder to provoke the killroom comment... so, he was in on the joke.. or that's how I recall the photo comments went.. could be imaginations I'm.l not looking at it right now..

                       Yes he did... the weirdest comment on there for me is the one about a pile of money under a sheet. So if it was a joke started with the killroom comment, It kinda flows, jimmy posts it and says fun as in either being sarcastic and commenting on how now he has to restock it all, or maybe even genuinely saying it's new and big so he likes it
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Then a couple peep talk about how big
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Then the killroom and murder joke is floated and kicked around I bit

                       Then some drunktank and other crap

                      <p>
                       But the money under a sheet comment I'm not getting I guess, dead people under sheets make money if you're selling murder? I can see that angle I suppose.. but I am looking for maybe a more innocent way of considering that line, or a way it is relevant to the joking around....
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Maybe money under a sheet is pointing out the great expense the cooler is on a balance sheet? Seems a stretch to me.

i think of the majestic ape things vid about finding ordinary ketchup.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember seeing  an ig pic on this hub related to Sparky Alefantis ig friends, showed  a guy holding a piece of pizza. His hand was smeared with fresh blood and it was on the pizza.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didnt save it, but now i wonder why majestic ape thing made such a big deal about ketchup in a vid sketch.

              Maybe Bucks camping and fishing restaurant is better, but with a classy name like that I'm doubtful... sounds more code cause  buck antlers show up in these circles a lot.

             "They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says [Anthony] Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls."
            </p>
            <p>
             A quote from an article in the guardian about Anthony Podesta and his wife's art collection, in which they detail a large subterranean vault. Could well be related to the design we see in that link considering Alefantis' connections to the Podesta brothers.
Although do keep in mind this article was posted in 2004, the connections that have been established now may not go as far back as then
            </p>
            <p>
             Also just a side note, what type of people have subterranean vaults? Seems like it'd be pretty tricky to show off your artwork if its well, under your house...

              yes that 'oh it's nothing, just our art vault' sounds like a cover story... four walls to get video art going in an essentially soundproof setting... does not sound positive.
