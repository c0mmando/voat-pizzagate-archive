            Akhenhaten introduced monothesism to Egypt.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             To a large extent, our knowledge of Akhenaten's life and times begins in Akhetaten, the city he built for himself and his religion, not that the site is particularly well preserved. In fact, it's not. Later rulers antagonistic to Amarna culture, the social and religious institutions Akhenaten imposed on Egypt, intentionally destroyed Akhetaten along with the records of Akhenaten's reign. Ironically, however, that program of destruction saved the city and its founder's name for posterity, and for the most part its preservation depends on the fact that the city rose and fell very quickly. The reason for that stems from the enormous scope of change which Akhenaten attempted—a dramatic shift in religious, political and social traditions—and that meant he had to have an entirely new, fully functioning capital from which he could run the country without the weight of tradition bearing down on him and holding him back. Revolutions often have to "seize the day" and proceed quickly or else they don't get off the ground at all.

            RED THREAD
"With regard to the ancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the seed in the earth."

            The most ancient evidence of the Great Pyramid in western literature is attributable to
            <strong>
             Plato
            </strong>
            .  He also wrote of Altantis (Alefantis).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Great Pyramid was a place where one would be reborn.

            Brief Summary of Pyramid Research Results
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Immune system of organisms improved  (blood leukocyte composition increased).
            </li>
            <li>
             improved regeneration of tissue
            </li>
            <li>
             seeds stored in the pyramid for 1-5 days showed a 30-100% increase in yield
            </li>
            <li>
             soon after construction of the Lake Seliger pyramid a marked improvement of the ozone was noted above the area
            </li>
            <li>
             seismic activity near the pyramid research areas are reduced in severity and size
            </li>
            <li>
             violent weather also appears to decrease in the vicinity of the pyramids
            </li>
            <li>
             pyramids constructed in Southern Russia (Bashkiria) appeared to have a positive effect on oil production with oil becoming less viscous by 30% and the yield of the oil wells increased according to tests carried out by the Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas.
            </li>
            <li>
             a study was done on 5000 prisoners who ingested salt and pepper that had been exposed to the pyramid energy field. The test subjects exhibited a greatly reduced violence rate and overall behavior was much improved.
            </li>
            <li>
             standard tissue culture tests showed an increase in survival of cellular tissue after infection by viruses and bacteria
radioactive substances show a decreased level of radiation inside the pyramid
            </li>
            <li>
             there are reports of spontaneous charging of capacitors
            </li>
            <li>
             physicists observed significant changes in superconductivity temperature thresholds and in the properties of semi-conducting and carbon nano materials.
            </li>
            <li>
             water inside the pyramid will remain liquid to minus 40 degrees Celsius but freeze instantly if jostled or bumped in any way
            </li>

            Lucifer (/ˈluːsɪfər/;[1][2][3] loo-sif-ər) is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:12). The Vulgate translation uses the Latin word lucifer, but with a lower-case initial,[4] The Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale), occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means "shining one, light-bearer". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος(heōsphoros),[12][13][14] a name, literally "bringer of dawn", for the morning star. The word Lucifer is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as lucifer, meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing"

             <p>
              To a large extent, our knowledge of Akhenaten's life and times begins in Akhetaten, the city he built for himself and his religion, not that the site is particularly well preserved. In fact, it's not. Later rulers antagonistic to Amarna culture, the social and religious institutions Akhenaten imposed on Egypt, intentionally destroyed Akhetaten along with the records of Akhenaten's reign. Ironically, however, that program of destruction saved the city and its founder's name for posterity, and for the most part its preservation depends on the fact that the city rose and fell very quickly. The reason for that stems from the enormous scope of change which Akhenaten attempted—a dramatic shift in religious, political and social traditions—and that meant he had to have an entirely new, fully functioning capital from which he could run the country without the weight of tradition bearing down on him and holding him back. Revolutions often have to "seize the day" and proceed quickly or else they don't get off the ground at all.

"With regard to the ancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the seed in the earth."

              seeds stored in the pyramid for 1-5 days showed a 30-100% increase in yield

              seismic activity near the pyramid research areas are reduced in severity and size

              pyramids constructed in Southern Russia (Bashkiria) appeared to have a positive effect on oil production with oil becoming less viscous by 30% and the yield of the oil wells increased according to tests carried out by the Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas.
             </li>
             <li>
              a study was done on 5000 prisoners who ingested salt and pepper that had been exposed to the pyramid energy field. The test subjects exhibited a greatly reduced violence rate and overall behavior was much improved.
             </li>
             <li>
              standard tissue culture tests showed an increase in survival of cellular tissue after infection by viruses and bacteria
radioactive substances show a decreased level of radiation inside the pyramid
             </li>
             <li>
              there are reports of spontaneous charging of capacitors
             </li>
             <li>
              physicists observed significant changes in superconductivity temperature thresholds and in the properties of semi-conducting and carbon nano materials.
             </li>
             <li>
              water inside the pyramid will remain liquid to minus 40 degrees Celsius but freeze instantly if jostled or bumped in any way

             Lucifer (/ˈluːsɪfər/;[1][2][3] loo-sif-ər) is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:12). The Vulgate translation uses the Latin word lucifer, but with a lower-case initial,[4] The Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale), occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means "shining one, light-bearer". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος(heōsphoros),[12][13][14] a name, literally "bringer of dawn", for the morning star. The word Lucifer is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as lucifer, meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing"
