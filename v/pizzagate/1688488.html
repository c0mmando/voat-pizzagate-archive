            The wiki page says because he died in office his wife received full survivor benefits totaling 1.28mil. His family was ruined by legal costs and friends believe this to be why he committed suicide without resigning and a day before sentencing would have automatically removed him from office. Also says the guy who testified against him lied under oath in hopes of a reduced sentence. so tragic. ...

            For those who dont know he was found guilty of accepting a bribe or agreeing to kickbacks for awarding a 4.6 million dollar state contract.

            Yes it is and thanks for posting this.  I was unaware of this circumstance.  My initial thought is that he was guilty.  An innocent man always has hope.  Framed or not, the only thing that could drive me to such an act is to escape the truth.  Just my opinion.

            That was truly haunting you could hear him rushing through his speech to get to what he was going to do, I bet he didn't even notice how fast he was speaking and I bet that felt a lot longer than 4 minutes to him.  Can't believe I've never heard of that story before
