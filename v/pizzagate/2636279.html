<p>The family of a 10-year-old boy who died after allegedly being tortured by his mother and her boyfriend is calling for a criminal investigation of the social workers involved in the victim’s case.</p>
<p>Brian Claypool, an attorney representing Anthony Avalos’, family held a news conference Tuesday morning in front of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services where he revealed “shocking&quot; details from agency records that show abuse allegations in the home.</p>
<p>Anthony was found unresponsive after his mother called 911 saying he had suffered a fall in their apartment in the 1100 block of East Avenue K on June 20. The boy died the following morning.</p>
<p>Anthony’s mother, Heather Barron, 28, and her boyfriend, Kareem Leiva, 32, have been charged with murder and torture in the boy’s death. Seven or eight other children were removed from the home since the boy died. Family members said the other children are also Barron\'s.</p>
<p>Claypool said the DCFS documents, shared with him by a news agency, reveal Barron had been declared “unable or unwilling to protect the child from serious harm, including physical and sexual abuse,” in May 2016.</p>
<p>Claypool said the DCFS documents show that social workers visited Anthony\'s home 18 times and noted 88 investigations into child abuse, physical abuse and sexual abuse. He said of those cases, 15 of were substantiated instances of child abuse, and at least two were substantiated claims of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a case of negligence. This is not a case of \'the social workers are overworked.\' This is a case of flat out, deliberate indifference toward the life of Anthony Avalos,&quot; Claypool said during the news conference.</p>
<p>He added that the death reflects a &quot;systemic failure&quot; of the the agency, and wants answers into why certain matters of Anthony\'s case were not further investigated.</p>
<p>&quot;I have never seen more red flags of an impending death of a child than in the case of Anthony Avalos,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Claypool compared Anthony\'s home as a &quot;prison&quot; because other family members were not allowed to visit.</p>
<p>&quot;The only human beings who could really access Anthony to save him were social workers,&quot; he said. &quot;We\'re talking about a child\'s life. You have to make time and be logical and be compassionate if you want to be a social worker.&quot;</p>
<p>Maria and David Barron, Anthony\'s aunt and uncle, said during the news conference that the boy lived with them for a time before DCFS deemed Heather Barron fit to take care of him. They said Anthony did not deserve to die the way he did.</p>
<p>&quot;A system was supposed to be in place to protect him and they didn\'t do their jobs,&quot; David Barron said. &quot;They signed a death warrant by putting him back in that house.&quot;</p>
<p>A DEATH WARRANT.  DCFS  or CPS Caused Anthony\'s Death.  THIS MUST STOP.  All  CPS Services Must Be Investigated.  NOW.</p>
<p>Please read the rest of the story.  Thank God the rest of the children are out of that home, no thanks to the Social Workers.</p>',

            Absolutely horrifying. Those poor kids and little Anthony. The CPS is a complete joke. Hopefully the Honeybee will expose this shit in the documentary. That photo in the link from Factfinder2 where little Anthony is posing in a pic with birthday cakes looks so fake and staged, he is skinny and has multiple bruises all over his little legs. The things that happened in that home were awful and disgusting just like that Turin case. I REALLY want to know how they had 7 or 8 kids living in that shithole dump with a psychotic MS13 gang member. Unbelievable. Too bad the family couldn’t have taken the kids away or done something more at the first signs of abuse. This is beyond maddening cases like these are almost the norm it seems...

             At one point there was interaction with the family but I guess the Mother finally passed muster and got them back.  Yes, I noticed the bruises as well.  Heartbreaking.  I read in comments that he only said "I like boys", well at that age all boys say they hate girls.  So maybe he was asked which he liked better, that was his answer.  And Yes!  I too had the same thoughts about the media playing with the gay aspect.  They never miss a trick to distort the truth.  Please Read my new post

             The Mother has now also been charged.  She has a murder charge just like the step dad and abuse charges.  They could both get life.  I say Give Them LIFE and throw away the key.  Sharp and Quick Action.  There must be New Laws for ignoring these crimes.  Those Social Workers Must Serve Time.  This site, Oxygen, has info on Child Abuse Statistics.

             I can't believe the step dad was charged with abuse in 2010, and they allowed him near those children.  AND he was MS -13.  I can't even...........It's just so awful.  Yes, Trump needs to call attention to the problems.  We have the problems with the immigrant children, but we have a desperate problem with the agencies in charge of Our Children.  This poor boy just said he likes boys, what is so terrible about that.  I read a comment that a boy at that age doesn't like girls, what does he know at 10.  So he was murdered for that.  The step dad must NEVER see the light of day again.   NEVER.   MS-13, known for their satanic ritual crimes, think about THAT.

            It’s heartbreaking.  Every child protection agency are corrupt to the core and have no intention of helping children in need.  Just look at how the Hampstead kids were treated by police and CAFCASS.

             However, Sheriff McDonnell said the extent of the boy's injuries was 'grossly overstated' by child welfare officials and told reporters that detectives did not find cigarette burns on Anthony's body.    He declined to provide specific details of the boy's injuries until an autopsy was finalized.  The stepfather was a MS 13 member and even though he was arrested in 2010 he was still allowed in this home with all of these children.  Where did all these children come from?  There was sexual abuse and starving and torturing, which brings to mind the Turpin Family also in Cal.  in Perris, San Bernadino County.   These are the kind of people we do not want here.  MS 13 has trained their members in torture, and satanic ritual abuse crimes.  Horrid Stuff. This is what he did to Anthony.

             I don't even know where to being with this.  How do we create so much noise that they have to at least start looking into the agencies.  There is a lot of sketchy stuff going on right now.  I have seen some really crazy articles.  Not enough time to post them all.  Dear Lord help us.

            Avalos said in Spanish that he met Heather Barron when the two were in high school and that they had Anthony at a young age. They had problems after Anthony was born and he said Heather Barron often pushed him away and threatened to have him deported.

            What I want to know is where did those other children come from?  Did she adopt them?  Were they foster children?  It did not say they belonged to her BF.  These questions must be answered.  If they placed those children in her home, what was the payoff?  How much?

              Maybe someone on here knows how to create a ruckus.  Twitter would be a good start.  Sending tweet to one of those guys that voted for the new bill to keep gays from adopting.

             They need to be brought before Congress to explain why they ignored all the times they hurt that little boy.  They documented it, then ignored it.  They have to answer for their actions.  Yes. All CPS and DCFS agencies need to be turned inside out and overhauled or Shut Down.

               I am wondering if that step dad pimped out those children to the Soc. Workers.  The Sheriff is already covering for them saying there were no cigarette burns.  LE throws a child under the bus.  Disgusting.

              If you’ve ever delt with them , then you know they are the most intimidating group of robots you’ll ever deal with . They have a sense of superiority big time and are trained to mess with your head . The story’s are true , I’ve never met one that cared for real . The worst situation they can leave a child in , the better for them .

                 The power they wield goes to their heads.  Yes, definitely a byproduct of Narcissism.  Politics, acting, LE.  All of them are positions of power and in charge.  But people like this should never be responsible for children.

             Well there will be a lawsuit.  Let's hope it is successful.  I can't imagine that people will not be incensed over this.  Hopefully it will hit MSM.

               The rest of the children are being cared for by some social care workers.  This is not good.  They should be sent home while they are investigated.  They should not be near children.

               These are the kind of people they hire for these jobs now.  Arrogant and selfish and greedy.  And totally unfeeling.  I still haven't researched to see if they were adopted or foster kids or from a whole bunch of different fathers.  Good God.

                 It worries me they have been put in the care of caseworkers.  The very type of people that caused their suffering are now entrusted with their care.  I just can't believe this.  It is so very disconcerting.  A mother of children that had many fathers.  Her sister cared more for them than she.  Yes, those poor babies.
