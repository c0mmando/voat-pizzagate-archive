<p>Spence struck me as extremely smart and also very manipulative. He was a morass of arrogance and extreme narcissism that I had never encountered before. He indeed believed that he resided at the center of the universe, and I was merely a pawn in his grandiose game of chess. Spence certainly didn’t impart a warm and fuzzy feeling during our initial meeting. In Shakespeare’s King Lear, Gloucester and Edgar have a dialogue, and Edgar declares that the “Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.” As I departed</p>

In Shakespeare’s King Lear, Gloucester and Edgar have a dialogue, and Edgar declares that the “Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.” As I departed</p>
<p>Spence’s home that day, I felt like I had just met the Prince of Darkness. Spence continued to phone me almost everyday, and about a month after our initial meeting he again summoned me to his home. I was met at the door by one his security personnel, who escorted me into the living room, which was beautifully furnished and decorated. The living room had a glossy, hardwood floor that was adorned with exquisite oriental rugs, and its walls were garnished with high-priced neo-classical paintings. His living room also had towering bookshelves. Spence and an African-American man in his forties were reclined on the living room’s chocolate colored sofa, and I was directed to a leather chair that was adjacent to the sofa. Spence was casually dressed in designer jeans and a pink Polo shirt, and, after I sat down, he introduced me to Larry King, his African-American friend. King was rather obese, and he wore a resplendent navy blue suit that I thought was either an Armani or Brioni. He had meticulously coifed straight black hair and a trim goatee. His large-framed designer glasses had tinted lenses that partially obscured his beady, darting eyes. A thick gold chain draped his neck, and he had a bulky gold ring that was encrusted by diamonds. King exuded a pomp and flashiness that even surpassed that of Spence. Spence gave me a chilly reception as King looked on with a sinister smile. Spence then started our meeting by excoriating me, because one of my escorts had belatedly arrived at his home. I explained to him that I had taken a three-</p>
<p>day vacation, and I wasn’t able to tend to the phone with my customary alacrity. Spence snapped that if he thought I needed a vacation, he would send me on a vacation. As Spence excoriated me, he was hunched over a china bowl on the living room’s large, circular crystal coffee table. The china bowl was brimming with cocaine, and he was dipping a gold coke spoon into it. Spence eventually offered me a toot of coke, but I declined. After Spence had taken two or three toots of coke, he started to chatter about his exalted status and clout—specks of cocaine littered his mustache. King also chimed in about his exalted status and clout too. I felt like Spence was putting on a show for King, but King wasn’t an individual who acquiesced to being out-boasted. They pumped themselves up like cartoonish parade balloons that were on the brink of bursting. Although I found their boasts to be almost comedic, I refrained from laughing. <strong>King then made a number of disclosures that I found to be absolutely bizarre. He revealed that he and Spence operated an interstate pedophile network that flew children from coast-to-coast. King also discussed that he and Spence had a clientele of powerful pedophiles who actually took pleasure in murdering children. In fact, King seemed to be obsessed with the subject of murdering children. I sincerely thought that I was talking to a pair of psychotics on the run from a psychiatric hospital.</strong> After Spence and King conversed about their rarified statuses and their extreme pedophilic perversities, Spence shifted gears and started to sincerely inquire about my life.</p>
<p>He asked where I was born and where I attended college. He then questioned me about the particulars of my escort service. In the context of our earlier discussion, Spence’s questions seemed like non-sequiturs to me. Though I answered Spence’s questions truthfully, I was uncertain about the motivation for his inquiries, because Spence struck me as an individual who generally had a self-centered, utilitarian reason for every action. I also found it nearly impossible to believe that Spence’s seismic narcissism made him constitutionally capable of taking a sincere interest in me. I thought that either he had a duplicitous reason for plying me with seemingly heartfelt questions or I was witnessing a miracle tantamount to the parting of the Red Sea. As Spence inquired about my life, King sipped his drink and was ominously silent, but an unnerving smile was etched on his face. When Spence finished quizzing me about my life, he stood up and gestured for me to accompany him. I stood up and followed him. King remained seated on the sofa. Spence walked toward a large mirror that was situated on living room wall, and opened a closet door that was in the corner of his living room. He popped open a secret panel that was embedded in the closet, and he stepped into a small room that was behind the mirror. I cautiously paused at the threshold of the closet, but Spence waved his right hand, signifying that I should follow him into the surreptitious room. (continued on next page).</p>',
