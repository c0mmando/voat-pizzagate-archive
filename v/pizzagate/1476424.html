            Can you imagine the pressure he is facing?
And btw he is absolutely correct, if he says, do not focus on a few pizza shops, focus on Podesta, the Clinton Foundation connections.
Look at Norway and the pedophile ring they uncovered! Even that in Norway is much bigger than the alleged "pizza"-relations. The focus should be on organized crime, child trafficking, international pedophile rings which go to the top of the society (it's the ULTIMATE blackmail and therefore power instrument over compromised people).

            Infowars is touchy subject now, so it seems. Suppose there are too many of the mainstream presstitutes looking at it and wondering WTF, and so Alex Jones has at least twice as many enemies as he did before the 2016 elections. It's all liberal projection, very psychological, or like in the
            <em>
             le rules for radicals
            </em>
            type of memes, where it's all about falsely accusing rivals as a diversion or distraction. It's all a big reality TV show for the political end, always plays out like the liberal democrats are just supposed to sacrifice the evil racist sexist conservative republicans on the alter of some godcause after at least one million people slam down the sufficient count of iterations in the damned social engineering hashtag recursion. It's really disgusting. The behavior of the news media is gaslighting, using machines to manipulate emotions, trying to steer overton windows public opinion memes in whatever directions for their satisfactions, even the Pope is telling the news media to go eat shit and die you bastards, and they still don't get it. They still want to use Alex Jones as the token symbol of Fake News and sacrifice him to yet another godcause. How am I not the only one seeing this and gets sick of it?

            Yeah. FBI anon says that the leaked emails are being used the Clintons as a distraction. He says to focus entirely on the Clinton Foundation. Frankly, I agree. I think that most of the juiciest topics from the leaked emails have been found, and that no more big stuff are available. He says that human trafficking is a huge part of the Clinton Foundation, if I recall correctly. He insists that Hillary is a small part of the big picture..

           <p>
            2 bits of the information that caught my mind were: trafficking children was a British and Saudi [or Middle Eastern?] thing; rest of world likes grown women.

            Total speculation here, but I think his assignment is the same as Glen Beck's during America's Tea Party movement -- jump in front of the parade and keep it away from anything too ngerous.

            He's right about the fact we're being easily discredited as "a group of people who obsess about the Comet Ping Pong and the underground tunnels". 90% of the people who research pizzagate won't even make it here or to credible evidence. But other than that I don't think Jones is being helpful one bit. He's a bad journalist (if you even want to call him that) who doesn't care about providing credible sources and is running pretty much just a sensationalist outlet.
           </p>
           <p>
            But to be the Devil's Advocate: I guess he and others anticipated Pizzagate and the Fake News narrative to be tied together and used to discredit anyone who dared to cover it fully like David Seaman. Endgame for Pizzagate seems something massive like the Nuremberg trials with hundreds or even thousands of people who might be covering each others' backs. And that'd mean we're facing the most powerful group in the world which will do anything to remain just that.

            Alex Jones' primary concern is having a big audience.   Most of his decisions follow from that.   If he thinks pushing a theory will grow his audience he will push.  If he thinks it will shrink his audience he won't.   And if he can be vague and allow both his pro pizzagate and anti pizzagate fans to think he is on their side...he will do that.   It's just like with Milo.

              Alex Jones does hurt the conspiracy theory community at large, by mixing important truths with hysterical bullshit. The whole site also sold out completely on the notion of rising above divide and conquer, when they realized they could get a lot more views milking the tactic instead and churning out a bunch of very immature material mocking liberals in the wake of Trump's victory. In a last ditch effort to milk it even more, they suddenly flipped from noting the Soros-paid agitators to a shoddy piece claiming the violent protesters were communists and that it was all Bernie Sanders' fault. Yet you're here to mindlessly bark at anyone who dares criticize them. If you want to talk about "shills" look in the mirror. We don't need any trojan horses in the pizzagate investigation, and that includes people like Seaman making "he identifies with Pan the god of child rape" caliber videos.
