            Jim D. is a very serious researcher in the JFK community.  I'm not (I've taken in a lot of interviews of many people but haven't studied source materials much myself), but I do take what he says seriously, at least where JFK is concerned.  YMMV, but I don't brush off Jim D. casually.

            Everything is subjective.  Mods are always going to have to make judgment calls.  It's a very slippery slope if we allow posts based on wild speculation.  It's not suppression of speech.  If substantive evidence can be found, it can be posted here.

            rule 1, 2 every claim in your post must be sourced. We left it up for this long to see if anything would come of it. As it has not I will now go ahead and delete it as it really doesn't follow rule 2. Please repost to

            If I were to take anything from this it would be this comment:

            I think this would make for a great discussion post and might actually lead to somewhere.
            <br/>
            Cheers Will keep this angle in the back burner of my mind.

             All good, hot stuff, and grateful you kept it going for a long while. I think most folk got the gist. Truthfully, it was starting to fill up with tiresome and tautological comments. Glad it was digested by a huge majority XX

            I've watched many of the crisis actor videos, they are very convincing, begs the question who are these actors, with what's at stake it would seem that being loyal to the cause, signing secrecy docs, that sort of thing would not be enough. Would these need to be people who are blackmailed for something, kids enslaved in some way, or their parents in trouble, or brainwashed? I don't know, just seems like you can't just audition in a normal way for this sort of thing. Do any of these people have a criminal history that would make them vulnerable? Maybe they had a kid killed by guns?

             $$$$$ mortgages, college loans paid off. Blackmail, yes. People sell their grandmotherw for a dollar. Everyone has a price. EVERYONE. Even Mother Theresa was a calculating old witch. People desperate for fame, even if that means shitty acting in a  psy op. Companies that specialize in Crisis Management/Actors. No different to what you see portrayed on shows like Scandal and Ray Donovan.
Respectfully, if you could just stick to finding and posting relevant links for this thread.

              Respectfully the thread will die if you don't widen the net, very little is known about how this crisis acting works, and we're not going to find legitimate connections without going down rabbit holes, hitting dead ends, and climbing back out. It's unlikely you'll be able to connect alefantis in any meaningful way without more deeply investigating who are the players in crisis acting and how it works. As citizen investigators we're limited primarily to making associations, the hard evidence is in the money trails, phone records, etc that we don't have access to. All we can realistically hope to do is put people in the same place, in association, in activity together, close enough to create widespread demand for answers. Everything we know about pizzagate to date was found in that way. The FBIanon stuff is interesting, but none of it has led to anything concrete. We don't seem to be getting any real help from feds, perhaps the opposite. The associations should be an inroad for professional investigation, but your connection, which is a very good and likely one, has a VERY important implication, if alefantis is working with white house regarding crisis acting, then the feds have good reason to cover it up, all of it, including anything else alefantis may be involved in. If he's a key player in crisis acting they can't take him down for pedophilia if they have something on each other. They can't even suicide him if he's a key person in distribution of children involved in crisis acting, actors work for him, important properties are in his name, etc... Consequently, then pizzagate needs to go away, as instead of uncovering the elites playground, it would uncover a vast conspiracy leading directly to the POTUS re Sandy Hook et al, and everywhere the crisis actors have showed up. It would explain a lot of what we've seen in how is being managed via the MSM and fake news narrative. That would make alefantis a very powerful person indeed!

               I think you've made a very key connection her smokemirrors, this connection fits better with everything we know, sort of a unified pizzagate theory, it doesn't have the flaws the others have had, the tunnels and basements, it makes the pedophilia a sidenote, not the end game.

                Yeah, the crisis actor connection -- ifffffff it's true -- would definitely put everything in a whole new light.  The desperate panic chorus of "fake news!" from the Grand Wurlitzer would make even more sense than it already does.

            I can  tell  you  right  now,  with what I am  reading  about  the  CIA  being the  beginning and the end  of this sex slave  network  that  Alephantis  is at  least  indirectly  associated with Sandy  Hook-he  is  apparently one  of the  CIA managers  of  this  at  the  very  top-you  will  never  understand  PIZZAGATE or International  pedophilia  until  you  understand  the  CIA and  its  CENTRAL  INVOLVEMENT IN  THIS  AFFAIR

              All  of the links are  here  on VOIT re CIA,
its there if you do  the reading,  there are enough posts re:  the  CIA and their involvement on  this  board  alone  to  get  up  to  speed
there  have  been  ample  reports that  identify Alephantis (one of 50th most powerful people in DC) as a  CIA  handler, that  being the  case  his proximity to the  most powerful  people in the  world  puts  him  at the  top  of this CIA program,
if you study Sandy  Hook esp. Fetzner  this is  part  of same  group, CIA organized  crime  with these  False-Flag  shootings

               Respectfully, I would advise not using Fetzer as a source.  Read this first:
               <a href="https://kennedysandking.com/john-f-kennedy-articles/the-decline-and-fall-of-jim-fetzer">
                https://kennedysandking.com/john-f-kennedy-articles/the-decline-and-fall-of-jim-fetzer
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't agree with everything said in that article, but it does lay out ample basis for caution re: Fetzer, IMO.
              </p>
              <p>
               That said, Fetzer has put out a lot of material and tons of interviews, and there is a lot of gold in them thar hills along with the less desirable stuff.  Just be careful.

                I'll  take  a  look  at the  link,
he is  fervently ripping  Pizzagate to  the  airwaves so  that  is  good,
I am  concerned about  him  working for that CRIMINAL at Veterans  Today,  however,
otherwise  he  has been  a solid  stand-up  guy,  unless  I  see some iron proof  otherwise:)

            Watched Killswitch re SOPA and Aaron Swartz another suicided subversive. Fake News is SOPA 2.0. this seems all intertwined, crisis acting, fake news, censorship, controlling the message.

             great, but what's James Alefantis/Pizzagate's exact role. Everything you post is stuff everyone already knows. Please try to stay relevant if possible.

              Suggesting if you're looking to make connection between alefantis and crisis acting, you might find it by going back through some of the old info, his connection to film making, these properties, what are they being used for? If he is involved in the crisis acting and he has directorial experience, he may be involved in the logistics, which would have to be somewhat substantial, crisis actors would be managed in some way, as secrecy would be very important? People with certain expertise would be used? Then tapes released to news networks? Rely on compromised blackmailed persons? Just thinking through how all that would work.

            I'm wondering about the properties connected to alefantis, there have been lists posted and it's long, like twentyish houses, don't think anyone's ever followed up to see what all these properties are? Does he own rentals or safe houses or house crisis actors or hold properties in his name for other people who don't want to be connected? Owning a bunch of rentals doesn't get you to the top of Washington's most powerful list. Alefantis is a director, the guy who came into comet with a gun is an actor, here anon is loosely connecting alefantis to crisis actors, those dots do connect well in theory. Just throwing this out there, what if he is THE director, running the production company, employs and houses the crises actors, etc... Maybe a little CP and snuff on the side. The party room at comet looks kinda like a screening room, blacked out, black curtains everywhere, is there a dropdown screen we missed?

             Thanks Mtnchan. Great and thought provoking comment. I had the same 'gut' ages ago, when he first gave this ad hoc interview outside of Comet:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EyzqskdmMI">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EyzqskdmMI
             </a>
             Again, not based on anything other than my knowing a few director types. Alefan definitely has an air of 'command' about him, whether you like him or not. The 'fixer', the 'dealer' the 'crisis management' dude. What you are saying fits very well with what I'm hoping both myself and others may be able to definitively prove.

              Wouldn't prove anything, but would be nice to know if there was a projector in the back wall of the party room at comet and drop down screen. Would make more sense what they might use the room for after-hours, as opposed to going into the controversial basement. Then they're laughing at us bc we don't know how it works. There's also been some hints that off site kill rooms live feed for paid subscriber viewing? That would connect with what the local guy was accusing, people there after hours, paying for murders. Yet no one is directly connected to the crimes and nothing to clean up. Just brainstorming, totally speculative.

                Perhaps, but then that leaves all the pedophile evidence just hanging as hipster doofus shit they claim it is and I don't by that. Most of the pedophile porn in the dark web, according to articles I've read, is torture related, that seems to be a preference for pedos, so it's not out of the question. It's very possible that all of the above are true, that he is CIA involved in the crisis production bc he's a compromised leveraged blackmailed asset ie they picked him up on CP years ago and made him do the crisis thing. Friend of the elites, gets them disposable play things. There's a lot here, some of it will be true some will not be true. It's likely that perversion is a part of it.

               I recall thinking in the video where alefantis have the tour, he seemed really nervous when asked about the back room, and hustled through quickly. People thought there was something behind the curtains, another door into the tunnels, there are videos saying people were going in and not coming out, I think they were just going out the back door to the parking lot, probably even to smoke.

Thank you again.

            First off, the second video is flat out freaky. That's for adding that. Second, there was a commenter here yesterday who said that Newtown was a normal town, Adam Lanza was real and the shooting was exactly what it appeared. It reminded me of a friend who recently said she had really enjoyed visiting Clearwater FL. I asked her if she knew that Scientologists run that town and she said no. Upon reflection she was weirded out she didn't realize something was amiss. So I'm quite sure if you have a govt controlled small town that it "appears" normal and may even have "normal" people in the population who are completely unaware of what is actually going on.

            Interesting that Anderson Cooper is holding up a drawing of an owl (Owl of Minerva) at the start of the video of him.  I also wonder if Obama won't call Isis "Isis" because the elite are so fond of her. Just a thought.

            but all the psy ops, sorry I meant 'gun tragedies' have totally obviously fake crisis actors. There's a reason they didn't make it in Hollywood. Some links below, but

            Whoever  (take a guess on the 'who') is setting up all of these, counts on the majority of sheeple believing it. And for years, they have.  Think of your own relatives and friends who think youre a loon for talking about pizzagate.

            We work our asses off enforcing very four simple, important rules (1-4 are the ones most commonly broken), to keep shills from spamming this sub with useless content.  This post in particular could arguably have been deleted, but instead it was flaired.  You're very misguided if you think we're the enemy.  I also worked my ass off creating the current summary sticky.  I would have more time to work on additions to it if I wasn't having to be involved in enforcing posting rules and responding to attacks on mods.

            Wolfgang Halbig has asked under FOIA for the school records of the 26 children who went to the Super Bowl. There would need to be permissions slips signed by parents and turned into the school.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far he has been stonewalled in his efforts to obtain these documents

             http://www.rense.com/general96/whochose.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, Halbig maintains that these children have never been seen nor heard from again after this trip. Should be investigated for their proof-of-life and well being

            Certainly relevant to the pizzagate figures -- central figure -- Alefantis .... and White House visits with Obama around the time of Sandy Hook.  If Tory Smith is correct here -- there may be "hi-speed trains" North/South - East/West -- Midwest -- underground. And connecting to White House -- also close to Pentagon.

            ...    Washington, DC to LA -- 30 minutes?
Tory Smith begins somewhere around 6 minutes on video -- 
Tour of underground tunnels about 9 minutes into video.

            Why would they use the White House as a meeting point?  Let alone a trafficking point for hundreds of people?  This is just stupid and taking away from everything else.  People here are just too anxious for a new break that they'll cling to any suggestion.  This is the type of behavior that gives conspiracy theories a bad rap.

             Are you imagining that Alefantis walks into the Oval Office bringing 26 kids or so with him?
No -- go to about 6 minutes on this video --
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KnSwOQzJuA">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KnSwOQzJuA
             </a>
             If there's a Hi-speed RR as is being suggested -- DC to LA in 30 mins -- there would also be an underground area where children are kept awaiting next step in transportation.  But, let's say Alefantis comes in to see Obama to confirm they are back -- or on their way out?
             <br/>
             Btw, we'll soon be losing this Obama link -- unless somehow Trump is involved in this?
Obama has bought a house in Tony Podesta's area so presume he intends to spend some time in DC.
(Collecting money, perhaps?)
            </p>
            <p>
             After that, be sure to watch the tour of the underground areas below DC -- which also passes close to Pentagon.
That's at about 9:00 on the video.

              You omitted to say that Tory Smith is a psychic. Seems to me that it's very possible that there are underground tunnels and passage ways, even possibly train tracks under the tunnels, but to take the testimony of Smith as evidence of child trafficking, sexual abuse and murder is a bit ridiculous. Not saying that he is lying, but definitely not reliable.

               As I recall, there has been confirmation about what Tory Smith is reporting from military
whistleblowers.  But -- again, that's up to anyone looking at the video to consider for themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we also know is that our government has been totally corrupted -- 
and that the rise of the right wing has brought great violence to the world everywhere.

              <p>
               Like any other corruption, in order to exist it has to be being protected by higher ups in government.

                Me neither. I just saw him on the YT video linked above by votescam. Mr. Smith (a psychic) talks about 'visions' of 127 children being raped and killed by government, military and agencies' officials. He also names Eric Holder, Joe Biden and B. Obama as 3 of the abusers.

            Makes sense to me. If you watch the Sandy Hood news broadcast replays, you'll see Omar Mateen's dad, with his big goofy smile in the background.
           </p>
           <p>

            We need to prove that James has any connection to the actual actors/children without any separation. The children from Sandy Hook have been officially seen with Obama in the White House. We need to see the date those pictures were taken and maybe line them up and research?

             Im trying. Any pics on Alefuckers Facebook/Insta (Insta not so popular in 2013  where he might have been at Superbowl 2013 held in New Orleans? Or were any of these 'kids' spotted in the DC/Comet PP/rehearsal space or nearby, at any dates prior? What does Jennifer Hudson know?(She sang with them)
Speaking about Jennifer Hudson, something very weird about her,  too. Her mom, brother and cousin were all killed by a 'random' shooter. He claimed 'police conspiracy'....Jennifer very tight with the Obamas. Hmmm.

            I think everyone starts freaking out when we post things that are very hard for the general population to accept - sandy hook and 9/11 being false flags/planned by the Govt - is just too much for them to handle.  So they don't want to bring those topics up here so we aren't called crazy.  Reptilians is another one they don't like.  Lol.  I totally understand that one scaring people off.  But podesta, Alefantis, and wiener all look reptilian - just sayin.  But No I dont believe in aliens and I'm on the fence about sandy hook and 9/11.  I'm more convinced 9/11 was planned than I am sandy hook was

             amazing how Podesta/Alefuck/Wiener all look completely mentally dearranged and slimy as hell. Podesta is just the physical embodiment of what a creepy pedo looks like. 9/11 no question. We're all on Voat/Pizzagate because we're alt thinkers. If you were middle america saying 'conspiracy theory', I get it. But Im amazed folk who chose to gather here don't see the 100% clear psy op that is Sandy Hook.

               Im looking forward to the 9/11 uprising. Have you been to the 9/11 museum in New York? Take a vomit bucket with you. Don't even ask how much this scam 'non-profit' (lol) is making. This is not the thread for that conversation.

                I haven't been, but their putting a mosque in the place of the towers is quite Suspect.  This globalism movement is frightening.  Kerry's speech yesterday was ludicrous and all the while McCain is harping on punishing Russia?!!  They are begging for wars.  They're already responsible for Iraq, Syria, and Libya.  They're fanning the flames in an effort to destabilize Israel and they're pushing Putin's buttons for no freaking reason.  Next up they'll go poking the crazies in North Korea.  How the public can't see through this or at least question it is mind boggling.  Obama is kicking his globalism agenda into high gear while people are on holiday not noticing.  Then when the poop hits the fan under Trump's watch, they zombies will all blame Trump because they weren't paying attention this week.

             More than the obvious acting here, what further shocks me is that a mom and her kid are just calmly standing outside a school where 20 kids have just been massacred instead of you know GETTING THE FUCK OUT OF THERE.

              On a good amount of those the signals are in motion after the child said the lines. Like, the kid says a line about stomachs hurting, and then the ladies to the motions.

               I noticed the same thing.  Still, the actions of the mom are a bit strange and do seem like they could be cuing.  Maybe it's a bit of both: the mom gives cues when she's not sure the girl will remember, but the girl remembers most of the time just as the motions are occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
               Total speculation, obviously.  The emotional valence of the girl is the really blatant "tell" here; that kid is not acting like a normal kid who just went through a traumatic event involving multiple deaths -- at least IMO.

              I'd have to disagree, this feels more like speculation without further facts to back it up.  Other pizzagate related material is support by facts, even if they are circumstantial they are abundant and overwhelming.  Obviously we should consider every lead, but not ever lead will pan out as some sort of smoking gun or truth.  Some rabbit holes end, some go on to other tunnels.  It does not do anyone any good to find an end of a rabbit hole only to keep digging saying it has to be true.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are some things that are connected, as is pizzagate, some things are not connected, not every ill in the world can be traced back to the origins of pizzagate, clintons, podesta, etc.  Sometimes random shit happens and strange links will occur even when they are disconnected.  This background noise exist in all events and people.  Everyone of us here would likely have some first or secondary connection to pizzagate at some point in their lives, but it doesn't make you part of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              What you have to do is look for the connections of circumstantial evidence that greatly outweigh that background noise.  Leave no stone unturned, but bringing back every pebble of sand from the beach saying each are a smoking gun just makes every grain of sand worthless.

              Honestly, I think half the stuff that has been reaching the front page of this sub is shill material there to piss in the pool and murky the waters.  There isn't just CTR here, you have some intel folks here as well.

               I'm not discussing this in the capacity of a mod.  I'm just challenging what seemed like yet another unwarranted attack on the mods, which is irresponsible and has been done by shills on here since Day 1, as part of their "deny, disrupt, discourage" strategy.

               No sarcasm. That actually made me feel better. Sometimes you get these convictions, and you're desperate to share, and have others see exactly what you see. Then a bunch of randos pour shit on you and its deflation. Thanks again, LoiturdFerguson.

             This sub is going downhill fast if you are getting that many upvotes for implying the mods are compromised because one of them flaired this for relevance.  The only evidence OP offers is that Alefantis visited the white house a couple days before and after Sandy Hook.  It's an extremely loose connection.  Ockham's Razor would suggest it's a coincidence.  I didn't flair the post, but I agree with whoever did. They exercised restraint by not just deleting it.   I don't see the reasoning for connecting Sandy Hook and pizzagate.  If someone has more evidence, please share it.

              You sound hurt. Can I help? 1. You infer what is not implied. A simple question is not an accusation. If voat's voting system works, what have you to worry about? 2. Sometimes leads are thin, this doesn't mean they should be negated. To say that Alefantis visited the White House two days before they served pizza at the U.S. Embassy in Turkey would be a 'loose connection.' The relevance is clear in this case. 3. The restraint was appreciated by the community. The power mods have is to be used with wisdom; which I see lacking in many respects. 4. If Sandy Hoax can be connected to Alefantis or any portion of Pizzagate, even if it were for comic value it would still be worth investigating. The reasoning is clear; to find out how far this goes and bring it down. Simple.

               Shills have been attacking the mods on here from Day 1, part of their "disrupt, deny, discourage" strategy.  There is plenty of reason to be concerned.  They upvote brigade their own concern-troll posts to try to create a bandwagon effect by creating a false sense that the userbase here agrees with their attacks.

             yeah, but look at it from the mod's point of view. they are few, and posts are many.

             if this thing escalates to Sandy Hook, and then to Crisis Actors -- when do you call halt? When do you stop saying, Oh My? If there are pictures to tie these together, especially the "before" pictures/footage -- damn. That's pretty tight. along with the donation webpages that went up immediately. IF you can tie the kids to CPP, you tie the kids to Obama and the place he chose for political phone bank operations. Underneath, rats scurry around in a haunted tunnel system.

             Yeah, even though this is almost equally disturbing. I read the article in a Swedish newspaper, and in that they sympathizes with refugees during this "chaos" over there. This is what they do, Obama and his Muslim friends are spreading propaganda terrorist attacks so they can justify the spread of Islam. How many hoaxes have we already seen that where staged?

               There is this strange desire among some posters here to not be "marginalized". They think that if we don't entertain points of data that seem a bit too "far reaching" that somehow the established media will take all of this pizzagate stuff seriously. That's why if you connect some seemingly unrelated dots that the accusations of being shill may follow.
              </p>
              <p>
               If it's any comfort, this name calling probably comes with the best intentions. But I find it strange that people think that the same media which has been covering up for pedophiles will somehow get on our side. It's laughable. The media would gladly fake a news story to discredit us, we cannot ever rely on them.
              </p>
              <p>
               For what it's worth, I think you may very well be on to something so keep digging. I'll do what I can to help.

                Can't thank you enough, FormerBaltimoreRes. Ive contributed much to Voat and always try to stay respectful. We're all here because we're alt thinkers so I just don't understand the accusations of 'shill' when I'm posting what aims to be undeniable causal connections.
If people don't like it or can't think of anything original to contribute, they can fuck off back to the Kardashians. 
Edit: apologies if this sounds too ranty.
