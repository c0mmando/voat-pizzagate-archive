            AIPAC owns the entire USA-GOV. Fact.
How did that come about? Because AIPAC has dirt on all USA polticians. How did that come about? Because AIPAC finds out the deviancy of every pol in the USA and fulfill's his/her need and then blackmails them.
           </p>
           <p>
            AIPAC didn't exists prior to 1963, prior to 1963 there was "Israel Affairs", the day after JFK died, they renamed themselves to AIPAC.
           </p>
           <p>
            AIPAC is not a friend of the USA, AIPAC is a standing army that assassinated JFK and filled  WASH-DC with their compromised men.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today all USA politicians are controlled by AIPAC. That control is by sex, all child fucking in wash-dc are AIPAC service providers.

            Look at the modlog (submissions deleted by the mods)
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/modlog/submission?page=1">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/modlog/submission?page=1
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Even submissions with a positive vote rating are deleted.  Such as this very post (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1440248">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1440248)
            </a>
            ). This is an attempt by the mods to control the narrative.  They're telling us what we can and can't see instead of letting us choose ourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now in case you haven't noticed there has been a massive push to censor people on the grounds of anti-Semitism " and the mods are deleting submissions that reference Judaism. You can clearly see by referencing the modlog in the link above that there's a clear theme to the deleted submissions.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's definitely some shilling going on here.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days ago it came to light that some users had the intention of exposing the Jewish links to Pizzagate and begun doing so. Then there was a bunch of people complaining about " antisemitism" and a bunch of shills calling to ban " antisemitism". The next day /Pizzagate appointed 9 new mods and now they're deleting all submissions that reference Judaism or Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's still a push to outright ban " antisemitic" users.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything I just laid out is entirely accurate. I'm not assuming anything and I can do a bit more research and link to everything but if you look at the modlog and what's in it you'll see what I mean. There is a push to ban " antisemitism" in an attempt to disassociate Judaism with Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            As one user had mentioned, "Satanism is a wing of Judaism. Judaism is the mother of all Abrahamic religions. Pizzagate is nothing new,it's an established and historically documented Jewish occultic practice called Blood Libel which is part of Talmudic doctrine. The Talmud is Judaism and it's what Rabbis study. "
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why we are seeing a clear push to ban antisemitism. The subverse has been compromised by people who wish to damage control for Judaism.
           </p>
           <p>
            How do we deal with rogue mods? I guess the subversives can hide behind free speech, but what do we do about the mods that are suppressing free speech and trying to deprive the community of information they deem " offensive" ? We cannot allow political correctness to constrain the truth. What do we do in circumstances like this where we can clearly discern that mods are potentially compromised?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:
           </p>
           <p>
            Even this submission was deleted. Unbelievable.  This subverse is compromised,  or at least the mods.  I will keep reposting to show people how some mods are clearly working against the community and impeding our research.

            I want to say those who think Trump will enable this to come to light: don't bet on it. I'm pissed at myself for not recalling the source, but one youtube vid had a list of political donations to comet pizza (like that aint weird enough?) - Clinton was about $9500 but Trump WAS on the list at about $1500. Now, it could be innocent, like his minders have told him 'this Alefantis guy is a DC player and if you want access to him we need to throw him a bone' - a lot of that goes on in washington, right? But until that's verified and cleared (any other investigators more meticulous than I care to fill my blanks) we gotta hedge our bets as to whether Trump is friend or foe on this

            But the mods here ARE out of control.
Look at removed submissions

           <p>
            They came from reddit and it is understandable that they are fucking spergs who do not trust the voting system to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop removing stop banning let the system work.
If it is trolls users will down voat them to oblivion. No need to removal.
So STOP IT!

             just assign a flair or tag or whatever it's called instead of deleting comments? That would stop people from whining and filter out information for researchers

            I think this a the only way to get the elites beast system down, pedophilia is a disgusting act for 99% of the population, the NYT, WashingtonPost, even french news are covering this up, this a premiere..
           </p>
           <p>
            Since when the MSM try to defend a random pizzaiollo?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or why is there so much reactions from the social media and internet moguls? I mean getting Tweeter and Eddit exposed, Google and FB in full damage control....
           </p>
           <p>
            This is huge, if we expose the inner rules of the gang THEY ARE DONE! Just my two Satoshis

            Remember, don't consider any information unless it confirms what you already believe. It is predominantly important that you burry your head into the ground and then declare to everyone else that you know the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fight the good fight. Expose the evils which lurk among us. But do not shun information which does not conform to your world view. A good detective is open to all information while being able to decern the truth from the lies. This is your task.
