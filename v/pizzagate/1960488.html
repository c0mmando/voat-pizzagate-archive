            As part of their investigation into the Westminster paedophile network, the 60 Minutes team spoke to the controversial figure who believes having sex with children should be legal.
“I don’t think I have ever seen an unrepentant paedophile speaking candidly about their beliefs and their lusts before,” Mr Coulthart told news.com.au ahead of the program. “It really is very confronting because you realise in their own minds they genuinely believe that what they are doing is not wrong.
“One of the arguments that he makes is that the trauma that children suffer when they have sex with adults is not caused by having sex with adults. He claims the trauma is caused by the fuss that is made by police, parents and by government agencies and he says if paedophiles were just left alone to have sex with kids everything would be fine because children can consent to sexual relations.
“It’s a huge dilemma for us as parents and as citizens. How do we deal with people like this? When you meet one face-to-face defending his beliefs arguing that’s perfectly reasonable for children to be allowed to consent to have sex with adults, you realise that children have to be protected from people like that.”
           </p>
           <p>
            While the allegations against at least 10 current and former MPs and subsequent cover-ups are so explosive that it eventually led to a British parliamentary inquiry, Mr Coulthart says it should be front page news almost every day, yet he says it isn’t.
“I have been gobsmacked that this has not been a front page daily news scandal,” Mr Coutlhart said. “One of the reasons why we decided to do this story was because we couldn’t believe that so much of the English media wasn’t. I think to a large degree a large percentage of the British media has been complicit in covering it up.
“There’s been stories we’ve been told about of stories being pulled from the media. It is the very worst tradition of British establishment political corruption. The institutions of state have been corrupted in order to protect the rich and powerful.”

             The OTO runs parts of the Australian police now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, British political corruption is obvious. Why didn't this Australian new outlet look into how the OTO runs their own police force? Limey-bashing is too easy. If the UK people tried to reclaim their own country, the US Air Force would bomb them. There are no obvious solutions when your enemy owns everything.

             Any peep from Australian journos on the Netherlands legalising adults having sex with 12 year olds? Or is that somehow okay? Do they only have a chip on their shoulder with Brits?
