&quot;Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems &gt; pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you’re &gt; busy, so feel free not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it. &quot;</p>
<p>Of course, this has become a famous quote. However, after rereading it, I wondered who the realtor was that found the handkerchief. I looked through the rest of the email and found the link: <a href="http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=29">http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=29</a> The realtor company appears to be KENDALL AND KENDALL. I remembered that The Folger family (as in Izette Folger, BFF of Alefantis) had an ancestor who was an original settler there. On a whim, I searched KENDALL AND KENDALL FOLGER MARTHA\'S VINEYARD. I didn\'t find a link for the two, but I found interesting info on a local Kendall family: <a href="https://www.nct-archive.org/local-history/new-england-and-the-south/">https://www.nct-archive.org/local-history/new-england-and-the-south/</a>  I don\'t know if the realtors are related to this historic family, but they did have many homes, one being in Boston, MA. </p>
<p>This New England family appears to have generational elite creds:
<a href="https://www.nct-archive.org/kendall-plimpton-family-history/">https://www.nct-archive.org/kendall-plimpton-family-history/</a></p>
<p>The most famous member was &quot;Henry Plimpton Kendall (1878–1959), founder of the Kendall Company.&quot;
 According to the website, &quot; Henry P. Kendall was a prominent industrialist and an influential shaper of textile industry policy in the first half of the twentieth century. He was also a pioneer in the field of Scientific Management and in worker welfare and collaborative labor relations.  A respected advisor, he volunteered his services to educational institutions, the state of Massachusetts, and the federal government, where he served President Franklin D. Roosevelt as chair of the Business Advisory Council.  A generous philanthropist, he supported multiple educational, religious and cultural institutions, work that was carried on after his death by the Henry P. Kendall Foundation. A man of many interests, he was an accomplished outdoorsman and sailor, as well as a collector and preserver of historical and cultural materials.&quot;
&quot;The Kendall Company produced Curity medical and health textiles and Bike elastic webbing, along with a variety of other domestic and industrial textile-based products.&quot; 
&quot;He remained actively involved in the Kendall Company until shortly before his death in 1959. The company eventually merged into the Colgate Palmolive Company in 1972...&quot;
<a href="https://www.nct-archive.org/henry-p-kendall/">https://www.nct-archive.org/henry-p-kendall/</a></p>
<p>After the Civil War, the new Northern industrialists made their way south to set up new cotton mills to take advantage of cheap labor and land. Evidently, the Kendall Company had a mill in PELZER, SOUTH CAROLINA.
<a href="https://www.nct-archive.org/kendall-company/">https://www.nct-archive.org/kendall-company/</a></p>
<p>I remembered that there had been past Voat posts regarding the suspected CIA fronted pedo ring called &quot;the Finders&quot;. There was mention of a Pelzer, S.C. connection, but no further info. I managed to locate the original info dump this came from: 
<a href="https://pastebin.com/DE8X7qa9">https://pastebin.com/DE8X7qa9</a></p>
<p>The town is listed all the way at the bottom, with no explanation.
I then decided to check the sex offender registry for the town. The results were QUITE INTERESTING!</p>

            <p>
             I researched Pelzer, S.C. crime rate and found this:
            </p>
            <p>
             Pelzer, SC	population: 44	 violent crime: 637 	property crime: 4,115	total crime: 4,752
ALL STATISTICS ARE / 100,000 PEOPLE.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Next I decided to see if there was a prison located there.
THERE IS. Perry Correctional Institution with "Sex offender treatment programs."
             <a href="http://www.doc.sc.gov/institutions/perry.html">
              http://www.doc.sc.gov/institutions/perry.html

            </p>
            <p>
             HOWEVER, its jail population is greater than 40 or 90.
The page of registered sex offenders for the area all had STREET ADDRESSES.

             <p>
              With these stats, it's possible that there is a sex offender treatment program in the community:
             </p>
             <p>
              "The sentencing and management of sex offenders is one of the most difficult and controversial issues facing the criminal justice system today. This is in large part due to the brutal nature of many sex crimes and the fact that many victims are children and other vulnerable people— a combination that elicits highly emotional responses from the public."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The increasing reliance on incarceration as a response to sex offenses, together with expanded definitions of what constitutes a sex offense, has driven up criminal justice costs. This has led some states to reconsider their response to sex offenders. While concerns of public safety and the protection of victims remain the primary focus, a number of states—especially those with limited resources—have concluded that incarceration is simply not a viable long-term solution, at least not for all sex offenders.
In fact, most people who are convicted of a sex offense will be placed under community supervision at some point—either on probation immediately following sentencing or on parole after having served a jail or prison term. A 1997 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that of the approximately 234,000 adult sex offenders who are under the custody or control of correctional agencies on any given day in the United States, almost 60 percent are under some form of community supervision.5 Although there has been no follow-up study in recent years, this number has likely grown."

             </p>
             <p>
              In my opinion, this info strengthens the connection of Pelzer with the "Finder" info dump I posted.
Certain elites/agencies might find these people useful.

            that Pelzer sex offender stat is wild...64 registered sex offenders out of a population of 91??  obviously something is up there.  most likely some kind of statistical abnormality, but who knows, maybe it's Pedosberg, USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            that being said, i'm still not sure if there's enough here yet to really connect this to anything related to the abuse and trafficking of children by the global elite (Rule 1).
           </p>
           <p>
            also the title doesn't satisfy the requirements of Rule 3.  since we are unfortunately unable to edit titles, i suggest a self-delete and a repost in

             Here's an example of a child molestation/murder case from 1913 which took place in an Atlanta pencil factory that hired children:
"On April 27, 1913, 13-year-old Mary Phagan was found dead in an Atlanta pencil factory, beaten, bludgeoned, raped/sodomized, and strangled by Jewish factory owner Leo Frank, also head of the local B’nai B’rith. Little Mary was an attractive white, Christian girl who earned a weekly wage of $4.05 putting erasers on pencils. One Saturday when the factory was calm due to a town parade (Confederate Memorial Day), Mary visited it one last time to retrieve her paycheck from Frank at his request.  The next morning factory watchman Newt Lee walked to the basement where he discovered Phagan’s bloody body, a cord wrapped around her neck, her underwear lying loose around her throat, and bite marks on her skin. Her clothes were neatly cut exposing her genitals and one breast, and other bodily signs indicated rape and molestation. The experts concluded that this was the work of a pervert. Frank was detained on April 29 and was indicted by a grand jury for murder on May 24, 1913."

             After looking through the current posted titles, I'm a little confused by your (rule 3) comment. Could you suggest an appropriate title?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't see how this post violates Rule 1. I thought the premise of pizzagate is "crowdsourcing the truth". The power of this format is having access to multitudes of individuals who can add "pieces to the puzzle" in a short time. I said that I did not have definitive links to the factual evidence. THAT IS WHY I POSTED IT. I was hoping to get some help in investigating these promising leads. "The Finders" and Pelzer, S.C. have certainly been discussed here before. I respectfully ask that you consider removing the 24 hour warning.
Also, I have driven by the exit to Pelzer, S.C. off of Interstate 85, a major east coast road that extends into Florida. It is in an isolated rural area. In the past, the early Southern cotton mills used child labor.

              That's why I gave the population link.  64 offenders out of a population of 91. "national average of 16.06 Sex Offenders per 10,000 residents." 64 divided by 16.06 = 3.99 (4). 4 times 10,000 = 40,000. There would have to be a population of 40,000 for the 64 offenders to fall into the AVERAGE range. The statistic is not off.
             </p>
             <p>
              Could you give a link to the realtor's name? These old New England elites keep the bloodline going.

               This ratio is impossible.  You would need far more than 64 out of 91 to achieve it.

                I did the math and it is correct. The ratio is of offenders to total residents COMPARED TO the average ratio, which is 16.06 offenders / 10,000 residents.

                You failed to give a link to the name of the involved real estate agent. WHY?

                 Your math still makes no sense.  In the ratio of a part to the total the part can never be greater than the total.

                 I wonder if Pelzer has some sort of sex offender clinic there.   There's a forensic pyscholologist who lives there.

                  What you aren't getting is that it is being compared to the ratio of 16.06/ 10,000 (average pedo rate)
64/91 is WAY OVER THAT RATIO.
Show me your math. Back up what you are saying.
Who is the involved real estate agent?  Is their last name Kendall?
