            I've been looking into this as well. John Conditt was sentenced to 12 yrs in prison in 2001. He retired in 1999 from the FBI. In 2001 Mark Conditt would've been 6 yrs old, based on HS grad tweet by his mom. Victim of John Conditt was a six year old girl. I'm thinking girl being same age as Mark may have been friend or school mate. Mark was homeschooled but was he always? Was he homeschooled to protect him from kids calling him out about his dad's crime of pedophilia? Someone said Mark's dad's name is Pat. But Pat is a common nickname that doesn't always mean Patrick. I have a relative that goes by Pat and his name is Marvin. My brother goes by Pete but his name is Allen. I find the more I look into things the more curious things get. Also, how could someone being chased by cops set off a bomb BEFORE crashing? Wondering if bomb was planted in car and detonated to kill Mark as patsy perp. John Conditt would've been released in 2013 if he served his full term. Mark would've been 18 at the time. I don't like this whole storyline being promoted. This kid had help or was set up. Thoughts?

             UPVoat!  Phenomenal Research!  I found this statement  here
             <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/03/mark-anthony-conditt-austin-bomber-bombing-suspect-name/">
              https://heavy.com/news/2018/03/mark-anthony-conditt-austin-bomber-bombing-suspect-name/

             It says these blasts were powerful.  If they were that powerful why as you say were not windows blown out of the car or more damage.  All I see is that the back doors of the car were open, but maybe those were opened by LE and not even blown open.  No serious damage to the car that can be seen.  Also,  again we see this:  The second explosion occurred on March 12 about 6:45 a.m. in the 4800 block of Oldfort Hill Drive, authorities said. It happened in a single-family house and appears to have been caused by a package that was placed on the porch. The explosion caused “significant” damage to the home, Police Chief Brian Manley said.  SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE to the home.  Again, something is off regarding the condition of his Pathfinder.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We did have one officer who was injured when that bomb detonated as he approached the vehicle, suffering minor injuries and we had one officer who fired his weapon at the suspect,” Manley said.   Officer outside of the car was injured from the bomb detonated by the bomber from inside the car, but yet no damage to the car that we can see.  Also is there a bullet hole in the windshield or any windows from the shots fired at the suspect by that officer?  Can't see all the windows, but really they should be shattered by the IED that went off inside the car.
            </p>

             He is a conservative, which he himself stated.  He is against free abortion and gay marriage.  So why this?  "we should do away with sex offender registration" ???  Very strange, unless yes, he is trying to protect someone in his family that was arrested or sex abuse. Possibly it was either the father or did he have an uncle that was a brother of his mom or dad?  Yes, I also agree he may have been taken out of school and home schooled to protect him from possible bullying.  It is also pretty strange that the pics of him with the wig on were not able to zoom in, cameras are so hi-tech now.  Notice how blurred his face is.
            </p>

             The ticket in DC given to his mother.  Where was the trial or hearing for John Conditt?  Was he in a federal prison in DC?  Did she attend the trial or hearing?  Have not looked into this yet.  All for now but must say there are way too many unanswered questions regarding this young man.  My take on it is that he very affected by something in order to be against the sex offender registry, which does not all all align with his conservative views.

             If nothing else, where is the blood from the IED detonation?  Ever see what happens when someone sets off a shrapnel loaded IED in close prox to a body?  It makes a mess.  If it was big enough to kill him, it would have fucked that car up 8 ways to Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can say from observation that about 200g of HE (TNT, RDX, C4) detonated inside a sealed vehicle will open it up like a Jiffy Pop pan.  While suspect was probably not using HE, the explosion still would have been big enough to blow out all the windows on that Pathfinder.

             Mom is Danene A Conditt (nee Bjerkeng); family ties in MN (sister(s) I believe). Father is reported as William Patrick Conditt. Has former address in SLC Utah way back. Of interest, Danene has a traffic ticket in the DC area from the year 2000.

             John Conditt, Jr. (still not sure if related) has a son, Brent Conditt, who currently lives in Fredericksburg VA (DC suburb). has also lived in Alexandria &amp; Stafford VA.

             Property records show Mark and William Conditt bought this property in early 2017. Note: when looking up street address of 403 N. 2nd St., the address won't come up in database search. Search by last name only brought up this info I linked.

            There was a congressman named Gary Conditt that was accused of murdering his lover, a much younger woman named Chandra Levy. So, the name isn't all that uncommon and yes, it could definitely be a coincidence.

            As others pointed out, the overall vote count is really low, too low, except for undeniable statements like Blacksmith's quote that now has 13. This is just like reddit in the old days. Very suspicious.

            I am requesting that the City of Austin ask Brian Manley to resign, this is not the first time that he has been untruthful when it comes to officer involved shootings. There was a previous incident in Austin on 04/07/2017, with victim Lawrence Parrish.

                They claim it needs adjustment but it never seems to get fixed.  It happens when you edit after you post.  Very confusing, indeed.

            I believe this report is important.  I believe I may have discovered why they are making an example of Conditt besides the bombs and his blowing himself up He was a conservative that was against the gay life style and something else    PLEASE READ:

            Homosexuality is not natural. Just look at the male and female bodies. They are obviously designed to couple. The natural design is apparent. It is not natural to couple male with male and female with female. It would be like trying to fit two screws together and to nuts together and then say, “See, it’s natural for them to go together.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, political protection of a sexual practice is ludicrous. I do not believe it is proper to pass laws stating that homosexuals have ‘rights.’ What about pedophilia or bestiality? These are sexual practices. Should they also be protected by law? If homosexuality is protected by law, why not those as well?
           </p>

            These are Shocking Statements.

              What I am saying is that maybe this is the reason they created the FF.  To spew out their hatred of conservatives.  Also to turn as tmany as they can against this group.  I find that they seem to like to advertise the home school factor including others like LGBTQ as well.  I don't know if they used an entirely different person and gave him that name or if that really was his name,  the MK Ultra factor could be at play here again.

            In Austin they are reporting that the bomber was a gymnast, I'm wondering if he has been molested like all those girl gymnast had...seems to go along with the whole coach Polanski crap...all the same circle of people

             As BChapman151 posted....where is the blood.  I've seen what IEDs do to people.  There isn't a drop of blood to be seen on the Pathfinder.  LMAO.

              I have been posting this same observation on Reddit. All windows blown out but the front windshield, not a drop of blood. Front windshield cracked. Geraldo on Hannity gleefully reporting on scene having odd conversation about the 25 minute video the ‘bomber’ recorded. Officials decided he said there was only 6 bombs on this video, so...yup, must not be anymore. This kid either just got killed, or won the FBI witness protection program!

              Yeah your right about that...I think that was nothing more than a round up...the goodwill is right next to a TOXLAB and a preschool that seem to be closed now...maybe just until they are finished investigating

             Thanks for letting us know. There is nothing we can do about it but wait for PuttItOut to fix it. Mods have no power over the codebase, as I am sure you are well aware.

              OK...  yes.. this glitch is site wide and the implications are yet to be realized.

            Oh my God.  I was just looking into this case.  It has bothered me from day 1.  Everyday I watch the typical group of LEOs that we have been seeing on the news almost every couple weeks.  Suicide in front of the WH, Parkland Shooting, Now this.  They all put up a front.  Yeah.  Very Odd Indeed.  I will look into this.

            Very interesting.I am always looking for connections when we have shootings and now bombings. I wonder if any of the victims were targeted because of a pizzagate connection as well.

            Edward Rodgers was in charge of investigating cases of Child Abuse at the FBI

Sisters win sex lawsuit vs. dad $2.3 million given for years of abuse 
By Howard Prankratz 
Denver Post Legal Affairs Writer
           </p>
           <p>
            Two daughters of former state and federal law enforcement official Edward Rodgers were awarded $2.319,400 yesterday, after a Denver judge and jury found that the women suffered years of abuse at the hands of their father.
           </p>
           <p>
            The award to Sharon Simone, 45, and Susan Hammond, 44, followed testimony of Rodgers’ four daughters in person or through depositions, describing repeated physical abuse and sexual assaults by their father from 1944 through 1965.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rodgers, 72, who became a child abuse expert after retiring from the FBI and joining the colorado Springs DA’s office, failed to appear for the trial. But in a deposition taken in March, Rodgers denied ever hitting or sexually abusing his children.
           </p>
           <p>
            He admitted that he thought of himself as a "domineering s.o.b. who demanded strict responses from my children, strict obedience." But it never approached child abuse, Rodgers said. "Did I make mistakes? Damn right I did, just like any other father or mother..."
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas Gresham, Rodger’s former attorney, withdrew from the case recently after being unable to locate his client. Rodgers recently contacted one of his sons from a Texas town along the Mexican border. Gresham said his last contact with Rodgers was on April 24.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sisters reacted quietly to the verdict, and with relief that their stories of abuse had finally been told.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I feel really good that I’ve gone public with this,"Hammond said. "I am a victim, the shame isn’t mine, the horror happened to me. I’m not bad. 
"My father did shameful and horrible things to me and my brothers and sisters. I don’t believe he is a shameful and horrible man, but he has to be held accountable," Hammond added.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawsuit deeply divided the Rodgers family, with Rodgers’ three sons questioning their sister’s motives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Immediately after the verdict, son Steve Rodgers, 37, reacted angrily, yelling at his sisters in the courtroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, Rodgers said he loves his father and stands by him. He said his sisters had told him their father had to be exposed the way Nazi war criminals have been exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In a way I’m angry with my father for not being here. But I’m sympathetic because he would have walked into a gross crucifixion," Rodgers said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Steve Rodgers never denied that he and his siblings were physically abused, but disputed that his father molested his sisters. 
Before the jury’s award, Denver District Judge William Meyer found that Rodger’s conduct toward Simone and Hammond was negligent and "outrageous."
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the length of time since the abuse, the jury determined the sisters could legally bring the suit. The statute of limitations for a civil suit is two years, but jurors determined that the sisters became aware of he nature and extent of their injury only within the last two years, during therapy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The jury then determined the damages, finding $1,240,000 for Simone and 1,079,000 for Hammond.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sisters had alleged in their suit filed last July that Rodgers subjected his seven children to a "pattern of emotional, physical, sexual and incestual abuse."
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result of the abuse, the women claimed their emotional lives had been left in a shambles, requiring extensive therapy for both and repeated hospitalizations of Hammond, who was acutely suicidal. Simone developed obsessive behavior and became so unable to function she resigned a position with a Boston-based college.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the judgment yesterday, Rodgers cannot be criminally charged. the statue of limitations in Colorado for sexual assault on children is 10 years. 
Rodgers, who worked for the FBI for 27 years, much of it in Denver, became chief investigator for the district attorney’s office in Colorado Sp;rings. during his employment at the DA’s office from 1967 until 1983, he became a well-known figure in Colorado Springs, and lectured and wrote about child abuse both locally and nationwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            He wrote a manual called " A Compendium -- Child Abuse by the National College of District Attorney’s," and helped put together manuals on child abuse for the New York state police and a national child abuse center.

            Associated Press Writer
           </p>
           <p>
            WASHINGTON (AP) - The former chief internal watchdog at the FBI has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 6-year-old girl and has admitted he had a history of molesting other children before he joined the bureau for what became a two-decade career.
           </p>
           <p>
            John H. Conditt Jr., 53, who retired in 2001, was sentenced last week to 12 years in prison in Tarrant County court in Fort Worth, Texas, after he admitted he molested the daughter of two FBI agents after he retired. He acknowledged molesting at least two other girls before he began his law enforcement career, his lawyer said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conditt sought treatment for sex offenders after his arrest last year, said his attorney, Toby Goldsmith.
           </p>
           <p>
            <code>
             The problem these people have is they don't really feel like it is their fault,'' Goldsmith said.
            </code>
            The treatment doesn't work unless you admit you are the one who instigated it, and he did that.''
           </p>
           <p>
            Conditt headed the internal affairs unit that investigates agent wrongdoing for the Office of Professional Responsibility at FBI headquarters in Washington from 1999 until his retirement in June 2001, the FBI said. He wrote articles in law enforcement journals on how police agencies could effectively investigate their own conduct.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI officials said Tuesday they had no information to suggest that Conditt had any problems during his career and he was never the subject of an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Mitch Poe, who prosecuted the case, said he wanted a longer prison sentence and was skeptical of Conditt's claim that his molestation of children subsided during his FBI career.
           </p>
           <p>
            ``Both myself and the judge in open court, we were kind of skeptical but we don't have any evidence,'' Poe said.
           </p>
           <p>
            A recently retired FBI whistleblower who brought allegations to Conditt's office that agents had not aggressively pursued evidence of sexual abuse in Indian country said Tuesday she now questions whether his personal history affected that decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            <code>
             Before, it never made any sense,'' retired agent Jane Turner said of the FBI's decision to decline to further investigate her allegations.
            </code>
            Now I can understand. Why in the world wouldn't you want to investigate that?''
           </p>
           <p>
            Goldsmith said he was concerned about the safety of his client in prison given that he is a former FBI agent and an admitted child molester. ``He's not going to be comfortable in the penitentiary,'' the lawyer said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Goldsmith said his client had admitted that he had molested at least two other girls before he became an FBI agent more than 30 years ago, but that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing while he served in the bureau.
           </p>
           <p>
            ``It seems that he never did because he had stricter control at that time,'' the lawyer said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conditt could have faced life in prison, and prosecutors requested he get 50 years. The judge sentenced him to 12 years in prison, in part citing Conditt's decision to spare the victim the trauma of a trial, Goldsmith said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conditt's conviction is the latest controversy to strike the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last year, FBI Director Robert Mueller transferred the head of the office to another supervisory assignment outside Washington, three months after rebuking him for his conduct toward a whistleblower.
           </p>
           <p>
            That whistleblower, John Roberts, alleged the FBI disciplinary office had a double standard that let supervisors off easier than rank-and-file agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those allegations prompted investigations by Congress and the Justice Department inspector general. The inspector general concluded that there was no systematic favoritism of senior managers over rank-and-file employees but that there was a double standard in some cases involving crude sexual jokes and remarks.

             Please read what i just posted.  I think it may possibly be tied to the sexual assaults.  Is this Conditt connected to Mark?  See Mark's views on sexuality and what he says about pedophilia and bestiality.  They may be the reasons they have created this whole False Flag.  To point out that this guy's views and connection to his being a conservative and that he did something so heinous.  Will they try to connect it to the LGBTQ Cause?  I think so.

              Didn't they try to do the same thing with the Pulse Nightlub shooter Omar Mateen?  He was an Afghan national.  Most likely Pashtun heritage.  That gives it a pretty high chance he liked the bung.  Islam + American Freedom + Bung = Repressed homo-rage.

               Lot's of crude stuff involved in what we have researched.  This is just another one.  M Conditt also was home schooled.  This fits right into the plan.  Bad Conservatives, Home schooling is bad, look what he did, he was home schooled, Conservatives hate gays and abortion and look what they can do.  Also the pedophile statement.

              A) You'd be fucking amazed at some of the scum that gets past the gates.  B) Conditt was retired at the time of the allegations.  C) I'm sure he took a 30 year hiatus from kiddie diddling.
             </p>
             <p>
              Someone should put a bullet behind his ear.  I have the feeling the whole Mueller-Bulger-Conditt-CIA Boston drug trade thing is about to pop like a pus filled zit.  J. Edgar Hoover is probably rolling over in his Liberace-inspired casket (I made that up)

               I am just starting to investigate things from pizzagate and everyday since then I have to pray for the world. I am not kidding. I first heard about everything by reading David McGowan's information then I found this place.I recently was reading about Steven Stayner a boy who was kidnapped in Yosemite park. So he lived with a pedophile for 7 years and then escaped when the pedo wanted him to help abduct another boy But here s the creepy thing while he was gone with the pedo, his biological uncle who did time for pedo shit was molesting Steven's older brother, and Steven's dad was molesting his daughters stevens sisters. Around the time of his disappearance, his older brother Cary started having fantasies about hurting women. Fast forward 9 years later Steven is killed in a hit and run, the Uncle who molested his older brother Cary is murdered and then a year after that Cary is arrested as the Yosemite serial killer. Pedo Ring much???? Holy crap and the news didn't really focus on the family being pedos themselves. A creepy world out there.
