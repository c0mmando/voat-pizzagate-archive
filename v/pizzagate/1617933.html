            I just got this thread a lot of exposure! I posted this list on Joe Rogan's twitter and used the #pizzagate hashtag. I got a message saying that it was chosen to be on Joe Rogans shzamm twitterverse! 
Here is an image

            The only code existing here is the "cheese pizza" term that is used on sites like 4chan. Pizza is not a code word for girl, cheese is not a code word for little girl, pasta is not a code word for little boy, hot dog is not a code word for boy, walnut is not a code word for person of color, map is not a code word for semen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The code words list manufactured on 4chan is bogus. But instead of doing a simple fact check, pizzagaters will mindlessly repeat falsehoods because they just don't give  a shit about facts.

            The handkerchief is for collecting the sex-blood-rape juices below the victim.  Just look at the pedophile rape artwork.  The perp normally takes with him as a memento, something to remember the moment by.  The "map" is all the dried bloodcum...FUCKING BARF, god it's so hard to talk about what they do to these poor kids.

            I agree with the list of significant submissions.  It would cut down on repeats and keep pertinent information always in view.

            $65 000 pizza/hot dogs is a deas give away. Why? Because it is illegal to bring in food into the White House from outside, so the only thing that we are talking about are either drugs or pedophile lingo.
