            If there was any real dirt on Trump like photos or videos of him raping 12 year old girls it would have been released long ago before the election or before he was inaugurated. Tom Arnold keeps bragging on Twitter that he's seen videos from The Celebrity Apprentice with footage of Trump saying "niggers" and other bad words and that might surface at some point. The producers are keeping it locked away but after the "grab her by the pussy" video everyone wanted to see more damaging stuff. It never surfaced which means it doesn't exist. I could believe the Russians have video of Trump with hookers in Moscow hotel rooms and if he's being blackmailed by that it will eventually be revealed by the CIA.

            Completely misleading title.  A better one would be "Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump, and newly signed Trump Model, Ingrid Seynhaeve attending Victoria's Secret Angel's Party at Laura Belle Club in New York City, April 1997.
 3x Sports Illustrated supermodel Ingrid Seynhaeve at Victoria's Secret lingerie party, is pictured here with her employer, Donald Trump.  "Mr. Trump (as he likes to be called) signed Ingrid to his modeling agency, Trump Models. She appeared in ads for summer concerts at Trump Marina in Atlantic City. She was working for him when she got the Victoria's Secret gig, so Trump's magic touch worked on Ingrid, too. He had her on billboards and the sides of busses before you (or he) could say "You're fired!" ...No dummy, Ingrid speaks five languages and has two sons. She jets back and forth between homes in Paris and New York. She is married to Jean-Baptiste Iera.

            Epstein, close friend to President Clinton at the time, was a financier who was later arrested in 2008 for soliciting underage prostitutes. 
Clinton was identified in lawsuit against his former friend and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein who had 'regular' orgies at his Caribbean compound that the former president visited multiple times. Epstein has a host of famous friends including Prince Andrew who stayed at his New York mansion AFTER his arrest.

            Trumps biggest "life mentor" Roy Cohn may have started Pizzagate altogether by running a homosexual/pedophile blackmail operation for the CIA. Now let's be fair, you guys have proverbially burned democrats at the stake with far less evidence/information.

            This photo may not be exactly damning but the op has a point. Anyone on voat who even suggests that Trump
            <em>
             might
            </em>
            be involved faces some serious resistance. This is very understandable for he is the face of hope for many, but I fear it's narrowing the scope of the investigation. In the end the fact of the matter is that he was indeed quite cosy with a convicted sex offender. This alone does not make him guilty by any means, but I think it's a good idea to be open to the possibility. After all, if there's something we've learned from pizzagate, it's that the unthinkable could be a reality.

            Trump has been to the island 3 times I believe. Probably didn't go back because he figured out what was going on there. We don't think Trump is the enemy here and we have no reason to believe he is. We have many reasons to believe that he is going to restore the US government as a government of the people and that he's gonna clean up shop with the pedos. Because Trump has been around, he knows this shit exists. Praying for you everyday Mr. President. You are America's last hope. You are humanity's last hope. Praying for you.

            Damn..Trump is a raging heterosexual that like's looking at Victoria's Secret models..who'd a thunk it? I hope he grabbed one or more by the p***y because that's what I would have done if I had my own freakin' jet...

            So Trump is at a party with smoking hot dime pieces and you link it because? Epstein is a sick puppy, but give some real evidence that Trump is implicated in his evilness. Trump isn't the Clintons. He didn't create a foundation with the guy that allegedly trafficked humans. The elite of the elite are going to cross paths. It doesn't mean they are all into child rape rings with each other.

              again, the elite of the elite are going to cross paths. that doesn't mean Trump is in a pedo ring with them. until I see actual evidence that implicates him, you guys seem to be grasping at straws when we have much more important stuff to focus on. Trump is anti-establishment/anti-shadow gov't President. If there was evidence of him being in one, they would have brought up during the election process instead of having Jerry Springer's producer file a fake lawsuit against Trump alleging misconduct with a 14 year old that was later rescinded once the public didn't buy it besides the partisan shills who WANT to believe things instead of letting the facts come in and making a decision off of them. Don't be those people... If evidence comes out against Trump, I'll be right in line to crucify him with you. Until then we have real evidence against real pedos so please focus on bringing that to the mainstream's attention... If anything, whether you like it or not, we NEED this man to bring these people down. If you think he's in on it, we're doomed for at least 8 more years and we all might as well pack up our bags because this is all for not.

              that's hilarious. I was wondering how that phrase stuck in my mind. I used to listen to a lot of JRE back in the day so that phrase must have stuck with me for years(it's probably been at least 5 years since I listened consistenly). That's crazy you noticed it right away.

             <p>
              In 2002, while Epstein was using child-sex slaves at his various homes in New York, Palm Beach, and in the Virgin Islands, Trump told New York Magazine that Epstein, his friend of 15 years, was a “terrific guy”.
             </p>
             <p>
              “He’s a lot of fun to be with,” Trump continued. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

              Ok? that still doesn't implicate Trump. For all we know, Trump could be into chicks Ivanka's age( edit: I meant to put Melania, but smoked a blunt before making this comment so my memory sucks....) while Epstein was trying to plow 18 year olds in the presence of The Don. There are plenty of normal folk who had what they thought were decent friends who turned out to be deviants. are we going for guilty by association now because that's what it sounds like?

                thanks for showing your true colors and politicizing this. again, give us the evidence. do you have Trump in secret emails talking in code lingo or just PUBLIC statements about the guy before he was a convicted pedo? Does Trump have any shady business dealings with Epstein? I'll wait... honestly if Trump was some part of a pedo ring would Trump make comments like that publicly or is this a coincidence after the fact? you be the judge....

                 "Pizzagate" activism isn't politicized? Puuulease. Roger Stone warned in August on twitter that he was going to unleash a hurricane on Podesta. This whole psyop has been in the works for awhile. GOP dirty trick, by a sexual deviant, no less. Stone is a bisexual swinger who diddle boy prostitutes with Roy Cohn and J. Edgar Hoover.

                  considering what we know about the Franklin case years ago paired with the pentagon being plagued with creeps, this is a bi-partisan issue. Sure, the Dems are the ones in the spotlight as of right now, but once we shed light on the cockroaches in DC, we'll see creeps from both parties. Denny Hastert is in those wikileak emails, too, talking to Podesta. stop being a partisan shill. if trump is a pedo, it will come out organically. you trying to paint him as one with flimsy evidence based on public statements from 2002 shows your colors, bro. it seems like you've still got blue pills mixed in with the reds.
