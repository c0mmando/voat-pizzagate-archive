<h1>Labor Secretary’s Role in Abuse Deal Could Get DOJ Scrutiny</h1>
<p>Posted Jan. 29, 2019, 1:46 PM Updated Jan. 29, 2019, 2:42 PM</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor secretary was prosecutor in Jeffrey Epstein case</li>
<li>Bipartisan group has called for some kind of probe</li>
</ul>
<p>The Justice Department’s inspector general wants lawmakers to give him the authority to investigate a decade-old plea deal in which Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta allegedly allowed an accused sex offender to skirt the harshest punishment for crimes against teens.</p>
<p>“Your letter raises important questions about the resolution of this case by department attorneys,” DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said in a Jan. 29 letter to lawmakers. “However, the OIG does not currently have jurisdiction over matters involving allegations of misconduct relating to DOJ attorneys’ handling of litigation or legal decisions.”</p>
<p>The department’s watchdog responded to lawmakers’ calls to look into an agreement that Acosta—then a federal prosecutor in South Florida—reached with lawyers for Miami hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein, which allowed Epstein to avoid federal sex trafficking charges. Epstein was sentenced to 13 months in prison on lesser charges.</p>
<p>Horowitz called on the Senate to take up <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/202">a bill (H.R. 202)</a> recently passed by the House. He said that legislation would give him the authority to investigate alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</p>
<p>A November Miami Herald report on the Epstein case has renewed public attention to the allegations against Epstein, who was accused of running a teen sex ring out of his Florida home. It’s also brought new criticism to Acosta, who as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida is said to have helped orchestrate the agreement.</p>
<p>Epstein’s all star legal defense team included Harvard University professor Alan Dershowitz, former special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, and famed criminal defense attorney Roy Black.</p>
<p>The Labor Department declined Bloomberg Law’s request for comment. A DOL spokeswoman on Jan. 15 told Bloomberg Law that Acosta acted appropriately.</p>
<p>“For more than a decade, this prosecution has been reviewed in great detail by newspaper articles, television reports, books, and Congressional testimony,” the spokeswoman said. “Department of Justice leadership, likewise, reviewed the matter at the time, and the Department has continued to defend the Southern District of Florida’s actions across three administrations and several attorneys general on the grounds that the actions taken were in accordance with Department practices, procedures, and the law.”</p>
<p>Acosta was rumored to be on a short list of potential replacements for Jeff Sessions as the U.S. Attorney General before the Herald story was published. The former Justice Department civil rights chief and National Labor Relations Board member is also widely believed to be interested in a federal judge seat.</p>
<p>The renewed attention to the Epstein case and possible DOJ investigation may put that goal on the back burner.</p>
<p>Acosta in a <a href="https://archive.fo/JS5Rm">2011 letter obtained by the Daily Beast</a> said he was brought into the case because local police officers were concerned that state prosecutors would let Epstein off easy. He said the deal was reached after Epstein’s lawyers launched “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” that was “more aggressive than which I, or any of the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered.”</p>
<p>The House Jan. 15 passed by voice vote the Inspector General Access Act, which would move DOJ prosecutor misconduct probes to the inspector general from the Office of Professional Responsibility. <a href="https://archive.fo/R5T9h">Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), whose panel would likely get first crack at the bill, recently joined Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in urging Attorney general nominee William Barr to conduct a “full and thorough” investigation of the Epstein case if confirmed for the post</a>.</p>
<p>A Graham spokesman didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg Law’s request for comment.</p>

             Thanks. I don't know much about Opperman. Is he a fairly reliable source, in your opinion? He seems to think Trump and his team are retards.
            </p>

             </a>
             see parent. At 13:33, Opperman says Roger Stone said it was Kelly Anne Conway who leaked the Access Hollywood tape because she is a CIA agent. He also says Stone and Trump wanted to bring Cathy O'Brien to the debate to sit with Juanita Broderick...implying that Trump thought O'Brien would be a stressor to the Clintons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a the bit about the Weiner laptop I transcribed. At 19:22, Opperman, who is a private investigator, says:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Eric Prince was going around talking about how he had sources in the NYPD and NY FBI that knew what was on Weiners laptop. And when that information got out it was going to be so damning so damaging to the Clintons...he actually made a big donation to Trump around this time and that is what really convinced me. I knew Prince had connections to NYPD because my partner was NYPD and we used to recruit for Blackwater back in the early 2000's about 15 years ago. So I knew Prince had connections to NYPD and to Trump's chief of security, Keith Schiller. I had my connections to Keith Schiller. I did some work for him.  When I was starting my company, people were so afraid of Keith Schiller that people didn't want to come work for me because I would be competing with Keith Schiller. So I'm very familiar with these people.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...My ears were perked with this theory that there was dirt on this laptop which made sense to me because if Weiner was such an extreme pervert...Huma Abedin...they had to both be involved in the same kind of stuff or they would have moved on from each other. So I said it's
              <em>
               possible
              </em>
              they had some stuff on there. And it's
              <em>
               possible
              </em>
              that this would be leaked back to Prince and Schiller and Guiliani and that whole bunch. It's a definite possibility. They would get this information and they would go and blackmail the Clintons.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...It's much easier if you want to fix an election to lose an election...if Trump had dirt on the Clintons and he could blackmail them they would hold back and he would be the winner. And that is what I thought happened. I no longer think that.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He then goes on to lay out why he thinks it was Russia who hacked the DNC and DCC, and Hillary and got all the dirt. He raises the question of how did they know they'd been hacked, such that they then hired Crowd Strike to analyze their servers, and says Putin probably called them to blackmail them. Pretty interesting stuff.

              Yeah, he's no Trump fan but he was a Bernie supporter in 2016 and was credentialed for the important Nev. DNC caucus where the rough stuff happened (Hillary's team hired goons to throw chairs etc.) and he gave very good eye-witness account. Plus he gives good local news on Las Vegas fake-mass-shooting as he lives in Las Vegas.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think he's extra good source as he knows all kinds of IT forensics. He invented the message retrieval system used for Tiger Wood's cell phone and knows all about leaks, hacking etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              He follows Epstein case very well and I post his news on my blog's Epstein section.

                 say it isn't true. Instead, he is defending Harvey Weinstein.

                  It would be terrible if he were in Trump's team. He was Epstein's attorney back in the day, and negotiated the lenient sentence. Also, there are credible reports that he also sexually exploited teenage girls.

                    well heck, maybe I am wrong and you are right.  I thought he was based on old tv snips I listened to on YouTube .... but maybe I have it wrong. He does defend Trump a lot in the press and maybe he's on some P.R. team.

                   <p>
                    Anyway, recent articles would describe him as being on the team if he was. They don't ....

                     Yeah, that's what I mean. It's a mystery. Something is definitely going on, but it's hard to tell what.

                     For the record, I messaged Praying Medic on Twitter last week and asked him if he still thinks QAnon was saying Dershowitz is on the team, and he said yes. I hit him with Dersh's denials in the press, and he never responded back to me.

                  OK - but sometimes key words in bad articles are helpful.  I will bar them in the future.  Almost ready for page 5 at this point. So many articles.

            I created this burner account to specifically share this information please do with it as you please:
           </p>
           <p>
            Steve Aoki is a pedophile, or at least knows about #pizzagate. This is the only picture on his personal instagram account and his company "pizzaoki" Instagram page that has the hashtag #pizzagate. Please explore for yourself. And guess what? The picture features the WB show "Smallville" nasty woman that was indicted last year for her role in the sex cult NXIVM for alleged sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor and other nasty stuff. This is more than just mere coincidence.
           </p>

            I could not Archive.today Aoki's Instagram page directly. The following links are the actual/archive.today links for websites that can mirror instagram pages.

            I would take a screen shot of Aoki's Instagram page before anything is done with this information and he has the chance to take it down directly. Please do with this information as you please. This is my attempt to help get the word out and I will be spreading the information around online as well and to various news agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the first hint I have personally found that gives any credible information linking Steve Aoki to #pizzagate. I also believe I might be the first one to have noticed Aoki's link to #pizzagate. It would be awesome if this information could be shared with the various Chans. I am unfamiliar with them.

             Acosta was rumored to be on a short list of potential replacements for Jeff Sessions as the U.S. Attorney General before the Herald story was published. The former Justice Department civil rights chief and National Labor Relations Board member is also widely believed to be interested in a federal judge seat.

            Trump is no idiot; he knew they would come after Acosta for this. He could have picked anyone for Labor Secretary. Why also fan the fire by allegedly contemplating Acosta for AG?  Especially when

                You know what's strange, AWS? You've been here for two years (or even longer), and I can't seem to remember that you ever expressed any disgust when reading info about crimes committed by convicted pedophiles or pedophilia in general. Why's that?

                 Because this forum doesn't actually care about that as an issue unless it can connected to some conspiratorial worldview.  It fact it often attacks the people trying to address it. 
 And pedophilia was not something I discovered in 2016.

                  if yu have empathy for the victims, I've yet to see it. You only seem to have empathy for those you believe to be 'wrongly accused' - even when those suspects act in a manner that is the opposite of forthright and accountable

                  i.e. if Alefantis is innocent, why doesnt he come out and explain his instagram account even just as a perverse sense of humor - if thats what it is?

                 <p>
                  if Podesta is innocent, why DOESNT he explain what a pizza related map is, or his maintained friendship with Hastert, or a score of other troublesome hints

                   I say there's nothing to the CLAIM that Clinton knew Silsby or helped Silsby and I proven my correct to be true.  The CLAIM is based on document retrieved after Silsby got arrested, but the CLAIM says it shows Clinton followed Silsby for years which is completely false.  The Silsby case is the single crime attached to pizzagate and it completely falls upon inspection.   I also think that this false claim was a DELIBERATELY FALSE CLAIM.  I don't know how it could be otherwise, it's so obvious the document is from after the earthquake and not from 2001.  I have also shown the claims to connect Silsby to Alefantis are completely false

                   That guy Jorge Puello, was not her lawyer or any lawyer of any kind.  There's no indication he spoke with her before inserting himself in the case.  He spoke with the families of some of the Baptists back in the US.  Given that he was not a lawyer, didn't speak Haitian creole, he could not be their lawyer in Haiti.  I think Puello was running some kind of grift.  He might have recognized her as a grifter and figured he could make some money.  I dunno what he was thinking, because it was an exceptionally stupid plan. He basically turned the families against the Haitian lawyer who was actually representing the Baptists in court, possibly trying to keep the money for legal fees for himself.

                   I very much do not trust your smoke detection skills let alone your ability to discern fire.  I often think y'all make Moloch's out of molehills.

                   Essentially the core evidence of pizzagate starting with the Podesta emails has fallen apart under any scrutiny.

                   I think this is absolutely hilarious.  You think there's a way to reason with a group of people who think Connecticut Avenune is haunted by demons all the business on the block are part of some cabal? That Comet and Besta are connecting in any meaningful way? People who can't hear the world tunnel without imagining crimes committed there.  Who believe that a years old video of people playing ping pong on the street contains the anguished cries of children from underground that somehow went unnoticed for years? People who still look for a basement at Comet? Do you think there's a way to reason with these witch-hunters?  Do you think they are rational and neutral evaluators of evidence? Tell me how you get some who believes Hilary Clinton is suffering from a brain condition due to her cannibalism to unbelieve some other bullshit they are committed to.  How does one work with Adrenochrome delusionists to understand probability and and logic?

                  <p>
                   AND to your point, Alefantis tried to do this. He let people film inside Comet Ping Pong.  Did it help? Of course not?  Their fevered imaginations took over.  The bathroom doors are designed to blend into the wall. WHAT COULD THEY BE DOING THOSE DOORS.  OMG did you see the cages with the liquors bottles?  AT NIGHT THEY PUT KIDS IN THOSE CAGESAlefantis tried to explain the girl with the masking tape was the result of kids playing.  Did the witch hunt stop?  Of course, not.  They imagined all sorts of horrors for that girl.  Imagined that she's connected to Madeline McCann and George Soros.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   He tried to explain stuff and his explanations turned out to be more evidence of his guilt the witch hunters said.

                    if Podesta is innocent, why DOESNT he explain what a pizza related map is, or his maintained friendship with Hastert, or a score of other troublesome hints.

                   Jesus Christ.  Do you understand how an incredibly weak, weak, weak piece of evidence this is?  Somebody said something odd in an email and therefore what?....How do you jump to any conclusion at all let alone child trafficking from this email without believing in their evilness or guilt?
First off, you know that Pizza related map wasn't his words right?  And that they were the words of someone who was not looking at the thing.  Her language was awkward because she is trying to describe something she never saw, just had someone describe to her.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Seondly Pizza related maps fucking exist.  And just this weekend I saw a pasta related map.  Food related maps of Italy are pretty common design theme.  You can even buy stock images of them.

                   The pasta map of Italy I saw was in an Italian restaurant and it looked similiar to this
                   <a href="https://www.world-wide-gifts.com/images/large/00007809-tea-towel-italian-pasta-la-pasta-made-in-italy-cotton.jpg">

                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This is on a kitchen linen, a tea towel.  Italian tea towels like this are very common as part of Italian pride/kitsch or the kind of thing tourists to Italy would pick up to use back home.  Kitchen tea towels are often made from thin flat cotton so they dry fast.  In fact they feel similiar to a handkerchief.  My personal theory is this has always been about a tea towel, but that's irrelevant to the main point,  Pizza maps are a common enough that there's multiple stock photos of them.
