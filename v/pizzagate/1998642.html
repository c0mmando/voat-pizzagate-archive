<p>Wisconsin court corruption </p>
<p>Mar 4, 11:37 a.m.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court is not only supposed to avoid corruption, but also avoid the perception of corruption.  They and the state legislature are not doing a very good job of it.  The upcoming Supreme Court probe into Governor Walker’s possible illegal campaign coordination, and the April 7 statewide vote on a constitutional amendment to change the way the court selects its chief justice, are classic examples. </p>
<p>Three of the groups that Walker is alleged to have coordinated with--and that are also targets of the probe--are the Wisconsin Club for Growth, Citizens for a Strong America, and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.  All three derive funding from the Koch brothers. </p>
<p>Those four justices may now rule on a case involving the organizations that helped get them elected.  The justices are not required to recuse themselves, and indications are that they will not.  If that is not blatant corruption, it certainly creates the perception of corruption. </p>
<p>For added insurance, Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature want to remove liberal-leaning Shirley Abrahamson from her position as chief justice, prior to the Walker probe. </p>
<p>one of the first issues the 2015-2016 legislature took up was amending the state constitution to change the way the Wisconsin Supreme Court selects its chief.  that selection has been based on tenure.  With a majority of conservatives now on the court, the Republican legislature has approved an amendment to the constitution that would allow the justices to elect their chief. </p>
<p>Representative Brooks of the 50th Assembly District was one of the sponsors of that legislation.  He has been less than honest about its purpose.  Brooks and other Republicans deny that they are trying to get rid of Abrahamson as chief, but their denials smack of deceit. </p>
<p>The legitimate way to change the way the Court selects its chief would be to wait until 2019 when Abrahamson’s term ends, but Republicans refuse to wait. </p>
<p>Democrats suggested that the new rule could exempt Abrahamson, since she earned her position under the rules existing at the time, but Republicans flatly refused that also—revealing again that their true motive was to oust Abrahamson as chief. </p>
<p>Abrahamson was already chief when Wisconsin voters re-elected her for another ten-year term in 2009.  Wisconsin voters have therefore given their approval of her as chief.  The Republican maneuver is a slap in the face to Wisconsin voters. </p>
<p>Wisconsin voters can restore some measure of legitimacy to the Court by voting NO to the amendment on April 7.  That would also send a message to the Koch brothers that Wisconsin is not a subsidiary of Koch Industries.</p>

<p>In Other News, Scott Walker\'s Wisconsin Is Still as Crooked as Ever</p>
<p>formerly known as the state of Wisconsin, now that Scott Walker has gone back to his job as its manager, ......and now that he continues to turn the state\'s political culture into a SuperFund site. For example, recently, he installed a crony named Rebecca Bradley in a seat on the state\'s Supreme Court, and Justice Bradley turns out to be quite the piece of work.</p>
<p>Bradley and Milwaukee attorneys Don Daugherty, David Simon, and Daniel Kelly said in a 2008 opinion column that a pledge put forward by the State Bar of Wisconsin\'s Judicial Campaign Integrity Committee shouldn\'t be signed by candidates because it infringes on free speech.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bar should not try to regulate speech by judicial candidates in a way that would be plainly unconstitutional if done by the government,&quot; the four wrote. &quot;The far better course is for candidates and their supporters to provide information they believe appropriate — good, bad, even ugly — and let voters decide.&quot; The committee was created in 2007 by the bar association\'s then-president, Tom Basting Sr., as a self-appointed watchdog group that tried to referee that year\'s race for Wisconsin Supreme Court. The committee was disbanded in 2009, according to the bar association. Basting and his group issued seven statements reacting to advertising in the race that it deemed false or to have impugned the reputation of either candidate or the court.</p>
<p>The 
In essence, then, Bradley and her co-authors are arguing for the right of candidates to lie in their advertisements, and to put the ethical obligations of their professions in a jar while they\'re running for office. It follows, then, that campaigning for political office is a lesser ethical pursuit than, say, the law. Of course, this has become axiomatic in Wisconsin since Walker was elected its governor.  The state still has a functioning open records law, and Bradley has declined to let it inconvenience her over much. A liberal watchdog group, One Wisconsin Now, filed an open-records request for the office calendars from Bradley\'s days as a judge in a lower case. Bradley responded by providing the group with a raft of blank pages that indicated she had done no official business in that court for two-and-a-half years. Confronted by this improbability, Bradley admitted…well, I don\'t want to spoil it.</p>
<p>Responding to an open records request from a liberal group, the newly appointed conservative justice provided monthly calendars that suggested she had no official business—other than the cases she was hearing—for 29 straight months. But in answer to questions from the 
a court official recently said Bradley actually did not have a way to retrieve her calendars.</p>
<p>And, of course, the open-records law itself is currently under siege by the forces of Walkerism, probably to mask from the people of Wisconsin how much of their money got chucked down the rathole of Walker\'s 
misbegotten presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Now an obscure administration board charged with facilitating the retention of records quietly made significant changes to the open records law without required public notice, giving the Walker administration a new way to deny records requests about the use of public resources during his presidential run and taxpayer handouts to Walker donors. The Freedom of Information Council asked the Dane County District Attorney to prosecute the board for violating the open meetings law when it made the changes. The swift pushback on the changes has prompted the board to reconsider and the board chair announced a public hearing about the changes on Monday, January 11</p>',

            This all makes my head spin.  The Koch Bros. are all in this too.  You Libertarians many times stick up for your ilk, you pick one or two causes you are for and don't pay attention to their whole plan.  Look up the John Birch Society.  Ron Paul and his son Rand are fakes. Rand once said he would not have signed the Civil Rights Act.  That is epic.  I am not just picking on them.  There are many False Friends that people think are for them and they are not.  I am no longer the fan of any idol.  No YT idols for me or Political idols.  I learned my lesson for the rest of my life with Obama.  Never Again.  Wake Up and Look into the Koch Bros in Wisconsin, for that is what they are doing everywhere else. In your state too.  They are behind a Constitutional Convention so they can change the Constitution.  They are just 2 states away from that.

             Wisconsin Club for Growth
            </p>
            <p>
             Wisconsin Club for Growth (WCFG) is a state arm of the national Club for Growth, and one of the top political 
spenders in Wisconsin. WCFG spent $9.1 million during the Wisconsin's historic 2012 recall races for Governor,
 Lt. Governor and State Senate, and has reportedly received a subpoena in a 2012-2014 John Doe criminal

Wisconsin Club for Growth was part of a "criminal scheme" to coordinate activities with the Scott Walker 
campaign during the state's 2011 and 2012 recall election, in violation of the state's campaign finance laws.

I think you should try to post it in both places.  But you know best. I noticed that Donald Trump donated $15K himself.  What do you think this means.

            Wisconsin is completely lawless and controlled at every level. They use Racine and Wisconsin as models for their bigger agenda. You can identify who is leading the charge in political corrupt through donations. Club for Growth is one of many PACs involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a chance that some more information would come out through the John Doe investigations tied to Scott Walker, but it has all been since covered up. The real story is with the Milwaukee 7 and Marquette Mafia using communities like Racine to push their corrupt corporate agenda to control information and resources, including the Great Lakes fresh water supply.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are corrupt and compromised Boy Scouts who are working for the mafia and the elite to push through an evil and corrupt global agenda. Racine, Wisconsin is the weak link to the entire system. That is why these three guys have so much undeserved power. It is because of what they are covering up in Racine and Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is one of 13 Bellwether districts that control the political fate of the nation. Wisconsin is a key battle ground, and it is used by the elite to control the one party system. Both the corruption in the RNC and DNC are closely tied to Racine, Wisconsin.

             Milwaukee 7 markets the region to companies looking to expand operations or relocate -- from across the state line to around the globe.
The business appears quite successful in terms of how much money they make but I find it quite odd I cannot name the founder/owners......
This marketing business has a lot of sponsors.  a lot !  sc Johnson to name one, other familiar names in their.  I will let you read more 
below.
Marq-Mafia====Back in the day they were called the Milwaukee Mafia. Victor DeLorenzo, Sam Llanas and John Sieger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Milwaukee County is being run by the mafia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "Marquette Mafia," as alumni working in Milwaukee , make up most of the staff in County Executive Scott Walker's office . 
All of the employees with college degrees in the office except for one graduated from Marquette University.   That means six out of nine 
staffers are Marquette alums.  Milwaukee County is being run by the mafia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Justice Scalia had ties to Marquette, Milwaukee

              This is absolutely correct and only the tip of the iceberg. These groups are being used for global models from privatized control of public resources including the Great Lakes fresh water supply to Sanctuary Cities to renewable energy to education reform to prison labor to viruses and vaccines, and it is all part of the real agenda of Global Enslavement. Foxconn was the latest corrupt development deal that will be used as part of this program, and is a cover for what is really going on in Racine and Wisconsin. Trump is also involved in the deals, and the Reince Priebus firing was only for cover, just as nearly all officials in Racine have resigned recently as the system of extreme corruption, trafficking and criminal activity has been exposed. The players change but the system remains. The Marquette Mafia controls all local and state judges, and is directly tied to corrupt officials and law enforcement who protect those involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a coalition between political groups, corporations, institutions, NGOs, religious groups, secret societies, gangs and the mafia to push through the real Agenda. It is not only the Jesuit groups including Marquette, Georgetown and others, but also other groups including Greek Orthodox, LDS (Mormon), LC, OTO, Scientology, Kabbalah, and others. Racine and Wisconsin serve as the models for these programs, and many of these same groups affiliated with Milwaukee 7 are involved in the cover-up with fake organizations such as the Racine Interfaith Coalition, Higher Expectations, Great Lakes St. Lawrence Initiative, Anti-Trafficking Coalition, The Fight to End Exploitation, the I-94 Project, and many others.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look into Scalia and ties to groups such as the Red Circle, Keshe Foundation, Federalist Society, Koch network, Club for Growth, CATO Institute, Reason Foundation, and Heritage Foundation. It is a global network with many layers, and the Milwaukee 7 is one of many regional models involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine and Wisconsin is the "Root" of the entire system, and the real agenda of Global Enslavement.

              They cannot allow the public to know the real story about the John Doe investigations, or everyone will find out about the criminal corruption networks in Wisconsin that control the entire court system, legislature and public private partnerships through collusion, racketeering and other crimes. Scott Walker and many others involved should all be in prison, but instead they bought off the Wisconsin Supreme Court and all lower levels. The rule of law is dead.
             </p>
             <p>
              It will also expose the JTTF programs in Wisconsin used by politicians for retaliation, intimidation, blackmail, extortion, harassment and other means.
