<p>Showbiz traditions run deep in Variety. Because the first Annual Dinner and Ball in Pittsburgh in 1928 was staged in a Big Top, the branches have always been referred to as ‘Tents’ and the members are called ‘Barkers.’ </p>
<p>Variety was started in the UK in 1949 with a dinner at The Savoy attended by film moguls, agents and celebrities, all eager to freely donate their time and talent to help raise funds for children. Since then, more than £270 million has been raised by Variety in the UK; funding 5,000+ Sunshine Coaches, almost the same number of wheelchairs, thousands of grants to individual children and life-saving support for children’s hospitals, hospices and youth clubs.</p>
<p>And each year tens of thousands of children are taken on great days out by our wonderful Variety Great Days Out team.</p>

<p>Interesting that Prince Andrew name pops up.  Remember at the start of this post, the company Hackremo is mentioned?  Owned by media magnate Richard Desmond..who hired a Sunshine Coach from Variety for an outing... I have made a number of posts (largely overlooked) in the past to do with this company.. (I need to do a diagram now to highlight its significance to the whole pizzagate network) but I last mentioned it in this post:</p>
<p>Prince Andrew touted as Donald Trump\'s golf escort on UK trip, a dodgy property deal, Sir Alan Reid and an Honours system under scrutiny after sex abuser kept title for years - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3262526/19038035">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3262526/19038035</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Andrew\'s Pitch at Palace ...Ella\'s Kitchen is a company that makes organic baby and toddler food, sold in supermarkets internationally  .. Ella\'s Kitchen  sold to The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., ..Hain Celestial Group is involved with the Core Club NYC </p>
<p>Ella\'s Kitchen was founded in 2006 by Paul Lindley ..He is an author of a best-selling book Little Wins: The Power of Thinking Like a Toddler and is a co-founder of a social enterprise called The Key is E with former child soldier and international hip-hop artist Emmanuel Jal. He was previously deputy managing director of Nickelodeon UK. ..Paul Lindley sits on the Santander SME advisory board and is an ambassador for the Family and Childcare Trust.  international firm Carillion .. known to have received investment from HSBC, Barclays and Santander. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carillion, Capita, Serco and Interserve run by criminals..Hackremco is the previous name of Interdean, one of the companies owned by Paul Evans, ... Evans runs Santa Fe Relocation</p>

<p>Santa Fe Relocation works with Chambers of Commerce around the world.. so does Prince Andrew ..</p>

           Interesting that Prince Andrew name pops up.  Remember at the start of this post, the company Hackremo is mentioned?  Owned by media magnate Richard Desmond..who hired a Sunshine Coach from Variety for an outing... I have made a number of posts (largely overlooked) in the past to do with this company.. (I need to do a diagram now to highlight its significance to the whole pizzagate network) but I last mentioned it in this post:

            <p>
             Norwood, known legally as Norwood-Ravenswood, is a UK charity established in 1785 in the East End of London. Its name comes from its long running home for Jewish children, Norwood Hall, in the south London suburb of West Norwood which opened in 1863 and closed in 1961.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1996, it merged with Ravenswood, a Berkshire-based charity for people with learning disabilities, to create one of the largest welfare organisations within the British Jewish community.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Norwood's Patron is HM The Queen and its Patron of Children's Services is Cherie Blair.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The charity's celebrity supporters include Simon Cowell, Elton John, David Furnish, Sir Philip Green, Roger Daltrey, Theo Paphitis, Tom Conti and Piers Morgan.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In March 2009, Norwood joined forces with Brighton care home, Sussex Tikvah. In April 2010, The RD Crusaders WorkHub in Stanmore was officially opened. The facility offers a range of services to help adults with learning disabilities learn new skills and, potentially, find paid employment.

             Accounts of abuse as Stoke Mandeville suggest that Savile was taking part in MK Ultra experiments, primarily to cause Dissociative Identity Disorder in patients. Valerie Sinason, the author who brought the story of Kim Noble to light, has cited Savile and many VIP politicians as being at the heart of an international pedophile conspiracy. the acronym 'MK' is a nod to Rothschild involvement in CIA, MI6, ect.

            I am going through the flight logs and I see Prince Andrew uses this near-London airport, EGGW. I had took up a lot of airport codes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I wonder if this airport is a pedo hub like Teterboro, NJ is.  Dwrshowitz flow out of Teterboro.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think pedos have certain "favorite" airports (opinion).

              The mural creates a pair of wings, with each feather representing every woman who works at the airport, and was presented to Princess Anne by a group of local
