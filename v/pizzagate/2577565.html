            WOWZA!
           </p>
           <p>
            Great job connecting the pieces ... so this whole pinning of these serial killings was a cover-up? A payback for causing trouble and not going along?
           </p>
           <p>
            Okay, I fully understand people not getting this This is right out of science fiction. It is not only hard to believe so many powerful people are in on this, it's hard to believe there's a cabal that can actually pull shit like this off.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's frightening, too. If law enforcement is tainted, where the hell do you go for justice?

             The guy may not have been much.  He was a dad, who helped his wife become a doctor.  She stole his kid and disappeared into the "protection" of the local pedo ring.  Which in this case, seems to include lawyers, cops, shrinks, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             He spent a decade trying to free his son from this abuse.  Nothing worked.  He took matters into his own hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right or wrong, he did what a father has to do, I believe.  Call it empathy.  I see and feel things which most do not.  I listened to the his voice.  He wasn't crazy.  He was organized and composed.  He had just come to the conclusion that there were no other options left.  He raised the boy from a baby until the gaslighting was enough to make him snap.
            </p>
            <p>
             I cannot say that I wouldn't have done the same thing in the same circumstances.

              No judgments here. Watching your child being tortured -- and then there were all those other children he accused his wife of abusing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think people would like to believe he's crazy. It would make it easier to dismiss everything than believe it's true.
             </p>
             <p>
              Very sad. But I guess the thing is, why didn't someone like him reach out to pizzagaters? We were the ones trumpeting his cause. I'm not saying we'd be able to do diddly-shit, but he would have had a sympathetic ear and gotten his story out there.

               We are in an odd, semi-shadow banned corner of Al Gore's Amazing Internet (Peace Be Upon Him).  I've watched the traffic stats and subscriber, "here now" numbers.  Nothing scientific.  It's taken about 8 months (approx) to grow from 16,XXX to 16,700-ish (going off memory, I'm not a numbers guy).
              </p>
              <p>
               I thought we might see some exponential growth.  No.

              <p>
               If there is anyone out there who needs help, you've found probably the smartest, most educated collective of researchers and subject matter experts on the subject of SRA, et al.  If you can withstand the shilling, we do encourage you to bring your stories forward.  We are Americans.  We are Patriots.  We believe in God.  And many of us do want to help.

              It is not only hard to believe so many powerful people are in on this, it's hard to believe there's a cabal that can actually pull shit like this off.

              It's frightening, too. If law enforcement is tainted, where the hell do you go for justice?

              Yeah, but I'm just looking at this from someone else's point of view ... someone that hasn't been red-pilled.

              No way would they believe that could happen. It's going to have to take something massive to change the shift. Something undeniable with absolutely incontrovertible evidence.

              Anytime I hear AZ, I think Ed Buck Territory. If that stupid POS was so involved in AZ politics and in finagling to get the freaktoid politicians elected, there had to be a reason.

            My jaw dropped.  He's going off about people being pedophiles.  He's comparing what sounds like his intended victims to Larry Nassar.  I think we are right.

              No.  He never said his name or showed his face, according to reports.  He did refer to some of his victims by name.  Apparently there were almost 10 hours of videos uploaded to his recently created channel.  All scrubbed.  How and why was it scrubbed so quickly?

             <p>
              We need to find the full videos.

               I call bullshit.  Why weave names of Pizzagate pedo's into his screed?  I bet they accused this guy of pedophilia in the custody battle.

                The fact that the subject was even brought up in his videos is telling.  I'm thinking the same as you - just like the MSM narrative - accuse others of what you are guilty of.  This smells just like the LV coverup on a smaller scale.

            This book strongly indicates that many are railroaded patsies, used to cover up ritual sacrifices and abuses that are carried out by others. Elites, cults and gangs are all interconnected by the evidence and likely alternative suspects.
