<p>Part One: How not to Extort and Blackmail Someone more Powerful than you: The Bean-Lawson Love Affair </p>
<p>November 2013 
Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; Patrick Bean says he fell in love with Kiah Lawson. Bean paid him a $400-a-week allowance, put Lawson up in one of his homes and took him on international trips. Bean brought Lawson to the White House in 2013 and also introduced him to Obama. Bean took Lawson on a private tour of the White House. They also attended a Democratic Party fundraiser that featured President Obama. </p>
<p>How did Lawson, who had a criminal record, pass a Secret Service background check, allowing him to meet with the President Obama?</p>
<p>Lawson claims that Bean asked him to bring younger men to his West Hills mansion. </p>
<p>January 2014 
Lawson becomes suspicious of Bean cheating on him. Although they had an open relationship, they didn\'t keep their action on the side secret. Lawson found that Bean had been using a different dating site, Adam4Adam. Lawson checked the records of the extensive video surveillance system throughout Bean\'s house. </p>
<p>This is when Lawson found a secret bedroom camera hidden in the smoke detector above the bed in his West Hills home. The camera captured videos of at least half a dozen different persons engaged in sex.</p>
<p>Lawson made screenshots and later confronted Bean about the recordings.</p>
<p>They have a big argument. They try to reconcile but ultimately the relationship blows up again. </p>
<p>February 15, 2014
Bean went to his Hayden Island condo to kick Lawson out, who resided there as Bean\'s salaried boy-mistress. The two men argued and police were called. </p>
<p>May 2014
Local news outlets pick up a story of legal proceedings concerning the return of images and videos of sex between several male persons taken at Bean\'s home.</p>
<p>The deal?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lawson\'s and Bean\'s attorneys entered into mediation and emerged with an agreement. Under the deal, reviewed by WW, Lawson would get $40,000, including $12,500 for Dickey, Lawson\'s attorney, and $9,500 toward drug treatment for Lawson.
In exchange for the money, Lawson agreed to turn over all images he had from the videos. The agreement also said Lawson would be paid only if by May 8 [2014] there had been no media reports concerning the claims made by Lawson concerning &quot;alleged illicit sexual acts&quot; by Bean.<br />
– <a href="https://archive.is/YAp2t">https://archive.is/YAp2t</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Late May 2014 
Lawson turned his iPhone to Charles Faulk (former electronic forensics expert with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) who has been hired by Bean’s attorney. Faulk wiped the images off the iPhone so they could never be recovered. – <a href="https://archive.is/YAp2t">https://archive.is/YAp2t</a></p>
<p>But Lawson gets no cash in return. Probably pissed. So he leaks evidence to the police about a pedo-threesome in 2013. Lawson as the source of the leak was later confirmed by Lawson\'s incompetent public defender Jeffrey Dickey. 
– <a href="https://archive.fo/2ZlCX">https://archive.fo/2ZlCX</a> </p>
<p>May 2014 - November 2014 
Police investigate evidence of Bean and Lawson committing three-way sodomy on an unidentified 15 year old boy in a Eugene, OR hotel, which occurred after they all attended a University of Oregon football game in September of 2013.</p>
<p>November 18, 2014 a Grand Jury indicted Bean.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Police say the pair enticed a 15-year-old boy to a hotel in Eugene, Ore., after meeting him through the iPhone app Grinder, which helps men locate “local gay, bi and curious guys for dating.” 
Washington Examiner –https://archive.fo/77xtH</p>
</blockquote>
<p>November 19 2014 
Bean is arrested for sodomy in Lane County, OR. –https://archive.is/4kV45</p>
<p>November 27, 2014
Terry Bean co-founder of Human Rights Campaign steps down from the organization\'s board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mr. Bean has decided to voluntarily take a leave of absence from the HRC board until the matter is resolved,&quot; HRC said in an email sent from staffer Jason Rahlan.
–https://archive.fo/2ZlCX</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lawson is also arrested</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scandal is escalating. Thursday, according to local media, Kiah Loy Lawson, allegedly 66-year-old Bean\'s 25-year-old former boyfriend, was arrested by the Portland Sex Crimes Unit for sexually abusing the same boy. After the relationship between the two men ended, Lawson went public with claims that Bean had a practice of secretly videotaping himself having sex with others.<br />
USA Today –https://archive.is/sl3dc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bean\'s attorney argued that Bean was extorted and or blackmailed by Lawson. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bean\'s attorney has told the Multnomah County District Attorney\'s Office that Bean is the victim of an extortion plot carried out against him by a former boyfriend, 24-year-old Kiah Lawson, a onetime cellphone salesman with a drug problem and a criminal record. 
–https://archive.is/bRq3Z</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bean tried to buy off the key witness and avoid justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During the prosecution of the case, Defendant Bean attempted to pay the victim a sum of money to settle the matter civilly, with an expectation the criminal case would be dismissed without a criminal conviction,&quot; Healy wrote. &quot;While the State successfully opposed this effort on the principle defendants should not be allowed to buy their way out of criminal responsibility for serious criminal conduct, there is an obvious concern regarding what affect this may have had on the victim\'s willingness to cooperate.&quot; 
– <a href="https://archive.fo/3kUxN">https://archive.fo/3kUxN</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>September 1, 2015 Two years after the pedo-threesome, the case against Bean is dropped.</p>
<p>It is very telling that Lori Deveney, the attorney for the 15 year old victim, is not at all on the side of the prosecution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My client is relieved this is finally over. He did not seek out this prosecution and made his unwillingness to testify known at every step of the process.
The special prosecutor, Mr. (Scott) Healy, suggested to the court that my client was unwilling to testify because he was being paid. That is completely false.
My client was bullied and manipulated by Detective (Richard) Myers. He was threatened with incarceration by Special Prosecutor Healy when he refused to be bullied into testifying. My client wants no part in this prosecution and never did. – <a href="http://archive.fo/Q4axD">http://archive.fo/Q4axD</a>
During all this, Bean used his D.C. connections to manage the media fall-out. His team label\'s the prosecution &quot;homophobic.&quot; </p>
<p>Bean […] engaged a veteran Washington, D.C., communications specialist from a firm with ties to Obama to manage the story. </p>
<p>Bean hired […] public relations strategist Hilary Rosen. Rosen works for SKDKnickerbocker, a firm that includes Anita Dunn, Obama\'s former communications director.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hilary Rosen and Bean\'s attorneys construct the narrative that Bean is the victim of an extortion ring. Oh the IRONY!  
</p>
<p>Lawson\'s attorney (the incompetent public defender) claims this narrative is simply a smokescreen. –https://archive.is/nVWpK</p>
<p>Indicted with charges sodomy by Grand Jury but later released Bean said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I take some measure of comfort that the world now knows what I have always known — that I was falsely accused and completely innocent of every accusation that was made,&quot; Bean\'s statement said.
&quot;I look forward to being able to tell the story of this conspiracy of lies, deceit, blackmail, malicious prosecution and homophobia now that this case has ended,&quot; Bean said.
Erik Hasselman, Lane County Chief Deputy District Attorney, retorted,</p>
<p>This investigation was not in any way, shape, or form motivated by the sexual orientation of any party.  Had the police not investigated this crime because of the sexual orientation of the victim or witness, a complaint would be justified. 
There are numerous historical prosecutions of men (i.e. church institutions, youth groups, etc.) for the sexual abuse of boys.  Mr. Bean and his lawyer insult these victims by hiding behind the label of suggestion of &quot;sexually-oriented&quot; prosecution.  This type of abuse is real in our community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott Healy, special prosecutor assigned to the Lane County case, said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through his lawyer, the victim has indicated he has felt bullied by the prosecution in this case.  While my meeting with the victim was respectful and professional, I was not willing to remove the possibility of a material witness warrant at that time. 
Unfortunately, as prosecutors, sometimes we have to balance the safety of the community, and in this case, the safety of other young boys in the community, with the concerns the victim has in cooperating with the process. 
– <a href="https://archive.fo/Q4axD">https://archive.fo/Q4axD</a>
Significantly, Healy implies that there are other young boys involved in this case, which is why they considered arresting the 15 year old victim with a material witness warrant. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, two weeks later in a related trial in Washington County, Bean was called to testify by Lawson\'s new attorney Gabriel Biello. Kiah Lawson faced new charges that he\'d had sex with a 17-year-old boy in June 2013. 
Sept. 10 2015. Bean was called as a witness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the advice of his attorney, Bean declined to respond to questions about his relationship with the young man who was the alleged victim in the Washington County case.
&quot;I\'m asserting my right under Article 12, section 1 of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution not to answer any questions in this proceeding,&quot; Bean said, according to a tape of the hearing WW obtained from Washington County Circuit Court.
But because Bean told the court in advance he planned to assert his right to remain silent, he was allowed to respond to questions via telephone and outside the hearing of the jury.

            Bean hired […] public relations strategist Hilary Rosen. Rosen works for SKDKnickerbocker, a firm that includes Anita Dunn, Obama's former communications director.

           Hilary Rosen and Bean's attorneys construct the narrative that Bean is the victim of an extortion ring. Oh the IRONY!
          </p>
          <p>
           Lawson's attorney (the incompetent public defender) claims this narrative is simply a smokescreen. –https://archive.is/nVWpK
          </p>
          <p>
           Indicted with charges sodomy by Grand Jury but later released Bean said:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "I take some measure of comfort that the world now knows what I have always known — that I was falsely accused and completely innocent of every accusation that was made," Bean's statement said.
"I look forward to being able to tell the story of this conspiracy of lies, deceit, blackmail, malicious prosecution and homophobia now that this case has ended," Bean said.
Erik Hasselman, Lane County Chief Deputy District Attorney, retorted,
           </p>
           <p>
            This investigation was not in any way, shape, or form motivated by the sexual orientation of any party.  Had the police not investigated this crime because of the sexual orientation of the victim or witness, a complaint would be justified. 
There are numerous historical prosecutions of men (i.e. church institutions, youth groups, etc.) for the sexual abuse of boys.  Mr. Bean and his lawyer insult these victims by hiding behind the label of suggestion of "sexually-oriented" prosecution.  This type of abuse is real in our community.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Scott Healy, special prosecutor assigned to the Lane County case, said,
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Through his lawyer, the victim has indicated he has felt bullied by the prosecution in this case.  While my meeting with the victim was respectful and professional, I was not willing to remove the possibility of a material witness warrant at that time. 
Unfortunately, as prosecutors, sometimes we have to balance the safety of the community, and in this case, the safety of other young boys in the community, with the concerns the victim has in cooperating with the process.

            Significantly, Healy implies that there are other young boys involved in this case, which is why they considered arresting the 15 year old victim with a material witness warrant.

           Sure enough, two weeks later in a related trial in Washington County, Bean was called to testify by Lawson's new attorney Gabriel Biello. Kiah Lawson faced new charges that he'd had sex with a 17-year-old boy in June 2013. 
Sept. 10 2015. Bean was called as a witness:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            On the advice of his attorney, Bean declined to respond to questions about his relationship with the young man who was the alleged victim in the Washington County case.
"I'm asserting my right under Article 12, section 1 of the Oregon Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution not to answer any questions in this proceeding," Bean said, according to a tape of the hearing WW obtained from Washington County Circuit Court.
But because Bean told the court in advance he planned to assert his right to remain silent, he was allowed to respond to questions via telephone and outside the hearing of the jury.

            See Terry Bean in Australian case law in the comments there. I have my own dossier on him in the form of Mozilla Archive and Faithful Save (maff) files from a faggot censored DMCA blog. Terry Bean knows who I am. I am destorying homosexual vilification law world wide, starting with THE NSW ANTI-DISCRIMINATION ACT 1977 '93 Crypto-Lesbian Clover Moore amendments moving up to his Oregon Equality act that he started. Say again I have a MASSSIVE dossier on this SOB and and my proxies have been sued in Australia FOR THE CRIME OF LINKING TO MY BLOG AND NOTHING MORE.
