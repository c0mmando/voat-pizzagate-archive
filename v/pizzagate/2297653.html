<p>Sandusky May Have Hosted 6 Fresh Air Fund Kids: Charity</p>
<p>A New York City-based nonprofit serving disadvantaged youth says as many as six children may have stayed at the home of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky over the last three decades, NBC New York has learned</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Air_Fund">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Air_Fund</a></p>
<p>What is the Fresh Air Fund</p>
<p>The Fresh Air Fund is a not-for-profit agency that provides free summer vacations in the country to New York City children from low-income communities. Each year, thousands of children visit volunteer host families in 13 states from Virginia to Maine and Canada through the Friendly Town Program or attend one of five Fresh Air Fund summer camps. The Fresh Air Fund has helped more than 1.8 million children since 1877</p>

<p>What the parents of the 5,000 boys and girls may not know is that most of the host families selected by the Fresh Air Fund have not undergone criminal background checks. None are required to be fingerprinted as child-care workers with city agencies are. And none of the summer parents will have received the informational documents that detail the children\'s personal histories -- including any history of therapy, foster care, or abuse that might be relevant to their behavior in the host home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vachss.com/guest_dispatches/excerpt_battle_3.html">http://www.vachss.com/guest_dispatches/excerpt_battle_3.html</a></p>
<p>Private and not-for-profit, the Fund is one of New York\'s oldest and most revered charities. Its directors represent a Who\'s Who of New York society, and it has the backing of some of the city\'s—indeed, the country\'s—most powerful and prestigious companies and individuals, including Con Edison, David Rockefeller, and The New York Times Company (which contributes more than $75,000 a year). All told, donors contribute about $3 million annually, and the charity\'s net worth is more than $25 million, according to its 1986 tax forms</p>
<p>The focus of the criticism was three civil lawsuits filed between 1981 and 1984 charging that the Fund\'s negligence in its screening and supervision caused children to be abused. All three children named in the suits were black (over 80 percent of the children the Fund serves are black or Hispanic), and two cases involved white host families.</p>
<p>Critics have called the Fund a natural target for pedophiles—adults whose sexual orientation is focused exclusively on children—and predicted that further abuse was inevitable until the charity made substantive changes in its program. Their charges seemed to be supported by interviews with convicted pedophiles.</p>
<p>Critics of the Fund have said that because many children do not disclose abuse, the number victimized on Fund vacations will never be known. Furthermore, they say, even when abuse is disclosed, it may not be publicized. This investigation revealed several such examples</p>

<p>Fresh Air Fund Seeks Families To Host Disadvantaged Children </p>
<p>Published: May 14, 2001</p>
<p>Families in Newtown are being sought to open their homes and their hearts to a child who might not otherwise have a summer vacation. The Fresh Air Fund is looking for residents to host children from New York City who have never known the joy of a summer in the country, the fun of playing outdoors in a yard, or swimming in the town pool</p>
<p>This is old news, but this type of stuff is still going on</p>
<p>seems some charities that are suppose to help underprivileged children, instead are being abused</p>
<p>we have seen many charities that do this</p>',

            It is alleged that Aarron Swartz, reddit founder, uncovered a satanic operation at MIT.  Universities are connected via various programs.  All I can find on quick search is Penn State, MIT, Stanford (google birthplace) share a dna collection data base/to supposedly solve world issues.  Not sure of relevance/just tossing this out there.

            <p>
             Am sure it started with just Penn State people, but why add the others?

            <p>
             Maybe they do DNA stuff

             The Penn Club is also a non profit

              Really don't know that they are up too and might be nothing.  However few months back there was a summary of a massive amount of university teachers, counselors and admins convicted on child porn and various other offenses to children.  Arron never committed suicide/the papers he was 'caught' copying were already freely available.  He discovered a child abusing network at MIT.  Penn state covered up what was going on there.  The universities are all connected.

              Way way back when the internet was in infancy google was virtually unknown.  I discovered it and how good it was via a PC mag article...started as a Stanford project (CIA).
             </p>
             <p>
              How this all dot connects don't know...but it is entirely possible that dots do exist.

              re dna research/true, some good, some not so good.  It is being used to target certain populations for example with vaccines.  Plum Island (where they created Lyme among other things) scientist give talks at Penn State.

              Then you have Operation Paperclip

              <p>
               There were dozens of experiments funded by the CIA and Atomic Energy Commission, often conducted by scientists at UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago, Vanderbilt and MIT, which exposed more than 2,000 unknowing people to radiation scans.

              While it may very well be using children's charities simply for procuring children for sodomy  with such a large data base it is possible that these children are used for 'more'.  All just speculation you understand :)

            Makes me skeptical of all these charities and telethons now. I have recently revisited the Jerry Lewis telethon thing. Will have to admit he always gave me the creeps. Maybe Im wrong but I dont know, just something about him.

            Wow, that’s depressing. Takes a special kind of evil monster to take an already economically disadvantaged child who has possibly been emotionally and/or physically abused and then add sexual abuse to their already too heavy burden in life. All while getting praised for their supposed good deeds. How do you look at yourself in the mirror and not see a monster?
           </p>
           <p>
            “Hanging from the nooses” isn’t nearly punishment enough.  Neither is being crucified. Maybe tie them splayed to the ground and leave  them there to be eaten alive by ants or whatever other animal wanders along.
