<p>&quot;An Ottawa artist who helped animate children’s TV shows has been sentenced to 28 months in prison for possessing more than 60,000 images of child pornography and sharing them online.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Wysom</strong>, 55, has <strong>worked on TV productions such as My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and Littlest Pet Shop</strong>, according to the Internet Movie Database.</p>
<p>Wysom was sentenced earlier this month after pleading guilty to the charges in December, two months after police executed a search warrant at his home in Old Ottawa South.</p>
<p>Police found 60,165 pictures — many of them duplicates — along with 1,626 videos, some of which depicted adults engaging in sexual behaviours with children. In some of the images, young girls had their hands and feet bound.</p>
<p>In a pre-sentence report, presented to court, <strong>Wysom told a probation officer that he developed an addiction to adult pornography about a decade ago, but slowly became desensitized to it and “needed something more.”</strong> He turned to child pornography, Wysom said, which became a way to deal with his clinical depression and other medical issues.</p>
<p>A forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Gray, conducted a sexual behaviours assessment of Wysom, and concluded he had a “pedophilic disorder.” Wysom told Gray he turned to child porn in response to the untreated stress he was experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>[Kudos to the judge for this at least]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justice David Berg took exception to Wysom’s attempt to blame outside forces for his behaviour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I think that you are still quite far from comprehending that the problem is you and only you,”</strong> the judge told Wysom in his decision. “I think that you are still trying to rationalize your behaviour to yourself and to others in the face of society’s reaction to what you have done.”</p>
<p>The judge told Wysom he could have erased the images on his computer and sought professional help, but chose instead to continue on his destructive path because “he didn’t think he would get caught.”</p>
<p>“The stressors in his life may have led him to throw caution to the wind, but the stressors did not create in Mr. Wysom an ability to take pleasure from those images. That ability pre-existed the stressors,” Berg said.</p>
<p>Court heard that Wysom was born and raised in Wales, where he worked as a postal clerk. He came to Canada in 1992, and hitch-hiked and camped his way across the country before becoming a permanent resident in 1996. He has studied fine art and commercial animation, and once had his work featured at Ottawa’s Cube Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>[Delusional psychiatrist] Dr. Gray told the court that Wysom is a low risk to re-offend or have sexual contact with children.</strong></p>
<p>The judge said he had to sentence Wysom to a prison term — a sentence of two years or more — in order to sufficiently denounce his conduct and deter others from the same path.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier this year, the Court of Appeal for Ontario noted there are now so many reports of child porn-related crime in Ottawa that investigators have to triage their work by “how bad the child pornography is.”</strong> Offenders regularly access child porn through peer-to-peer and encrypted internet networks.</p>
<p>Wysom was arrested after a member of the Ottawa Police Service’s Internet Child Exploitation Unit conducted an investigation of a file sharing network with an IP address in Ottawa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the uninitiated, My Little Pony is a toy and merchandise enterprise that first became popular in the ’80s, but experienced resurgence in 2010 when the animated series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic [on which Wysom worked] popularized the franchise for a new generation of little girls. And also, apparently, adult men.</p>
<p>These adult men call themselves Bronies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The friends we spoke with said Bronies are often accused of being pedophiles - a claim they say is unfair and makes no sense. They say the fascination with the show comes first and foremost for the &quot;beautiful&quot; animation.&quot;</p>',

              Even more intriguing to me was this comment I found in a random blogpost discussing the CCC's ties to the KGB that attempts to discredit Assange.

              "You may not have realized when you saw Jacob Appelbaum speak at 29C3 on YouTube that the funny name meant 29th Congress of the Chaos Computer Club in Germany. In this speech, titled "Not My Department," he openly recruits those computer programmers who are working for governments in what he views as "surveillance states" in the West to come "from the dark side" (as he sees their lawful activity) into the "light" -- the dark underground world of anarchist coders he represents."

            I wonder if he had a hand in the twisted and deranged Pinkie Pie cartoons on YouTube that are very Elsagate-ish? After all, whoever is creating the cartoons had to have gotten permission to use the Pinkie Pie character.

            This is so sick.  So very sick.  28 mos?  28 years is more like it.  What do you think he will be doing when he gets out?  I hope no phones are allowed in the jail. Pedos are extremely manipulative and expert groomers, not of just children, but adults as well.  He has groomed himself as well by believing he is not a pedo, oh yeah, that's why he has so many pics and vids.  I get it.  Yeah. Another Bleeping Narcissist.

              I work in a prison. That really doesn't happen anymore. The amount of incarcerated child molesters is staggering these days and they are not being shanked or made into someone's bitch. I know many enjoy this fantasy, but it's just that, a fantasy. Being victimized in prison has everything to do with your behavior and demeanor and rarely anything to do with your offense. I would not look to the penal system for vigilante justice.

               Good for you, it really is a sign of "growing up". No offence meant by that either. Basically, accepting reality is all I mean by it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am basically an AnCap when discussing my "ideal" society but I eventually realized how futile that concept was. Like most "libertarians" we believe in freedom of movement, etc.. But that only works when everyone believes the same thing and there aren't people who want what you have. There will always be "borders" whether imagined on a map or ideological. This brings me back to the original concepts of the constitution as the best "idea" that guarantees personal freedoms while also protecting these ideas and borders (geographic &amp; ideological).

               Sorry for the rant.

            I wonder if there isn't some kind of subliminal message/post hypnotic suggestion incorporated into 1) the cartoon animation and then 2) the porn frames that encourage the user to become increasingly addicted to pedophilia.

             Interesting.  Do you know whether steganography is actuallly being used in cartoons?  If so, I think that warrants a separate post.  Subliminal message inserts are likely part of the mix.

            Is nothing sacred? I'm so sick of these bastards. I watch TV with my 6 year old daughter, thanks to these scumbags I'm constantly looking for pedo shit symbolism. Often find it, like Nella the Princess Knight. It's so blatant.

               You want what? Want me to quote the entire book?

               The quote is quite explicit, the void left by religion is going to get filled over and over again by the same pattern that will come back under a different name

                I thought the quote reflected our lack of need. God of the gaps has so few gaps left to fill.  Philosophy has filled our hearts. Our minds are on the future of our race, not the happiness of a sky father.

            Most artists who use their imaginations to entertain kids are or become pedophiles. Disney? Oh yeah, big time pedo grooming company. Clowns. Magicians. Puppeteers. Candy store owners. Toy store owners.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would be surprised at how much the MSM lies about the real reasons for many deaths and disappearances. Even more surprising was the amount of psychologists and psychiatrists that are jewish, freemasons, mormons, scientologists, they all have their own doctors to treat those kids who are being abused if they talk or show signs they might talk. If so, they get drugged to make them seem semi-retarded so they lose their credibility if it goes to court.  The parents are usually members and in on it. Sometimes their kids are punished if their parents screw up or break a rule within the particular cult they are in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disney is the one who hires the largest amount of fuckos, pushing LGBT stuff in every kid's show. Poor Walt is spinning in his grave.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember the first MLP in the 80s, it went from "be yourself, love your friends, be proud of your family" to "having borders is mean, also lesbian ponies should be accepted now".
           </p>
           <p>
            I let my kids watch the old Hanna Barbara cartoons and lots from the old Looney Tunes creators. Also
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DePatie%E2%80%93Freleng_Enterprises">
             Depatie/Freleng shows are great
            </a>
            . You've got lots of patriotism, classic steorotypes of different nationalities and ethnicities, and much more poltically incorrect honest humor.

             I generally agree with you, but I don't think Walt is spinning in his grave unless by that you mean some kind of a happy dance.

              Why did you get so many downvoats? Guess people don't want to have to realize Walt was most likely a pedo himself.

               I believe Walt Disney was a Nazi fan and also a pedo.  So not sure what your beef is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your comment "Poor Walt must be spinning in his grave" means you think he would be hating what's happened to his company.  I think he'd love it and particularly the pedo push.

               Meryl Streep is Walt Disney's grand niece?  I am totally flabbergasted.  But when I think of it, it's not that hard to believe.  I really despise her.  A Steven S defender.

                The grand niece is Abigail Disney.  Apparently she said that Meryl Streep was right about Disney:
               </p>
               <p>
                "The great-niece of Walt Disney has come out in support of Meryl Streep after the actress's controversial remarks calling the icon 'anti-semitic' and a 'gender bigot.' "
