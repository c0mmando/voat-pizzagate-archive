            I don't mean to nit pic but can you repost this because the search engines wont pick up Gusifer LLC or Patty Paule-Carres? 
I am sure those cousins are up to no good and need as much exposure as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            there is a thread about Winchester VA in pizzagatewhatever (many months ago), with the space camp, and Patty's son Michael Paule Carres has soccer camp and Kalamazoo MI connections.

              As for M. PauleCarres,  ( I think) the Kalamazoo connection was in his linkedin profile, my memory is not 100%, I might be confusing the cousin brothers. One is a construction contractor, the other was going to start a MI soccer program, I hope its all still archived in old threads. (I can't spend as much time here as I used to.)

                the Paule Carres are thick in it.  And weird (maybe) that the husband Glenn (psychiatrist) added the name Carres when he married Patty. He was at Knox College with JPodesta.

            I recall reading a thread about Bright Horizons Friday Child Adoptions and Gusifer LLC and various other companies being listed at 124 Amherst Road in Virginia.  There was, somewhere in that thread a connection to flight simulators or something and it was having something else to do with a thread about some guy who went to disadvantaged countries in South America looking to get kids into these youth soccer camps.  I have absolutely no idea how or if this is connected, but there was definitely something about flight simulatotions in that thread and I can't find it there now. So I was reading the comments to an article about false flag terror and someone left a link about calle fueraventura.  The exact link is too long, but I submitted it anyway and will put it here

            Just Google calle fueraventura flight simulations though and there is some kind of weird looking potential pedo related stuff around page 5 of Google that looks a whole lot like that Chinese/ Norwegian website with the full blown pedo chat room that was found by a reader last November 2016.  I do not have time to research the details at this time and I am in the process of working on election integrity issues.  I noticed how the people who made some of these websites I find when Googling Calle fueraventura also have references to a plane crash in Russia, so I imagine that the kiddie porn one might find if they search deleted conversations maybe will just be said to be the result of " Russian hacking" since that is the way John Podesta rolls.  At least , that is what he did when he said Norwegian state dept was hacked in that recent Politico interview.

            Podesta: "You know, look, there’s a long, complicated story about that. I had assistants that had access to the link. One of them checked what—one of them saw this question, changed the password, asked our cybersecurity expert. He inadvertently told her to click on it, and she did. So, I don’t blame them. I mean, it was, you know, a fast-moving campaign. It’s easy to say, oh, if you’ve already done this and that and the other thing—I think we’re—I’m, you know, I’ve been around for a while. I’m fairly careful. I don’t just go click on random links, and—but, you know, if—I’m sure that if I had gotten the advice to go ahead and click on it, I probably would have done it, too, so you know, it is what it is. And people make mistakes. And if you look—if you think about it, the Bundestag has been hacked, you know, the Norwegian defense department has been hacked, the White House was hacked by the Russians, and the State Department’s been hacked. It’s like, I think you can’t come back and blame the victim for this. This was a crime; it was painful. You know, I thought I was, you know, had a relatively secure profile. It turned out I didn’t, but a lot of other people have fallen prey to fairly sophisticated hackers that are operating under Russian intelligence. In this case, most likely, from the GRU, but it’s Russian military intelligence. It’s pretty sophisticated, so they did this. So, it is what it is. I can’t really beat myself up or beat my team up over that. I just have to move on, and you know, they committed a crime. I was a victim of the crime."
End quote.  Hahaha.  Russians?  He always says Russians.
  We all know about Norway and Operation Darkroom, the pedo bust that seized tons of child porn and disgusting stuff.  Great work to the ones that took those sick Norway pervs down!  I hope you get everyone connected to it.

            That secret chat room which may have led to the FBI tip connected to Operation Darkroom  has been shared by Anonymous which is how we know it had weird stuff in the middle of prescription drug talk, and the website looked Chinese with Chinese letters and wanda hotels  and another had something in Norwegian written under Wanda Hotels 192.  Those all connected to the post about Bright Horizons Fridays Child Adoptions Gusifer LLC and everything else at 124 Amherst Road in Winchester VA because the way you got to the pedo chatroom was by Googling "Bright Horizons Norwegian Cruise" and then Google prompted the " people also search for" and under it there was something about a 13 year old boy and a 6 year old boy.  Knowing how Bright Horizons was a company started by Lamar Alexander, whose former chief of staff was suicided over his potential testimony he was about to give re: a child porn distribution bust related to Azov Films of Toronto and The Franklin Coverup possibly and the Bright Horizons connection to Linda Mason, a Clinton campaign bundler who also was part of USAid in Cambodia where children were trafficked around the time of the Khmer Rouge, I had to look and see why other people were Googling " Bright Horizons Norwegian Cruise 13 year old boy" and so I googled it and accidentally found a pedophile chat room and put the link in a Pizzagate thread and then Anonymous also looked into it AFTER I PUT IT WHERE FBI SAW IT in a grouo with only 3 people in it at that time and ina thread that was immediately taken down.  So nobody can say that anyone hacked into that and planted child porn.  It was there before anyone was even looking into Bright Horizons AT ALL and I told an Anon friend the next day just in case anything happened to me.  When the Operation Darkroom story came out, mainstream media tried to take down that story, but we knew it had to be shared.  I mentioned NOTHING to anyone about how that website- chatroom was found except for what I just told you until a while after Darkroom because I did not want to be a targeted individual.  I do not enjoy EMP attacks on my home.  I have small children here that are more sensitive to these things, so I do hope they cut that out

            Maybe all this info will help someone search all the pages of Google for a deep web hidden chat room connection to calle fueraventura. They could already be onto the fact that this is being investigated, however, so keep that in mind.  A lot of people read Veterns Today.  The weird ones who like kiddie porn may have deleted things.  These false flag plane crash companies related to whatever they might be will certainly be said to be " hacked by Russians" should you find anything good. Of course we know there is a flase flag shooting here in the USA anytime a law about terrorism NSA or gun legislation is on the agenda, so a Podesta connection would not be the least bit surprising.  The Hanford Tunnel collapse false flag makes sense, since in that politico interview, he says he moved to Washington state to be around more " like minded people" and to work on " clean energy" which means nuclear in Podestaspeak even though renewable energy is the only truly clean energy.  I have a feeling Podesta is friends with some people that promote nuclear energy.  Forbes is famous for promoting the nuke gang agenda and at least one person who writes for Forbes was talking in the wanda hotel chat room about how Forbes has the ability to call out comments that are particularly interesting.  I get all my comments called out because they're true .  I would hate to learn that Podesta and the nuke gang are all involved in some giant love fest.  That's too disgusting to visualize. But I know when I was debating a person on my own page about the nuclear industry, someone said " get ready to charge the EMP" so it is a very real possibility.  I'm still not going anywhere.  I mean no harm.  Just trying to save the planet and its inhabitants from pedophiles and  a radioactive death . I have been paying attention for a while now.  I hope somebody digs into this.  The whole point of the link I submitted being in the comments, by the way, was because someone was warning about a plane crash that would happen Jun 7or 8 near the Canary Islands which would be reported as actual news, perhaps by accident.  So the flight simulator connection to the Podestas would be related to false flag terror events.  I already figured this much.  Calle fuera ventura, read every page if Google.  Everyone knows there is more than one page of Google, right?
