            quote from link:
            <code>
             ...the Saudi and US armed and trained ISIS forces counter by moving to retake Palmyra. This game kills people, on a massive scale, and goes on and on.
            </code>
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, the Saudi/USA link is with the purpose of controlling adults in the war game.  When one is exposed  (Bin Laden/Al Quaida)  it's killed off and a new one is started --  all for the purpose of these sick f'ers idea of elite fun and $$.
While the patriotic public happily send themselves and their children to die for these so-called patriotic war games.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Isis/BinLaden/Russia is the elite way to control the adults with fear/war/financial burden,  the pedo-rings are the abusive $$ trafficking and sex or  ritual process of the elite with  children. 
Either way,  it's still all about control and games,  for their fun, pleasure and  $$.
   The mkultra, pharma, bio-techno is all for their advancement so they can live a longer life and have fun playing their  fun games as long as they can.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh yes,  the pedo-rings are only a branch of the sick games and its tentacles touch every aspect;  which is why it had to be leaked by a few  ''good''  ones who knew that it was bigger than them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Professional journalists who have an ounce of intelligence  and integrity while researching this topic can easily link it together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still,  what action can be taken on a larger scale to educate the brainwashed public   to stand up  and clean out this rathole? What can the global public do from  an education standpoint?  Is  the  power structure so far gone that they'ere  now using this to cull out the harcore groups that can't be programmed?
           </p>
           <p>
            For example,  today on youtube I plugged in the words  new pizzagate podesta   but nothing showed up except weeks old vids.
Are the public afraid to  transfer  the information from  these  forums into ytubes for educational purposes?
Has the  media elite done its job to fearmonger ytubers into silence against linking  hashtag pizzagate, thereby stop educating people as to the far-reaching tentacles that is pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Have they won the game?   They do love their  duality games in all flavors.
            <br/>
            I'm so tired of this shit game.  Really, really tired  of it,  yet people can't seem to wake up to the full picture.

             I suggest you are vastly underestimating just what you are up against and are playing right into the hands of those you seek to bring to justice.  I'm certainly not part of the Clinton machine. Rather, I am fully aware of decades of shady dealings by the Clinton's, the Bush's and their close ties to corrupt elements of the intelligence community.  Just what about this post drove you to think I'm not on your side?

            CIA ran MKUltra, the shit they pulled in South America, the drug trafficking and regime change, the using of Nazi's as operatives to staff secret police and perform experiments. Dangerous bastards. In case they are reading, I love the CIA and all of the good they've done in the world, thanks lads.
