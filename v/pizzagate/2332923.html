            Teenagers used to be played by adults. If you parse the productions, you'll see who is running an underage pipeline. But sincerely, just look at Disney movies and shows.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Movies where children are unsupervised by their parent or orphans meet crazy weirdo who tells them they are special in a certain way.
            </li>
            <li>
             TV Shows where a teen girl has two personalities, one being a normal daughter and the other one, a pop star.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            All these things seem like grooming tools produced by rich people for the benefit of other rich people. I mean that is how Hollywood started, as a tool to aid gross old rich men in raping young beautiful actresses. Now it's a huge legit industry full of talented workers who've had enough of this kind of thing, but still, that remains the purpose of Hollywood, lubricating rape.

            Read Dave mcgowans blog about the laurel canyon Hollywood culture. He documented SRA and CP and all the things we are seeing, including government involvement, going back to the beginning of Hollywood; possibly the days of Errol Flynn even. The story about a ritual in his home is still verifiable.

            nobody wanted to talk or think about it. Pedos love that. People imagine justice is served when these guys get caught. People believed in rehabilitation. powerful pedos laugh at that when they get slapped on the wrist. This industry is built on the vain desire to be famous, the parents vicariously achieving their failed dreams and luxury through their kids and by leveraging blackmail on the lower ranks and lackeys to keep things quiet and to protect the cash flow of the powerful ones.

            I would say yes. Look at Disney. It's the origins of children's entertainment. The creator did not only make content that was suppose to brainwash children but used the innocence of the characters so that they would become favored by parents. This eventually led to Walt having what was called "The Mickey Mouse Club" where little kids spend the day at Disneyland. I assume that you can figure out what happened from that point on. Walt was known to have an odd obsession with children's butts. He had a very close connections with Anton Levey - a hardcore satanist - who studied "The Law" (Alister Crowley) and believed that Walt was the man that everyone should follow because he grasp the ideology of lucifarianism and was able to use that by luring in children through cartoons.

            Oh! And also disney movies and cartoons ARE the movies that they use for MK Ultra. Just saying.

            Wow, gamepwn. This is a hard-hitting post. I hadn't seen the list run through in quite this way... Made me think that the whole point of kids channels like Nick and Disney was simply to get more child actors to feed into the snakes. I'm giving this the "Share!" flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            This post, and the comments, also made me realize just how much I love you guys for trying to protect the kids. Most people would just cling to their fantasy and turn a deaf ear. You guys dig up heartwrenching horror after horror, set your faces like flint and go back to dig up more. Sometimes I get tears in my eyes.

             heart wrenching is absolutely correct. I have terrible flashes of these tiny kids screaming bloodcurdling screams in dark rooms somewhere and no one coming to help. It is spine chilling.

             You sound extremely incincere as always. You had the audacity to say "If you care about the damn native children so much..." when you excused yet another deleting on the documentary I posted on the Catholic church mass murder of chilrden in canada. Not suprised this speculative thread is more what you want to promote.

             I was carefully reading each comment because I wanted to make sure Disney was brought up. Especially with the recent arrest of the guy with Disney Studio in California. Or connected to? Should have known it would be you to mention it. Good deal.

             Thank you Vindicator I appreciate it. As much as much of this horrifies me I know what those children must go through is so, so much worse. I and many of us are lucky to live normal lives. The people in the dark that do not know about Pizzagate we just need to lend a hand for when they fall they don't crash. They are just like us, when we were in our little fantasy blue pilled worlds. It's not easy to wake up, to realize reality and our world and civilization was and will never again be like what it seemed it was. Our idols are demons, our scholars are liars, our world leaders are wicked beyond belief. Sometimes even if I have to take a break from all this with my job and college and family and friends and girlfriend and life in general it always is in the back of my head that everything is so twisted and fake and false. So much evil in the world... those children need our help. It's a silent genocide they face and they need to know we're fighting to save them from these monsters.

             He probably killed them.

            <p>
             What the lie is....him commiting suicide and torching the house most likely. My theory is that he was killed by a second person who then set the house on fire as part of a satanic sacrifice (fire frequently plays in role in that, such as in Moloch sacrifices).

             What makes you think so?
            </p>
            <p>
             There are still pedophile producers and directors, pedophilia is still a taboo topic, there are still parents who are either naive or greedy for the money.
            </p>
            <p>
             I doubt that things have changed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason we mostly hear about older cases is it takes years, if not decades, before victims find the strength to speak up, most of them never will.
            </p>
            <p>
             They get threatened and silenced. Statutes of limitations are so low, it often wouldn't make sense to file a case, even if you believe the police and judges are not compromised.

             ding ding. I still fail to understand exactly HOW the
             <strong>
              Olsen
             </strong>
             brand has made billions (rather than millions) over the years. Am I accurate in wondering this? knowing what we all now know, there is part of me that has to ask if they were given multi million $ pay offs over the years for ________ (fill in the blanks)
            </p>
            <p>
             What do other people think. I just know that I'm 'redpill re-thinking' every story that I ever believed to be true about anything.

              They were approached by the elite group to push a clothing line... which is most likely laundering money. It serves two purposes: keeping them quiet (payoff), and laundering money.

              Olsen twin child pornography was highly sought after, the most popular type you could get back then. They loved making the twin cry when they tortured the other. I was a kid when this was happening, but was in and out of the studios because I was also a victim, and family member was a pimp, drug dealer to the stars, and enforcer.

              Some episodes of Full House were 'rolled into' the child abuse videos. Example an aired episode would be spliced into a child porn scene, made to seem like a continuous episode. Videos would be tightly controlled. Some only shown on a private TV screen.
             </p>
             <p>
              The whole set of Full House was a mess. Every actor was trying to gain everyone elses trust. When people complained they would act shocked and say they would fix it. Just to buy time so the child psychologists could tell them they were imagining things, and then hypnotize them. Poor kids couldn't figure out what was going on and cried for help.

              Right, I'm pretty sure those two were most likely iinducted into this cult during gestation, meaning their parents had big plans for them before they were even born and many a Hollywood pervert probably paid tons of money for the pair hundreds of times knowing their obsession with twins. Selling heroin was allegedly another side job and it is rumored they were the supplier of Heath Ledgers hot dose.

Any fashion type who has that type of money would just buy a Birkin. WHO is buying shite from The Row...? Laundering $40k a pop on absolute dogpoop? Why is MK married to that weird ass French prez brother? Political union, but can't figure out how...

               Can we have a thread on the Olsens at some point? Again, knowing what we now know, there is NO WAY, their billion dollar brand was/is legit....wow, all this redpilling is making me want to revisit literally everything we ever thought was true! (SMDH not enough hours in the day)

              Yes, we almost have to review everything from the past.  So can we be truthful, will be review only the ones we can deal with and not the others.  I think so.  But it has been hard for me.  I just thought about Mickey Mouse Club the Old and the Newer version.  Good God it must have been Kiddie Porn everyday.  That is when I have to Change The Channel.

               MM Club, Kids Incorporated. Stacey Ferguson from Kids Inc (now she is singer in Black Eyed Peas) had a crack and meth habit from a young age. Lord knows what that kid has seen, such a beauty she was, when younger.

                I looked up some of the older ones, and Mickey Rooney's 2 boys were working at Disney in the paint dept.  They both got in to trouble and were asked to leave.  Very odd indeed.

            Would not be surprised if while they are raping the Children, that they are filming and creating CP.  This is what they do with the Brownstoning.  But the CP is for their entertainment (Sick) and for making a Bundle.  I can't even think of HO.  It is too painful.  I get sick thinking about it.  The part that is even sicker is the parents.  The mother falling all over Spielberg.  I know she will have no peace until they are exposed.  The day will come.

              Just think. We are just finding out about Katy Perry's past.  We will be living this little girl's horror right along with her.  They will never let her escape their clutches, she is too valuable.

                 Megachurch pastors are all evil. JO is the worst. I got a bad feeling the first time I saw his cheesy hair and smarmy smile. It's like they can't have a successful mega church without that same @#$%ing haircut!!

                  If people would just Wake Up!  It is always staring us right in the face.  People are so gullible.  Do they think these rich people are willing to help us get to where they are?  They don't even want us to have enough to feed our children, let alone ourselves.  Stop Following these heads of your religion.  They are Bleeping Liars.  the pope is one of them.  Osteen is another.  He hangs with Oprah for sure.  Oprah is Poison.  She has been Tainted by the Luciferians like Obama and Friends.  Look at David Geffen's Instagram.  I have posted it a few times, but look who is on there with him on his yacht.  That will tell you who is in on "the joke".  The Joke Is On Us.  All the Pedowoods are on there.  Oprah, Gayle, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, etc.  WAKE UP.

             I can't wait until Spielberg is revealed as the monster that he is. It's horrible taking the Red Pill. I read the book Ready Player One years before Pizzagate and loved it yet I don't even think I even want to give that pedophile monster and Pedowood money by seeing the movie coming out. Poor Heather did not deserve her fate

              Whe will that day be? When they surrender their complete control over the system? When they order the media and authorities to sop being part of the criminal network? Oh wait, a hero will make it all go away won't he? Trump? Please be real. Focus. Now, close your bank accounts. Defund the banks.

               To be absent from the body is to be present with the lord. She is an innocent child and thankfully she is resting peacefully. We however are not because we know what kind of sickness is in this world roaming free. And what is worse is the innocent kids who are being abused right now. They need peace!

                Yes she certainly would be with the Lord.  But her rapists must be brought to justice.  Many souls cannot rest until the job is done.  I am a firm believer in this.  Also it sets things in place.  The world must know what they did to her.  They must not escape.  That is all I am saying.  But yes, those that are here must gain Peace on Earth.

              Ugh.  In the early days there were Cubby and Karen and the Two grown ups were Jimmy and another guy.  I just loved that show and now when I think what those guys might have been doing to those children.  I remember one of the boys dying in an accident.  I just now remembered. it.  I should look it up.  Oh God.

            All of hollywood is a front for money laundering of drugs ..child traffckking...organ trafficking...huge amounts of money can and is moved from production to distribution to unauditable box office ticket sales...
In fact all cinema across the planet especially in india..are essential fronts.for.the black money created from criminal enterprises..the huge amounts of paper debt notes generated from criminalnactivity..has to have a route to turn it into white.money in the banking system

             I have to add that everyone seems to overlook the elephant in the room, which for me, is the gaming industry. Yes movies and TV but the video games are PROGRAMMING junior while mom and dad sit in the living room watching Netflix. There are back doors built into games now and the agencies are all over this for recruiting purposes as well as....well just WATCH the games, what they are promoting. The video game companies are in all likelihood run the same as production companies that produce film and TV. One more thing to add, film companies use their connections to smuggle children and arms across borders. All something needs to be basically given a green light to pass through borders is "this is part of the production company now filming in ...." fill in the blank. Because film companies generate so much money for the local country that is being used for the location, EVERYONE looks the other way.

              I'm reposting the comment I made two days ago about how the pedophile globalists' instigation of mass immigration of Muslims to Europe and Canada is undermining Western values and cultural traditions:
             </p>
             <p>
              I&gt;t's an important piece of the puzzle to understand how 'our' elite pedophiles try to normalize pedophilia - by instigating Muslim mass immigration to Europe or Canada.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Many newspapers and magazines in Europe have been publishing 'heartbreaking' stories of underage girls at age 14 or 15 who are desperately 'in love' with their older husbands.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's part of the psy-op to undermine Western values and to normalize pedophilia. Thus, relevant to pizzagate.

               </p>
