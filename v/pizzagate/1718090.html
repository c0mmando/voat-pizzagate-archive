            FINDING FOUNDATION TAX RETURNS:
           </p>
           <p>
            I submitted the following comment about Not-for-Profit digging in this thread:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1694321">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1694321
            </a>
            .  I'm reposting here as people might find it useful because it contains links to some of the McCain Institute IRS forms that the article mentions.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's been lots of discussions that involve these not-for-profit (NFP) organizations, but I've not found where anybody on the forum here has talked about the tax returns for these not-for-profits. The IRS requires that NFPs file some form of a 990 form each year to maintain their tax-exempt status (there are 990-EZs for simple organizations and the bigger 990s for more complex organizations). These tax returns ARE SUBJECT TO PUBLIC INSPECTION. Therefore, lots of organizations post them on their websites and there are other charitable organization ratings/monitoring companies that also make these returns available (e.g. www.guidestar.org).
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the McCain Institute Foundation 's 44-page 990 form for 2014 is here:
           </p>
           <p>
            2014 McCain Institute Foundation tax return: (
            <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/306548232/McCain-Institute-2014-990">
             https://www.scribd.com/document/306548232/McCain-Institute-2014-990))
            </a>
            ))
           </p>
           <p>
            What's interesting about these returns is that besides the income and expenses of the organization, they list the directors and lots of other pertinent information, like the names of organizations to which they give grants or make donations as well as people/organizations from whom they receive contributions in excess of $5,000. If you look at this McCain Institute 2014 return, you'll see that the Royal Embassy of Saudia Arabia contributed $1,000,000 to the McCain Institute in 2014. There are others listed as well: The Eranda Foundation from the UK -- I don't know who they are but they donated $300,000 in 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, this particular 990 has a 23-page Investments Schedule attached to it which details, for example, how many shares in the HSBC FDS Hedge fund they own. (Didn't I see a post earlier today talking about HSBC's link to money laundering for some of these criminals?) All of which is to say that there's a huge amount of information on these IRS public record tax returns.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been trying to do some research on a few of these NFPs, which I will post when it's in better order, but for now, I want people to know this resource is out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the IRS website to find an EIN (Employer Identification Number) for NFPs:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?searchChoice=pub78&amp;dispatchMethod=navigateSearch&amp;pathName=forwardToPub78Search&amp;submitName=Return+to+Search">
             https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?searchChoice=pub78&amp;dispatchMethod=navigateSearch&amp;pathName=forwardToPub78Search&amp;submitName=Return+to+Search
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The search criteria requires you to put the name in quotes to have a manageable list (e.g., "McCain Institute" pulls up just the one).
           </p>
           <p>
            The beauty of having an EIN is that it's very specific, so it's easily searched on google. For example, I entered the EIN for "Innocents at Risk" and the top five items were ALL pertinent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also these are usually available as downloadable pdfs so that helps in countering the disappearing-evidence problem that we all keep seeing.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if people can get started pulling the 990 forms for all of these various NFPs that are tied into all of this, they will give us lots of leads to work with. Organizations that don't post their 990s are supposed to provide them upon request.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry I can't take more time right now, but I will happily answer questions if anybody has any related to this post. (I'm no tax expert or anything, but I do have a bit of familiarity with 990-EZs.)

            Ok so most money went to the ASU Foundation. President and CEO of ASU Foundation being Rick Shangraw.

            Rick Shangraw: As founder and CEO of Project Performance Corporation, a research and technology consulting firm specializing in environmental, energy and information management issues. During his tenure, PPC received the Inc. 500 Award for being one of the fastest-growing, privately-held companies in the United States. (1991-2004, McLean Va)

            ✓&amp;company_facet=Project+Performance+Corporation&amp;q=) It would seem that the Project Performance Corporation seems to have ties with the following: Security Clearance, Signals Intelligence, SIGINT database, SAIC, PRISM, Secret Clearance, Stratfor, Palantir, SIGINT, TAPERLAY, SIGINT metadata, Six3 Systems, OPSEC NSA, SURREY, Pluribus International, Pinwale, ODNI, SCADA, IC CIO, ADNI CIO, DNI CSE, EDS IA, military, program manager, operations manager, LLC, Navy, USDA, Telecommunications Industry, Energy Industry, Retail Industry, DIA SIA, IDIQ, Oracle Corp, CIA

            Edit: Shangraw serves on the boards of several programs and institutes, including the McCain Institute for International Leadership, the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability and The Sustainability Consortium, and he chairs the board of directors of the ASU Foundation’s Arizona Technology Enterprises.

               McCain Institute gave ASU 1,500,000 in 2015 or 2016 I believe. ASU gives to a lot of various causes, but I think one of them may be the Sedona Forum, where McCain can perhaps drum up future political donations?  The whole thing stinks.  The ThinkTank/University/Corporate/Transnationalist intersections have been working towards the post nation state world.  They almost succeeded had Hillary won (and the fight isn't over).  NGOs, Think Tanks, CSOs, are the political 'nesting dolls' of subversion.  For example, one organization, say IREX (mentioned by Hillary in 2010), will have a number of initiatives, each initiative can be linked to say 8 'partners' which themselves are connected to say 20 organizations, which nest into more etc. etc. etc.  I'm sure there are total money laundering schemes embedded in there, covert government entities and operations, hiding the abuse of power while taking credit for whatever real charity dollars might be spent to 'legitimize' the network of lies.

                Psychological Warfare Specialist in the US Army

               from 1968 until 1990 :
               <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2005/3233aquino_profile.html">

               .  Fort Huachuca is the centre for miliatry intelligence apparently, and that includes surveillance, satellites, cyberwarfare and the like.  So lots of spying.  Psychological warfare also seems to be part of their remit. The University of Arizona Foundation is very much involved with satellite technology development which ties in with the needs of the milatry base and curiously, has connections with the Vatican due to their Lucifer telescope.  The fort has a reputation with conspiracy theorists who speculate about underground bunkers and aliens.  The fact that McCain's Institute has a convention in Sedona with people like Rothschilds etc. just seems to me to have an other worldly feel to the connections.  It feels like there is something that we haven't been told.

            These so called " charityFoundations" have been proven to be a shady front for politicians to receive bribes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its about time Trump sign an executive order banning all US politicians from starting or having links to any "charity foundation"

             That is a great idea.  Ex.Order.  Tweet Campaign.  I don't have acct.  but this is a really great idea.  #Ex.Order#Stop#PolFound. or something similar.  This could be the beginning of our campaign.  We must start somewhere and this would surely attract attention and not get us the "nut job" responses.

            I believe hes dirty.  However to do adequate research one would need to analyze all the tax returns not just a small sampling.   I believe they are all public record and available to all.
