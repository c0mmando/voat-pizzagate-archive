            Launched in 2010 by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Alliance eyes adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels in 100 million households globally by 2020. It advocates for alternatives to open air stoves, whose pollution levels jeopardize individual and community health. The group is “building bridges between the public and private sectors to make the basic but essential act of cooking safe and healthy worldwide,” notes Alliance Executive Director Radha Muthiah.

            World famous celebrities on the golf course for charities
           </p>
           <p>
            05/07/2002 - SOS Children's Villages Sweden is the major beneficiary of a big celebrity event being held this summer where former president Bill Clinton will be in the spotlight.
           </p>
           <p>
            On 6 - 7 July, Bill Clinton will be in Stockholm to hold a seminar and to play golf. The former president will take part in a two-day golf tournament with a number of well-known sport and movie stars, including ski stars Ingemar Stenmark, Alberto Tomba and Franz Klammer, footballer Henrik Larsson, hockey ace Peter Forsberg, singer Alice Cooper and movie star Stacey Keach. Sven Göran Eriksson, manager of the England football team, will hand out the prizes. The event is expected to draw a big audience and all money raised from the entrance fees will go to charities, with SOS Children's Villages Sweden as the major beneficiary.

            BILL CLINTON &amp; BUSH IN HAITI

           <p>
            SOS Children's Villages Playing Prominent Role in Helping Haiti's Children
           </p>
           <p>
            Even before the January earthquake, many Haitian families lived in dire poverty that left them unable to care for their children. SOS Children's Villages has been providing loving homes to orphaned and abandoned Haitian children for three decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            SOS's work in Haiti has earned the group great trust on the ground. SOS-Haiti made news on January 30, when the Haitian government handed to SOS's Santo Children's Village 33 children for safekeeping. These were the children whom a U.S. church group, claiming the boys and girls were orphans, had attempted to take out of the country without official approval.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the wake of natural disaster, SOS-Santo is providing shelter, food, and medical care to 500 children. Orphaned or separated from their parents, the children are deeply traumatized by the death and destruction they saw all around them. SOS-Santo has arranged for psychologists to work regularly with the children. Teenagers living in the SOS Children's Villages are helping their younger SOS brothers and sisters deal with emotional loss through activities like singing, dancing, and painting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reuniting and Strengthening Families are SOS Priorities
           </p>
           <p>
            SOS believes that children belong with their biological families whenever possible. SOS-Haiti has been taking great efforts to reunite the children under its care with their parents. Reunification has already taken place for most of the 33 children who had been in the news; none of them are orphans. When families are unable to adequately care for their children, SOS gives them financial and other support to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            At present, SOS is helping the wider Haitian community by distributing food and other necessities to vulnerable families through 89 distribution points. In total, SOS is supporting 13,000 Haitian children with food, water, and medical attention.
