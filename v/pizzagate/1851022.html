            I have  just a few links and a few notes on Project Spade, so many topics in PG, haven't dug deep into this one.
But first:  It is believed that that the same pedophile ring involved in the Franklin Scandal, found GOP protection, moving it's network from Nebraska to Tennessee, "which the Bush family considers a personal political fiefdom".

            Project Spade
           </p>
           <p>
            The three-year undercover project, named Project Spade, began back in 2010 when Toronto police officers first made contact with a man who had been sharing “very graphic images” of child sexual abuse.
What they eventually found was a full blown child porn production and distribution company in Toronto that was distributing their content online. The site was run by 42-year old Brian Way and sold and distributed images of child exploitation to people across the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The films were sold in 94 countries.  Among the countries involved in the investigation were Australia, Spain, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Greece and the Republic of Ireland.

Son of George Downsbrough, Sr., Bruce O. Downsbrough, served beginning in 2003 as chief operating officer of the University of Tennessee Foundation, which serves as the fundraising arm of the state university. Lamar Alexander had previously served as president of the University of Tennessee. Downsbrough was installed in his position despite a prior conviction for child molestation.

           <p>
            Previously he was an executive at Colorado University Foundation, and in 1986 had been charged for molesting two underage boys in Boulder, CO.  Colorado Supreme Court merely froze his law license because of unstated disability.

            Ryan Loskarn CP Distributor, Chief of Staff Sen. Lamar Alexander..arrested in Dec. 2013, in connection to Project Spade, arrest was reportedly the 'tip of the iceburg' of connections in TN.  Released into his parents custody, against the wishes of the prosecutor due to suicide risk. His body was found hanging from a rope end on Jan 23. Foregoing an autopsy, CME for State of Maryland in Baltimore did called it a suicide from a visual look.

            The network of child care providers linked to Alexander is also linked to the University of Tennessee and Penn State University, the latter the nexus for the pedophilia scandal involving former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky and his The Second Mile Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            TN contracted the services of OMNI VISIONS, (CEO Jim Henry, close GOP associate of Alexandar, close ally to TN Gov Bill Haslam) to developmentally disabled and troubled children.  OMNI VISIONS cited in several legal cases for placing children with convicted pedophiles, or with abusive staff, and there are cases of children dying at the hands of OMNI VISIONS care providers

            These are the sort of people the Hampstead kids have accused and everyone who doesn't believe them have said because the list of culprits is too unbelievable to be true. This story adds weight to their claims.

            Maybe we've missed this as it happened between 2010-2013.
           </p>

            Project Spade was revealed to public on Nov 14, 2013 at a press conference at Toronto Police Headquarters. I think this is still an important news (widely copied by alternative media even yet), and especially important regarding pizzagate investigations because of:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As a result of the investigation thus far, 50 people were arrested in Ontario, 58 in the rest of Canada, 76 in the United States, and 164 internationally.
            </p>
            <p>
             What was most alarming, Inspector Beaven-Desjardins said, was that many of the arrests were of people who
             <strong>
              worked with or closely interacted with children
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Among those arrested were 40 school
             <strong>
              teachers
             </strong>
             , nine
             <strong>
              doctors
             </strong>
             and
             <strong>
              nurses
             </strong>
             , six
             <strong>
              law enforcement
             </strong>
             personnel, nine
             <strong>
              pastors
             </strong>
             and
             <strong>
              priests
             </strong>
             and three
             <strong>
              foster parents
             </strong>
             , she said.

            The news were originally shared by Associated Press, then at least by
            <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/nearly-400-children-rescued-348-adults-arrested-canadian-child-pornography-f2D11599561">
             NBC News
            </a>
            and most recently (like the one you found) by several alternative media sites. Worth an upvote from me at least, thanks.
