            Just a word to the people of De. and surrounding states, if he needs to be delivered for prosectuion. Hopefully, people in Noncy Nancy's state feel the same about her. Sick is as sick does. Thank you to researchers, rescuers and all witnesses to research. We are in your debt. May God The Creator of All bless you and keep you safe in His works.

            It's seven women now....and counting....

             </a>
             with complaints about how uncomfortable the Democrat former vice president made them feel.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can actually just see it in the videos circulating. Girls freezing up.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality is that women are becoming less tolerant of groping disguised as benign social interaction. We know the difference. Here’s a clue: if a woman flinches as she is hugged, perhaps that contact was unwanted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Instinctively we know when our personal space is invaded, and this is not about being repressed or uptight. If these politicians cannot read this, then what the hell are they doing?
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember a time in the late 90s when a lot of New Labour types went from geeks to ministers and were sent for media training. Suddenly they were all looking you in the eye, touching your arm and saying your name too much. “Stop it!” I used to want to scream, because it was horrendous.
            </p>
            <p>
             They had all seen Bill Clinton work his magic … the handshake where you move one hand on the arm further up the elbow. Clinton made everyone feel so special and we all know exactly where that led.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no such thing as “connection” without consent. If powerful men have somehow managed not to notice the consent requirement it is because they get off on embracing those with less power.
            </p>
            <p>
             This doesn’t make women merely uncomfortable, it makes some of us rigid with anger. Get off us.'
            </p>

            She should have mentioned all the kids Biden groped, too.

             Imagine having such a low moral gauge that your childs well being sits second to a co-workers public image? Nothing in the actions of any politician supports a claim to being human. They simply disqualify themselves from the species. I'm the great great grandson of America's most prolific executioner and his spirit is screaming at me to enact Justice. The blood of great men boils within us all. by trial or by combustion, these creatures will pay.

            They have different levels of "membership" to the CAMP but they don't say what all the "benefits" are... its of course implied for all the sick people wanting in in the membership "colour codes"... top being purple, the very favorite colour of the luciferians...
           </p>
           <p>
            They have an American flag in one ad in the magazine but the colour is skewed to purple with a tagline: mixing up the red, white and blue...

              Rehoboth Beach is also known as one of the mid-Atlantic coast's popular LGBT-friendly getaways because of the large number of LGBT-owned and operated businesses and because of the LGBT-frequented stretch of beach near Queen Street at the south end of the boardwalk, known as Poodle Beach.[18][19][20] Poodle Beach attracts gay men while North Shore Beach within Cape Henlopen State Park attracts lesbian women.[21]

              Oh man that is the definition of depravity.  IMHO if ever the reset switch was to "be hit" by whoever/whatever hits it for the next cataclysm, it would be because of depravity like this being widespread.
             </p>
             <p>
              When/if shit like this and lets say something as fucked as cannabalism ever became mainstream? bring on the flood.  IMHO I think thats why the floods came in the past, because the babylonian religion (virus, luciferianism) spread everywhere and spread its depravity with it.  Demon worship... Child sacrifice.  disgusting.

            I just noticed something even more suspicious. She's not saying Joe and the grandkids would play games, only the kids. Which would suggest they were taught it at another time and it stuck with them because this man told them its the magic word.

            That just screams grooming. Anything that involves adults teaching children to keep secrets or have magic codewords is dodgy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember during the 90s when parents and teachers were so worried about child grooming with the internet picking up speed, that they drummed it into our heads it was wrong to keep secrets. That we should always be able to talk about things we might feel uncomfortable about, such as a neighbour or relative touching us and then asking us to keep it a secret.

              Happy shiney photoshoot compatible children is an alter as much as any other..or is Pelosi signalling that it's now open season on Biden....it makes no sense.. it's everything a code phrase ought to be... cant slip into normal conversation by accident and no mistaking what you've just heard...but Ive been in MKU for so long.. I think Im seeing triggers everywhere... lol.

              It creeps me out to think this way but....
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Open Sesame opens the mouth of a cave in which forty thieves have hidden a treasure.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sesame seeds grow in a seed pod that splits open when it reaches maturity.
              </p>
              <p>
               The phrase possibly alludes to unlocking of treasures.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sesame is connected to Babylonian magic practices which used sesame oil.
              </p>

             <p>
              Also interesting discussions on how open sesame is akin to a password. Yes I do think its an MKUltra phrase/password. To be honest I think Pelosi is also brainwashes. Lets face it they are all under the sick spell of Evil.

              Biden Has A Major Ukraine Problem
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Joe Biden appears to have made a major tactical error last year when he bragged to an audience of foreign policy experts how he threatened to hurl Ukraine into bankruptcy if their top prosecutor, General Viktor Shokin, wasn't immediately fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             relevant video footage:

             </a>
             <em>
              (from 52:00)
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden described how he threatened Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in March 2016 that the Obama administration would pull $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, sending the former Soviet republic toward insolvency, if it didn’t immediately fire Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time," Biden said at the Council on Foreign Relations event - while insisting that former president Obama was complicit in the threat.
            </p>
            <p>
             And why would Biden want the "son of a bitch" fired?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In what must be an amazing coincidence, the prosecutor was leading a wide-ranging corruption investigation into a natural gas firm - which Biden's son, Hunter, sat on the board of directors.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden’s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts — usually more than $166,000 a month — from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015,
              <strong>
               during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.
              </strong>
              -The Hill
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              And before he was fired, Shokin says he had made "specific plans" for the investigation - including "interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Joe Biden "clearly had to know" about the probe before he insisted on Shokin's ouster.

             <p>
              "LEWES, Delaware—The whispers about Dr. Earl Bradley started years ago in this sleepy fishing village of 3,000. But most parents didn’t believe the rumors until Bradley was arrested and subsequently charged this week in the largest child-abuse case in U.S. history."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Bradley’s office, on a busy highway surrounded by strip malls and convenience stores, looked from the outside like one of the many little amusement parks that dot the landscape of these small beach communities......But beneath the façade, in the basement of the little white house and in the adjacent out-buildings, the kindly bearded doctor was, authorities now say, systematically raping and abusing the children that parents trusted him to care for.
             </p>
             <p>
              Monday, Delaware Attorney General BEAU BIDEN charged Bradley with 571 separate counts of abusing 103 children and said he expects the number of victims to grow dramatically as the investigation continues. Biden also is investigating how the system failed these children, how complaints about Bradley were ignored, and why colleagues with suspicions never reported him."

              Media Matters founder accuses gay ex-lover of blackmailing him for $850K after breakup
By DAILY MAIL REPORTER 
UPDATED: 18:58 EDT, 27 February 2012
             </p>
             <p>
              "David Brock, the founder of the liberal media watchdog organization Media Matters, was blackmailed for $850,000 by his gay ex-lover who threatened to reveal information about the nonprofit group's finances to donors and the IRS, according to dueling lawsuits.
             </p>
             <p>
              "In May 2010, Brock says his lover sent an e-mail to him and his new partner JAMES ALEFANTIS that read: 'David, You and James pulled this same kind of sick nonsense in 2008 to try to hide your financial malfeasance.
In order to pay the handsome sum, Brock SOLD a historic $1.5 MILLION HOME he owned in REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware, the author claims."
             </p>
             <p>
              "It's unclear exactly what information Grey was threatening to unveil, however, he seemed to understand that Brock traveled in powerful political circles.
             </p>
             <p>
              'Please finish this today so I don’t have to waste my time emailing anyone – Biden, Coulter, Carlson, Huffington, Drudge, Ingraham,' he allegedly said in a 2008 e-mail.
             </p>
             <p>
              He makes reference to Vice President Joe Biden...."  Or was it BEAU Biden....
