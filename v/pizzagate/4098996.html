<p>This picture of available wifi spots was taken by him, I\'ve typed multiple names of wifi spots to see if he was maybe in some more official place and found that HKETO leads me to this place:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong+Economic+and+Trade+Office/@38.9102095,-77.0424632,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b7c6f70c4dfd:0x29655b72cf8b06ca!8m2!3d38.9102095!4d-77.041916">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong+Economic+and+Trade+Office/@38.9102095,-77.0424632,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7b7c6f70c4dfd:0x29655b72cf8b06ca!8m2!3d38.9102095!4d-77.041916</a></p>
<p>Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>By looking for other locations I\'ve found that there is lawyer with Goldstein in name and it is possible match for &quot;Goldstein Law&quot; from Jabbaroos picture of wifi spots: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goldstein+%26+Associates+PC/@38.9098409,-77.0420281,19.12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sGoldstein+Law!3m4!1s0x0:0x6b2b9e3516e2d727!8m2!3d38.909896!4d-77.041022">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goldstein+%26+Associates+PC/@38.9098409,-77.0420281,19.12z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sGoldstein+Law!3m4!1s0x0:0x6b2b9e3516e2d727!8m2!3d38.909896!4d-77.041022</a></p>
<p>And it is only 70-80 meters from Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington D.C location although on jabbaroos picture it would seems as if he was closer to HEKTO that Goldstein Lawyer location.</p>
<p>It looks like this now:</p>

<p>I\'ve also spotted that one of the pictures posted by him seems to fit the architecture of some residential areas around this place, however it\'s very hard to nail exact location and I\'m still looking for it:</p>

<p>If we are to believe this bio posted in original thread in 2016: <a href="https://archive.fo/YlfRz">https://archive.fo/YlfRz</a> Then he would be black but we already identified on his Instagram, and with his presence on adoption day video and pictures of his friends throughout social media - that he\'s white ginger. </p>
<p>This is not conclusive but it definitely looks like a lead and to sum it up again, there\'s only one HKETO in D.C. and only one near location that could be identified with Goldstein Law, we know Justin Barrows probably lives in D.C. or at least has very close ties in there, but more likely he lives there.</p>',

            Great research, Heisenberg. The way you've archived all this and laid out these graphics is terrific. The comments on the mural were highly disturbing. Is the theory that he was doing work on a building in the area of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office?  I find it hard to believe a guy in construction could afford to live in the immediate area, but if he does, maybe that is an anomaly worth investigating...

            I was curious about the FBI wifi hotspots also in his pic. Do the FBI really advertise they're surveilling in the area by naming their hotspots in such an obvious maner? That seems a bit of a stretch to believe.

            I notice that there is an Episcopal church right on the corner across from the Iraqi Cultural Office. They have an interesting history which involved horrible arson in the 1970s and recent construction commercializing their property:

             Can't really say if he lives there or was doing works there because not enough intel on that, but looking at original from 2016 about him that gave location we are likely to rule out that location because it says about ethnicity of his "black". I would say both work and home theory would be valid here. Probability that he lives somewhere in this area of D.C. is rising with facts that he pictured other localization in close proximity.

              So I found some weird stuff poking around. I went back to the original post in your other link, which lists his income as $47k (half the DC average) and address as 1315 Gallantin St. NW. I went to street view at that location to see if it was an apartment building or sketchy part of town. It's a house. As I was trying to get a look at it, I noticed that the house right next door, 1311 Gallantin, is
              <a href="https://archive.vn/xwcIV">
               blurred out on Google Street View's latest 2019 pic
              </a>
              . I find that really weird. I could not tell from the street view which address is 1315 Gallantin and which is 1311 -- or which is blurred. From satellite view,
              <a href="https://archive.vn/0dZea">
               it looks like the houses on either side are duplexes
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              So then I went back to the source link and poked around some more. I clicked "Personal Arrest Records and 4 Secrets" in the
              <a href="https://archive.fo/YlfRz">
               original Identity Pages archive
              </a>
              linked there and it opened a TruthFinder.com search. I went through all the steps at that site and got a list of numerous Justin Barrows all over the country. I clicked the closest one, which was in New Haven, CT. It popped up a warning page that this Justin Barrows
              <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/zczals.png">
               is on a government watch list
              </a>
              . The site warned me information on this individual contained material inappropriate for those under 18, then wanted a name and email address to view the information. I did not go any further than that, but obviously it bears further looking into!
             </p>
             <p>
              The Barrows in CT was listed as 50 years old, and the Barrows in the original research four years ago was listed as born in 1975. They may not be the same guy.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, this clearly needs further research. I'm giving both your submissions the Potential Lead flair, Heisenberg, in hopes others will help dig.

               Looks like there are probably two guys of the same name, one white and one black. This Comet guy didn't look like he'd be that old, when adjusted for time, so the 50 year old - possibly black guy - has got to be ruled out, right?

                The allegedly black guy is the one listed as born in 1975 -- so he would be younger.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you look at
                <a href="https://archive.vn/EmIZl">
                 the Zillow page for 1315 Gallatin
                </a>
                where the 1975 black Barrows lives, you'll see it is a $950k home estimated to rent out at $3000/month. The black Barrows listed as living there was also listed as only earning $47k a year. Now, it's a 6 bedroom 2.5 bath house between two duplexes, so chances are good that whoever owns it is using it as a rental property and Barrows is merely renting it with others, which might make it affordable. The construction contractors I know, however, tend to live outside of town and own their own homes so they can store all their tools and materials. That may not be feasible in DC, though.

                That might give us a point of comparison, in case these may be relatives of Justin Barrow. Further digging into them would be a good idea.

                 Guy in the middle. If that black woman is his wife [the one he is kissing on his FB profile picture?] then her name is Vanessa Thomas:
                 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vanessa.thomas.3386585">
                  https://www.facebook.com/vanessa.thomas.3386585
                 </a>
                 And we could track his location through tracking her own location : )
                </p>
                <p>
                 He blocked me but I believe this is his FB profile:
                 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cutterfingers">
                  https://www.facebook.com/cutterfingers
                 </a>
                 and the background picture should have a like from poanessa according to my memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If that's his mother or something that's not necessary bringing us closer to his location as he is adult however there may be some hints there:

                 The Barrows described as black is also "Justin P Barrows" and is also "married" so that fits and I believe we have some fitting piece in here. Your theory about him being inaccurately described as "black" in that old bio could be legit.

               I've seen that house before, it is visible from the side like this:

               Is that it says this:

               And from that point it doesn't allow me to load more. If I remember well there was more on mega file but I can't really say for sure.

               Another possible address or something associated with him was posted here but I can't find where that is { if that's address at all }

               Around 50 years old wouldn't be that far off. We know that James Alefantis is not that far from that age? However if Barrows from that bio is indeed black then that's not the same guy as the one we're investigating for 100%.

                I could see a public data aggregator picking up a piece of data like him being Black and it not being accurate. All he'd have to have done is list himself as Black on some college application or small business loan doc to get preferential treatment a la Elizabeth Warren, and it could get incorporated into his public record. They don't vet these data on these sites for accuracy.

                Has anyone found a Justin P. Barrows in DC that IS black?

                Why is it or the site next to it blurred out, now?

                 Could be legit theory too. Hard to tell. If we could identify some place pictured by him on his Instagram as near to that house 1310 Gallatin St NW - that would definitely be a strong lead. Need to search around this area and compare with IG pics.
