<p>I found [this article](https:/  /drwatsontea.ru  /en/sup-iz-detei-v-kitae-sup-iz-mladencev-sup-iz-mladenca/) on humans eating babies, fetuses and placentas to prolong life. Many believe eating babies is good for health. This is happening in China.  I do not post this to provoke any anti-China sentiment, but to show why there would be a market for trafficking babies and encouraging abortions, and that there is a market for babies for those who believe that eating them increases health, vitality and longevity.  They call unborn babies \'uterine fruit\', and the more developed the fetus, the greater the health benefits.  
</p>
<p>Some Chinese clinics offer human babies and fetus as a \'medicine\' for their patients. One patient claims that eating babies cured his asthma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the cutting table was a small corpse of a baby who was only 5 months old. The cook apologized to him that the baby was very small.</p>
<p>He did not say what their purchase price was, but said that it depends on the size of the baby and whether he is alive or dead. These are mostly girls. Everyone sitting at the restaurant table that evening poured soup on plates, shared the baby’s meat and ate everything with relish. </p>
<p>The Hong Kong monthly magazine Next Magazine recently published an article stating that dead babies and embryos are the Chinese most valuable delicacy. The article also described all the details of the storage and preparation of this &quot;delicacy&quot;.</p>
<p>The young human body, she said, has much more beneficial properties than the placenta. However, such a delicacy is not available to everyone. Those who do not have certain connections have to write on long lists in anticipation of the human body.</p>
<p>Male embryos are considered the most valuable.</p>
<p>At the request of the magazine staff, Liu showed the place where the embryos are being prepared. In the eyes of astounded journalists, she cut the uterine fruit into pieces and cooked soup from it.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not worry, this is just meat, and nothing more than a highly developed animal, ”she said during the process. According to the customs of the region, before being cooked, the embryos are burned in the hearths.</p>
<p>In some restaurants in southern Guangdong you can order a very popular dish: a soup of a six-seven-month-old baby with medicinal herbs. The cost of this soup is from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Small uterine fruits are boiled for soup. Late uterine fruits are eaten like fried milk pigs.</p>
<p>…  doctors in Shenzhen clinics eat dead uterus after an abortion. Doctors defended their actions, arguing that the embryos are beneficial for skin condition and general health. Soon, the city already said that doctors in the city recommend uterine fetuses as a firming agent. </p>
<p>On March 7, a reporter came to the Shenjiang State Women\'s and Children\'s Health Center and pretending to be sick, asked the doctor for uterine fetus. The doctor said that they ended in their unit and asked to come another time.</p>
<p>The next day, the reporter came to a lunch break. When the doctor finally left the operating room, she had in her hands a glass bottle full of embryos the size of a thumb. The doctor said: “There are 10 fruits, all aborted this morning. You can take them. We are a state clinic and give them free. ”...  In a clinic on Bong Men Lao Street, they ask for $ 300 for one fetus. The director of the clinic is a man of about 60 years old. When he saw an unhealthy reporter, he offered him 9-month uterine fetuses, which, he claimed, had the best healing properties. When a female doctor named Young ... from the Shin Hua Clinic was asked if the uterine fruits are edible, she warmly declared: “Well, of course. They are even better than the placenta. They can make your skin smoother, your body tighter, and they are good for your kidneys. When I was in the military hospital of Jiangti province, I often brought fetuses home. ”...</p>
<p>“At first I felt awkward, but the doctors told me that the substances contained in the uterus would help me get rid of asthma. I started taking them, and gradually the asthma disappeared, &quot;said Cheng ...</p>
<p>Zoe Keen, a 32-year-old woman with beautiful skin for her age, attributes her well-preserved appearance to a fetal diet. As a doctor at the Long Hu Clinic, Zou had abortions to several hundred patients. She believes the fetuses are very nutritious, and claims she has eaten more than 100 in the last six months. She takes out a sample of the fetus in front of the reporter and explains the selection criteria. </p>
<p>“Eating uterus is a form of traditional Chinese medicine, and has deep roots in Chinese folklore ...,” he says.</p>

            Yes its real. But dont confuse the practise with satanism.  You need to understand that Chinese are more concerned with recuperating the Chi of the body of the child by consuming it.    Its a horrific practise that needs to stop.  Dark magic techniques include drying out foetuses and gold leafing the body to make golden children dolls.  To make good luck charms.. the idea being tou bind the soul of the child to you and make it your servant to bring good luck to you... Dont trust them.. the entire chinese economy is based on drugs.  Ever since their Empire was broken by Opium.  All for a cup of tea...

            I couldn't read all of that and continue to feel good, so I won't for now. But do you think maybe some of these ultra wealthy people indulge in this eating babies? Does the Queen of England have them delivered to her Palace like she would fresh fish? Is this what PP is used for?

             I have no idea. I do believe the ultra-rich are always looking for transgressive ways to deal with their boredom. I know that social mores do not apply to the elite. I know they have the money and the means to indulge their whims. I do believe there is a group of people who believe there is power and good health to be had from eating babies and children. I don't think that the Queen eats children. I think PP is used by the higher-ups to destroy humanity.

            Not sure this is real. Although Next Magazine of Hong Kong is a real tabloid, nothing comes up when you search for it and "child soup" to confirm an article was published there as this Russian cooking site claims. Also, in the article you've linked it says:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The interest in this phenomenon is so great that the editors could no longer remain silent. Using our connections among the very top of the CCP, we managed to get into the most closed restaurant for the Chinese elite, located in the most secret underground complex under Tiananmen Square. At the dinner, where the entire Magazy editorial staff was invited in full force, the table was bursting with food, and we managed to try even such rare dishes as the bone marrow of the phoenix and dragon liver. But the soup from the babies was not there. Then we conducted a special investigation, and found out that the soup of infants is not really a dish of Chinese cuisine, but comes from the journalistic kitchen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main ingredient of the dish are, of course, photographs. Surprisingly, given the extreme prevalence of eating babies in China (as follows from the hype in the media around this issue), the same photographs are used in all articles about babies soup without exception (sometimes they also use photoshop). And they were not made at all in a restaurant specializing in the preparation of babies, as these articles narrate in chilling tones. These photos belong to Zhu Yu (朱 昱), a scandalous Chinese artist from Beijing who works in the genre of performance and conceptual art. At the Shanghai Art Festival in 2000, his work “Eating People” was demonstrated, in which the artist himself prepares and eats the human fetus. The embryo, according to him, he stole from a medical school. It is from this moment that the spread of rumors that the Chinese eat soup from infants begins.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second important ingredient is journalistic fantasy. Thanks to her, the finished dish acquires a diverse taste, ready to satisfy any gourmet. Disclosing the terrible secrets of Chinese cannibalism begins as different individuals who have familiar managers of secret specialized restaurants, as well as whole research institutes. Eating babies is found in all parts of China, in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even in Liaolin province, apparently located not far from Shambhala in the mountains of Tibet, because it is not on the map of China, but also in Japan !!! Various doctors and nurses turn out to be the suppliers of the embryos, packing them in bottles and polyethylene, as well as leaving them in landfills. The price of embryos varies from free to hundreds of dollars. Only one thing remains the same and unchanged - photographs by Zhu Yu. The main thing is not to forget to mention in the article that eating babies is very common and deeply rooted in Chinese culture, without referring to anything - and the attention of readers is guaranteed!
            </p>
            <p>
             I could not resist, and I decided to write something like that myself. There you are!
            </p>

            Zhu Yu is indeed a "performance artist" who uses cadavers:

            <p>
             Zhu Yu is an artist who exhibited photographs of his procuring, preparing and eating a six-month-old fetus. Exhibition was entitled Dinner--Eating People and was held in Shanghai. Dinner – Eating People was not a performance. "Zhu insists that he framed the piece as ‘conceptual photography’, scripting it as cinematography rather than as an action. The images belonged to a larger series experimenting with the use of human flesh in art …"
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://frieze.com/article/zhu-yu">

            </p>
            <p>
             So, it seems that some of the photos are of Zhu Yu eating a real baby, which he did as a 'performance'.

            Is this real? The excuses they give for child cannibalism are unbelievable. Murdering innocent children and eating them to make yourself stronger and healthier? It sounds like the same philosophy which guides Satanic ritual magic. If only they could be arrested and prosecuted...

             They aren't human. This isn't hyperbole, but literal fact. Their DNA is different than humans. This is why they behave inhumanely. The takeaway is they are incompatible with civilization.
