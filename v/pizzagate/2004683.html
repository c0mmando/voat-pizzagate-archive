            These people are actually just mocking us now. The Katy Perry video was just a big FU. Look, well put all this shit in a video and the masses will use the music video as proof that PG people are crazy.  Like... we are literally Bigfoot researchers.

            Considering the number of rides in the Lolita jet he took and the witness saying he was a regular at the Virgin Island estate, it would be surprising if he didn't know exactly what's going on.  And then there is the Silsby rescue from more jail time as a child trafficker and his other rescue of Laura Ling and Euna Lee.  No, he knows exactly what is going on and is part of it.
