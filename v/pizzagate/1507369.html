<p>Anyone who is familiar with the 2016 primary shenanigans knows about Cliff Arnebek who was working on filing RICO against Hillary winning primary with fraud. I worked in Bernie\'s campaign here in NH as a Grassroots Team Leader and Location Director for GOTV. This was information passed around by us Bernie supporters and was covered up and ignored by DNC and MSM. </p>
<p>I ended up being one of the #DemExit voters and voting Trump in the general election and thank GOD he is our president instead of Hillary!!! Anyway, here is a link to the short version of what was happening with RICO lawsuit. There is a longer version available if you search.

<p>Cliff Arnebeck (above) wrote letters to Obama, Biden, Bernie, and Loretta Lynch. In one letter to Biden and Obama he claims that he has inside information that Biden\'s son was murdered. Here is the interview about the letters;

<p>Like I said, most people don\'t even know about these things because it was a huge coverup during our 2016 primary and now. Beverly Campbell, who shared info with Cliff and feared for her life for knowing inside info about Biden\'s son, mysteriously died. Also, assassination of Mike Connell. Cliff Arnebeck seems to think Creepy Uncle Joe knew his son was murdered on purpose. </p>
<p>All of this info could just end up being meaningless to #PizzaGate but there is a lot of info/leads of higher ups and background info about our government that could link to something related so I\'m sharing.</p>',

            It has to do with Clinton then it's Pizzagate. Everything is Pizzagate at this point. All government corruption is interwoven. Who is to say which thread we pull will unravel it all.

            It is definitely possible that there is an indirect pizzagate connection there.

           <p>
            It has already been discussed here (

            ) that Beau Biden was passionate about prosecuting child predators, and I can tell you that victims of child sexual abuse who process their trauma enough to come out the other side not being abusers themselves, tend to be
            <em>
             very
            </em>
            passionate against child abusers. I'm an example of that, myself, but I've encountered hundreds more just in a few peer support groups alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we know what Joe Biden is like.
