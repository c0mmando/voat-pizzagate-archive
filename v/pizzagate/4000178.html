            I would say the adults are definitely exploiting this kid. He's precocious and charismatic, and they all want to make money off of him -- his parents, the pizza guy and Ellen. No doubt pedos love his show. Nor can they resist making adult comments they know he won't understand, for their audiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            At 7:37, pizza guy asks whether girls have been "Sliding into his DMs, saying 'Hey, Shirley Temple King!'"
           </p>
           <p>
            The kid says "Yeah, and then they would want to take photos of me."
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizza guy says "Yeah, I certainly believe it. That's the price of fame. It's fun, though, right?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the fact this kid is not making any allusions himself and seems oblivious to the darker connotations of what the pizza guy is saying, I'd say he has not been abused. And based on his use of the word "would", it sounds to me like his parents are doing a pretty good job protecting him from "girls sliding into his DMs".  It doesn't sound like he understands what type of photos people might want in DMs. Thank God.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the pizza reviewer guy, I didn't get a pedo-y vibe from this at all, just a guy whoring for clicks. I looked through some of the comments on the YouTube video and didn't see the typical pedo grooming stuff we saw on some of the toy review videos a few years ago, either.

            On the Ellen show they show the little boy in a pic behind him when sitting next to Ellen. He’s sitting with no shirt on. At least that’s what it looks like to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shirley Temple Black was in Baby Burlesques and has been rumored to have been abused. There’s way more going on in that video. Pizza on Ellen?

             Yes, I'm still digging, but I'm curious if anyone here can see what I'm seeing with Dave and Shirley Temple King in this video, it seems clear to me especially at the end that Dave is acting sexual to him.

              Yes I agree. He is also very sneaky about it. You have to be aware of these things to catch it. Not obvious to all. Good you caught it. Also he takes the Child out to pizza place. If he’s got sexual ideas going through his head then it sticks out like sore thumb. Should check his whereabouts and his bad habits.

               Thankyou, a month ago he did an interview with trump. At first I was confused, but then I went and rewatched, trump seems to be onto him. So when he did that interview with trump, it caused issues within barstool and he is now parting ways with some guy called KFC. He announced roughly a week ago that he is leaving to Philly. Also he does a pizza review with Jerry springer, Jerry says he hasn't eaten for 12 days, and after taking a bite or two Springer says "omg.. I don't feel like another pizza". It feels to me the pizza rating system relates to how high they are getting - but sometimes it's just to do with pizza. When he reviewing with shirley temple king, shirley gave it a score, and then Dave was like, you've had so many shirley temples so I think it's gonna effect me more you know (they're talking tolerance).
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's the interview with Dave and trump, just really watch trump, I swear he's onto him, and Dave is so coked up and he's trying to cover his ass - but it won't work, he looks so scared at times.

               I'm working on putting something fully together, but this has been so overwhelming, it has eased my mind I think trump is onto him,

                Keep at it. Look into his background and his tweets. His followers if they post anything sketchy look through their media. Your doing good. On right track. Taking this Kid to pizza place. Bad especially after the Ellen piece. Btw pedos love shirtless Kids. It’s sick and sad but to them it’s a real turn on. Did my homework on gay soc media. Was worth it. Learned a lot.
