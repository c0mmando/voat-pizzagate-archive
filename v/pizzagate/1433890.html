           </p>
           <p>
            THERE WHERE A LOT OF EVIDENCE POINTING INTO A DIRECTION OF A GIANT PEDOPHILE NETWORK IN THE BACKGROUND. INCLUDING HIGH RANKIN POLICICIANS AND BUSINESSMAN.
           </p>
           <p>
            More than 23 witnesses were found dead. The case got never really analysed officially. I think its the same giant network like the pizzagate.

           <p>
            HERE, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ORIGINAL POLICE REPORTS OF WITNESSES of the child abuse and murder of Dutroux. ITS DISGUSTING!! Including making snuff films. The media downplayed everything.

            "SATANIC sects involved in bizarre rites including human sacrifice are being linked by Belgian police with this summer's string of grisly paedophile murders in which at least four children died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Five witnesses came forward last week and described how black masses were held, at which children were killed in front of audiences said to have included prominent members of Belgian society. One investigator said it was "like going back to the Middle Ages".
           </p>
           <p>
            The tentacles of the sects appear to have stretched beyond the borders of Belgium to Holland, Germany and even America. The witnesses - several of whom claim to have received death threats - say that young babies were handed over by their parents willingly in return for money. In other cases the victims were abducted. [PEHI note: The incest aspect should definitely have been described here. The "abductions" should also have been explained in more detail]
           </p>
           <p>
            The witnesses, who are believed to have identified the sites where the masses took place to the police, said organisers had also photographed participants and threatened to hand over their pictures if they went to the police.
