            I agree that many professional law enforcement individuals are probably working on this, but not officially.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alo agree that Pizzagate is not the real investigation, but rather the PR of the investigation. The things that are leaked are leaked for a reason - They know, the only way to communicate in an effective way from now on forward is to let the public come to their own conclusions.

            It's most correct to assume that the LEO's are chomping donuts and ass raping 12 year old girls, just like their Idol Sir Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of LEO in the USA is to protect elite pedo's and keep them out of jail. Should a cop ever bust an elite Pedo, that cop would be a dead man.

             Cops are like the rest of us.  They get their hands tied by their higher ups and fucked out of doing anything.  I know enough of them that I can tell you they hate the bullshit of their internal politics just as much as the rest of us hate how our bosses keep getting in our way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then you have the additional issue of channels.  A lot of what most cops do is handle the immediate situation.  They hand off their information to the higher ups or feds hoping that it's taken care of by the proper channels, and go back to their first priority (keeping as much peace in a community as possible).
            </p>
            <p>
             Get over your shit and actually talk to them some time.

             I actually think much of what you say is true. But, I have hope that there are still "Untouchables" working this thing and could begin to bring it down...like Al Capone. Perhaps we should start digging into individual pedophile's tax records?
