             Yes, the shills are busy beavers.

             Seems that if your not talking about the shit stains in Alefantis boxers you get down-voated, ...
            </p>
            <p>
             They say they care about children here but that is bullshit, remember that most of the agents here are bots, and based on sentiment positive or negative for TRUMP-LOVE then up/down voat.

             ...

             I think the downvoats have something to do with the handle NumbCuck, the cuck-mods here don't like being told their cucks.
