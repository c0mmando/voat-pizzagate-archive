           <p>
            On 11/25/13 at approximately 1212 hours, GSOC dispatched Sergeant Rubben Moore to the SPP Building, P-1 parking 
level, for an incident report.  He met with
            <strong>
             Miss Hayley Rae Abramoff
            </strong>
            , a guest and with Mr. Gregorio Callejoas, ABM Valet 
Attendant, and the following information was relayed:
            <br/>
            Statement by Abramoff:
            <br/>
            “The valet guy told me that I hit a car, but I thought that I hit the pole.  I don’t remember hitting a car.  I parked in one 
location, but was told that I needed to move my car to another space.  If I hit the car, why didn’t he tell me before I left for 
my appointment?”

           If you have time, there's a heavy load of names behind these links which might be worth listing and linking. Big job, above is just a start. And why I started this, you may ask?

            Because Wikileaks emails points out in general that a nice ending to the case
            <strong>
             is not expected
            </strong>
            , and that could mean
            <strong>
             a nice ending in our point of view
