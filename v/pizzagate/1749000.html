<p>This first exposé stars the Fanjul brothers, Alfonso and José, Cuban born sugar barons with a rich history of exploiting foreign labor.</p>
<p>The Fanjul brothers — Cuban born Alfonso &quot;Alfy&quot; Fanjul, José &quot;Pepe&quot; Fanjul, Alexander Fanjul, and Andres Fanjul — are owners of Fanjul Corp., a vast sugar and real estate conglomerate in the United States and the Dominican Republic. It comprises the subsidiaries Domino Sugar, Florida Crystals, C&amp;H Sugar, Redpath Sugar, Tate &amp; Lyle European Sugar, La Romana International Airport, and resorts surrounding La Romana, Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Alfonso Fanjul married the daughter of Spaniard Andres Gomez-Mena who immigrated to Cuba in the 19th century and built up an empire of sugar mills and property by the time he died in 1910. The couple\'s holdings were then combined to create a large business of cane sugar mills, refineries, distilleries, and significant amounts of real estate. </p>
<p>In 2001, the family expanded into the charter school business. They established a religious elementary school, Glades Academy, which accepts taxpayer-funding for 200 students. They also established a high school Everglades Preparatory Academy, which serves 600 taxpayer-funded students.</p>
<p>Alfonso Fanjul served as co-chairman of Bill Clinton\'s Florida campaign in 1992 and is a major contributor and fundraiser for the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Also at the Casa de Campo resort, the Clintons met brothers Pepe [José] and Alfy [Alfonso] Fanjul, owners of the Florida Crystals Corporation, a sugar company based in Florida, again according to Dominican Today. The same article cites the Dominican-based website listin.com.do as saying that &quot;in addition to personal matters, the sugar tycoons discuss the possibility of Hillary Clinton’s run for the White [House] on the Democratic ballot in the US elections in Nov., 2016.&quot;</p>

<p>Alonso Fanjul and Rolando Bunster both participated in the Clinton Foundation’s Future of the Americas conference in New York in December</p>

<p>The U.S. Dept. of Labor\'s &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor&quot; report lists sugarcane from the Dominican Republic as having child and forced labor. This is a small source of raw sugar that is imported from 40 different companies to be refined then sold by Domino Foods, a marketing cooperative that among its products sells the Florida Crystals brand</p>
<p><a href="http://afrocubaweb.com/fanjuls.htm">http://afrocubaweb.com/fanjuls.htm</a></p>
<p>in 1995, the 49 members of the House Agriculture Committee received an average of $16,000 USD from the sugar producers, mainly the two largest ones. Moreover, the Fanjul brothers invest money in hundreds of local election campaigns and thus have become, in association with the CANF, an influential factor in U.S. politics over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>The main source of funds is the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a Reagan-created program which hands over money to 39 Democratic and 17 Republican members of Congress, in particular Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Dante Fascell, Robert Torricelli, Lincoln Díaz-Balart, Larry Smith, Ernest Hollings, Robert Graham, Joseph Lieberman, Connie Mack, Orrin G. Hatch, Claude Pepper and others. The Sultans of Sugar are among the principal entrepreneurs to finance politicians from both parties, confirmed US News &amp; World Report in its July 17, 1995 issue.</p>

<p>In preparation for the sugar cane harvesting season that begins in mid- October, the Orlando-based Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association is advertising for workers statewide -- including Central Florida.</p>
<p>But the association doesn\'t expect much response... why the industry relies on the federal temporary immigration worker program known as H-2.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-09-23/business/0330160294_1_cane-florida-cutters">http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-09-23/business/0330160294_1_cane-florida-cutters</a></p>
<p>(One form of this forced labor, for example, exists under the federal H-2 program, which provides entry visas for guest workers engaged in temporary farm labor and various non-agricultural industrial work. Analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found that the protections offered to guest workers by law are typically not honored, with little or no governmental oversight. Private, pro bono attorneys typically will not represent guest workers due to the ambiguity of the workers’ legal status, and guest workers are not eligible for federal or state-funded legal services)</p>

<p>Jamaicans have been the mainstay of the U.S. sugar cane harvest for the past four decades. Despite the hardships, Jamaicans continue to fill virtually all available positions every season.</p>
<p>The Florida Job Service says there is a lengthy waiting list of young cane-cutters in Jamaica who want to participate in the U.S. harvest. Sugar cane is a major crop in Jamaica, and the cutters there are experienced. But the country\'s average per capita income is about $100 a month, or about an eighth of what workers can earn cutting Florida cane.</p>

<p>Although the International Labour Organization approved the DR’s labor laws for the trade deal, in 2001, the United Nations body had called Dominican sugar “one of the most widely documented instances of coercive labour contracting over the past two decades.”</p>
<p>in 1952, the Dominican dictator signed an agreement with his Haitian counterpart, Paul Magloire. In it, Magloire agreed to a transfer of labor that amounted to selling tens of thousands of Haitians every year to Trujillo’s government to work in nationalized cane fields.</p>

<p>“Until now, the disturbing remnants of colonial slavery were carefully hidden in paradise.... “The Sugar Babies” examines the moral price of sugar—present and past—from the perspective of the conditions surrounding the children of sugar cane cutters of Haitian ancestry in the Dominican Republic, and the continuing denial of their basic human rights.”</p>

<p>According to Federal Election Commission data, Jose Fanjul has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to many conservative political action committees and Republican political candidates in recent history, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner and GOP Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, in addition to Brown.</p>
<p>Conversely, FEC data show that Alfonso Fanjul has contributed to the campaigns of not only Obama and Kerry, but also Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>Another interesting situation the Fanjul brothers were involved in.</p>
<p>Senator Menendez Scandal
A pair of FBI agents met on a recent weekday morning with brothers Alfonso “Alfy” and Jose “Pepe” Fanjul in the Palm Beach headquarters of their sugar and real estate empire.</p>
<p>Months after the FBI began probing allegations against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), investigators are looking at whether someone set out to smear him while he was running for reelection last year and then ascending to his new post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to four people briefed on the inquiry.</p>
<p>As part of a wider public corruption investigation of the senator, the FBI has been examining whether Menendez patronized prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, according to people familiar with the inquiry. They said agents have been trying to determine whether a longtime political supporter and friend, eye doctor Salomon Melgen, provided the women, free flights on his private plane and any other services as illegal gifts.</p>
<p>For years, they agreed with Menendez on issues of particular interest to the brothers, such as support for U.S. trade sanctions on Cuba. But last June, the Fanjuls were disappointed by Menendez after he voted with the majority of his Senate colleagues to revamp the Agriculture Department program and end some parts of it. Not long after the vote, Alfy Fanjul called Menendez to register his unhappiness, according to two people familiar with their conversation</p>

           According to Federal Election Commission data, Jose Fanjul has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to many conservative political action committees and Republican political candidates in recent history, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner and GOP Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, in addition to Brown.
          </p>
          <p>
           Conversely, FEC data show that Alfonso Fanjul has contributed to the campaigns of not only Obama and Kerry, but also Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee.

           Another interesting situation the Fanjul brothers were involved in.

           Senator Menendez Scandal
A pair of FBI agents met on a recent weekday morning with brothers Alfonso “Alfy” and Jose “Pepe” Fanjul in the Palm Beach headquarters of their sugar and real estate empire.
          </p>
          <p>
           Months after the FBI began probing allegations against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), investigators are looking at whether someone set out to smear him while he was running for reelection last year and then ascending to his new post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to four people briefed on the inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of a wider public corruption investigation of the senator, the FBI has been examining whether Menendez patronized prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, according to people familiar with the inquiry. They said agents have been trying to determine whether a longtime political supporter and friend, eye doctor Salomon Melgen, provided the women, free flights on his private plane and any other services as illegal gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
           For years, they agreed with Menendez on issues of particular interest to the brothers, such as support for U.S. trade sanctions on Cuba. But last June, the Fanjuls were disappointed by Menendez after he voted with the majority of his Senate colleagues to revamp the Agriculture Department program and end some parts of it. Not long after the vote, Alfy Fanjul called Menendez to register his unhappiness, according to two people familiar with their conversation

            This is a great article and I thank you for all your hard work.  They have to follow rules so maybe list it by forming a small paragraph.  Yes as I read it I did see an opportunity for child trafficking.  Especially since the DR is right next to Haiti as well.

             The U.S. Dept. of Labor's "List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor" report lists sugarcane from the Dominican Republic as having child and forced labor. This is a small source of raw sugar that is imported from 40 different companies to be refined then sold by Domino Foods, a marketing cooperative that among its products sells the Florida Crystals brand

              I saw a post on here within the last few days about how the fashion industry may also be involved.  Mother Jones had an article about how the Clintons spend every Christmas in the Dominican Republic at the estate of Oscar de la Renta (now deceased).  Mrs. de la Renta survives.  I would not be surprised if there are connections as well. Along with them at the estate also mentioned were, the Kissingers, Barbara Walters and I think Charlie Rose.   I also believe they will use any possible means of transporting their valuable profits.  Also by accident a while back, I happened on a shipping company on the dock of Port au Prince, Haiti.  It was a perfect scenario and everything about the place fit, I asked within the comments if people could please research but no one took it on.  I was knee deep in researching St. Louis which I still am.  I truly believe there are many of these places near hubs and large cities that are doing the nasty work of shipping these beautiful children.

            Hey Shizzle, is there any evidence this connects to the sexual abuse of kids by the elite? If so, can you link it up? If not, could you remove this post yourself and put it in

             v/pizzagatewhatever

            for now for safekeeping in case you do turn up some links? Otherwise it's going to be taken down for Rule 1. I will leave it up tonight, though, so you can clarify/add links if you've got them. Thanks.

             Bob Menendez was accused of having sex with an underage girl at the Casa de Campo resort which the Fanjuls' own (OP mentioned the "of age" prostitutes). Even though the DOJ was not pursuing the statutory rape crime (it was headed by AG Loretta Lynch - so no shock there), the DOJ even admitted that the timing matches the girls' claims:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In further bad news for Menendez, the DOJ says the senator’s trip to the Dominican Republic was “during time frames in which one unidentified alleged minor victim specifically claimed to have had sex with him.”

             Casa de Campo is a haven for all sorts of elite crime as it has no regular police force and the outside police force isn't allowed in.

              I hear you. The problem with inferred information to satisfy the submission guidelines is that it forces us to leave up complicated, seemingly well-sourced, baffle-with-bullshit

              designed to discredit the investigators as idiots, nuts, religious extremists or racist neo-nazi's. Read that link, and you'll see the problem. There are dozens of posts like that every week, and it's our ability to demand more than inference that allows us to take them down so they don't slide real posts like yours off the board.
