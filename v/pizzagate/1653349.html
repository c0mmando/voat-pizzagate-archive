            I like the idea of baiting the foaming at the mouth MSM, but I'm not certain it would work. You'd think they would have hammered that connection harder during the general to smear Trump, but they didn't. Could be that some in the media are also involved so want to keep it down.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if we can also tie in Russia to this. It'll be even harder for the media to ignore if Trump is scared of Russia because they got data from the cameras on Epstein's island, and know what he did... ;)
           </p>
           <p>
            But given the previous problems with MSM, maybe we should reach out to some alt-media cucks like TYT?

            I agree with you to a point, instead of talking about Podesta and Hilary Clinton with people when I get the chance. I go straight for the jugular and just say the cia is stealing babies from haiti, focus on cps, focus on the wars and orphanages in bosnia in the ninties.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said people need to stop acting like they have the moral high ground for voting for hilary. That shit pisses me off. Anyways, we are the real sjws and the real non racists. Trying to get the word out about the cia stealing Haitian babies to rape them and get their organs. That's the angle I've been taking and some peeps will actually listen because it is an interesting story.
