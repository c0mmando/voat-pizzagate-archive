<p><strong>David Bourque</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A former police captain was sentenced to 10 years in prison April 2011 for amassing what authorities said was one of the largest and most disturbing child pornography collections they’ve ever seen in Connecticut, one that included images of infants and toddlers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had more than 328,528 images and 4,000 videos on his police department computer including “sadistic and violent acts” against infants and toddlers. His “collection” was organized into more than 300 sub-folders named “photos — babies — men” and “6–10yo boys pics.” In this excerpt Bourque is D for defendant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors said the images were “extremely disturbing; some are especially horrific” including: (1) a boy between 1 and 3 years old being raped by an adult male penis in the child’s anus, (2) a boy between 3 and 6 years old with a “penis of what appears to be an adult male pressed against the child’s anus” and (3) a child, less than a year old, “performing oral sex on an adult male.” Bourque showed “callous disregard” for the children being abused telling people to “enjoy” themselves and “have fun.” Samples of his on-line chats include extensive discussions of rape and bondage of children. Bourque was a decorated officer with more than 31 years in law enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bourque at one point was investigating a child pornography case while collecting child porn on his time off, authorities said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in court documents that Bourque showed a “callous disregard” for the harm suffered by the children, telling his trading partners to “enjoy” themselves or “have fun” while viewing his collection.</p>

            I cannot comprehend why there are so many people (or any people at all) that have a desire or attraction to view child porn or actually be sexual with children. Take wanting power over someone out of the equation, just the sexual part alone is very very very disturbing, disgusting, sick, gross, and a million other adjectives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about all the pedophiles that are on the Megan's law/ national registry list, we have their names &amp; faces...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now think of the ones that are not...bc they haven't been caught, we don't know where they live, what they look like, what job they have...all we know is that there are tens of thousands still out there.  And when we even suspect we possibly found a connection to a pedophile (pizzagate), rather than looking into it, everyone suppressed it immediately, from liberals, media, potus, police chief in that city, the pope, etc... it was called fake news before it even was news at all. Knowing the code words, they still shut it down without looking into it. It happened so quickly like--
           </p>
           <p>
            Us: I think we may have found a connection to a child rapist
Them: STFU you are doing damage to people, it's fake!!!!
Us: But we are just googling stuff
Them: STFU no one is a pedophile, Conspiracy Theory, Fake news, we will delete everything you say!
           </p>
           <p>
            How they handled us even suggesting there might be a pedophile connection is very very very disturbing (and a million other adjectives)
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe how MSM, Potus, pope, etc are acting is how authorities acted in the Dutroux case...protect the pedophiles and smear the people. Why did they do that? Bc well known people &amp; authority figures were involved in the same pedophile ring as the pedophile on trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's only 1 solution...keep digging.

            Thanks for this- I imagine child abuse is rampant in the US Police. They are out of control with killings and violence and with that extreme power which appears unaccountable comes the ability to do what they want.
