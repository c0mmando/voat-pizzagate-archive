            How does Hillary team plan to discipline the staffers involved in hiring goon squads to stomp around the edges of Trump events, causing fights etc. to make the public think the paid performers were Trump supporters?

            How does Hillary team plan to discipline the staffers involved in locking the doors to the convention hall during a recess to lock out delegates during surpise votes?

             Yeah, the Robert's Rules were thrown out the window.  The test case for the Convention was the fiasco that happened in Las Vegas.  They did a test case there.  That is why the guy picked up a chair, but then decided not to throw it.  Can you blame him?  Also, here goes the pointing finger story again.  They pointed fingers at Bernie's campaign but at the same time those Hillary people were exposed, so were Bernie's people.  Oops.  They would never have taken any info, right?   Also, the guy that admitted to looking at those  Hillary names and then was fired, was a person that the DNC recommended the Bernie campaign to hire.  Another Oops.  There are just too many Oopses.
