            If it was an option I'd gladly support making a pact with the president of Mexico for the United States armed forces to use the help of the NSA, CIA, drones and satellite surveillance to pinpoint all the locations of cartel bosses and hideouts then commence stealth operations where they go in while they are sleeping and kill everyone. Without declaring war, just their president saying "The problem is out of control and we need your help to eliminate it."
           </p>
           <p>
            And before anyone says "muh it's mexico's problem" this is much more of a noble cause than dying for oil or the global banking system. They could get it knocked out in a couple months if not weeks.

            Mexican Drug Cartels are the worst you can imagine. Make no mistake, they have connections to politicians and key figures in law enforcement all over the world. The war on drugs is a hoax perpetrated by the scum making deals with those cartels by their own. The biggest problem is the prohibition of drugs, cause it makes the Cartels compete over the lead of the gobal drug market, especially USA. Their intimidation techniques were "just" shooting &amp; killing anyone working for the competitor, could be a poor student working in bar "for the enemy". And due to poverty in those regions, pretty much every 2nd person works indirectly for a cartel. To stay capable of competing on the free market, their techniques went from shooting the enemy, to filming their execution, beheading them, skinning them alive etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of these cartels are so powerful with their private armies that they openly portrait themselves as satanic, doing rituals, drinking blood. So its a hot spot for child trafficking and organ harvesting. Amazing how daily news on new-speak &amp; diversity &amp; transgender topics seem to be so much more relevant these days than the daily kidnapping of unloved and forgotten children. Fuck all of you participants enabling those daily atrocities. Blinded by the illusion of worldly fortune you betrayed creation itself and for that you are the traitors of mankind, the light of truth will prevail and demolish your lost souls.

              My in-laws own businesses here. One constant feature for people that earn more here is that they deal with lotes of crime threats, extortion and bribes. We have heard again and again about kidnapping threats (not recently, but I expect soon; as more deportees return). In those years, a severed head was placed at the door a family member’s business. An exclamation point for a kidnapping threat. That was enough for me to return.
             </p>
             <p>
              I’m getting ready to do the same again.

               I know a man from Ariz. that married a woman with a little girl and he went with her to Acapulco to help run her parent's store. Everything was fine since it was beautiful there and was a really popular tourist place until it turned for the worse. It is now a hell hole of crime and they don't know what to do.  They cannot leave her parents in a lurch but many are advising them to just leave and move to another part of Mexico.  We all know how old people don't want to leave their homes.  But this is their life.  We have traveled to Mexico and a friend also, Calderon Fox and Salinas were  crooked but things really went south when Nieto took over.  There are reasons why we had better pay attention for they are also  sending trafficked children from Mexico into the US.  You can bet on it.  I will be the first one to say we should straighten out our own problems here, but these are our next door neighbors.  It does and will affect us no matter how much we say it won't. I could not read the article as of yet, as you know I had to take a break for about a week since I have been greatly affected by too many horror stories.  Children are children to me.  No matter where they are from, it has always been that way for me. This story from what I can make out, is as frightening as can be.

              Hey, I see you're point, but we're not the world's police-keeping force. That's supposed to be the U.N.'s job.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're on one hand saying we should not be involved in wars because oil is a bad reason, but saying we should get in a war with Mexico so we can eliminate their bad guys for them?
             </p>
             <p>
              Countries have to take care of themselves. Like Britain. Are they marching in the streets over the murder of that baby, Telford, and so many other restrictive measures that have been passed? If not, THEY need to get active. Otherwise it's our responsibility? The people that voted in the last presidential election tried to shake things up and clean things up by voting the way they did. Whether it works remains to be seen. We are NOT responsible for Mexico! Mexican leaders have siphoned so much goddamn money from the US it' not even goddamned funny. And you don't think the government is one of the reasons for the cartels? So what do we do then? Impose a new government in a country we don't belong?
             </p>
             <p>
              WE ARE NOT MEXICO ... WE'RE THE UNITED STATES. Since a lot of the trafficking problems have to do with open borders -- something that THE MEXICO GOVERNMENT IS PUSHING AND FINE WITH SO YOU TELL ME THEY'RE NOT PROFITING FROM DRUGS/HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- our POTUS is attempting to close them up -- again something the is being resisted here and by THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.
             </p>
             <p>
              No, I can't say I agree with what you're saying, but in terms of shutting down these sex trafficking rings coming into this country, yes, we should all be pushing for secure borders and an end to sanctuary cities.

                My point was Mexico needs to clean up its own mess. Just like Canada. Although, I get the impressions from talking to Canadians, they don't feel they have a problem so there you go!

             Last year my grandson got a form from Headstart that was for the Lions Club. It was called Lion See and they had some special machine that they check kids eyes with, I said no. The Headstart people seemed confused that someone would say no and actually called to make sure that was what I meant to do.

              Many or these "clubs" and org. have been infiltrated and actually are connected to the cabal.  They are assisting them by doing micro chips, free shots, and yes, eye exams.  There have gone into schools and parents had better wake up.  They are doing this with the blessings of the crooked leaders of cities and towns.  Missouri has a microchip program through

              </a>
              out of the courtesy of the Missouri Freemasons.  How sweet of them.  Check for your state, for there are many now offering this by Freemasons with the blessings of your politicians as well. I discovered all this by researching St. Louis many mos. ago.

             <p>
              You did right. If your kid is smart/good kid... another (BETTER) opportunity will come along. Better to err on the side of cation and protect your young ones, especially these days.
