<p>Another thing that is interesting about this footage is the appearance of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s procurer. She comes over to make Epstein’s guest comfortable. She did not come in with them, but appears to have already been there. If you look at the whole video, it looks to me as if Epstein is a little uncomfortable being there. Maybe it’s because of the cameras and I don’t think his guest wanted to be filmed. He and his guest arrive after the party has been in full swing, and Donald is trying to make them feel welcome.</p>
