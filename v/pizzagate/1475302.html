            Perhaps we can get some of the info graphics from the all news pipeline so people can share those as well as the ones in the sidebar.

              Approximately 75-80% of human trafficking is for sex
             </p>
            </li>

             <p>
              An estimated 30,000 victims of sex trafficking die each year from abuse, disease, torture, and neglect. Eighty percent of those sold into sexual slavery are under 24, and some are as young as six years old.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Although human trafficking is often a hidden crime and accurate statistics are difficult to obtain, researchers estimate that more than 80% of trafficking victims are female. Over 50% of human trafficking victims are children.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Most human trafficking in the United States occurs in New York, California, and Florida. - Sex traffickers often recruit children because not only are children more unsuspecting and vulnerable than adults, but there is also a high market demand for young victims. Traffickers target victims on the telephone, on the Internet, through friends, at the mall, and in after-school programs.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Belgium, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Thailand, Turkey, and the U.S. are ranked very high as destination countries of trafficked victims.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Women are trafficked to the U.S. largely to work in the sex industry (including strip clubs, peep and touch shows, massage parlors that offer sexual services, and prostitution). They are also trafficked to work in sweatshops, domestic servitude, and agricultural work.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing criminal enterprises because it holds relatively low risk with high profit potential. Criminal organizations are increasingly attracted to human trafficking because, unlike drugs, humans can be sold repeatedly.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              In approximately 54% of human trafficking cases, the recruiter is a stranger, and in 46% of the cases, the recruiters know the victim. Fifty-two percent of human trafficking recruiters are men, 42% are women, and 6% are both men and women.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Human traffickers often work with corrupt government officials to obtain travel documents and seize passports.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Human trafficking has been reported in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and in some U.S. territories.
