            This is why I try so hard to push this website on Voat. This is the perfect spot for us to organize our information, by person, by company, by location. So if we need to go back and pull old info we know where to find it. Voat user Hanshan runs this site, if we can update it in any way please contact him.

            I absolutely agree. My thoughts were more along the lines of creating an accountable system where teams could be given assignments and secretly gather thorough evidence before posting the leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm looking at these good leads where the people in the periphery have time to run out the back door; and also where innocent people are getting implicated, because of the haphazard approach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Surely there must be some way to balance peer reviewable research and transparency. I'm certainly not proposing another centralized alphabet agency; just something that better focuses our efforts. I do think that compartmentalization is useful.

            Great...now I can't stop thinking about this and I have work to do.  More thoughts:
           </p>
           <p>
            5) We need to assemble resources who are actually able to volunteer for legal, non-intrusive investigation.  We can only run down internet leads for so long.  This needs to be done on an obviously discreet fashion; entirely volunteer; and entirely safe and legal.  The purpose of these reconnaissance survey reports (RSP) is just to verify something or to develop a ground truth insight.  Google StreetView is great, but it won't tell you what smoking a cigarette and having a cup of coffee on a bench for 20 minutes will tell you;
           </p>
           <p>
            6) Collections management - I almost think for the deep archive of real intelligence (note I didn't say data), analytical reports assessing investigative aspects.  The goal of this "team" is to vet out BS reports and intelligence that hasn't been subjected to a peer reviewed group.  Sorry for the broken thoughts - I'm envisioning a team of 6 or so trusted collections managers who are willing to put their "name" on a publication to be entered into an "official" record for the public.  We need a location which can be used as a top-level investigative resource for outsiders - media mostly.  At some point, they are going to have to wake up and cover this story.  It's already made it to the WashTimes in a non-hit piece version;
           </p>
           <p>
            7) Subject Matter Expert (SME) Panel - An approved collection of SMEs on a variety of subjects where investigative researchers can vet collected data - Medical, accounting, legal, area of operations (AO) expertise, technical (security, AV analysis, GIS, etc.), language, occult, etc.
           </p>

            My first question to the mods would be what type of capabilities does the Voat platform offer?  Is this WSIWYG now?  Or are there abilities to create sub forums, host a working document (privately) and behind passwords, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            My gut tells me the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) If we are going to do this right, we need to know what communications tools we have at our disposal on Voat.  Subsequent needs analysis may determine if portions of the investigation need to be migrated to another platform;
           </p>
           <p>
            2) A very solid redundancy plan needs to be in place to scrape the content of this subVoat multiple times a day and backed off to multiple redundant and undisclosed locations; tech savvy mods should be able to do the same with local secure storage.  They are going to come for this data;
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Mods an research/team/special project leads need a method to communicate securely.  We cannot conduct research like this in the clear.  I have no confidence in Voat email;
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Act like you are already compromised at this point.  OPSEC is fo' schnizzle at this point.  Be very careful not to disclose even less-than-PII information.  You would be amazed what a good "structural data analysis" can correlate;
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to think on this a little longer, regarding the best way to chop up this beast.  Oh, and how come no one has brought up good ole former Representative Barney Frank?  Wasn't his boyfriend arrested for running a "male prostitution ring" out of Frank's house or something like that? Bleah.

            Excellent article and suggestions.
Is it possible on VOAT, to give writing permissions to only one member for a thread?
           </p>
           <p>
            If that's possible that way one thread for each of the subtopics you suggested could be created and only ONE capable person receives writing permissins to add info to it.
In fact I think two threads per subtopic would be helpful: one with the really good infos, a second one with intersting facts, that shall not be forgotten.

            This is fantastic and incredibly important advice as the MSM embarks on their next phases of their cover up. As they produce fake news more people will be googling Pizzagate than ever.

            It will be integral for the success of this investigation to properly present our research in a professional and concise manner so that individuals who would like to learn more will be able to educate themselves without feeling overwhelmed and confused by the presentation of our information.

            I'm an A.I. Researcher, and Groth marketer with many ideas. As far as getting people up to speed a debate/devils advocate style run through of the relevant information among a couple of individuals would go far online.

            If anyone would be interested, we can defense chat. I would be willing to invest necessary time + resources to get this off the ground.

            I've been giving this a lot of thought, and hoping for someone with the experience and skills to step up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way it is going is the best that the perpetrators could hope for. So disjointed and polluted that it's little more than a crazy game of "Whack-a-mole"!

            We need to work like them. Compartmentalize the research and put teams competing against each other, independently.
           </p>
           <p>
            This would mean that the leads need to be distributed secretly, in order to allow the teams to dig deep before the targets can cover their tracks. For every business who gets caught with a pedophile logo, how many get wind and take theirs down?
           </p>
           <p>
            We also need a contact management software to easily collect all info and links between these people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that it goes against the whole philosophy of the transparent investigation, but I think we could be ruining it, the way this is going.

             I, too, have been concerned about the covering of tracks. Any time we start investigating, it's going to happen. As big as this is in the media, there has to be multiple people watching this to help convey who's under scrutiny. I have no idea how we could limit this beyond vetting people who were involved in pizzagate before it became out in the open and actually provided helpful research, and then only do video chats, nothing typed out for net searches to talk about the game plan. But this would drastically limit the scope of everyone pitching in to help.

            I like what you've written. I find myself in agreement, to say the least. If we really want to break this thing wide open, spark a "formal unbiased investigation." We need to offer concrete and irrefutable evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some leads, in the 9 mile radius around CPP (Comet Ping Pong) and BP, how many children have been missing?  Surely, someone is local to D.C. Area, is there anything notable in the 9 mile radius?
           </p>
           <p>
            How about the handlers , we need to discover who they are: tax records, voting records, email I think some of this could be gleamed for Podesta emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say we break into teams, present findings in a concise manner.

            Yes this is what's needed. With the amount of information there is I keep forgetting bits and pieces, my brain is fried.. For example there's that Max Spiers guy who mysteriously died a couple of days ago investigating, which reminded me about Vince Foster. That's just 1 of 100's of details that could be useful in a well organized presentation of all aspects and contradictions etc, .

             Nick Bryant: I didn’t get a lot of help from my fellow journalists. That’s one of the things about writing The Franklin Scandal that I found to be very, very difficult. People in mainstream journalism did not want to touch this story. They didn’t want to touch it as an article and they didn’t want to touch it as a book. They would rather not believe what I wrote about in The Franklin Scandal.

            What if there are two teams, such as team diggers are looking at anything and everything, meanwhile team skeptics narrows it all down to real facts?

            This is well thought out and on point.  Organization on this level is exactly what is needed now (possibly prior to now).  I would add to this an analysis and determination of types of evidence procured — much of what is current and directly pertinent to this case falls in the categories of character evidence or circumstatial evidence (or demostrative, if the coded emails can be proved against conjecture).
While my own experience and connections are of little value, I'm close to a trustworthy attorney here in Maryland.  I'll do my best to ask him (when I see him in 4 days) for some advice, and I'll mention this ongoing investigation to see if he has heard of it.
Shun fear and distraction, ignore and downvoat the shills, and stay focused.  Bless you all for your efforts.

            Very well-structure and helpful, thank you. Anybody knows if this board can be organized modular according to the key facets?

            Would add an item "actions to be taken" or sth like that.

            Thanks.  A very useful structure I think.  I am also looking at the 'contemporary arts' scene angle..there are many interconnected agents there I believe which also lead back to private banks and their investments.  Maybe something else to think about.
