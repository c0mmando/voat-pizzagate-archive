<p>The Book:  “Thanks for the Memories:  The Memoirs of Bob Hope\'s 
and Henry Kissinger\'s Mind-Controlled Sex Slave” by Brice Taylor</p>
<p>From Chapter 25 titled “Baby Monarchs are Born,” subsection titled “The Birth of Our Second Mind Controlled Child</p>
<p>Bob Hope\'s &quot;Little Filly&quot; and George Bush\'s &quot;Bush Baby&quot;:**</p>
<p><strong>“The torture and trauma began right after her birth.</strong> While we were still in Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California, three men in suits came into the hospital room and closed the door. <strong>They took my new baby girl out of her bassinet, held her up and put a pistol to her head.</strong> Another man put a gun to my head and the third man stood guard at the hospital room door. The man holding the gun to my head said, <strong>&quot;If you fail to follow our instructions, just one time</strong>...&quot; he clicked the gun, but nothing happened, &quot;<strong>we will just have to kill this precious little one.</strong>&quot; Then the man holding Kelly took a wad of Kleenex off my hospital tray, wadded it up and put it into the glass of water on my tray in order to wet it. <strong>He held my precious baby girl faced downward and forced the wad of wet Kleenex into her mouth, interfering with her ability to breathe.</strong></p>
<p>With a gun to my head, I watched in absolute horror and terror, as <strong>my baby girl choked and gagged and then went limp in the man\'s arms. I thought she was dead. Then he said, &quot;That\'s all it takes. It\'s as simple and easy as that.&quot;</strong>  
</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Our lives went on and, as programmed, I dutifully delivered my little daughter to <strong>Point Mugu Naval Weapons Base in California</strong> where <strong>military men took her from my arms...They kept her for a long while and then brought her back out to me.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As Kelly grew a little older, at around age two our programmers laid her by my side on a gurney where we were both hooked up to sensors all over our bodies - head, chest, and pulse points (wrist and neck artery), in order to monitor something. What exactly, I don\'t know. The men working on us wore surgical greens so I assumed they were doctors. <strong>Kelly and I were drugged and totally out of it. I watched as my little baby daughter\'s eyes rolled up in her head like she was convulsing.</strong> Sometimes they put a mask over our faces to further drug us or injected drugs into our forearms and sometimes there was even an IV bottle left to drip for us both. There was one IV bottle, with the tubing split into two, one for me and one for Kelly. They also hooked us up to sounds delivered through earphones and often added bright lights. <strong>It felt like they programmed Kelly and I through sound and light</strong> by hooking us both up to wires. It seemed like we were getting a blood transfusion, but we were connected to wires instead of tubes and there was no blood.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>There were all different sorts of chairs; some were for electroshock. One had a headrest with a band on it and straps for our wrists and straps for our ankles. They would zap me, and Kelly would be in the same kind of chair facing me and then they would zap her.</strong> It was horrific to watch her being tortured. They would have to almost carry her off when it was through because she was so out of it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>From subsection titled “Reagan Is President and Our Vice President is a Pedophile”:</strong></p>
<p>**…our newly elected Vice President at the time, George Bush, was/is a pedophile and Kelly was created to be, as I later found out from a renegade CIA operative, what was called a &quot;Bush Baby.&quot;</p>
<p>Barbara Bush brought snacks in on a tray to the delight of the children clustered around her husband. The kids munched on animal cookies with sprinkles on top as they listened to the Vice President read them stories.** The reality created and the accompanying program he delivered was, &quot;You are what you read.&quot; This was during the time they lived in the house with the flat rock fireplace. The fireplace had a stone bench that you could sit on in front of the fireplace and George had his easy chair near it. There was a brown coffee table and a couch, and hunting pictures of Springer Spaniels holding birds in their mouths and pointing, graced the walls. George was into that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Barbara thought I was there as a representative of the new educational system being implemented in California, which was true, although I wasn\'t consciously aware of it, and she was told that the children were there to demonstrate to the Vice President just how well the new system was working. But later, when the demonstration was over, <strong>Bush would take Kelly or another small child to the bathroom or to &quot;show them something special.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>During the time the Vice President disappeared with my daughter, Barbara often made lots of small talk, always smiling, cheery and pleasant, speaking nothing of importance. She talked a lot, especially when her husband was out of the room…</p>
<p><strong>The Vice President brought Kelly back when he was finished. She looked dazed and out of it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bob Hope arranged many other times for George to be with Kelly in different and more private settings…George always said he had a special place in his heart for little girls.”</strong></p>

            Sorry, I will be lambasted as a shill: To me the wealth of technical details about drugging, sound, light, and electroshock doesn't ring true. Giving such a wealth of details is meant to be convincing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Really, a shared IV? Injections into forearm when a catheter already available? Sound/light programming works on 2-year olds and adults? They have the same chairs with headband and arm/ankle restraints in a wide range of sizes to cover 2 year old to adult? "Blood transfusion" through wires?

              The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.

               Who knows why these sickos do anything, I doubt the 'shared IV' was anything to do with the expense lol.  Defending pedophilia by not believing a person telling her actual history of pedophilia.  Anyway, at the end of the day, looks like all this is coming out so speculation will not be needed.

             Even though we know different, I can understand why Normies might think  this is fake, for how can any human do these things to any other. Children, no less.  It just boggles the mind.  But yes, there are such horrid beings on this earth.  And then to know that they were ruling our country is shocking.  To think that we voted for these people and put them in power is earth shattering. Yes, it there are such people.  The sooner people realize that, the sooner we can wipe out these vile monsters.

               I think it is happening.  I think people are reading and hearing, but keeping it in their heads.  They are not all completely ready yet.  They are hearing their Idols accused of heinous acts.  But what about those that no one hears about.  The every day people that go unmentioned.  Those are the ones that go by without a thought.  So sad.
