            Ask them about who supplies the funds to run their news organization. I've heard Al Jazeera signs their checks. I wouldn't expect much from them without an aproved response from a group of individuals who have no interest in seeing the USA prosper.

            That dude is unreasonable. I unfollowed that pedophile sympathizer, TYT is to be treated like CNN and The New York Times. John is obsessed with debunking pizzagate and keeps redirecting ppl to his disinfo video that claims taping kids down is just innocent fun. His crusade to avoid journalism sealed the deal on his ass being irrelevant, deny if you want but to not put in the legwork and scream Fake News makes him a lazy CTR shill, to hell w/ him and TYT.
