<p>It also seems to be directed at an assault of a minor. Look at one of the responses:</p>

<p>Evidently, Heather has talked to this &quot;loved one&quot; and is trying to get them to tell their story which we\'d all like to hear. Not to hear salacious details, but for someone to start really opening up. It\'d be the key in the avalanche of molestations/abuse finally coming out. Pedophilia seems to be the one aspect that\'s the toughest to get people to talk about. Now if the person is still a minor, it\'s completely understandable, but if not now, when? </p>
<p>There\'s also another allegation made in the string of comments. I don\'t know if that\'s true either. Can be someone piling on, but here it is:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The tweet is responded to by GRIFFIN O\'NEAL with this pic of his dad with Polanski. </p>

            Actually, last night I finally again found Mae Brussel's research on the Sharon Tate murders ...
Link to Mae Brussel article on Sharon Tate murders -- which she concluded was a military operation.
False Flag, carried out by the CIA to destroy the Youth Revolution, Peace/Anti-war protesters, Hippie/Love movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            No fear -- it's TEXT of the broadcast ... :)

             http://www.maebrussell.com/Transcriptions/16.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you scan it you'll find many comments about Polanski and Sharon and Satanic get-togethers at their home.
Also, many videos found by police at the home seem to have been of notable people in Hollywood engaging
in orgies.  If any of those notables then suspected that it was a false flag they would have been reluctant to
challenge the story for fear that they'd be exposed.  Read this all quickly last night and intend to get back to it....
but meanwhile, I didn't memorize it .... it's as I recall what I read.

             Thanks for this. I still think there was more. I mean, Polanski was gone. He was supposed to come home, but didn't and that's when they struck. It had to be the secret collection they were after. Remember that Manson invented the term "snuff film" and was purported to be selling one of a murder on the beach. Nope, I think it was about whatever was stashed away. It was about control of those films. And Sharon Tate had a lot to lose. She would have told where they were hidden.

              The picture reflects what the link I sent you speaks about -- involvement of Polanski and Sharon with Satanism -- 
and meetings and orgies at their homes with the full Satanic atmosphere.  I would say that picture looks like something from those get-togethers.  And, films were found which as I mentioned would have intimidated those appearing in them.
             </p>
             <p>
              What do you mean by "I still think there was more"... more than what?
The whole think was a fake.  Sharon is alive.  No one was killed.
Sharon's father was CIA -- this is all part of MKULTRA.
That doesn't mean that there might not have been actual Satanic violence/rituals at their home.
Or pretend rituals which suggested sacrifices and filmed as though something real had taken place.
Maybe to blackmail the many actors who it is suggested attended these meetings at the Polanski home?
The films themselves may be fake.  From the highest perspective, this is all involvement of MKULTRA and
those recruited in Hollywood to help the operation.
              <br/>
              You seem caught up in a very limited view of all of this --

               You know what? You may well be right. The released photos were faked. That's for sure. They look like stills from her movies. But on the other hand, she could be dead because of that blackmail they were recovering. Not sure, and my mind is open. Also if they were into Satanism, Satanists are a pretty strict bunch for members following rules. If they went rogue and were blackmailing people without following the chain of command, it's enough to get them off'ed.

                Again, Sharon's father was CIA ... CIA invents and uses "Satanism" as a tool in Mind Control.
and, again, as part of MKULTRA.

            Here is a broken link to a video about about a satanic dinner with many Hollywood A list guests which I posted moths ago.
At 25:21 into the video there were 2 disturbing shots of Spacey with a young man/teen? crawling across him and the laps of several other men with his pants pulled half down. The young person looked stressed like he wasn't enjoying it and wanted to get away.

            Don't know if anyone else remembers this photo or video or has it archived but it would be a good picture to get out there now.

            So I googled this Heather Unruh and found that she used to be a prominent newscaster in Boston.  Does anyone know why she retired?  Apparently she was on the air for a very long time and then she resigned (or maybe was canned) all of a sudden, unexpectedly.  I googled her male sidekick and he is still on the same station (where she used to work), so it's not like the team broke up and they left town.  In fact, she still seems to be in the area.  So I'd be curious to know what precipitated her exit.   Mad props on this lady -- she's obviously a liberal Democrat Bostonian -- but mad props on her for wanting to the expose the truth.  As I always say, I hope she's exercising her God-given Second Amendment rights.  I hope we all are, because it's better to be safe than unprotected.  I worry about anyone who calls the pedos.  (P.S.  WHO WANTS TO BET SPACEY'S VICTIM IS A BOY, NOT A GIRL?)

             Interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for digging into her background. The fact she's not aligned in the alt-right makes her even more credible, but we'll see. Theoretically, she could be telling the truth and still not have the truth emerge due to the victim's unwillingness to come forward. I hope it gets through that there's actually more shame in holding this inside. Somehow the burden the victim feels is crazy since it's the molesters fault. Fingers crossed that the truth does reveal itself. But I thought the rest of the conversation was interesting also. Everyone talked about Polanski's obsession with beautiful women, but was that a cover? He was a beast when it came to relationships, and people have insisted that the real motive for the Manson killings was to get their hands on the Polanski's pornography.

            By in good time she means she has to respect the wishes of the abused person involved.  I totally get that.  You go girl!  I totally believe you about KS.  He was a passenger on Epstein's Lolita Express.  Take them down, One by One.  Get her a lawyer Heather.

             Yeah, we have to support these people. Very brave and being one of the first to step forward, but someone has to do it. While adult men and women are speaking out, the pedophilia is still waiting for the juggenaut to break through the barrier of silence.

              Now that they are coming out more will be empowered.  That is why we must spread this like wildfire.    I believe they are breaking the ice.  We can't let it stop.  We should retweet on twitter as much as we can.

                  Oh Thank God.  Would it not be funny if they created this whole mess to take eyes off the LV and instead they created the Pedo Exact Firestorm they did not want.  Ah, Revenge Sometimes Is Sweet.  Let's hope there is plenty more.

                   You can count on it. Judge Jeanine Pirro would never be that vocal without something to back it up. She's a smart cookie and is not about to say anything that could get her sued!!! Same with Cernovich. He's an attorney, and if he's promising a pedo article, he's going to deliver!!!!

                    I am worried I guess, because this just all seems too good to be true.  I am afraid it will all be taken away from us.  You know, as well as I do how long we have all been waiting for the moment when they would get theirs.  One thing I am really hoping for is  for Corey Felman to see the light.  I have heard that he was given a big payoff and thus will not release the name.  Also he has fear of what may happen to him, what with all the deaths there have been.  We must keep on this and for those that can tweet we should.

                     There are a LOT of Corey Felman's around. Don't pin your hopes on only him. I would also love him to be given the freedom to speak out because I believe it would help him as much as us. I think if someone else primes the pump, he will. I'm waiting to see what Cernovich has. This game of chess is being played brilliantly. Going after a strong player, Weinstein, may have seen like a bad move, but he was also the weakest. Why? Because there were so many comments in the press and amongst the Cannibal Elite. It's not believable that they didn't know when Meryl Streep is calling him God and Courtney Love is warning actresses to not go to the Four Seasons with him and the Academy host is joking that the five actresses nominated don't have to pretend to be interested in HW anymore! And he's up The Cannibal Queen's butt! Nope, this is brilliant and far better than anything I could have done so believe, but don't stop pressing. I think it's overconfidence that's the problem, and there's not any going on. Everybody is doing their thing to bring this to a successful conclusion.

                      Yes, This is only the beginning.  The conclusion is far far away.  There are so many to be outed and I want every last one to be named.  There should not be any word like "Group of Pedos" or anything similar.  Every last one should get their day in court of the World   Court.  I will not be happy til all their facades are taken down.  All the gay actors married to women that are men and visa versa.  The Disney Empire must also get their day of Open Secrets Exposed.
