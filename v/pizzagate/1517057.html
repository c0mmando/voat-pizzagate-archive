            George Webb is following sarin gas.  We are all wondering what the cabal (whoever they are composed of) could do to protect themselves and clear people out of the way in the US for the corporations (they are not just working on clearing things from themselves in Syria for oil pipe lines),  We've been wondering about different kinds of attacks.  They appear to have arranged for ones people are not looking out for.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2016/11/who-is-checking-have-the-us-water-and-subways-systems-been-rigged-to-kill.html">

           </p>
           <p>
            Now if they were to use sarin, there's a bigger terror effect.  If they use a new virus they created - ebola/rabies, which they had made into a dispersible form by air or water or other means - they have less terror but a fortune to be made in the vaccines, which are already made and waiting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, if people are watching kids, they need to be watching vaccines and understand they are not for anyone's health, anymore than all those orphanages and CPS are.  Vaccines, not to make too fine a point, are "humanitarian."  That should be enough of a red flag.  But those making them are more like a frying pan landing on someone's head to wake up.

           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, vaccines are tied to war and to children and to trillions and are themselves an immense, maiming and deadly reality which has yet to be exposed.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Rockefeller University in New York had begun literally playing around with children with the symptoms later formalized as polio as far back as 1910. Simon Flexner, first director of the predecessor to the Rockefeller University, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, had produced the symptoms later named polio. He did that in a rhesus monkey which then transmitted the disease from one animal to another. Flexner was a close friend and advisor of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., son of the founder of the Standard Oil trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Albert Sabin, creator of the Sabin polio vaccine had come out of the Rockefeller University. Human experiments with untested versions of the polio vaccines were done on already crippled children in care homes, on children in homes for the mentally insane and on that Rockefeller family plantation for human experiments, Puerto Rico.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since that time the Rockefellers, some of the world’s most ardent financial backers of eugenics, have been at the center of the developments around what was named polio and its “vaccine.”

            Child trafficking is built into the infrastructure of wars and uses "humanitarian" orphanages and other forms of "help" when in reality it is making a fortune on children, wrecking their lives, experimenting on them, and even killing them.  And THAT is a description of what is occurring with vaccines, as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            And two of the major donors to the CF are the Rockefellers and Bill Gates who control vaccines worldwide.  CIA is trafficking children.  They are also inside vaccine teams with UNICEF, killing children.

             Vaccines are about CF, kids, CIA, engineered diseases as means to control oil regions, world power, war and money.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we're following the money to CF, this is about CF's top donors who have access to children and are world controllers.  Rockefeller and Gates run the WHO.  WHO trucks were used to ship arms to Syria.  Vaccines are a limitless business - are they worth as much as oil?  Kids are
             <strong>
              the pipeline
             </strong>
             and they are adding more vaccines by the day and mandating them.

             drugs and especially mandated vaccines which do not even have to be proven to work (they are only a promise of prevention and when it fails, MSM doesn't report it and/or studies are pulled), are a new phenomenon and a "miracle" for Gates and Rockefeller's financial health.

              It was hoped that following polio eradication, immunisation could 
be  stopped.

             <p>
              However  the
              <strong>
               synthesis  of the polio  virus in  2002 [Gates' contribution],  made 
eradication  impossible.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              It  is  argued  that  getting  poor  countries  to expend their scarce resources 
on an impossible dream over the last 10 years was
              <strong>
               unethical
              </strong>
              . [Gates is in the top tier of CF donors, and is impoverishing countries' health systems as he makes billions, and delivers vaccines that are twice as deadly as normal virus and causes the disease.]
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore,  while  India  has  been  polio-free  for  a  year,  there  has 
been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). 
In 2011, there were  an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP.  Clinically 
indistinguishable  from  polio  paralysis  but  twice  as  deadly,  the 
incidence  of  NPAFP  was  directly  proportional  to  doses  of  oral 
polio  received.
             </p>
             <p>
              Though  this  data  was  collected  within  the  polio 
surveillance   system,   it   was   not   investigated.   **The   principle   of
              <br/>
              primum-non-nocere was violated. **

             <p>
              The authors suggest that the huge bill of
              <strong>
               US$ 8 billion
              </strong>
              spent on the 
programme, is a small sum to pay if the world learns to
              <strong>
               be wary of 
such vertical programmes
              </strong>

             CF and CGHI and CHAI are central to pushing this new "vertical" program for their multi-billionaire donors, which is wreaking havoc on real healthcare programs in poor countries, and ALSO maiming and killing babies and children on a global scale.  When the polio vaccine killed 10,000 children in Pakistan (via UNICEF and CIA vaccine teams) and Pakistan was questioning the safety of the vaccines, the WHO (CF donors, Gates and Rockefeller) defined the vaccine-caused paralyses as outbreaks of polio and called for "saturation vaccination" - this in an area already bombarded by drones - and threatened to pull Pakistani visas.
            </p>
            <p>
             [Vaccine Mandates In Real Life: Over 500 Pakistani Parents Arrested for Not Vaccinating With Polio Vaccine That Killed 10,000 children]](http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2015/03/vaccine-mandate-insanity-500-pakistani-parents-arrested-for-not-vaccinating-with-polio-vaccine-that-.html)
            </p>
            <p>
             So what part of this is not about following the money to CF and its putting in new "structures" to enrich its donors, and the concomitant wrecking of kids' bodies and minds for profit, with deaths included, and all under the banner of "humanitarian help"?
            </p>
            <p>
             The numbers of deaths are being hidden.

              CDC and CIA: A Close and Sick Relationship
             </a>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "The CIA has a sweet-heart relationship with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) which allows it to dictate what the CDC reports and even what data it supplies to researchers requesting it. That is, the CDC keeps several different "books" on morbidity and mortality to supply to different "consumers".
             </p>
             <p>
              "In this way the CDC has helped the CIA and military cover-up incidents of Bio-warfare germs, released unintentionally or even intentionally, inside the US [and other countries as well].
             </p>
             <p>
              The 1977 Congressional Hearing on MKULTRA revealed that the CIA was in the habit of keeping faked "cover files" to limit US liability and particularly liability of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers who were giving the CIA its orders behind the scenes, free of "democratic constraints".
             </p>
             <p>
              "But the CIA [Rothschild/Rockefellers] also had other agencies around the world cooking their books to cover up the illegal activities they were engaged in which included fomenting wars, preventing people from having water safe to drink [e.g. Iraq], preventing people from having access to food, medicines, distributing vaccines with Bio-warfare germs such as HIV, infertility drugs, toxins like mercury, anti-human chorogonaditropin antibody inducers [prevent pregnancy], etc. for the purpose of genocide. To cover up these many crimes against humanity around the world, meant that they had their agents, often CIA and MI6 officers, committing black ops to bribe and coerce officials throughout the world to cook their books.
             </p>
             <p>
              "However, because they also wanted to know what was really the result of their genocidal policies, the CIA usually kept the original databases "off the record" at the CIA's headquarters at Langley as well as supplying them to the Fort Detrick US Army Chemical and BioWarfare Research Labs. That Lab as well as the CIA's own labs, needed the original data to prove the effectiveness of their "interventions". [Emphasis added.]

            This is just a theory, but could Braverman already be in the Witness Protection Program?
           </p>
           <p>
            Clues that lead to my hypothesis:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He was part of the CF inner circle, thus many of their plans would go through him.
            </li>
            <li>
             He likely had witnessed many of the atrocities that Webb identifies in his videos
            </li>
            <li>
             Braverman's conscience gets the better of him and he decides to blow the whistle on them, and fears that with what he's seen with others who either got too close, uncovered facts/people, etc, and witnessed how they "dealt with" the problems.
            </li>
            <li>
             Feds who are investigating the CF are independent of Comey and operating in parallel, decide to give him cover in exchange for information.
            </li>
            <li>
             These same Feds, along with NYPD (who are not happy with the FBI's handling of the cases), are waiting until the swamp is drained on the 20th, and awaiting the new POTUS to give them the green light to expose the Clintons and their minions.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Either that or he's got a new pair of concrete shoes and is now fish food.

            Can somebody make a good meme for highliting the Eric Braverman issue. This guy can blow the lid off of CF scandals. We need a good meme and hashtag. #WhereIsEric?

              This guy is an amazing researcher. I have noted down some of his methods and he uses the people itself as sources whenever he can. This is very smart. We can use this to our advantage.
             </p>
             <p>
              A lot of people I showed the Instagram images to said they could be faked... So instead of debating them, I show them the clip where Alefantis says the taped down pic is in fact from his Instagram and in his niece. He even calls it a cute pic. Once people seen this they can't deny it anymore. He says so himself. We can apply this principle to much more.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will try to make a list of "indisputable facts".

                The Russians have had a hard week, diplomat, ambassador, the plane with 92 dead and people dying from counterfeit alcohol. RIP The part of the US that's the hardiest make up most of the support for friendly relations with Russia. Obomba can pull just about anything at this point, as can Killswitch Klinton. Saw the earthquake in Chile today...hmmmm
