            Yes these are crisis actors from Sandy Hook. There were actual want ads on Craigslist hiring people for exciting work in Vegas. No doubt people died but a false flag does not mean there are no casualties. It means it was set up by government insiders to get a specific response.

             I put that in the post. I know that a false flag doesn’t mean no casualties. I saw that craigslist ad. They are blatant. What did you think of the one from Twitter? Did you watch the videos?

             Oh I totally agree.  I believe people really did die there 🙁 But they could still use crisis actors. I truly believe it was a false flag and planned. People can still die in false flag attacks. Like 9/11.

              I agree false flag. I also agree like 9/11. Those people died. The people that have not red pilled, just think crazy man in Vegas.  It is hard to explain that was not the case. Our daughter said friend shot in leg and others that attended are not the same people anymore. Prob all suffering from PTSD.  Her friend was staying with other shot and decided she was going to run for it. She thought she had two daughters and wasn't going to die there.  She is a cross fit fanatic. She told our daughter that she was sprinting and flying over barricades, climbing huge fence and was glad she was in cross fit.

               Gosh her Cross fit sure came in handy there! I am amazed at the ones that stayed and helped strangers even when they didn’t know if the shooter (or shooters) were caught. That is brave! Did you hear about the guy who stole a truck and was taking people to the hospital? Stories like that are beautiful to me. When you see people just care for one another because we are all just human beings.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then you have others that are tweeting that they don’t feel bad for them because they were probably Trump supporters. It’s unreal how evil peopl can be. So it sure is nice when you see heroes like the people that stayed to help others.

            Check the guy's ears. That's where it's most obvious they aren't the same person, but their noses are different, and their faces have different proportions. There's three different women there, from my judgement, but the "nurse" doesn't look as much like the other two.

             I think the men’s noses match a lot. I don’t know if you know what this means, but earlobes can be either attached earlobes or unattached earlobes. Both pictures of the man have attached earlobes. Unattached is when they dangle. I think their noses are both large and shaped the same.

             I know it’s not provable because his eyes are closed. Did you see the tweet too? There is another person and this one seems the most likely that they are the same person in my opinion. Both of those are videos so it’s much more clear.

              They may share attached earlobes, but the rest of the ear is completely different. The top's a different shape, the interior parts curve differently. Plus, the sandy hook guy's nose isn't as straight as Paddock's, not to mention his weaker jawline.

             I agree that the guy on the right is older than the guy on the left. The two women on the left look the same to me. I don't know about the woman on the right.
