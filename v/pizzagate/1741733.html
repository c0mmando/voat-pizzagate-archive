<blockquote>
<p>If you are a survivor of child sex trafficking or satanic ritual abuse, please get in touch with myself, Kenneth or Felicia. [...]</p>
<p>Please just talk out on behalf of the children. If you don\'t want to do it for yourself, do it for the children. Do it for the four-year-old that is so scared and so frightened that, even at that young age, she doesn\'t want to live anymore. At four years old – she shouldn\'t have to feel like that.</p>
<p>Or the little boy that is so ashamed of what is going on, he feels like he can\'t tell anyone because he\'s a male, and he feels like he\'ll be mocked because he\'s a male.</p>

             Lol, this is NOT the same Ken Dawson. This is "Kenneth Dawson", the founder of The Voices of Butterflies. I would appreciate you having your facts CORRECT before you go posting things like this, wrongfully defaming my name and associating THAT person to THIS project. First of all the Ken Dawson YOU are referring to is this guy
             <a href="https://angel.co/kenneth-dawson-1">
              https://angel.co/kenneth-dawson-1
             </a>
             . Perhaps if you took as much time to watch the actual video linked to MY name in the description, as you did playing detective, you would CLEARLY see that we are not even close to being the same person. Do you know how many 'Ken Dawson's" come up when you type the name in? Maybe it made you feel better to just pick the one with the most heinous crime you could find and just peg him as me. How come you didn't pick the NFL player, or the engineer? BTW, I think it's pretty ironic that your name is "thetruthwillsetufree", yet your posting false information. Just saying...

              Frustrated?   Maybe you need to learn some Public relations skills by actually answering emails and peoples concerns. I have a Gift from our Lord,  Knowledge to Really know who is For Us and Who Isn't.  Take that GOFUNDME  money and feed a family.   Making a Film is a waste of time, so is Hollyweed, LA   We all have internet, that is the most powerful way to research. GO Fund Me is the Biggest Racket of this Decade!      Research the Father of Sandy Hook Victim "Smiling" after he lost his child....."ON CAMERA"   This GOFUNDME  is a racket

Secondly, YOU have of all people have no position try to put someone in check with your false accusations, and sharing incorrect information base on you THOUGHT I was. YOU look like the idiot. So all of this non-sense that you speak of in this email is irrelevant. Maybe if you spent more time researching your information before you go publicizing it, you'd be better off. So if anyone has something to learn is you. Message me again with this garbage and I'll report you.

                 If I may recommend something, in order to clear doubts about your identity for the future: would you mind verifying yourself sometime? Stating on your official Twitter or GoFundMe that you're the user
                 <em>
                  TheVobProject
                 </em>
                 on Voat would totally suffice, and if you then backlink to that statement from your Voat profile bio (that you can set
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/account/manage">
                  here
                 </a>
                 ), people will immediately see that you're the real Ken. This is not compulsory at all, but is useful to do to avoid suspicion and misunderstandings. Once you do that, I recommend you actually submit a well-sourced post about your project to get the word out in the community. If you decide to do that, feel free to reach out to me and I will help you make sure it complies with our submission rules (I'm a moderator on here).

                   Sure thing. Whenever you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line. Since you can't send private messages until you reach 100 Comment Contribution Points, or CCP (that you receive for the upvotes on your comments), to make sure I get notified just comment somewhere and mention me with the @ sign before my name, like this:

                    I really appreciate the help, surely gonna need it. Not quite the Twitter/Facebook "ergonomics" that I'm used to. I'm trying to replicate the submission that you made for our project with Becki, with the links and separate appeal section etc... I'm assuming there isn't necessarily a way to "share" a submission or whatever the correct verbiage would be on VOAT. I somewhat have an idea, but not really getting what I want. Any help would be MUCH appreciated!

But if you're thinking about resubmitting the same, with only minor differences, then don't do that as the community here frowns on duplicate posts. If you just need some of the formatting, but otherwise the content will be different, then just grab the source, and play with it. Here's some

                     for understanding the formatting code, if you don't want to mess with the editor. Since my submission was focusing on Becki and her appeal to survivors themselves, it would make sense that yours focuses on the project, and appeals to the audience and donors instead, and people will be able to ask you anything in the comment section about the project. Once you have a draft, if you like I can check it for you, just post it here as a comment reply, the same formattings apply in comments as well. You can always delete your own comment later.

                      That's helps a lot, thanks! I was looking at the source information yesterday, but wasn't sure if that's what I was needing to mess around with. Really appreciate the heads up on the resubmissions. As I mentioned, I'm still trying to learn the lay of the land, so that is good to know. I'm going to play around with the raw code and see what I can come up with. As always, really appreciate the help.

                         From a submission requirements point of view, I see absolutely nothing wrong with the post. I have two notes, but as a reader and community member, not as a moderator:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>
                          The first two sentences don't really make sense to me grammatically, you might want to tweak them a little bit.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                          I would suggest rewriting this in the first person, it feels unnatural to read about
                          <em>
                           "The founder of this project, Kenneth Dawson"
                          </em>
                          in the narration of the founder of this project, Kenneth Dawson. :) This is an opportunity for you to connect with the community, and be direct. Your post reads more like a formal advertisement for your project, which may have been an appropriate voice in my own post about it since I'm a third party sourcing information about your project, but you're the project founder himself, so I would make it a little more personal if I were you. Feel free to greet the community, introduce yourself in the first person, they will appreciate the gesture and the transparency.
                         </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                         Just my two cents. But as I said, from a strictly technical point of view, your post already complies with the submission rules, so feel free to submit it when you feel like it.
                        </p>

                         No, that's acceptable if it's justified and doesn't come across as adspam. I meant duplicates within the same subverse, which we also remove as moderators.

                         I also have a question (two actually): is your wife called
                         <em>
                          Felecia
                         </em>
                         , or is that a typo? Becki spells it as
                         <em>
                          Felicia
                         </em>
                         , so that's what I copied. And also, is it correct to call her your wife? Both questions are just so that I can edit my post for accuracy if I need to.

                          Thanks for mentioning the suggestions to the first two sentences. Funny thing is that I noticed that as I was writing, but guess I got so caught up in the "coding" that I lost track of that.

                          Lol, yes it's Felecia. We aren't married "officially" just yet, but close enough. So calling her my wife is just fine.

                             In conversation about child sex trafficking, I notice that many people don't want to hear the harsh realities of what these children suffer through. It's "too horrific". Well just imagine how it is for children who actually have to live it. Rape, torture, abuse, imprisonment et...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Some are ok with just feeling sorry, or sympathetic, but if only that was enough. We must be compelled to DO something.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Even if you don't have children of your own, you may have a niece or a nephew, or a child that you care about, that could easily become a victim. It's not a parent issue, it's a human race issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I want my daughters, your daughters, your sons, and every child to grow up in a society where child sex trafficking doesn't exist. A society where children can just be children, the way life was intended for them. Full of joy, fun, and freedom.

                       <blockquote>
                        <p>
                         We ourselves are the parents of two young daughters, and we want our girls to grow up in a society where child sex trafficking doesn't exist. Until then we will do what we can to fight for those that are exploited, victimized and can't fight for themselves. This project is a labor of love, and we are eternally grateful for the calling that God has given us to to do this project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         We thank everyone in advance for their support!
                        </p>

             Just logged back in after being away from Voat for a long time. I wish I had seen this earlier. Would you still like me to contribute? :)

              Thanks for reacting anyway. :) I think the project still hasn't kicked off and there's ample need for contributors, but I'm not involved in the production, I just posted about it when I found out. If you would be willing to help with the project, please reach out to either Becki or Kenneth, you can find their contact information in the post.
