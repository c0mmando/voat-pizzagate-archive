<h1>Producer Speaks out with New Claims About Corey Haim’s Alleged Abusers, Michael Jackson Named</h1>
<p>In an interview with Radar Online, film producer Ed Meyer named Sheen and Michael Jackson as two of the men Haim allegedly told him were his abusers.</p>
<p>The bombshell allegations came in 2008 during filming for “The Two Coreys,” a reality series starring Haim and Corey Feldman, according to Meyer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Corey said, ‘I have a problem with Michael Jackson and with Charlie Sheen,\'” Meyer recalled. “I was assaulted by these guys and a few others.”</p>

<p>And what\'s really sick, if this isn\'t sick enough is that Corey Feldman called in The Howard Stern Show to defend MJ?!!! I\'m relying on The Data Lounge for that tidbit. LaToya was appearing and basically trashed Corey saying he was &quot;too old&quot;?!!!! Too old for what? </p>
<p>Sick bitch!!!! </p>

<p>Corey Feldman is a sniveling little rat-faced midget who, once again, sold out a dead friend for publicity. I don\'t know why. Nobody\'s gonna give him a job. He says Corey Haim was used by a bunch of industry guys, that he always wanted Feldman to set him up with Daddies. Now that Corey\'s all butched-up and married, he\'s forgetting that he already told the world how he himself was &quot;sodomized&quot; by older men in the business. He is leaving that part out in his new book and just saying Haim was a raving, gay nymphomaniac. </p>
<p>...
I remember listening to Howard Stern interviewing LaToya Jackson before she shut up about the child molestation. Cory Feldman called in to defend his biggest celebrity connection by saying LaToya\'s brother never put the moves on him. Without missing a beat, LaToya said that The teenaged Cory had been too old for MJ and that her brother complained about Cory hanging around and never going away.</p>
<p>I kind of think that the weirdest person in Hollywood is disappointed that he was never able to seduce the second-weirdest, and thus gain some sort of meaningful celebrity.</p>

            If Michael Jackson was a pedophile he would have been protected by the pedo-mafia, not targeted by them in a massive and vicious hate campaign. IMHO.

            must be Michael Jackson night
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael has been at the Playboy Mansion....
           </p>
           <p>
            Director of Thriller, John Landis said: 
“The next potential problem arose with Ola Ray, the actress Landis wanted to play Jackson’s girlfriend. “We found out she had been a Playboy playmate. Oh, Jesus Christ! I went to Michael and told him and said, ‘Can I hire her?’ He said, ‘Sure’, though I don’t think he even knew what I was talking about.”
Are you sure about that, Landis?
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael takes Tatum O'Neal out to the Playboy Mansion on their first date, March 1977
           </p>
           <p>
            Photos of Hoefflin, Michael and Hugh Hefner posing together after a Victory Tour show. Dr Hoefflin says Michael asked him to take him to the Playboy Mansion after Thriller, 1982

            wonder if he based Neverland on the Playboy Mansion?  hmmmm
           </p>
           <p>
            also, I believe both Hugh and Michael worked for CIA
           </p>
           <p>
            wonder who the director was,  obviously a trigger

             Great find! UpVoat for you!
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, MJ was going to the Playboy Mansion to see the "animals". Right ...
            </p>
            <p>
             It's amazing how much of this PR crap people believe. It's why PedoWood has been gotten away with covering up things for so long. As for the CIA's involvement, I wouldn't be surprised. Especially given the white rabbit symbolism.

            Ok hold on a second.  Take a step back and consider the source.  He may be a nobody producer who is currently struggling may want some attention.  Corey Feldman....heck Corey Haim both of them could have extorted money from Jackson if they wanted.  Haim was quite broke at times especially when he was heavy into drugs.  I tend to think Jackson was innocent of all allegations for several reasons.  The media never rabidly goes after anyone in Hollywood unless the elite want to take someone down.  If you are a true pedophile, Hollywood protects you.  However, they have been after Jackson for a long long time.  He also doesn't fit the profile....Jackson acted like he himself was abused not like he was the abuser.  I could go into detail about his profile but maybe some other post.  Corey Feldman emphatically denies Jackson was a pedophile.  When you have been abused you don't imitate the abuser, you don't want to see a picture of them or be in the same room with them.  And you certainly don't defend them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until I see some sort of proof, I'm going to go with Feldmans account.  Heck I don't even think there is a picture of Haim and Jackson together at a social event.  Charley Sheen on the other hand I have no opinion one way or the other.  He very well could be an abuser

              Spotted in the women's bathroom at a mall while visiting Dubai, wearing women's clothing and applying makeup. After which Michael Jackson's spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., issued a statement in response, which was picked up by the Associated Press It was all a mistake! Wrong door! Some of the news coverage has been sensationalistic One plotline has it that Michael Jackson is taking forty Xanas a day, delivered via secret flights from California. Which is somehow tied to some underpants that investigators had found at Neverland that tested positive for trace amounts of cocaine but were never introduced at the trial because, you know, anyone could have been handling those underpants unclear how it all links up, but underpants and cocaine a bad combination for Mr. Sleepover.

             As for your point about the media never outing the pedos or pedo rings, you are correct and make a great point. However, what you're leaving out is that MJ was getting hit with lawsuits and criminal complaints. Not good when the pedos in PedoWood want everything to remain hidden. While MJ paid off his accusors, the children were getting older and there was a chance there would be more of them talking about what happened. Then there's MJ shooting off his mouth and announcing on camera in an interview that the best way to show love is to share your bed -- with children?!!!! Yeah, no ... no, no, no, no, NO!!!! Just NO!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, believe what you want. There is so much freakin' evidence it's ridiculous The biggest evidence? That cosmetic surgery that turned him into Peter Pan. That's a HUGE tip off!

              Corey Haim's actions show he was never molested by Jackson.  Because Haim stayed good friends with Feldman even though Feldman routinely, praised Jackson, dressed like him, and imitated him.  If you watch their reality show that they did together you would see that Haim adored Feldman.  Feldman was fed up with Haims drug abuse and Haim was upset about Feldman not protecting him from the pedophiles that abused both of them, but otherwise they were good friends.  If my good friend was dressing like and idolizing my abuser, it would make me want to wretch my guts out.  I couldn't be friends with that person.  So you see, Haims devotion to Feldman shows Jackson was innocent of these charges.   I am not a Michael Jackson fan.  I've never owned a record of his.  But when he was accused of child molestation, I watched his trial meticulously looking for his guilt or innocence.  I also watched the Martin Brashir interview with him.  I can't go point by point with you as it would take too long but my assessment after viewing all the witnesses was that it was a hit job on Jackson.  Later I found out that Jackson was speaking out exposing the evil people who run things.  When Hollywood is done with an actor or Musician they will take them out and try to pry their money from them before all is said and done.  Randy Quaid talks about this and it's happened to others.  Regardless, his children who are now adults have never indicated he abused them.  Also I must say that there is motive to damage Feldman as an accuser.  Think about it.  If Feldman is discredited, then anyone who he is accused gets off scott free.   There are those who he named and those who he has yet to name.  It is in their best interest to destroy him.  To the general public, it is clear that the two Corey's were abused.  Why not accuse a man who is dead and can't defend himself of abusing a man who is dead and can't tell his story.  Easy as pie!  Who can prove you wrong?  And in the process, make Feldman look like a horrible human being for sticking up for Jackson.  It's all too neat

               This. As you stated, this is your assessment. And poor MJ. Persecuted and victimized because he's misunderstood and not because he's doing anything wrong.

               Not going to argue with you. You know the real victims? The boys who were abused and their fathers. Wade Robson's father ended up committing suicide:

               I highly doubt you are not a Michael Jackson fan. I have supported the victims of MJ for almost five years. Many of them come to the page I created stating exactly what you stated.  As for your talking point about being a hit job laughable. Michael Jackson had full control over the Bashir interview because much of it was left out per his direction.  The fact that Michael Jackson would allow any child to sit next to him and discuss why it is perfectly fine to share a bed with an unrelated child shows his total disregard for the child. Adults don't put children in ambiguous situations to garner positive press. MJ knew what he was accused of in 1993 and used Gavin Arvizo a child to push his personal agenda. Also responsible adults don't use children to reclaim their lost childhood. Children should not be put in a position to heal his psychological issues. The other point people seem to gloss over when it comes to the Arvizo case is the whole premise made by defense attorney Tom Mesereau.  He stated this was nothing more than a money grab. However history has proven him wrong. Before the case Janet Arvizo was asked if she will take this to a civil trial and she stated no. After the trial she was asked the same question and gave the same answer no. Make no mistake Michael Jackson was in no position to fight a civil trial. Much of the barred information from the trial would be fair game. He could not hide behind his attorney he would have to give a deposition and Michael Jackson at the end of that trial was frail. The Arvizos could have also taken the easy route,  paid interviews, book deal, etc. To this day they never have asked for a dime from Jackson after the trial. Gavin still has six figure offers and refused. I could also go on and on and your assessment is way off. Stop excusing predatory behavior, the patterns don't change just the place holders

I like predominately folk rock of the 60's with a lot of classical music thrown in as I play violin.  So your skills at spotting a Jackson fanatic are questionable.  Really it amounts to "suggest MJ could be innocent and you are just a ridiculous fan".   I gave reasonable arguments.  You disagree fine but if you don't understand how the power structure in Hollywood works and how the press is a propaganda tool to promote people or to bring them to their knees, then I can't help you.  People can and have been paid to set up and accuse others.  Just knowing that though is clearly not enough for acquittal.  Janet Arvizo is mother was a seriously shady character and no one looking into the facts of the trial can say otherwise. They were gold diggers asking George Lopez constantly for money.  That family also approached Jay Leno weirdly.  I'm sorry but when I watched the trial, I came to the conclusion that the boy and his family wasn't credible.  So did the jury by the way.  So re-litigating a case is pointless now.

                Corey Feldman said he didn't molest him and that Jackson was one of the good guys.  You either believe him or you don't.  Until a video of Haim comes out saying he was abused by Jackson, I'm taking Corey's word for it.

                 I did not agree with you thinking that it is air tight Jackson did not do anything because Feldman stayed friends withh Jackson and Haim stayed friends with Feldman. That is not something that proves anything IMO. Victims in that business seem to stay close to predators so why can't a victim stay friends with a friend of a predator?

                 Again nothing but fluff. If the Arvizos wanted money for participating in a criminal trial they would of pursued all avenues. The argument was Janet Arvizo wanted a pay day and because of the California statute she had to do a criminal trial first. Con artists ate Not going to go through the motions without receiving a pay day, Never Happened. To disprove a hypothesis of action A creates product B. There has to be a B. Sorry no pay day.

                 As for your I have been fighting child abuse, really. Supporting a individual who selected, groomed, isolated and discarded children does not bother. A man who Advocated for unrelated adults sharing beds with children. A man that had one of his accusers accurately describe his genitals according to lead investigator Bill Dworin and I would put his reputation of fighting for victims over yours any day of the week. So yes I think you are a me sycophant and I have a page that shows the work I have done where is your proof of many years

               Ok yes well thats all well and good, except that Corey also dresses up very much like Charlie Sheen. In fact all the times ive seen him recently he has looked the spitting image of Charlie. So it could be a case of obsession with your abuser. And also like where a kidnapper becomes friends with the victims over time. Maybe its a similar effect. I dont know but I find it weird that Corey looks so much like Charlie these days.

                Sheen doesn't exactly have memorable dress style.  He's pretty much suit with or without a tie or maybe the odd "dad shirt" or Hawaiian shirt.  Seriously, I wouldn't say Feldman is imitating Charley Sheen's style.

             I tend to take Haim's word on Jackson too. If he said Jackson didn't abuse him I have no reason to believe that Jackson did. The cult hated Jackson because he started to rebel against their evil shit and they whacked him in my opinion. You also don't hear rampant stories of Jackson having an evil reputation like most of the real scum. That whole thing didn't smell right to me.

            Attack the mangled remains of an abuse victim who is traumatized, making mistakes, but has done more than anybody in Hollywood in recent years to bring pedophilia into the mainstream. Sound typical of Hollywood tactics.

             Sorry, Feldman is a joke, always coming from an angle and his revelations always seem to be limited hangouts. I detest Feldmans act. Yeah, he will reveal all if he can get 10 million to make a movie showing what he knows. Consistantly an ass.

              Whatever Jackson did I give him a lot of latitude. Jackson was not a true predator in my opinion. His abuse started at birth with his father but I don't think they succeeded in turning him into a vicious sadistic predator. I also suspect he could have been MK Ultra victim. I think he was abused so badly that he was seeking that inner child, that innocence, that they stole from him as a child, and that is why he was so childlike.
             </p>
             <p>
              At times you could see him gain strength and do songs like "They Don't Care About Us." I think the reason he hung around children so much is because they stole his childhood and he felt safe around children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe he did have sex with children. I don't know. But I don't believe they succeeded in turning him into a vicious predator.

            I know.  The style of dress has been obvious to me for some time.  He is a kind of flashy dresser.  Granted he is in a band, but he could have chosen some other style.  Very strange indeed.  He is committing the worst kind of sin in the Friendship Club.  He is throwing a deceased "friend" under the bus and he cannot defend himself.  He also has the other Corey's Mom to back him up because she has sold out her son as well.  These people are Scum. No one should buy his book.  If there is one lie in it, there could be a Hundred.

              Possibly.  Or another Hiding in Plain Sight.  These people are sick in the head.  Totally Demented.  I think there could be a few answers to that one.  Usually the handler is older and more mature, but that is not always the case.  But Feldman could have earned his stripes early, and been promoted by the Pedowood Elites.

             He really was jealous of Haim. It's pathetic how he sold him out. And look at this. Feldman was on Howard Stern's show and does a MJ imitation. And what's up with Stern? He just made it onto my radar.

               Stern is in the same category of gross as Seville, IMHO. Anytime I see him, which is always by accident, I feel I need to shower

               I must have missed this part of Stern's career. Why is he talking like that? And Feldman ... I don't know which one is worse.

              Yeah, Stern is Filthy, imo.  There is also the George Takei stuff on Stern.  Beyond Disgusting.  Someone sent me a pic and I nearly fell off my chair.  It was sick.  Haim should be Ostracized. He should never sell One Book.  Never.  Boycott Haim.

               And for all these years, Feldman has made a living off the fact he was once Haim's "friend". Feldman was never a friend. NEVER! He's part of the problem!

                 Every time I think about Haim, I realize he could have been getting better and maybe sued the asses of those pedos who abused him!!! But there was Feldman, like Satan, whispering in his ear and handling him for the Pedo Masters!!!!

                   I chose to be a handler and probably recruited Haim. Then when Haim was suffering, Feldman "pretended" to empathize with him and played victim when the truth is HE WAS ONE OF THEM!!!! He abused Haim as much as any of that pedo ring!!!

                    That could have broken Haim's heart.  The person he thought would have his back, Feldman,  abused him just like the others.  First his Mother and then Feldman.  No wonder he took his life.

                     Absolutely. It's why he used to get so angry at Feldman, and Feldman would BS him about them both going through the same thing.

                     I doubt deep down inside that Haim believed it.

                      God this stuff is beyond belief.  There has to be a special place to torture these people.  I think a while ago I suggested Guantanamo.  Perfect Place.  or Abu Graib.  Either one of those would be just fine.  We should take a vote and send it out on twitter.  All Pedophiles take notice:  You will be sent to Guantanamo.   Tweet to Trump.
