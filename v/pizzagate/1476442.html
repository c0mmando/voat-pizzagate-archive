This just-released interview by Kevin Annett of the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State was done on June 5 2014 in preparation for Ann Marie’s testimony before 5 judges and 27 jury members of the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Due to death threats, ICLCJ Court officials and over 60 court witnesses to these same type of child rape and murders that appear to be under the direction of this Vatican and mafia-run Satanic group, remain in hiding. Watch for other parts of this interview forthcoming at www.itccs.org.

<p>Transcript of Anne Marie van Blijenburgh video:</p>
<p>“My name is Anne Marie van Blijenburgh. I have been married for twenty four years to Kees van Korlaar. Together with his three brothers, Kees van Korlaar formed a criminal organization known as the Octopus Syndicate (The Octopus Syndicate is a Holland slang term for Ndrangheta, the modern Italian-based mafia connected to the Vatican).</p>
<p>“By order of Dutch Queen Beatrix the criminals (or Ndrangheta Mafia) have worked from 1960 through today organizing the murder, torture and rape of children in Netherlands youth detention centers. Through the Dutch Court, the youth detention centers were asked for children who could work for Dutch Queen Beatrix. They gladly volunteered the files of certain children. If they wanted to verify what the criminals told them they were given a name and phone number of a high ranking officer in Queen Beatrix’s Court. That high ranking officer would tell them that indeed the criminals were seeking children to work for a certain period at the Dutch Court.</p>
<p>“After receiving the files, the criminals selected a child that had no relative or family. They told the youth detention center that those were the ones they wanted. The youth detention center would put the child on the train to Zwolle. In Zwolle, the criminals fetched the child from the station and brought them to a building that was equipped like a hotel. But, it was not working as a hotel, although there were people in the lobby as if the hotel was working. The child was put on a table and was given something to drink. The child was drugged with that drink.</p>
<p>“Beside the hotel was a building where the performance (a Satanic Child Sacrifice murder ritual) took place. In that building there were people sitting down. At a certain moment the child was brought into that building by the criminals, was tortured, raped and brutally murdered in front of those people.</p>
<p>“The audience was relatives and friends of (Dutch) Prince Johann Friso, the second son of (Dutch) Queen Beatrix. I was told that Johann Friso was quite insane and had an unhealthy interest in young children. He had a psychiatrist with him every day of his life. That psychiatrist’s name was Guus Pareau Dumont.</p>
<p>“The criminals organized those killings in accordance with Queen Beatrix. She paid for the killings. The criminals asked Johann Friso to bring his relatives and friends with him. The whole building was filled with very important people from the Netherlands. There were ministers, high ranking officers and all kinds of people that the criminals could photograph (while sexually abusing naked child victims). They blackmailed those people to get advantages using the (child pornography) photographs.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: Could you name some of the people who were present?</p>
<p>“The people who I recognized were Prince Johann Friso and his psychiatrist Guus Pareau Dumont. I recognized Johann’s wife Mabel Wisse Smit. She was there with an old man, XXXX (a prominent American businessman) I believe. I recognized a Herr Donner, a former minister of the law department, the Vice Roy of the Netherlands. I recognized Ernst Hirsch Ballin, a very important former Minister of Justice. I recognized a Mr. Van den Emster. He was for years the head of judges in the Netherlands. I recognized Dick Berlijn. He’s a former head of the military department in the Netherlands. I recognized a very important journalist. I recognized Carla Eradus, the wife of Friso’s psychiatrist Guus Pareau Dumont. Carla is the President of the Court in Amsterdam, a judge. I recognized Mark Rutte. He’s at this moment the President of the Netherlands. I recognized Geert Wilders. He is at this moment the head of the political party PVV and head of the Dutch Parliament.</p>
<p>“There were about fifty people every time I was taken there. I have been taken there three times. I have seen every time that they killed a child. I have seen two boys killed and one girl killed. I presume they were children from the Netherlands. I presume they came from detention centers and were recruited in the way I have told.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: You said that officials at the detention center thought that the children had been eaten?</p>
<p>“I asked a journalist of the paper De Telegraff in 2005 or 2006 to look that up for me. I asked them to publish in the newspaper what was happening. The journalist told me he had checked my story with all the youth detention centers in the Netherlands and had spoken to people who had indeed given those files to the criminals. They thought that the children they put on the train were going to be solicited to work in the court of Queen Beatrix. Some of those detention center people told the journalist that they thought that Queen Beatrix was eating those children up because they were putting them on the train to Zwolle. They never saw those children again or ever heard about them anymore.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: Do you know what happened to the remains of the children who died, where they were buried, or what they did with them?</p>
<p>“Yes, unfortunately I know. Yes. They were first thrown in a container behind the building where they were murdered. It was a cooling container. After certain performances the container was brought to Belgium where they had a piece of land. They put the children in a hole.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: What is the name of the place in Belgium, do you know?</p>
<p>“I must look it up. I found it, but I must look it up.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: What is it that you’d like to see happen about all of this?</p>
<p>“I want to see those criminals forever locked up.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: You haven’t received any help in the Netherlands, you said?</p>
<p>“Not one thing. No. It’s terrible. From 2004 to today I have spoken with every policeman I could find and every law official. I’ve talked to INTERPOL about this. I’ve been to (the Dutch) Court to try to get a prosecutor to convict this and investigate the matter. The Court told me it wasn’t my problem. They said it was a problem of society and the Court didn’t want to give an order to the prosecutor to investigate. I have done literally everything to clear this up. I have the idea that everything is stopped because Queen Beatrix is involved and the Dutch Court is involved. Every time somebody wants to investigate they slap him on the shoulders and say don’t do that because Queen Beatrix doesn’t want it.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: Are you willing to give this testimony in another court, say a Common Law Court?</p>
<p>“Yes. I have no objection about that. I am very, very angry. If you’ve seen what I’ve seen . . . It always will stay with me. I can’t put it aside because it’s one of the cruelest things I have seen. It’s horrible. It’s really horrible. The idiots.</p>
<p>“One time when I was going back to my home, my husband who took me there, he drugged and let me see that. He brought me back to my home a hundred kilometers away. During that ride I suddenly came to my senses. I suddenly discovered that it was a child that I had seen killed. I burst into tears. My husband was driving and he put his arm to me and he said, ‘Don’t bother. They’re children of a minor family. They’re orphans. They’re just trash. It doesn’t matter they were killed.’</p>
<p>“It’s horrible. I can’t describe it. It’s horrible those people were sitting there and looking and not doing anything.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: And your husband is still alive?</p>
<p>“He’s still alive. He’s still killing people. If you just think how many people since 2004 have been killed. It’s been ten years. They kill perhaps ten or twenty people a year if not more. It’s horrible. I have shown the police four places in the Netherlands they use as grave yards for people they killed. Never, never has any policeman ever taken the trouble to look.”</p>
<p>Kevin Annett: Can you name those four places?</p>
<p>“Yes I can name them. I can show them, but I will put them to you by email. The criminals know I have told the police. They’ve had every opportunity to let the bodies disappear. I know two places where it is difficult for them to disappear. Normally in the Netherlands when you find a body in a house with blood, the police go with 20 or 30 people to investigate. But when I say to the police I know four places in the Netherlands they use as a graveyard and every graveyard perhaps 20 or 50, perhaps 100 bodies are buried there, nobody is looking. Nobody goes to those places.”</p>
<p>In this interview some perpetrators mentioned by Anne Marie van Blijenburgh were also named in an article on Human Hunting Parties in the Netherlands titled: “European royals killing naked children for fun at human hunting parties?,” plus were referred to in an article on Human Hunting Parties in Australia titled: “CIA bonded with Nazis to sex traffic, kill naked children at human hunting parties?”</p>

            Ok, bro, I'm sure you've had a rough life. You're a unique case I'm sure. In the game of victimhood narratives, you have earned seven shekels so far. Would you like to keep playing? Yes? Well, I don't care. I don't give a shit about your supposed past suffering. This is the internet. It's for pron, cats, and the search for Truth. I don't care about your THICC ass or your tight gyaru boipussy.

            If you're still reading this... just read on. My only point in all of this is that we are finite beings and living in an impossibly complex world. Because of our "nakedness" to the infinite, or God, or whatever word you wanna use, our capacity -- and all of humanity's capacity -- to commit evil is real and can manifest itself in myriad ways. How we respond to this Truth as I see it -- that is the bile that occupies our deepest being -- is key. And it sounds like you've got a hold on it. Great. Some people do. Some people don't. And I don't think that's ever going to change no matter how many pizzagates there are.

            War never changes. Man never changes. Societies change, but they may only be as cyclical as everything else.

            Him? Did you just assume J-dog's gender? Seriously, Jesus fucking Christ, they're invaluable mythology of our emergence from nature, but take it easy. And I'm sure Jesus loves you just as much, and God on his flying nimbus. That's why you had such a good life -- because they love you so fucking much. Ha! I'm fucking with you. No, bro, people love you, not the Big Brother in the sky. He don't give a shit about you. Grow some balls, and take your agency into your own hands. You'll feel better about yourself. And if you're a paid shill, ruminate on your pointless life. Now call me a nigger faggot and ignore all of this. Smoke a bit maybe and calm the fuck down. You'll be all right, fuckboi.

            The Common court CASA program allows volunteers to care/counsel infants to 14 year old? I was trying to find out more info on the common law court and was drawn to this. 
On another note: Does anything have connections with merchantware or the pizza ordering sites and merchants? Ordercraze.com order5.ordercraze.com order3.ordercraze.com order9.ordercraze.com

            Our proclivity toward that darkness seems heightened the more morally justified our actions become. Ideologues always see themselves on the correct side of history.

            As a Polish-American who was raised Catholic and did 13 years in Jesuit schools, believe me, I'm very familiar with JP2's official biography.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of all the recent Church leaders, it would sting the most to see that JP2 was involved in some of this dark occult shit, but unfortunately the Catholic Church is not an infallible organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were you, I wouldn't take the official biography/hagiography of
            <em>
             any
            </em>
            Pope 100% at face value. The Vatican, like the CIA, derives much of its power from secrecy, and nasty things fester in the dark. I'm not saying JP2 is a
            <em>
             confirmed
            </em>
            devil-worshipping pedo, but stranger things have indeed happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            For a little background on the dark side of the modern Church, google "Archbishop Paul Marcinckus", "Vatican Bank CIA", "Licio Gelli", or "Propaganda Due (P2)".

            It just doesn't get any easier reading these eye witness testimonies. Please everyone take care of yourselves and never give up on hope for justice. Spread these links far and wide. Don't be afraid of opposition or ridicule and stand by what you know. I'm not a religious person but I believe in the powerful force of truth. Don't fight with your fellow man but continue to point out who the real enemies are.

            your assumption that the Catholic Church in the 1980s was "good" and that the Soviet bloc was inherently "Satanic" is an oversimplified and biased one.
           </p>
           <p>
            JP2 and his lieutenant, Cardinal Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) covered up multiple cases of priests committing child sex abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Soros also cut his chops in the Color Revolution game by using NGOs to undermine communist governments in Eastern Europe in the 1980s...was he fighting Satan too?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because someone is feverishly anti-communist doesn't mean they're a Good Guy. The deep staters who assassinated JFK, MLK and RFK were all "anti-communists".
           </p>
           <p>
            Know who was the most "anti-communist" group of them all? Nazi Germany.

            well I guess if I am unable to meet your level of intelligence then this conversation is nothing more than you spending your time shitting on me, the moron. Why are you here? Why do you care? I'm so insignificant, so inconsequential, why give a fuck? Maybe, just maybe, you are a fraud, an angry slanderer who makes his living off of deception and obfuscation. You, sir, are a liar. And maybe even a child molester. We are watching.

            there's also "The Octopus", the CIA-linked deep state criminal network that Danny Casolaro was investigating before he was laughably "suicided" in his motel room in the early 90s.

            What if I told you there are purposely no locations mentioned so that the validity can't be checked by an independent investigator? I'd see to it that that took place if they said where this was.

           <p>
            I'm not saying I have a practical fix for this problem, but my personal view is that nonviolence is better, and I'll stick with that.  I respect your disagreement on that.  I'll still urge people to restrain themselves from violence and focus on exposing the evil.

             "A Dutch court rejected an attempt by anti-paedophile campaigners to ban the Brotherly Love, Freedom and Diversity party (PNVD), which wants to cut the age of consent from 16 to 12 and to legalise child pornography. "The freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association should be seen as the foundations of the democratic rule of law and the PNVD is also entitled to these freedoms," the court in The Hague said in a statement."

            I've seen "International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State" pop up a couple times since this whole thing started and I'm having trouble seeing them as a legit organization. Is there any evidence that shows they are? I honestly just want to know for sure

             In its sinister efforts, the US government is supported by the governments of its vassal states. This time, a major role was assigned to the Dutch government. The first Dutch actor to make a public statement was the Minister of Justice,
             <strong>
              Ernst Hirsch Ballin
             </strong>
             . It is a mystery how this man ever made it back to a cabinet position, after being forced to resign in 1994 as justice minister for his involvement in a billion dollar drug trafficking operation.
             <strong>
              The man is also suspected of paedophilia.
             </strong>
             Moreover, the highest ranking public servant in the justice ministry is a notorious paedophile. Hirsch Ballin called for the immediate introduction of full body scanners at Dutch airports. A few days later, Dutch interior minister, Mrs. Guusje ter Horst was cued to chip in. This woman, an alcoholic who is routinely let off the hook by the police whenever she is caught driving while drunk, actually had the nerve to say that the world had escaped disaster when the “crotch bomber” plan was foiled

            The central event of his life as a royal came when he gave up his claim to the throne in order to marry Dutchwoman Mabel Wisse Smit, in a wedding not sanctioned by the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            The couple got engaged in 2003. Wisse Smit worked for George Soros’s Open Society Institute and was seen by the queen as an ideal daughter-in-law. But during her vetting to join the royal house, she and Prince Friso decided not to disclose the full extent of a friendship she had had while she was a college student.
           </p>
           <p>
            The friend in question: drug baron Klaas Bruinsma, who later became one of the country’s most infamous crime lords and was slain in a 1991 gangland killing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wisse Smit denies ever having had any romantic involvement with Bruinsma and says she hadn’t understood who he was at the time. But as details about their relationship emerged in the Dutch press, then-Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said it was clear the pair had held back information and he wouldn’t propose the law needed for parliament to approve Wisse Smit’s entry to the royal house.

            If it is at all true, don't you feel a little bit strange knowing you were very close to where this could have taken place?

            I have heard rumors that people in the upper echelons of American politics are required to attend such rituals which is then used as a blackmail tool against them.

            WW2 could have ended very well for everyone. Except the Jew.

           <p>
            But here we are, the present day, slaves to the Jew. Subjected to their social experiments, twisted and dissected. Sub-human animals to be played with and manipulated by Jews. Are you enjoying your present day? Everything that makes you, you, subject to examination and critique. Lab rats. Hitler fought a war against this very result. The Jews won. Now we die. We helped kill ourselves.

             You really don't have a clue do you? 1. The Nazi's kept on useful jews and made them honorary Nazi's. 2. "Subjected to their social experiments, twisted and dissected." Mate, the Nazi's are the basis and the scientists behind MKUltra and the worst toture, social/medical experiments. MKUltra is fundamentally Nazi in its origin. 3. The Nazi's considered any non-nordics to be sub-human, they killed millions of poles, slavs, Russians. All of Europe at the least would be subjugated to the whims of nutters. 4. Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Goering: all severely disturbed, abnormal personalities. There has never been an inner circle as mentally abnormal as them that I know of. Attachment disorders, repressed homosexuality, bizarre torture fetishes etc. 5. Hitler wanted a Germanic imperial Europe, and was of the opinion that no great empire was built without slavery. The people of Europe bud have been second class citizens building the German Reich up.     The most ludicrous statement I've ever heard in my life. This child sex, mind control shit was industrialised by the Nazis you dope.

               That's bollocks mate, many of these things were found out long before the Jews were a major political influence, in facts the jews didn't have a very sympathetic audience in America. The Russians, Poles, the Nazi's documents which have been pored over. I've read works refuting it, they are fundamentally biased and are themselves propaganda. While there is no doubt The Jewish are disproportionately powerful now, to refute what there s concrete evidence of is ridiculous. If your going to contribute to an investigation you could do it a favour by contributing things that don't completely fly in the face of established knowledge.

                 I will when I get a chance, however reading many history books with verified sources, which critique the documents they pore over and explain their interpretation is good for understanding the war. Biographies from reputable, objective biographers and psychological profiles of the Nazi leadership are the best info we have on the Nazis, and they generally have a consensus.

                  Germany fought for a free Europe. Europe lost. Watch now as Europe dies. Oh I'll be so happy for you to acknowledge the righteousness of the Nazi party. As Europe is conquered by 3rd world peoples. No, actually I won't be happy, and there is no joy. I wish you were not so easily deceived. We are the future, we are making history right now. We are dying. And your ignorance is paving the way for a future nightmare.

                   Ignorance? I'd love to be enlightened. They fought for a German Empire encompassing all of Europe, and would have enslaved most of the Europeans to allow for this. That is not a free Europe. National Socialism, that is not freedom. Do you want to live under dictatorial socialism? Where each individual is a subunit of the state? Where for the average person they tell you where to work and you are not free to leave? You are a state employee and obliged to serve Nazism, regardless of whether you agree with it? That is not freedom. That is a man with a severe, well-documented maladjustment to society, with his equally maladjusted sycophants (they were absolutely cowardly sycophants, spineless) deciding on your future and what is best for you, based on ideology with no scientific basis. Our world is fucking awful and in decline, but to think the Nazi's would have ushered in a new utopia would be laughable, if it weren't so bewildering. As for ignorance, I have studied both wars, the intervening period, the politics and the major characters for years, and it would not matter to me either way what I found so long as it is the objective truth, and the evidence is very strong in favour of what I've mentioned.

                      bla bla bla, Nationalism is superior to any philosophy you subscribe to. You are part of the insanity which is enabling 500 different genders, the demonization of Europeans, and the destruction of decency in general. I pray for the day where we are at open war. I will show you fanaticism. First the hippy communist faggots, then the Jews.

                       Oh my good god you idiot national SOCIALISM you cretin. It is communism, just with a nationalist bent you complete fucking mongoloid. You don't have a clue about your own philosophy and you certainly have no inkling of mine, or any other philosophy out there. I am not part of the insanity advocating the destruction of Europeans, I am a fucking European, and the fucking Nazis wanted to subjugate us in their Germanic SOCIALIST  reich you dippy bastard. Read a book fuckwit, something that wasn't written by a nazi which just excuses all the scientific and historical evidence pointing out how corrupt, idiotic they were. You realise just how shocking a wartime commander Hitler was don't you? His bold gambling won him some unbelievable victories but his messiah complex led him to believe he knew anything about military strategy other than aping Napoleon, and at that not even learning Napoleons lesson about invading Russia. Fucking hell you call yourself a nazi but you know absolutely nothing about them. Typical. Do you know how many germans died because his idiotic stubbornness and complete divorce from the reality of battlefield situations? He was absolutely shocking.

                  Germany fought for a free Europe. Europe lost. Watch now as Europe dies. Oh I'll be so happy for your to acknowledge the righteousness of the Nazi party as Europe is conquered by 3rd world peoples. No, actually I won't be happy, and there is no joy. I wish you were not so easily deceived. We are the future, we are making history right now. We are dying. And your ignorance is in large part why.

            Okay, if she really believes this and maybe convinced 5 people in the netherlands. What is stopping her to go with a small group to go look into those fields where she claimes kids are buried? Wouldn't that be the way to find definitive proof for her allegations? Why is she sitting on her ass expecting the government to plough through such a field?

             If she's a mafia wife I doubt that she's down for that kind of investigation and work. That being said her testimony is helpful to the cause and I for one am grateful.

             Yup! I once linked an article that got removed (didn't think it was THAT important of an article), and when I went to find the archive of it, there wasn't one, gone!

            The only answer to this is violence, unreserved and brutal retribution. Murder them all. They have forfeited their right to live among us. Death to the pedophiles! They harbor bad genes, they must be removed from the pool. Purify humanity.

              Perhaps, but violence is not evil. Violence creates civilization and repels barbarians. Violence, AKA strength, is the very quality which enables civilization to exist.

             No, the answer is for everyone to know about this.  Violence will not solve the problem.

              No, Violence is the only solution. You must force your will upon the enslaved masses less the masses forces its will upon you. The time for diplomacy has passed. We are being wiped off the face of the earth. Or had you not noticed? Faggot.

                 Ah, unmitigated ad hominem. How's working at CTR going for you? Lucky you, that you get to talk to someone who's only a passing observer of the situation, and not actually investigating anything, not that I would fall for such distraction if I were. Anyway, to your "argument":

                   But I understand what you're saying. I'm not the kind of person to walk into the street with a pitchfork, at least not now. I need to conquer myself before I can conquer my enemies. Sorry if that sounds cucked to you. I'd die for my family if that means anything, but I'm not gonna try to be some ill-equipped, Batman-wannabe, hokey-pad-wearing, 5th-of-November, vigilante faggot. Your idea of a purge is romantic, your wanting to "cleanse" the world of evil, but it's ill-informed with regard to the reality of the bile that exists within all humans. You can pretend to be morally justified, but you're the apple-flavored ideologue to their orange-flavored. But good luck to you anyway! If you wanna keep calling me a faggot, which I clearly am, I'm here all day!

                     Much was said, and therein lies the problem. Your cognitive ability is less than adequate in relation to where humanity is headed. Your make a mockery of yourself. I think it's time for a purge.

                      It's true. Living life as a dumb inbred hick. I struggle to even comprehend the easiest of social agendas. I look at lesbian couples and am instinctively repelled, but I know, thanks to you and your liberal friends, that the problem is me and my ignorance. If only I could learn enough, then I would see the world just like you. And we could get along, as comrades. I am sorry. I will try to reeducate myself. I want to join your hippy Jewish commie world, I really do. But I need your help. Will you guide me into utopia? please

                 We all felt this emotional when realizing this is all not conspiracy-mythology but in fact conspiracy-fact. Relax. Take a couple days away from this and dive into some healthy hobbies away from world history and politics...if only for a couple days if you can. I know the underbelly of the world is magnetic, but our sanity suffers from looking into the abyss. Do yourself a favor and try to separate yourself form this every now and then. Out of self preservation even. Otherwise you will be reduced to a ''literally shaking'' emotional lefty-wreck  lol

                 Just my two cents.

                      No shit? Well thanks, mr azagthoth. You have shown me the wrongness of my ways. You are a hero. Assuming I exist in some black and white world where absolutes dominate reality. You are so smart. When you are not busy, drinking mt dew and eating Doritos, maybe you can find time to visit the human zoo I call home and critique our way of life? I would so love to have you come and preach to me how I should be living. Thanks.

            If the elite want to continue into the 21st century, this is exactly the type of testimony that sets people apart. This is great testimony. We need more. They don't deserve your silence.

           </p>
           <p>
            Since last month’s arrest of two Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult members in Montreal Canada during their preparations for a child sacrifice, the ICLCJ Court has been considering Child Sacrifice links to the Vatican, CIA and American global corporations Sinclair Oil, HSBC, Gargill and Cameco Uranium.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the ITCCS website over sixty eyewitnesses have identified members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult as Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Popes Francis, John Paul II and Joseph Ratzinger; Catholic Jesuit Superior General Adolfo Pachon, a Dutch Cardinal, other Catholic Cardinals; the UK’s Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Phillip; Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, UK High Court Justice Judge Fulford; in the Netherlands the consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, former Dutch ministers, the top man of the Dutch Army Force, head of the Dutch Parliament Geert Wilers, Belgian royals King Hendrick, Netherlands Bilderberger Founder Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard, his daughter Belgium Queen Beatrix, her son Prince Johan Friso, Friso’s wife Mabel Wisse Smit, Friso’s psychiatrist Guus Pareau Dumont, Dumont’s wife and President of the Court in Amsterdam Carla Eradus, the present under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix, former minister of the Netherlands law department Herr Donner, former Minister of Justice Ernst Hirsch Ballin, head of Netherlands judges Van den Emster, former head of the Netherlands military department Dick Berlijn, a prominent Netherlands journalist, a prominent Netherlands judge, head of the Netherlands PVV political party and President of the Netherlands Mark Rutte; officials of the Canadian, Dutch, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians, businessmen and celebrities in the US, UK, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France and Ireland.

            This article is dedicated to victims of the Vatican and mafia-run global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult, along with the memory of over 50,800 missing children, some of whom rest in 34 mainly Catholic-owned unmarked mass grave sites across Canada, Ireland and Spain. Their perpetrators continue to live lives free of responsibility for their ongoing crimes. Our prayers are with these innocents, and should be for ourselves if we allow this Child Holocaust by our global leaders to continue.\

             Camerco seems to be a typo, correct:
             <strong>

            <p>
             EDIT:
Problem: the source for claiming a connection to Cameco and others are not court filings, but is an article on the same homepage!

             <p>
              Yesterday blood from a Montreal stone altar and video statements from Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult members who were arrested while preparing for a possible child sacrifice, were filed in the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Evidence collected included metallic torture devices, ceremonial swords and sophisticated film equipment containing child pornography. The ICLCJ Court was considering Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult connections to Pope Francis, food giant Cargill, Sinclair Oil, Europe’s convicted mafia money-laundering bank HSBC, Cameco Uranium corporation and the criminal syndicate known as Ndrangheta.

             So this claim is not supported by the slightest evidence or any verifiable sources!

              Do not use it and treat it as false, until that claim can be verified by a reliable and verifiable source!!!

Highest are primary sources.

               Haven't time to dig more on this, but it's looking kinda sketchy. Could be disinfo, could be clickbait, maybe both - might be some legit sprinkled in there, can't tell at the moment.

               I think it's interesting but we must strictly separate facts from claims without verifiable facts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did you read about Norway and the pedophile ring with 150 terabytes? That's facts!
And the MSM like the NYT were deleting the articles about it! That's verifiable! Nobody will understand, why they are doing that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pizzagate may not be the best name, but this hole obviously is incredibly deep and IMO they are forced to begin to show their cards. Therefore no claims based on nothing! They will do all they can, to discredit the civil investigators.
Theories are good, but always be honest (also to oneself), ask for verifiable facts to differentiate from claims and if it is so, then say it!
