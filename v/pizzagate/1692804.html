<p>BACKGROUND:  Reversal of Fortune was released in 1990 and is the story of how Dershowitz got his client, Claus von Bulow, off the hook for attempted murder of his wife, socialite Sunny von Bulow, with a poisonous, almost-lethal injection of insulin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100486/combined">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100486/combined</a></p>
<p>von Bulow has been described by some as a &quot;serial killer,&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a90HwJ4BR9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a90HwJ4BR9M</a></p>
<p>Dershowitz claims that von Bulow told him that he has been accused of being a necrophiliac.  This was in the book and portrayed in the movie as well.</p>
<p>TIMESTAMPS:</p>
<p>At about 30:23, von Bulow\'s car pulls into Dershowitz\'s house/law practice driveway.  Then it cuts to Inside the house, where we see Dershowitz in a small kitchen (30:37) with two other people who are seated at a table and eating what appears to be pizza (30:38).  We hear the doorbell ring, which prompts Dershowitz to come out to answer the front door.  He then ushers von Bulow inside and introduces him to the people in the kitchen.  
</p>
<p>At 30:55 we hear the first ping-pong sounds and can see the brown pizza boxes on the edge of the &quot;bar&quot; counter.  
</p>
<p>At 30:57 we see two people standing at a &quot;bar&quot; helping themselves to pizza out of pizza boxes.  The &quot;bar&quot; area is on the side of the room where the ping-pong table is.</p>
<p>At 30:58 we see the ping pong players and table.</p>
<p>At about 31:00 a woman asks, &quot;Where do you keep the paper towels?&quot;  (presumably to sop up the grease from the pizza or to use as napkins)</p>
<p>At 31:04 we see a shot of the &quot;bar&quot; counter with the brown pizza boxes stacked on the edge of it.</p>
<p>This &quot;segment&quot; ends at about 31:07.</p>
<p>AUDIO:</p>
<p>At my friend\'s house we watched the movie in stereo on the Amazon Prime player, and I could clearly hear a background voice say &quot;Pizza&quot; about the time that Dershowitz ushers von Bulow into the house and greets him.  (On the Amazon Prime player, that occurred at about 00:40, I think.)  Unfortunately, on my laptop at home I was unable to make it out, even with Sony stereo headphones.</p>

            / Gentle Plea to the Community (not specific to this OP)
           </p>
           <p>
            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this inv/pizzagatemods, asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created inv/pizzagatewhateverhttps://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <p>
            1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

            I know they always like to rub it in our faces but this (1990) seems very early for these references. Or maybe we are late getting wise to them?

             Not early. Franklin Scandal was in the 80s and into early 90s. MK-Ultra goes back decades prior.

             The use of a child in that scene is actually the linchpin.

             Hi Single,  It's the latter.  It turns out that there were pizza/pong references in Speilberg's movie ET (1982) as well as in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  (1990).
