            The article nails it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One other factor which cannot be ignored is that so many politicians and high-profile individuals have been involved in pedophile rings entrenched within governments and “elite” groups around the world, which so many people are now becoming aware of. To see sex with children normalized, and the age of legal consent lowered, would possibly free them from a prison sentence for their vile actions. This could explain why we see numerous governmental groups pushing to lower the age of sexual consent and most governments around the world allowing some form of Comprehensive Sexuality Education to be taught in schools.

            It also splinters the psyche. That's where those alter egos and second, third, and fourth personalities come from. Children can't handle sexuality at that young of an age; they're not equipped. If you just go by nature and when puberty occurs, you'll get an idea that anything below menstruation is verboten. With it, teens become interested in the opposite sex, but again, they're exploring. Being groomed and molested by an adult is not what is supposed to occur even then.

            why does our government require infants to get a hepatitis vaccine? hepatitis which is spread through drug use and sex, something that typically won't happen until at least the teen years, however the vaccine will have worn off by then as it only covers 10 years.

              <strong>
               Effects of sexual abuse last for decades, study finds -- Levels of so-called stress hormone are altered for years, sometimes causing physical and mental problems, researchers find
              </strong>
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Young girls who are the victims of sexual abuse experience physical, biological and behavioral problems that can persist for decades after, a new study shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Researchers, who tracked a group of girls ranging in age from 6 to 16 at the start of the study in 1987 for the next 23 years, found that they had higher rates of depression and obesity, as well as problems with regulation of brain chemicals, among other issues, compared to a control group of girls who were not abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             As children, they had higher levels of cortisol, the so-called "stress hormone," which is released in high levels during the body’s "fight or flight" response. But by about age 15, testing showed that cortisol levels were below normal, compared to the control group. Lower levels of cortisol have been linked to a decrease in the body’s ability to deal with stress, as well as problems with depression and obesity. Lower levels of the hormone have also been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “The cortisol levels (of some study participants) wound up looking like Vietnam vets,” says study co-author Dr. Frank Putnam, professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. “That tells us they are in a chronic state of stress, and never feel safe.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             During the last assessment, when study participants were in their 20s, their cortisol levels remained lower than the control group, on average. “That tells us their stress response system is burned out,” says Putman, which could explain why some are doing so poorly in life.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The long-term effects of the abuse “were absolutely profound,” says lead author and child psychologist Penelope Trickett, USC professor of Social Work. “It’s just not mental health issues. Some of these women are suffering from a lot of problems today like sleep issues, poor health utilization, and have a lot of risky behaviors. It’s very disturbing.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Trickett says some women who have been sexually abused themselves have told her the findings validated their realities. “A woman came up to me once at a talk and identified herself as a childhood victim of sexual abuse and thanked me for these findings and for trying to shed light on this issue.”
            </p>
            <p>
             She also noted that not all of the 80 women in the study are extremely disabled from their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Trickett also says the findings don’t mean that once someone is abused they are destined to a lifetime of struggle.
             </strong>

            Straight from Aldus Huxley's Brave New World. Huxley was a member of the Fabian society who gave us a glipmpse into the projected agenda in a guise of fiction. Sexualization of children as young as 5 was part of the system.

            these wastes of skin have chosen evil, and they are in it to win it.
           </p>
           <p>
            think of a person you love from childhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            imagine yourself running up to them, pure love in your heart.
           </p>
           <p>
            just waiting for that hug...
           </p>
           <p>
            eternal love and true intent is infinitely powerful.
           </p>
           <p>
            these sickos know that hate and lies can be, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            good thing we choose love and protection.
           </p>
           <p>
            so spit on these sickos. it is up to you and me to keep at it. every minute.
           </p>

            Several reasons:
1) The law must accomodate Muslim practices long in place if you intend to flood the West with them;
2) You must completely demoralize a nation if you want the State to be god;
3) To normalize the crimes already committed by upper eschelon globalists, resulting in no penalty;
4) As in "Brave New World", brainwashing children into early sexual promiscuity ensures that the family unit is a thing of the past. Again, the result is a single authority in the individual's life: the government.

            To them, that is their world. I'd like to see age of consent raised to 18 or 21 across the board. It should be the same as the legal  drinking age.

             It is also rumored that the shock trauma from anal penetration activate chakras that allow for demonic possession. In a way I believe that is true, not completely in a supernatural sense but it opens up sexual receptors that would not have been otherwise disturbed in a healthy environment. There is an element of power and control, of subjugation, that is most attractive to the elite and they believe that it rejuvenates them spiritually by stealing the energy of a child.

             The ages 1-7 are the most formative years in the life of a human, through those years a child is like a sponge or a recording device, shock treatment received during those formative years will leave an indelible mark that can be exploited the childs entire life.

              I also have read that on here before.  Not remembering if it was through comment only or an article.  I also believe it could be possible.  Children are extremely sensitive during that age range.  It is a shock to their system.  But we really should research this further.  I think this is or could be an extremely important factor.  Also when they sexualize the children they have their little tarts right away.  This makes it seem that the children are making themselves available.  Not the perpetrator taking advantage.  The Perfect Woody and Roman World.  This must never happen.  We must start turning back the clock on that right now.  They have already brainwashed their parents into thinking they are Little Adults.  They are not.  They are still considered children until 18, the age of consent, as far as I am concerned.

              Could you elaborate, please? Thanks! Somehow I can't seem to find a difference between the shock someone must experience when raped anally/vaginally/orally. A child will only experience terror and pain.

             Their masters are angry that the world has been given over to God’s creations, after their corrupt ‘children’ were destroyed. Therefore, the Enemy wants to debase and ruin as many as possible before their time is up. Satanists are enticed with worldly power and fake spirituality to do this deprived work.
