<p>One of the main players was who attended these Coffee meetings was Johnny Chung, a Chinese born American citizen.  Chung was being used by high ranking Chinese officials to funnel money to the Clintons.  
</p>
<p>Once the stakes got to high, Chung didn\'t want to be a traitor to America, and backed out.  The Clintons and the FBI wanted him to keep quiet or take the the 5th.  Chung went forward and please guilty.

<p>Chung had Chinese hitmen trying to take him out for backing out of the deal.  A few days before the trial the FBI randomly took away Chung\'s protection and told him that he was in his own.

<p>Fearing for his life, Chung made this video as insurance in case he was assassinated by the Clintons.  
</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are two main reasons why Chung was so scared.

             Chinagate happened back in the '90's, but the major players are popping up in the news now.  Ng was arrested in 2015 and is supposed t appear in court this year.  John Ashe was one of the players who took money from Ng.  He was supposed to testify at some point last year or this year but died by dropping a dumbbell on himself.  Then this video just came out a couple of days ago.  There's a book coming out Feb. 28 called Game of Thorns.  I'm gonna read it, I'll post anything interesting I find.

             It's all in the Daily Mail article.  I'll copy a few quotes from the article for you.  I'm doing this on my phone so i can't bold or italicize anything.  I'll post my claim after a dash followed by a statement from the article in quotes.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Chung was being used by high ranking Chinese officials to funnel money to the Clintons:
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             "Chung, one of the main players in the 'Chinagate' scandal, was accused of giving over $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee on behalf of the head of China's military intelligence agency during Clinton's reelection bid."
            </p>
            <p>
             And
            </p>
            <p>
             "In total he visited the White House 57 times in a two-year span – eight of these meetings were 'off the books.'. Most of the meetings were with Hillary Clinton or her staff. During one of these trips, Chung personally handed a $50,000 check to Hillary Clinton's chief of staff Maggie Williams.  Chung even helped arrange for Bill Clinton to meet with the source of the money – a top Chinese military official – at a Los Angeles fundraiser."
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Chung had Chinese hitmen trying to take him out for backing out of the deal.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             "'His concern about his safety was understandable, given that there had been three attempts on his life which required FBI protection… and given his knowledge of what happened to people such as Ron Brown, who as Secretary of Commerce, was deeply involved in arranging – and selling seats on - Clinton administration trade missions to China,' added Abernethy.  Brown, the point person for Clinton's trade policy with China, was killed in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996. Some speculated that he was preparing to go public with information on the illegal Chinese campaign contributions shortly before his death."
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The Clintons and the FBI wanted him to keep quiet or take the the 5th. Chung went forward and please guilty.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             "Chung described on the tape how Democrats on the House Committee on Government Reform tried to dissuade him from testifying publicly before the committee by sending his attorney a letter telling him he could plead the Fifth Amendment."
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Chung's protection and told him that he was in his own.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
             "The FBI in Los Angeles began providing around-the-clock protection for him. But just a few days before Chung was scheduled to testify before a grand jury, the FBI headquarters in Washington called off the protection detail and told Chung he would have to make the trip alone.  In the secret videotaped statement, Chung claimed the Department of Justice dismissed his safety concerns – with one U.S. attorney telling him to 'call 911' if he felt threatened."
            </h2>
            <p>
             It's just crazy to me how at of this is coming out now of all times.  Combined with the Ng Lap Seng trial and the death of John Ashe I'm convinced these guys all knew what was going on.
