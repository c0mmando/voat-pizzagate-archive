<p>Salesforce Co-CEO Marc Benioff Distances Himself From the \'Techlash\' - <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-marc-benioff-techlash/">http://fortune.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-marc-benioff-techlash/</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff took a subtle shot on Tuesday at Facebook and other tech companies that have recently faced harsh criticism for lax data privacy policies, among other issues.
Speaking in San Francisco at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference, Benioff told the audience of salespeople and developers that businesses are facing a “moment in time” in which executives must ask themselves “what is really important to us” and what are the values they must stand for.
Still, Salesforce hasn’t been immune to public backlash over its policies. Although Benioff used his keynote to highlight much of the company’s philanthropic work, he did not address activist criticism over the company’s decision to keep its contract with the Customs and Border Protection agency, which has been carrying out controversial policies involving the separation of children from parents. </p>
<p>..Several activists protested the Dreamforce event on Tuesday over the company’s contract with the Customs and Border Protection agency. Benioff has previously said that Salesforce’s products are not directly involved with the act of separating children from parents and that he has “personally financially supported legal groups helping families at the border.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, those activists must be really \'special\' if they haven\'t worked out the associations between Salesforce, Dreamforce and Media Matters. <a href="https://www.jacksonriver.com/news/will-we-see-you-dreamforce">https://www.jacksonriver.com/news/will-we-see-you-dreamforce</a>

           Salesforce Co-CEO Marc Benioff Distances Himself From the 'Techlash' -

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff took a subtle shot on Tuesday at Facebook and other tech companies that have recently faced harsh criticism for lax data privacy policies, among other issues.
Speaking in San Francisco at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference, Benioff told the audience of salespeople and developers that businesses are facing a “moment in time” in which executives must ask themselves “what is really important to us” and what are the values they must stand for.
Still, Salesforce hasn’t been immune to public backlash over its policies. Although Benioff used his keynote to highlight much of the company’s philanthropic work, he did not address activist criticism over the company’s decision to keep its contract with the Customs and Border Protection agency, which has been carrying out controversial policies involving the separation of children from parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..Several activists protested the Dreamforce event on Tuesday over the company’s contract with the Customs and Border Protection agency. Benioff has previously said that Salesforce’s products are not directly involved with the act of separating children from parents and that he has “personally financially supported legal groups helping families at the border.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Well, those activists must be really 'special' if they haven't worked out the associations between Salesforce, Dreamforce and Media Matters.

            Salesforce and Atlassian are basically tech utilities. If you are gonna draw connections to them, then you might as well include the trash company and the cable provider.
Yes, Salesforce has some questionable mascot choices - a furry, a goat, and a lightning bolt - but the product itself is basically a real-time spreadsheet. It supplies very fundamental tools to support standard sales pipelines. I'm sure any Rothschild will have used it or something similar at some point in their life. That doesn't mean that the software itself is suspect. It's just really useful.
Same goes for Atlassian. They provide code repositories and project management. All very useful stuff. I use both companies' products daily. The client base is just too broad and diluted to seriously consider either company to be a strong lead in this investigation.

             <p>
              Some of you will remember, I noted that a reliable source informed us, back in 2010, at the outset of the cholera outbreak that USAID’s first “relief” dollars for the cholera victims went to buy 200,000 body bags! You may also recall, the incident, when the doctors at
              <strong>
               Mirebalais
              </strong>
              we questioned about why the bodies of those who were said to die of cholera were not returned to the families of the cholera victims for at least a funeral? We were suspiciously stonewalled. Then finally told it was because they were getting properly buried by the doctors and staff, in body bags to avoid further contamination of the earth. And when we said why can’t the grieving families attend those funerals or “disposal” activities. No answer. A great portion of human trafficking happens at oil rigs, at the over 1000 US military basis around the world, and on the high seas for the pleasures of sick oligarchs and their servants who use the women and children and sometimes, discard the bodies at sea. ..

             Miller's home was the focus of a massive FBI operation last year in which agents seized some of the artifacts he'd obtained from around the world. Investigators said they might have been removed from their countries illegally.

             Miller was never charged, and the status of the seized artifacts is unclear.

             Legal experts tell The Indianapolis Star it could take years for experts to sort out the legalities of the thousands of objects seized by the government.

             My concern here is, how many moroni are responsible for researching and qualifying the research of Ming Dynastic artifacts. Asians are as traveled as the Vikings were with relation to sailing and mariners knowledge.

            So glad this is all coming out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I worked at this big investment company that used Salesforce. Funny thing was that about a week after I started, I told a few people that the guy that was running the Salesforce team was CIA. No way he wasn't. Even the guys he picked were ex-military. The thing is everybody hated him. They wanted him gone, but he never went anywhere and kept exerting this inordinate power. Like with this fulfillment company. He recommended one and the firm switched, but they had no idea what they were doing. They sent packages and mailings that would be held at the border because the right papers weren't used or filled out correctly. Two things happened: (1) millions and millions of dollars were paid to this fulfillment company that was not a fulfillment company. Anybody with a brain could see it was a front to siphon money; and (2) this non-company now had a tremendous mailing list of super rich people that they then turned around and used to sell them variable stocks.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this was one firm. They had access to every project and lead people inside the company were working on and made a ton of money. It's how it's done. I tried to bring it to upper management's attention, but they didn't want to listen and that brought on my exit out the door which was fine. Ultimately, this type of stuff proves my instincts were right.
           </p>
           <p>
            No way that guy wasn't CIA. None.

             Thank you very much for your comment.  Sometimes it's quite difficult to get across to people who don't work in the tech-related sectors how important and relevant these links are.
