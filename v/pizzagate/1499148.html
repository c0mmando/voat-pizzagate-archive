             We are building a catalog of evidence to wake up the world to this problem. The great part is, we don't need corporate media to get this done. I still want to catch the elites involved in trafficking people/organs, wars, and sexual abuse. As we work toward that goal, I think there will be some uplifting wins along the way.
