            You mean like how he backed down from Andrew McCabe? Come on, don't kid a kidder. You're either extremely naive or a shill. George Webb just delivered Andrew McCabe in a doggy bag. It was such an extreme ass pounding Andrew McCabe could be the first man guilty of Treason to be sent to the electric chair but die of shame before he even gets there.

            I'm picking up you're a female, is that right? That's the only way you wouldn't have picked this up. What George Webb just did to Andrew McCabe will soon go into the Alpha Male Hall of Fame as the main attraction for the next 100 years. To give you perspective on the degree of Alpha Maleness George took over 1st place from Marine Corp General

             Nope. Im a dude. Sorry. The McCabe thing is a joke. McCabe has never heard the words "George Webb" in a sentence spoken. Explain to me then...how McCabe was handed over in a doggie bag? What will happen to McCabe and if it doesn't...then what? Shills are usually the ones that wont consider any other argument and just dead set on their narrative in the face of logic. Consider that please.

              Simple and best question is this...what has Webb accomplished exactly? And please dont tell me something about awareness or opened eyes and such. He gets a meek 10K views on average which isnt really anything to crow about, but the Webb cult acts like he cleaned up the deep state, saved Trump, and proved to everyone something that no one can figure out. Who was arrested, fired, disgraced in the public eye...who...or what? He never had any real objective to begin with. You act like he is a hero and some alpha male type because he is...tall? I seen plenty of tall guys fold like a chair to people half their size. Being tall and talking tough on the internet about a public figure an alpha male does not make. He actually is kinda feminine in a lot of respects and very insecure.

            That sounds sketchy, almost as if you're about to call me an anti-Semite. I ain't no anti-Semite. My sister converted to Judaism when she got married and I'm an uncle to her children. My heart breaks when people rip into "The Jews(tm)" because some of them are part of my life and I love them very much. Trust me I'm not an anti-Semite. You can look through my comment history and you'll find that's true pretty quickly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically I just want to know the truth. It's frustrating waking up to all the lies and disinformation of the past 20 years. In fact it's traumatic. I felt like tossing my cookies on many occasions. This isn't fun being lied to. And if TPTB don't handle the Great Wake-Up that's about to happen in the U.S. correctly well then............I think you can use your imagination. I'm a Pacifist since accepting Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. But people like me are a rarity these days. There are millions of Deplorable Shit Lord Atheists with assault rifles and no job and are pissed off enough to go looking for payback. God only knows what'll happen when the truth about 9/11 comes out. But come out it must.

            "read my comment all the way through"
           </p>
           <p>
            Fair enough. I went back and read all the way through. In the unlikely event you're being honest I'll explain why you're wrong. First up is:
           </p>
           <p>
            "George toils in tech sales and managing accounts for 30 years"
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd love some of that "toiling" because George has had years he's paid more in tax than I've made in two years gross income. That is some seriously nice toilage. If I could just get to 1/4 of that action I might be able to go back to two working toilets in my house.
           </p>
           <p>
            "looking to redeem his life and get attention."
           </p>
           <p>
            I can think of much safer ways to redeem ones life than making an enemy of the FBI, CIA, ISI and the SEIU all at the same time. If there are multiple levels of dirty laundry "1" being a handkerchief in your suit jacket pocket you didn't use at Bar Mitzvah to "10" being the soiled underwear from a long time resident of a Leper Colony then George Webb is airing Level 11 Dirty Laundry: a radioactive full body uniform from a clean up crew at the  Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no fucking way George survived the past 9 months trying to be the next Sy Hersch. The "Aspiring Journalist" is a cover story. If George had wanted to be a journalist he would have been a journalist not gone into high tech sales.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mossad told the CIA, FBI and ISI that if George Webb so much as stubs his toe then they should expect an immediate smack down Old Testament style from let's just admit it right now the most bad ass intelligence service on planet Earth. I know fear when I see it and George never displayed an ounce of it. Ok maybe on that last day when the SEIU goons showed up but he was only afraid because he wasn't sure they'd gotten the message if you know what I mean.

              Toiling implies working harder than you should. At least that's what you implied comparing George with his older more successful brother. You made it sound like George is a fuck up or something. George is no fuck up. He played Div 1 basketball which automatically makes you an Alpha Male. And at 6' 8" he's literally a giant among men which would be pretty valuable in avoiding a double garreting which was a requirement given the radioactive uniform from Fukushima we talked about earlier.

            Agree about Tzipi Mazuz and the rest of your conclusions. Also Dr. Piecheinick who by the way tweeted Webb's video Day 219.1 yesterday outing Alpha Jollah as Seth Rich killer and FBI informant. Dr. P (who is the actual Tom Clancy)  followed that with #McCabe and follow the dots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb was then offered some top level support &amp; encouragement.

            I fear George is about to get his wish fulfilled which is a week or two in the psycho ward  of one of DC's local hospitals where he will receive room and board and a break from spooks real and inagined.  He'll be released in due course because he isn't really a threat to himself or others and the psychotropic drugs will quell the delusions while the family trustee tries to figure just how much money does he need to exist yet stay out of trouble. And then  the rest of us can stop debating the merits of George's  web. Thank God.

            Webb is so scared for his life that he has no problem meeting up with random commenters on his youtube channel or facebook for drinks and such. He also has plenty of time to meet up with women who shill for him on his channel for one night stands and then offering them scholarships he purchased from Lee Stranahans school for citizen journalists. Oh..and yesterday we are to believe his life was saved because a diminutive youtuber asskisser from the area made his way there and escorted him to safety. George was in danger after all...there were spooky people walking the streets...of NEW YORK CITY during the afternoon. OMGZ. There were also spooky agent types lurking in the hotel but even though Webb records and uploads videos of everything including himself knocking on random doors in neighborhoods that lead to dead ends (because the Awans...), he just didnt think to get any of the spooky people on camera this time...damn.

             Brilliant. I think it's high time someone make a proper outing article about this character. These random but brilliant comments in the back alleys of Voat aren't quite doing it, he's got an enormous following that's only gaining steam. You have to really pay attention to see the real picture, and apparently most people don't do that.

            A disinfo agent has to mix a good amount of truth for the operation to work. Just like Alex Jones. You have to give them a reason to keep coming back. But when they're there, you throw in the disinfo. Even if it's only ten percent, that's very harmful to a truth community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another word for it is limited hangout operation. If you look it up, you'll notice it describes him perfectly. And it's nothing to admire. Webb also took part in pedophile entrapment schemes, three times he took part in brownstone operations for the CIA. This is not someone I would trust with the truth. He also thinks Podesta should not have any jail time, and that Donna Brazille, who lost her job at CNN for helping to rig the debates for Hillary, is innocent, a great gal.

            Pretty funny for those stating he is a dumb conspiracy theorists who wants no one arrested. Set Rich shooter and FBI McCabe informant Alpha Jollah was arrested and taken into federal custody within one hour of George Webb naming him on Video yesterday morning.

             @ Jem777.    where is your proof.   Meanwhile GW is back on youtube, although yesterday the deep state had locked him out, and I kid you not he is talking about the Awans.  Wants to know if they worked for a certain company.  He also went on about crowdstrike saying stuff that has been known for ages.  So Yesterday. he breaks who murdered Seth Rich, announces hitman are after him, and today doesn't bring any of that up.  What?

             If this is true that means Sorcha Faal, the source which first appeared here, and was used by Webb to inform his big discovery, is not a hoax site after all. Heh.

            I guess that's my point... since it is crowdsourced, and not just coming from a singular POV from Webb - the data is likely legit. If he was a disinfo op, why would he present it? It's very damaging shit if ever investigated from a legit enforcement agent.

             Well what exactly is he presenting? Look at his take on the Seth Rich nonsense. In the span of two weeks he told us boldly and confidently that the murder was a school play and the parents were fake...then he went to Seth being alive and well at a hospital, transferred and organ harvested...then TWO DAYS...Seth actually arrived at hospital brain dead and then harvested....then Seth must be alive...to here is his killer, folks! An 18 year old who was entrusted by the evil DNC to hire MS 13 guys to carry out this important "setting an example" by Podesta...oh and we have an FBI bullet now so i guess they are in on it. That kind of info you are talking about?

            BTW, I doubt GW is mossad or IC.  I think he is just delusional.   He keeps claiming MCCabe is after him and his family because GW uncovered the fbi was behind the xmas bomber.  I looked into it and there was a lot of coverage on fbi entrapment as it was as a defense by the attorneys.  I didn't find anything connecting GW to being the guy who exposed the FBI role.  I think that story is also BS or at least hyped by GW.

             Bingo. Tell me how a guy with a catholic mother and two parents born in the US with a brother who is NSA and worked for Army Intelligence with STRICOM of all things would get through a background screening by Israeli intelligence to become an agent. Not to mention there are no gaps in Webbs residences to suggest he was out of country for any long period of time.

            WTF... guys... are you really THAT convinced that Webb and Seaman are disinfo agents? I mean, I have my suspicions too, but these are some of the only people that have traction/shedding light on the topics. I would be very disappointed if everything Webb has uncovered was somehow bogus or pure disinfo.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is the case, he should go to Hollywood, because this shit cannot be easy to make up. Perhaps I'm gullible, but, I think his intentions are generally good/aligned with ours.

             He already did go to Hollywood. It is on his FB coincidentally right before he embarked on his long road trip. His goal from day one was to make a documentary and cash in on it. Why do you think he butters up Goodman? Goodman is a Hollywood guy who is a millionaire and will finance it and produce it.

             Wow, how did seaman just get added to this post about Webb? Seaman has not been found to have put out any disinfo, or even exaggeration.
            </p>
            <p>
             Webb is whole different story. Voat might be pretending yesterday didn't happen, but if you were around, you would have noticed that Webb was outed in a big way here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also on reddit. That's why George had to pull the whole "omg they're out to get me!!!"
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a good summary from a redditor:
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              George Webb has figure out who killed Seth Rich. Let's step back a moment. Sometimes dot connecting gets ahead of itself.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I've watched the entire series, and a lot of it feels like the disinfo technique of mixing about 20% constructed narrative into about 80% truth. I stuck around for the truth (which I think is the ratlines, blackberry, 'school play' and assorted spycraft,) but there were always red flags, like:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               the way he kept referring to the Seth Rich medical info as a "report" without disclosing that it was an anonymous 4Chan post. So much for transparency.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               the slippage and blurring when he spoke about Muslim organizations, eg claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah were trading intel, without explaining why in the world that would be, since they are antagonists without common ideology. But I also knew he had connections to Israel, which would explain the less rational info about Hezbollah. Then he started talking about Saudis, while pointing to a photo that was clearly an Afghan tribesman. I know all Muslims are interchangeable to many US viewers, but it was as ridiculous as talking about Chinese people and pointing to an Indian as evidence. I couldn't tell if he was that ignorant, or if he was exploiting the assumed ignorance of the audience to sell his narrative.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               His obsession with McCabe. McCabe was hacking his computer, deleting stuff that GW now admits he deleted himself, McCabe issued immunity deals, the way he flubbed when asked why he was sure McCabe did so, but Comey wasn't involved, etc. Not defending McCabe, but it felt fishy.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Doxxing that Marine in the rented house, including even mentioning where he had originally come from (which is the type of info that's useful if you want to track down someone's family.)
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The revelation of the killer, with such flimsy evidence.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The biggest WTF?? was when he'd had a bit of wine and started saying how he wanted to return the IC to the old days, where instead of these out of control ratlines, there was just a little organ harvesting, just a little trafficking, just a little compromising people with children. What?? I expected him to post something the next morning taking it back and explaining what he really meant, but no.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Today he's been waxing nostalgic about the early IC again, and basically admitted he's affiliated with Mossad, qualifying that there are 2 Mossads, the new one involved in the milieu around Clinton, and the old one, the great Mossad that made Israel what it is today.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             That's it. I'm out. Still watching, but don't trust him at all.
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e825u/george_webb_has_figure_out_who_killed_seth_rich/">

            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             And this from reddit:
             <strong>
              Wtf?! Is George Webb working for Mossad, Israeli intelligence. Check this out, very strange
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been following George webb for a while and I enjoy his work on the Seth Rich investigation. But, being a conspiracy junkie, I keep an open mind and look at all theories until there proven otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyways, after doing a quick search on George Webb theres this thread on Voat on him. If you look in the comments section there's another link to another thread, showing proof of his brother being an ex NSA agent.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, this morning George named the killer, awan brothers, and he started freaking out saying he think they will call a Hitman on him. He calls jason goodman while he's still in hotel and jason uploads this call to his YouTube. Wtf is George talking about?? It seems like he works for someone and "they picked jason to film" REALLY STRANGE if you ask me
            </p>
            <p>
             So he was locked in his hotel and scared to leave until his friend, comedian guy, came and got him. So, george starts periscope LIVE (webb4bernie) just in case anything happens to him. So, then he tells us, the viewers, we are all Mossad agents bc we helped research. WTF (I went back in the scopes and couldn't find the video he says this at, so if u watch his scopes please post the video he says it. Thx(
            </p>
            <p>
             Periscope 1 - George scaring Jason in this scope. Brainstorming all different ways the hitmen can take them both out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Periscope 2 18:50 - when referring to Israel he says "We" like he's one of them and Jason is confused and asked if he once lived there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Periscope 3 17 mins - he says usually when someone has a high IQ there's usually intelligence behind them supporting them. Is he referring to himself?
            </p>
            <p>
             Interview - Jason and George finally arrive to Dr. Coris house for an interview. Dr. Corsi works with infowars and there's a lot of spectaclation Alex works for the Israeli intelligence
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, go to his periscope and the last 12 videos are all from today. Watch them bc they are pretty intense and really strange. If you see where he calls all his viewers "mossad agents" please screen shot the comments, bc a lot of us were shocked he said that we were Mossad agents.

             </p>
             <p>
              And raise you one "What is McCabe's involvement in the Seth Rich Shooting and are you aware that (Alpha Jollah)the shooter named yesterday by George Webb was Andrew McCabe's Informant he personally arranged released from jail prior to Seth Rich murder? Are you aware Alpha Jalloh was in a shootout with D.C. Police on July 12, 2016 two days after Seth's murder? Are you aware Alpha Jollah was never arraigned &amp; went missing from the criminal justice system once again since that date but was arrested and taken into Federal custody within one hour of George Webb naming him yesterday?
Are you aware McCabe is no longer in charge? Just wondering you seem to know everything hoping you can clear it up for the rest of us idiots.

               Sorry, Jem, this is actually a repost from Reddit. If you have an account there, you can go post your questions about McCabe to the person who wrote this. Webb isn't suddenly going to become trustworthy by bashing me or other people who question his bullshit, but I don't blame you for trying if you've got a lot invested in him.

                Not bashing you just your logic. Have nothing invested in him only truth. You are the one who bash others including longtime researchers on this forum who unbeknownst to you are risking their lives. 
Why don't you put up some of your own creditionals if you want to call others into question.

                 These are serious questions members of the anonymous online community of researchers have about one George Webb, a man who chose to put himself up in front of our investigation, and has admitted to being a fucking Mossad asset. But I'm the one with problem?

              - this was a comprehensive mind fuck. Very detailed and makes me rethink my previous comments. Typically people just slam him without much to go on, but, this offers some very strange/concerning P'sOV that will have me watching his videos far more closely.

            Spooky George Interwebs needs to go away. Interestingly enough, he wants the exact same thing as Robert David Steele., "Everybody gets the truth, nobody goes to jail". I think they will get their wish. I really hope he pretends he is killed and stays dead. And I wish David Seaman finaly dies of poisioning on the third attempt. One can dream.

               All of which Webb tells us..is okay..as long as it is only a little bit of organ harvesting, drug smuggling, and human trafficking. You know because...he wants it like it was in the good old days. Under control or something...seriously?

                Yeah I didn't get that one either. He took himself down a notch after that brain fart that's for sure. Still he did get the goods on Andrew SlowWalker so he's not all bad.

                And don't bust my balls over my support for GW. I know he works for Mossad and I know he's playing the "Good Cop" in a really bad "Good Cop/Bad Cop" school play.

                I get it. When this war is over and assuming we weren't turned into Radioactive Dust Particles the American public's view of Israel is going to be a casualty of war.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just don't see how Israel can come back after all this shit. Andrew McCabe and James Comey and all the rest are Americans. But to have seen evidence of Israel joining in on the gang rape I just don't see how the American public will keep supporting them.

                 Except he really isnt Mossad. He just likes it that people think he is. He is incredibly jealous of his brother...George was the youngest of all the siblings. His dad got to be known as a famous inventor, while Dave got the glory of being a government agent. All the while George toils in tech sales and managing accounts for 30 years since he wasnt good enough to go pro with the basketball. .An out of shape middle aged dude with a nasty divorce looking to redeem his life and get attention. The guy isnt an agent. He is just a con. He has the power of personality from years of chasing down sales so when you meet him in person...he can overwhelm you since he cant shut up for two minutes and let anyone else speak. But after a bit...you see thru it. The only thing i dont know for sure is whether or not he knows is a fake or if he really believes it. I know he wants people to think he is a modern day Sy Hersch (his personal hero). I wont say he is a malicious character. I honestly dont know that, but i know that nobody should trust him and he is not mentally stable.

                  I stopped reading at the end of "Except he really isnt Mossad.". And technically it was all over between "he" and "really" due to my peripheral vision.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you are so naive you can't figure out George Webb is acting in a school play put on by Mossad as a stopgap to the American people flushing Israel down the toilet then there's no helping you.

                  They saw the hand writing on the wall last Summer when Trump was drawing massive crowds of Deplorable Shit Lords. They knew they had to get ahead of this thing but quick because doing nothing when the Truth comes out will be an immediate Game Over for Israel. "The Jews!(tm)" aren't stupid. Handing up Andrew McCabe's head on a platter is them getting back into the good graces of the American public.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We'll see how that turns out. If I had to guess I'd say it's not enough because Israel's role in 9/11 albeit playing 2nd fiddle is still egregious enough to get them kicked out of the kingdom again.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They pulled this shit 2000 years ago and got thrown to the four corners of The Wind. The more I learn about this story the worse it gets for them. This time I don't think they'll be alone in the imminent drop kick. They'll be accompanied by hordes of Pagan Atheist Devil Worshipers. Who the fuck knows where they'll be sent probably straight down is what I'm thinking.

             I was a bit skeptical myself. I do think there's a lot of truth in his presentations... He has no real authority though? I mean, even if he "cracks" the case, it's up to the same corrupt prosecutors and judicial system to bring a case.

              I tuned out first time i heard the word "ratline."  Libya and Syria are unnecessary distractions to PGate.

               Really? The Sloth of May starting WWIII in Syria was a distraction?

               Last time I checked Thermo-Nuclear Warfare trumps child rape. In fact it's not even close. Turning around 5 billion human beings into fine radioactive dust particles is as bad as it can get.

               He is part of the disinfo network that says PG is a psyop to entrap people and make them look bad. He needs concrete evidence. What he realy needs is his throat slit for being a piece of shit sub human posing as a person.
