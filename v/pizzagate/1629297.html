Even after hundreds of years the town has forbidden anyone to sing or dance in the street where the children were last seen.</p>
<p>Pied Piper of Hamlin [Remember the &quot;god&quot; &quot;Pan&quot; who Alephantis identifies with, blows pipes and is connected to &quot;Free Sex.&quot; / Bestiality / Pedophilia? ]</p>
<p>Pan; = a &quot;god\' who plays on reed pipes. i.e. &quot;Piper&quot;</p>
<p>How does this connect to Pizzagate?
Alephantis is the owner of the suspect Pizza parlour. We are told he is Greek and belongs to a Hellenist Association [people who celebrate the culture of Greece]. He associates himself publicly with the figure of &quot;Pan.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Pan&quot; is known in the classical world for various activities, including unbridled sexuality, bestiality, violence, wild &quot;partying&quot; .He is said to have originally been a follower of the &quot;goddess&quot; Cybele. </p>
<p>It is known that human sacrifices were made to the goddess &quot;Cybele&quot; - She was the figure/ goddess of the Attis cult; which is a cult supposely worshipping a good-looking boy god. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Bust_of_Attis_as_a_child_wearing_the_Phrygian_cap,_Parian_marble,_2nd_century_AD,_probably_during_the_reign_of_Hadrian-_the_portrait_bears_ressemblance_to_those_of_Antinous,_Cabinet_des_M%C3%A9dailles,_Paris_(23181827431).jpg/371px-thumbnail.jpg">Attis is the boy</a>. And Cybele is the Mother Goddess figure to whom human sacrifices were made. </p>
<p>Notice in the image of Attis that the cap resembles an uncircumsized penis - tip. The Phrygian hats were said to be worn by the priests of the cult, to be red and to represent a phallis [I do not have all my citations at this time since our Forum was vandalized Dec. 10th; I do have that citation but can not access it right now]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In his earliest appearance in literature, Pindar\'s Pythian Ode iii. 78, Pan is associated with a mother goddess, perhaps Rhea or Cybele; Pindar refers to virgins worshipping Cybele and Pan near the poet\'s house in Boeotia.[6]</p>
<p>&quot;In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era[13] Pan is made cognate with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros.[14]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So according to some scholars, &quot;Pan&quot; is the same as Dionysus - who was known for the cult wherein people got drunk and went into a frenzy and then murdered people. And Eros, who is portrayed as a young good-looking boy. God of sex, [That\'s where the word ERO-tic, comes from]</p>
<p>Pan is also sometimes more than one figure. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>but also [there are] little Pans, Paniskoi, who played the same part as the Satyrs&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mini - Pan-s are the same as a Satyr. </p>
<p>What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr">Satryr?</a> They live in the Woods [Wild places] and have a permanent erection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Greek mythology, a satyr (UK /ˈsætə/, US /ˈseɪtər/;[1] Greek: σάτυρος satyros,[2] pronounced [sátyros]) is one of a troop of ithyphallic male companions of Dionysus with goat-like features and often permanent erection</p>

<p>There was a story released from a Tabloid a few days ago [coincidental timing?] by a Onion -style UK tabloid mocking the notion of Pedophilia arrests in our present day - claiming the Pied Piper is being arrested. For instance, comparing the Pedophilia accusations and arrests which are now surfacing with an old &quot;wives\' tale,&quot; that, however, just happens to be true. Most people do not know that part of it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://news.bfnn.co.uk/pied-piper-of-hamelin-brought-in-on-historic-child-abuse-charges/">The much-beloved folkloric musician and children’s entertainer, the Pied Piper of Hamelin, has been taken into the custody of New Scotland Yard today facing tough questions over child abuse accusations dating back over 700 years!</a></p>

<p>The catch is: It a real story of a real event where a Joker - type figure , [Dressed as a Harlequin, that where they get the &quot;Pied&quot; part of the name <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pied&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY2_n4_oDSAhVD-mMKHQ-FBwkQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1218&amp;bih=649#tbm=isch&amp;q=pied+clothing">&quot;Pied&quot; means patch - quilt design ; can be said of an animal\'s fur</a> ] Came to town. </p>
<p>Piper enchanted the children and led them away. The children never returned [ Much as the children, in British Columbia, Canada are said to have disappeared with the Queen and her husband, never to return nor to be found - no bodies]</p>
<p>In the town of Hamlein they even have a street dedicated to the very real and remembered event. </p>
<p>So what we called &quot;Pedogate&quot; or &quot;Pizzagate&quot; has a long history</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin">&gt;The earliest known record of this story is from the town of Hamelin itself, depicted in a stained glass window created for the church of Hamelin, which dates to around AD 1300. Although it was destroyed in 1660, several written accounts have survived.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin">This window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town. Also, Hamelin town records start with this event. The earliest written record is from the town chronicles in an entry from 1384 which states: &quot;It is 100 years since our children left.&quot;[5]</a>

<p>Here is a link comparing the ancient Pied Piper story to the present - day &quot;normalization&quot; Media and Political promoted trend.</p>
<p>The Pied Piper and Invasion of Pedophile Culture 
<a href="http://www.renegadetribune.com/pied-piper-invasion-pedophile-culture/">http://www.renegadetribune.com/pied-piper-invasion-pedophile-culture/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like the Zodiac killer, some criminals like to send clues before committing their dark acts.  The admitted perps of the 2015 invasion of Europe trumpeted their plans in a collage that included Merkel and the usual suspects.</p>
<p>Does the Pied Piper there herald the elite’s desire to normalize — if at first by traumatic shock — a pedophile culture in white Western nations?</p>

<p>The Disturbing True Story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin</p>
<pre><code>&gt;When, lo! as they reached the mountain-side, 
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
   And the Piper advanced and the children followed,
   And when all were in to the very last,
   The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
   Robert Browning, The Pied Piper of Hamelin: A Child’s Story</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story that the Piper was not paid for his work and took revenge on the Town was added later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The supposed street where the children were last seen is today called Bungelosenstrasse (street without drums), as no one is allowed to play music or dance there. <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/disturbing-true-story-pied-piper-hamelin-001969">Incidentally, it is said that the rats were absent from earlier accounts, and only added to the story around the middle of the 16 th century. Moreover, the stained glass window and other primary written sources do not speak of the plague of rats.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So someone inserted the story of the cause being Rats into the authentic historical record, which has no mention of rats. 
Why would there have to be a distraction from this, just as what we face today?</p>',

Even after hundreds of years the town has forbidden anyone to sing or dance in the street where the children were last seen.

          <p>
           Pied Piper of Hamlin [Remember the "god" "Pan" who Alephantis identifies with, blows pipes and is connected to "Free Sex." / Bestiality / Pedophilia? ]
          </p>
          <p>
           Pan; = a "god' who plays on reed pipes. i.e. "Piper"
          </p>
          <p>
           How does this connect to Pizzagate?
Alephantis is the owner of the suspect Pizza parlour. We are told he is Greek and belongs to a Hellenist Association [people who celebrate the culture of Greece]. He associates himself publicly with the figure of "Pan."
          </p>
          <p>
           "Pan" is known in the classical world for various activities, including unbridled sexuality, bestiality, violence, wild "partying" .He is said to have originally been a follower of the "goddess" Cybele.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is known that human sacrifices were made to the goddess "Cybele" - She was the figure/ goddess of the Attis cult; which is a cult supposely worshipping a good-looking boy god.
           <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Bust_of_Attis_as_a_child_wearing_the_Phrygian_cap,_Parian_marble,_2nd_century_AD,_probably_during_the_reign_of_Hadrian-_the_portrait_bears_ressemblance_to_those_of_Antinous,_Cabinet_des_M%C3%A9dailles,_Paris_(23181827431).jpg/371px-thumbnail.jpg">
            Attis is the boy
           </a>
           . And Cybele is the Mother Goddess figure to whom human sacrifices were made.
          </p>
          <p>
           Notice in the image of Attis that the cap resembles an uncircumsized penis - tip. The Phrygian hats were said to be worn by the priests of the cult, to be red and to represent a phallis [I do not have all my citations at this time since our Forum was vandalized Dec. 10th; I do have that citation but can not access it right now]

           There was a story released from a Tabloid a few days ago [coincidental timing?] by a Onion -style UK tabloid mocking the notion of Pedophilia arrests in our present day - claiming the Pied Piper is being arrested. For instance, comparing the Pedophilia accusations and arrests which are now surfacing with an old "wives' tale," that, however, just happens to be true. Most people do not know that part of it.

             The much-beloved folkloric musician and children’s entertainer, the Pied Piper of Hamelin, has been taken into the custody of New Scotland Yard today facing tough questions over child abuse accusations dating back over 700 years!

             This window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town. Also, Hamelin town records start with this event.

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
   And the Piper advanced and the children followed,
   And when all were in to the very last,
   The door in the mountain-side shut fast.

          <p>
           The story that the Piper was not paid for his work and took revenge on the Town was added later.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The supposed street where the children were last seen is today called Bungelosenstrasse (street without drums), as no one is allowed to play music or dance there.

             Incidentally, it is said that the rats were absent from earlier accounts, and only added to the story around the middle of the 16 th century. Moreover, the stained glass window and other primary written sources do not speak of the plague of rats.

          <p>
           So someone inserted the story of the cause being Rats into the authentic historical record, which has no mention of rats. 
Why would there have to be a distraction from this, just as what we face today?

              There are a thousand retellings of this myth, and it has to do with being denied payment so he punishes the town by stealing it's children.   The origin myth has NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH PEDOPHILIA.  And you can't make it so with a hundred links.  It just isn't and does nothing to help this investigation. 
Here is the sentence about how he was not paid by the townspeople
              <strong>
               "Now that the citizens had been freed of their plague, they regreted having promised so much money, and, using all kinds of excuses, they refused to pay him. Finally he went away, bitter and angry."

            This kind of sick stuff has been going on forever, I have no doubts about it. The difference now is we are civilized and have the resources to STOP it pronto! If law enforcers had any balls they would go after these people no matter who they are-politicians,teachers,lawyers,military, the neighbor etc. it is unconscionable to me that these groups operate under everybodies noses. End it Now!

            Any way to see if Marc Mezvinsky (Chelsea Clinton's husband) is tied to Alefantis thru the greek organization ties?  Very interesting that Marc Mezvinsky ran a fund for "Greek recovery" and that Alefantis is greek and keeps strong ties...might be a connection?

            Because the Khazars or Knights Templar  or whatever you would like to call them focus their attention on banking and finance. This story impressed on small children, the importance of paying ones debts lest you be separated from your mother and father forever. There is no greater fear. I just posted a discussion about those fucktards if ur interested.

             I was thinking it was something like "He got rid of the RATS' ["rug rats"] and was paid with children.. " But your idea is good too. In Finland they scare the children with a "Yule Cat" song to make them stay tidy.. If the Yule Cats come and the children have dirty cloths on, they are eaten by the cats; so they are told by their parents. Bjork did a version. -

             - Yes, Bjork's singing sounds like a spell.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, in Holland / Brussels, where there is a reputed very active Sado - Pedo group embedded in the ruling class, The "Black Peter," side-kick to Santa, scares children with threats of beatings @ Christmas.
