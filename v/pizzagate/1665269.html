<p><strong>(WorldCorp hidden directory found/video of child alive &amp; well [Youtube VIDEO explaining everything])</strong></p>
<p>This post was all about how the child who was being MKULTRA-ed in the shower by the &quot;Father&quot; in the orphaned vid [uncertain provenance]  was found safe and sound in another photograph;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing to worry about\'&quot; was the message &quot;Child is alive and safe.&quot;</p>
<p>A Few things people brought up in the comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There\'s no positive identification between the tortured child and the healthy child, except a presumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There\'s was a lack of date data between the two images/video so therefore no way to tell if, for instance, even if it really was the same child - if the healthy snapshot was before or after the torture event. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I did a sound comparison of John Podesta\'s voice vs. &quot;Father&quot; voice as each are recorded on some extant YouTube videos, as a contribution to the discussion:</p>
<p>The most important facet of data collection is analysis and the person who asked me for my analysis requested I make my work in that comment  its own post, since they appreciated my work. </p>
<p>How does this relate to &quot;Pizzagate&quot; </p>
<p>If the voice on the torture tape is John Podesta that means :</p>
<ol>
<li>It can be proved forensically via a professional analysis via voice print. </li>
<li>Podesta will likely be arrested and put in jail </li>
</ol>
<p>Another VOAT analyst in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1657970">the earlier thread</a> said he thought &quot;Father&quot; torturer sounded like John Podesta except that in the Election Night audio John Podesta enunciates his &quot;R\'s &quot; and in the &quot;Father&quot; audio, &quot;Father&quot; drops his &quot;R\'s&quot; </p>
<p>I address that at the beginning of my comment.</p>
<p>If I\'m missing something obvious, please y\'all, chime in, as I know you will. </p>
<p>I am using my gut feeling intuition as well as carefully calculated thoughtful and reasonable analysis. </p>
<p>It\'s really been a descent into the Underworld of Violence to look at this material and is stressful. It\'s a cross to bear. 
There are also heavy-weights intent on disrupting our work. 
Would be important to know who dropped this video, but if it\'s John Podesta\'s voice, that will stand upon its own. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright, I see what someone mentioned about the final &quot;R\'S&quot; In the speech in front of a large audience in an ostensibly important formal occasion - should\'ve been thanking the followers for all the work and money - which I don\'t think he did - but in any case its a formal speech and it\'s more leisurely, He would enunciate the final &quot;R&quot;\'s He\'s on stage.</p>
<p>In the torture MKULTRA moment he\'s striking the child with his words and it has a staccato rhythm . He\'s probably &quot;hopped up&quot; on some drugs; Poppers? So the &quot;R\'s&quot; are dropped; perfectly explainable.</p>
<p>I\'ve noticed people who put on voices, act voices, when they get angry or scared they revert to older more habitual cadences. Dropping &quot;R\'s&quot; is a sloppy uneducated cadence. Podesta was from a home in a rough are of Chicago and his father did not graduate from High School. So John Podesta\'s more polished speech, such as it is, was likely learned after his childhood, in college or law school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when angry or emotional he would revert to his original accent; dropping the &quot;R\'s?&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know there are people who can take a voice print and really know from a forensic POV , not just speculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZnstAiN3VgYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZnstAiN3VgYouTube</a> Listen to when he says &quot;back and forth on this&quot; <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cny24Imgur">http://imgur.com/a/cny24Imgur</a> Album</p>
<p>Sounds just like &quot;Father&quot; But there should be a rock solid way to prove that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He breaks in and over-rides the interviewers question. His voice cracks up high to a higher range at about 1:27 + as the voice in the MKULTRA-style vid does.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can you find or think of any other voice or voices which sounds like him?  I cannot.</strong></p>
<p>In the Horror vid , when the &quot;father&quot; says &quot;finding my way&quot; the manner in which he lingers on the word &quot;way&quot; sounds exactly like John D. Podesta. 1:08</p>

<p>Also, for the Horror vid it sounds like he\'s adopting an &quot;alt&quot; voice , as people do sometimes, when speaking to animals or to children.. Like telling a horror story. But it still sounds like him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWSSfsbMdEYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWSSfsbMdEYouTube</a> Fatherhood\' John Podesta Voice Comparison. Same hesitations you see in other voice samples.:</p>

<p>&quot;Say it again&quot; &quot;Say it again&quot; -- sounds exactly like him. 45 - 50 seconds</p>
<p>At the campaign closing &quot;Listen to me.. &quot; &quot;[]go home&quot;</p>
<p>[what a douche. Can\'t believe anyone ever took this fool seriously. Doesn\'t even thank anyone.. Alright , so that counts for psychopathology that is shown in the horror clip ] 1:37</p>
<p>&quot;We are so proud of you. and we are so proud of HER&quot; Alright he did thank at the very end. But didn\'t focus on any individuals.</p>
<p>[in terms of &quot;Russians trying to influence election&quot; They never explain how the leaked emails do that.. He just skirts it&quot; ]</p>
<p>3:58 &quot;You oughta get a real job&quot; Angry. sounds like battering &quot;Father.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWSSfsbMdEYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDWSSfsbMdEYouTube</a></p>
<p>&quot;Just Get Lost&quot; 4:28 You can hear the spittle. Same.</p>
<p>He is so fucked. [When I first saw the &quot;Pizza&quot; material , I wrote that.. It\'s over. He\'s toast. He\'s done.] Sounds precisely the same.</p>
<p>I do not feel sorry for him at all. I can\'t believe he was let get as far as he has.</p>
<p>Now there\'s more. He could\'ve been hung out to dry just with his pedo artwork, the teddie and klennex next to his bed, and the Pizza map reference. But now,, hmpth. There must be more, too?. ]</p>

            I think it's Podesta but it doesn't matter the whole point of it being leaked was to get people talking about it being Podesta. It's a strategic leak by white hats in the FBI the video might be from Anthony Weiner's laptop and I hope the NYPD will leak everything they have all the videos which might include videos of Hillary and Huma having sex with young girls in foreign countries from when Hillary was Secretary of State. That is the kryptonite we need to see. Mossad has these videos for certain. They use them for blackmail they get a lot of money from them. If one of these videos could be leaked on the dark web it will surface very fast on the public web. Mossad also has videos from Jeffrey Epstein's orgy island and his lolita parties and those videos have Bill Clinton with young girls. This is what the world needs to see but so far it's all kept locked away. Sad!

            One has to wonder if John's "faddah" spoke like that to him. He may then revert back to that in his disassociative state.

            Not a shill, long time lurker. Here's what I know: I have 6 kids. No child who is that young (3-5) can mimic, or "act", that kind of traumatised, hysterical tone of voice. That is real. The adult voice sounds very much like Podesta, though I dont want to say I'm 100% certain. That said, during the interview he did with Heilermann, some of the same voice characteristics can be heard as in the child abuse vid. In reference to his "r's", alot of people will revert back to their natural venacular in stressful or excited situations. I've heard native spanish speakers revert back to Spanish and not even realize they did it due to their frame of mind. If it's not him, it is a very clever forgery.

            If I was on a jury and this was one of many pieces of evidence I would convict. If you take into account the EFIT that look like the spitting image of not one but both podesta brothers. The multiple associations with convicted pedofiles: epstein, hasert, Tim bean, Clinton, anthony wiener. Finally the Wikileaks emails with the pedo code words. Let us not forget the disturbing tragic artwork of canibalism and child torture that they proudly display. Since the two are clearly unable to provide an alibi for his whereabouts on the night maddy McCann disappeared. They instead skirt around this investigation crying out fake news and the Russians.....there is no reasonable doubt: GUILTY!

            This is all so surreal and crazy to me.  I've watched all the cleaned up/stable versions on here and I have listened to all the voice comparisons.  I still don't know what to think.  Before reading anything and after merely watching the Fatherhood vid, I personally could hear the kid call the man John in the vid's beginning.  Then I took it upon myself to look up vids of JP speaking to compare....I feel like they are similar..but at the same time I don't know because I like to remain skeptical.  I'm so torn.  I also tried listening to the Each vid and only slightly felt like I could hear the guy call himself John Podesta....but he might be cutting himself off before finishing the 'Podesta' portion..but at the same time...I rewatched the vid looking for him to say that..so...could it be confirmation bias?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I remember seeing all these posts about how the entire thing had been debunked and that Silva acct stated no kids were harmed...but has this really been confirmed, or is it just mere statements presented without proof?  I lurked a lot since this PG thing exploded and only now am making an acct on here to post because of these Fatherhood vids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, who the hell was the very first person to post the video?  I feel like it's obscure to the point of it being too weird for comfort for someone to find the Fatherhood vid (be it on the WorldCorp site or on their removed Youtube acct) and to say there is a PG/JP connection.  Can someone clarify to me when and where this was posted to the point the PG connection has been made?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also....did I see somewhere that supposedly the kid in the video was identified and is alive and well? Can anyone confirm this?
           </p>

            Thank you ahead of time!

             To the people who claim it's LARP - I just don't think Podesta has that kind of acting talent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The evidence is piling up against him .
            </p>
            <p>
             If you don't think it sounds like him, I don't know what to say. That's your business.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I don't really care about whatever words they're supposedly say, or don't say.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's the sound of the voice which clinches it,
            </p>
            <p>
             The exact-word arguing and the cutting the words to little pieces comparisons, just distract from the evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe it was dumped by the same people who dumped the Wanted poster from Portugal, and the emails about Pizza Maps.
            </p>
            <p>
             From one interview listed above in the YouTube links, Podesta says he's not confirming those are his emails..
            </p>
            <p>
             He's a lawyer and it might be hard to convict, what with his political connections and the ownership of the Media Networks by his crime buddies.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why, maybe, they are rounding the little guys so they can people to testify against him? dunno.

            Great post!  I've been thinking it's the same voice but just amplified louder from anger and possibly intoxication and disassociation, playing dominos in a small room.

            Most of the time, common sense solves crimes and this case isn't a complex riddle, you shitbag.  The only reason the Podestas and others have not been arrested is because there is deep and widespread treason throughout our government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pretty sure I know what side you're on, because why would someone be so flippant about such a topic? After all, that is a real kid in that video being tortured.

            Also if another alter ego, being Skippy, his old accent may come into play too. I wonder if there are more?
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it's him. My only analysis however, was looking away as each played. Skippy sounded like a terrifying ego, lord even knows when it was 'born'
           </p>
           <p>
            Example, we know Britney Spears was programmed, she had/has at least 3 personalities, most curious to me; is her British accent one she used a lot previous to the umbrella incident.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case the voice terrified me, I have something go wrong with me when men yell, like I remember that trauma alone. So, I can only imagine how awful the kids are feeling. If they are victims of abuse this trauma never goes away sadly. You can cope, but you still get a trigger once in awhile. I hope Skippy someday gets to feel this trauma. With no power trauma eats up anybody.
