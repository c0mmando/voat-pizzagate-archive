OUR MISSION</p>
<p>The Mama Bear Effect seeks to empower adults to actively protect children from sexual abuse by raising awareness, and promoting conversations and behaviors that can prevent abuse. </p>
<p>There are many misconceptions regarding this issue, specifically: 
 the reality of child sexual abuse - occurrence, offenders, scenarios 
risk factors that permit child sexual abuse to exist in our society today. 
prevention methods to deter abusers and detect &amp; cease abuse that is occurring. 
how society handles disclosures of abuse - often failing to support survivors, and instead - defending abusers and minimizing their actions. 
failures of the justice system, protective services, and family court. </p>
<p>The Mama Bear Effect will work diligently and endlessly to expose the reality of child sexual abuse and put an end to dangerous misconceptions.</p>
<p>We believe that all good people have a &quot;Mama Bear&quot; instinct - a desire to protect innocent children from a harm greater than what they could ever imagine. A willingness to face our fears, overpower our desire to turn away from such evil, and conquer the ignorance that clouds our understanding of how child sexual abuse exists and is afflicting our nation and world. </p>
<p>We must protect our children.  We will fight back. This is The Mama Bear Effect. </p>
