            I would take off Sanduskys kid and replace him with the biggest fish so far - Anthony Weiner. I live in PA and the Sandusky thing got alot of press. That guy (the kid) just seems like a sick loser who was messed up after years of abuse at the hands of his sick dad. I think we should stick to ppl in positions of power...that's what pizzagate is all about.

             I agree. I already had second thoughts on Sandusky, I'll remove it and add weiner when I have more time later today. I can't believe I forgot him!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Last Thursday, a lawsuit was filed accusing Seattle Mayor Ed Murray of sexually assaulting a minor in the 1980’s. Murray was in his 20’s and 30’s at the time. The alleged victim, who is only referred to as “D.H.” in the filings, was a 15-year-old high school dropout and a drug addict at the time. Murray allegedly paid the boy $10 and $15 payments for at least 50 sexual encounters over a period of four to five years. Allegations Murray has since denied in person and through his attorney.
            </p>
            <p>
             While these charges will be adjudicated in time, the scandal is made worse by the fact that when Mayor Murray first ran for the position nine years ago, similar allegations were made. In 2008, two men from the Portland area called media outlets in Seattle, including the Seattle Times, claiming that Ed Murray had paid for sexual encounters with them, years prior, after meeting him on a city bus.

             The disgraced commander claims that he had been seeking legal pornography, but his downloads sometimes contained images of minors. Jones admitted that he knew the search terms he used would likely turn up some child pornography, but not exclusively. He argued that there was no way to separate illegal content from the legal in the torrent downloads.

             Thanks. I added Ed Murray, but not col. Jones, as I didn't see any real political ties. If I missed one, let me know. If I included military and law enforcement we'd be here all day, unfortunately.
