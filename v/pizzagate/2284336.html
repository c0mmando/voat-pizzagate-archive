<p><strong>Trump Jr. Sets Phasers To Wrecked, Blasts George Takei Into Deep Space</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>You may have read about the giant CNN screw-up over a #FakeNews story concerning Donald Trump Jr. in which the network claimed two sources both happened to misread the date on an email and accidentally concluded that Wikileaks was passing information to the Trump campaign before it was made public - when in fact the emails had been published days before.</p>
<p>The network issued an embarassing correction, both in print and on air: </p>
<hr />
<p>Washington (CNN)Correction: This story has been corrected to say the date of the email was September 14, 2016, not September 4, 2016. The story also changed the headline and removed a tweet from Donald Trump Jr., who posted a message about WikiLeaks on September 4, 2016.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the wake of all that, George Takei tried to launch his own follow-up \'gotcha\' at Trump Jr., tweeting \'Uh-oh, Donnie\' - with a link to a new article from a left-leaning news outlet with a mixed reputation for factual reporting, which claims that a Russian social media executive emailed Jr. and campaign aide Dan Scavino, inviting them to create an account. OH MY GOD, EVEN IF TRUE. (............crickets...........)</p>

            Ok if it's gotta be a kid and has to be someone s son let it be the frog son of Pepe to shoot the gun....it could start out innocent....DADDY, HE WAS A BAD MAN. OK NOW SON, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. Someone emblematic like Pepe jr. that's not a real person/child  it's not personal. 
Sorry to sound negative, i can't come up with better, or anything except maybe an old guys with long beards run out of. Cave, cave men everywhere are coming out of their caves. To say stop fucking the kids. But they havent and  if they did, would people  listen to hairy cave men, even if they organized? If hairy cave men came out of their caves all over the world to organize anti pedo campaign on Twitter, would people listen? I think they would get banned first.

            Is there a way to leave kids out of this, esp the Trump kid? It's still too much for kids and is as bad as Elsa gate is violent. I spent much of last night actually reading the pedo posts on Twitter and their fake victim bullshit combined with reading about the mk ultra patterns and messages blue red green yellow pink. The most frightening stuff the baby vids. Equal to the finders cult some clues put them with the Chinese daycare. With the Clinton's, Alefantis  and those in that CULTURE. Thisneedles and scissors shit, gas to be routed out, never ever put a phaser in a child's hand. Ok. Same mk ultra bs people. Let's get the big fish. Jump out of this pond.

             That is why I posted it. Trump did not say assaulting people he said "kids". I took that as a message to the pedos hopefully. I would suspect he chose his words carefully.

            I live in Indiana and when then Gov Pense tried to give his base a softball by passing RFRA, Takei started a #boycottIndiana movement online, not understanding that the very people that were affected the worse by the boycott (hospitality workers in hotels and restaurants and small business owners, etc) not only opposed RFRA, but were going to be hurt financially while the people in charge of passing the law would have zero financial impact. And Takei chose the lazy route, tweeting it out rather than coming to Indiana (where he'd only been one time before at a paid appearance) and actually doing something. So he started a movement which hurt the very people he thought he was helping then took credit when RFRA was modified, which was in place before his hashtag campaign. That's what bugs me about Takei. I don't care about how he (or any adult) conducts their private life as long as its legal, but people think he's some sort of activist, when in fact, he's lazy and irresponsible. So good for DTJ for calling him out.

             Wrong again Georgie... I guess you have a bit more free time to read #fakenews now that it’s a bit tougher to ply kids with alcohol to assault them??? You know with all the added scrutiny.
