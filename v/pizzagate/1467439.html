            I love it. I hope you will incorporate some collaboration. You have clearly been inspired. Looks like you are letting the facts speak for themselves too. This is a great principal in historical writing. This is major historical juncture, IMO. If we can make the world safe for children, we have a new era ahead of us. We ought to be able to. There is really only one to one and half percent of the population, who wants to ruin life. Even a lot of them, do not really want to do what they are doing, I believe. They are rejecting life, because they feel overwhelmed by the prospect of a happy world. The same as when people sabotage love, because the prospect is too much for them. Some, just get shy, or nervous, but some have a severe, life consuming reaction, and go to extreme unconscious lengths, to keep it at bay.

              For me, this is all about the election, Hillary hiding her emails, what was she hiding? well, we are finding out!! So don't forget the stolen primary (from Bernie) and Comey investigating and then dropping it, WJC hijacking Lynch's plane, and Comey reinvestigating and redropping the email handling. And Anthony Weiner, of course.

               I have been writing solidly, for the last year. these last three or more weeks, have been the first time off I have taken from my book. It has been good though, `because it has made me get organised, which is what i needed more of in my own book. Many topics relate to this one as well. for instance I was writing about the potential that there would be, in many people getting together, and pooling their mental abilities, in a positive way. Now we are seeing that, in the most positive way. Also my book looks at the fundamental reason behind why people do harmful things. I believe I have found the cause: it is a rejection of life. We see it when people are afraid of love, and the closer they get to love, the more they will magnify their fears. We have not been factoring it in, in life. Life, were we to really live it happily, would be millions of times more thrilling than love. it would  literally make for a world, where millions more people can be happy. The harmful things we are seeing, are the resistance against this life, and they are intent on saying that we can never have a better life, just like love deniers, are intent on saying that love will never happen for them. It is the reason for all pessimistic, and harmful acts. It is the reason, why truth, is faught, instead of revered, and it is even the reason, who so many of us in the world, who could unanimously call for an end to this, have been slow to, until now.

            Pizzagate has nothing to do with the election. Your narrative is way off here, and the false flag thing is a footnote at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Pizzagate is part four of your book, parts one, two and three should cover the Presidio Air Force Base abuse stories, the Larry King/RNC scandal, the story of Johnny Gosch/Jeff Gannon, that Epstien lolita island man/Clinton scandal, the Clinton death list perhaps, the history of child sacrifice and pederesty in Western Civilization in general, twittergate, maybe the Marc Dutroux/Mothers Of Darkness angle...
           </p>
           <p>
            there is way more here than you are even digging into, and all the election stuff is way off and basically unrelated. Obviously you are digging for ideas here, but if you are seriously going to write about this stuff at least do your research.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It All Goes Away - Details how Alefantis snapped his fingers to make Pizzagate disappear." You made me laugh with that one. If this is a troll, a tip of the fedora to you, but there is no point carrying on this false and limited narrative that somehow relates Pizzagate to the election. 
There is a bigger picture here.

             My idea isn't to tie Pizzagate into every single scandal regarding children. If I did that I would be writing forever. My thinking is simply to write up the events that led to Pizzagate and yes the election is absolutely related. If it wasn't for Reddit and 4chan digging like crazy through Podesta's emails then no one would even be talking about Pizzagate. You're absolutely right though, there is a bigger picture but I am not ready to write about that.

            It can't be written now. We don't have the full picture there's so much we probably don't have and don't know that will change our understanding of the whole situation. Go into mega research mode for the foreseeable future but be warned getting into the territory of real research involves getting hands on and potentially exposing yourself to dangerous situations

            Being here and now gives you a unique advantage. Whatever happens, in a decade from now, this website, the Reddit, the 4Chan posts, the pastebin documents, the archived files etc. will be obscure or non-existent. Take notes, save important information for posterity, document.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the truth: we don't need tomes, books, or lengthy articles. We have enough of these. What we need are popularizers; people who can condense the most important information into the tiniest space possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            People here don't know a damn thing about rhetoric, PR or advertising. We're a bunch of nerds, tin-foil conspiracy theorists who are excited to probably be right for once, or just ordinary people from every walk of life. We can't communicate our findings to the public in a succint and shocking way. Our radical idealism and unrestricted honesty is seriously stunting the movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, I don't think you should write a book. I think you should focus on getting this to the masses. Once they are curious, they will find an abundance of introductory guides.

             I disagree. If they are curious they will find a bunch of things saying its fake news and has been debunked. Also I don't really do social media so my ability to spread is limited :(

              The operative term here is, "if they are curious". They're not. Most people aren't curious. Most people don't believe - and don't want to believe - they live in a country where the government enables a mass child predator ring to operate in Washington D.C.
             </p>
             <p>
              They aren't curious; they are annoyed. They have a worldview that they wish to validate, and their shields are nearly impenetrable. So the point is developing content that penetrates those shields quickly and effectively.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't worry about your ability to spread. If you can make something concise, succinct, and effective, this community will spread it for you.
             </p>
             <p>
              ALSO, this isn't to shut down your efforts. If you want to do this, then by all means, go ahead. Since you asked for input, I just don't think this is what we really need right now.

               Thanks, I appreciate your opinion. And you're mostly right, a lot of people are annoyed, but there are a lot of people who are very curious and don't know where to begin to look. You would be surprised how many people I've mentioned it to, they ask about it, then they come back the next day saying they read it was fake.
