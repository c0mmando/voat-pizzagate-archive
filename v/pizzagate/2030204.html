            Haven't gotten to "The Story" involved as yet, but would certainly agree based on info below that likely they changed
the autopsy report and then had to disappear the coroner.  Evidently this particular coroner wasn't willing to cooperate and I'm guessing that many have cooperated under threat and fear of ending up dead.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Yet it wasn’t until his coroner, the one responsible for declaring his cause of death(also at the center of much controversy), turned up dead from arsenic poisoning within hours of the release of Breitbart’s preliminary autopsy report that the theory truly began to materialize. Many of Breitbart’s tweets leading up to his death were very accusatory and seemingly irrational at the time. However, following WikiLeaks’ release of the hacked emails from John Podesta, uncovering the horror that is pizzagate, his tweet’s context began to form.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            As a liberal, I haven't been familiar with Breibart and I'd certainly need someone to explain this comment to me ...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Breitbart had attempted to call out Media Matters for covering up “underage sex slave operations” that connected back to Planned Parenthood.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Now, I'm certainly no friend of Media Matter nor David Brock, but I certainly support Planned Parenthood.
In fact, Americans support Planned Parenthood and government funding for Planned Parenthood.

             <p>
              Nature is pro-choice having given women reproductive freedom through natural plants
which are our medicines and our drugs.
             </p>
             <p>
              The knowledge of those plants and the plants were destroyed by patriarchy.
              <br/>
              And of course, patriarchy continues to war on women and reproductive freedom.
             </p>
             <p>
              What we have actually seen in the way of real "killings" involved religiously fanatical 
murders of doctors who have performed abortions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Planned Parenthood is serving a basic need for poor women all over the nation who
cannot afford gynecological care and who cannot afford abortions or even birth control.
             </p>
             <p>
              And providing a service for young females who want abortions and who can't afford them
and who often would kill themselves rather than have their parents disappointed in them.
             </p>
             <p>
              In its fanaticism. what the right wing has actually done has made it ever more difficult for women 
suffering wanted pregnancies where something has gone very wrong.  Where either their life is 
threatened by the pregnancy or the baby is already dead or dying.  Often there is an enlarged head.
If the woman continues on with the pregnancy to a vaginal delivery, she very likely risks losing her
ability to have children in the future.  These pregnancies are very rare -- about 1 in every county of 
the US every year.  The actress Debbie Reynolds twice carried dead infants for months in her womb
on two occasions because abortions weren't permitted in the 1960's and early 1970's.
The second pregnancy failed because the first pregnancy had so drained her body of the stamina 
to carry another pregnancy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those are considerations which have to be made by women and their families.
Often there are other children to be cared for.
Many women in the past have lost their lives to back-alley abortions yet many men in
Congress seem to barely be able to wait until women are in that position once again.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since we are here ... did I mention that MALES are our sexual abusers of children which even
right wing women's groups agree with.
And that they are heterosexual males.
              <br/>
              Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.

                Then Nature is a "murderer" because NATURE provided women with many ways via plants
to interrupt conception, to end their fertility when they wished, and to be used as birth control.

               <p>
                In fact, RU486 is based on one of those plants still used today.
It keeps an egg from being embedded in the lining of the womb -- 
thus an abortion.

                And NATURE also provides many spontaneous abortions.

                 There has to be intent to harm for murder. Nature is simply, well, things happening naturally. It's like saying cancer is a murderer. Cancer kills, sure, but it is not intelligent. A plant is not intelligent. If I poison you using cyanide that I mined from apple seeds, am I any less a murderer because I used a plant based substance? Of course not. 
What you truly mean to say is that life does not begin at conception. And unfortunately, the current law in my country agrees. That does not make it morally right, or even logically true. It's a moral argument, and it is simply a waste of time, and beyond the scope of this forum, to debate this with me. I'm a Christian and you will get nowhere. Regardless, peace to you, fellow pizzagater!

                  The intent was of violence on the part of males who ran "Witch Hunts/Burning Women at the Stake" intended to destroy women's wisdom of plants as healers, and the plants themselves.  This was male violence used to  gain control over our societies which they could not in any other way merit.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Elite patriarchy is what violence is all about, still today, and their desire to control and enslave the world.

                  You may have missed the fact that US adapted "cancer" as a weapon and has killed many by using it ...

                 <p>
                  Again, natural plants always provided a means for women and families to control reproduction and those means were supplied by Nature/Creation.

                  I wouldn't these days brag about being a "Christian" if you understand the discussions here and involvement of Church with these issues of child sexual abuse.
                  <br/>
                  And that's always been true from day #1 of the Catholic Church.
And from Day #1 of organized patriarchal religions which underpin Elite patriarchy.

                  It's laughable to suggest that males in any way represent morality -- 
or that "Christianity" represents morality in any way.
All evidence points clear to its violence and Inquisitions ...
it's Papal Edicts to "Enslave or murder" natives here and Africans enslaved here.

                 <p>
                  We have a Congress which is majority male and majority "Christian" and they have done nothing but warmonger all over the world, so far killing in excess more than one million Muslims in order to control their OIL. and for profit of the Elites and Empire.

                  Our Founders showed no "morality" in their murder of 112 million native people here in genocide,

                   I'm not a Catholic, but even if I was, it's not fair to blame the average Catholic when most of the sexual abuse is perpetrated by priests who are expected to remain celibate. This is simply not realistic for the majority of people. I

                   It is unfair to categorize an entire group of believers (or nonbelievers as the case may be), especially one so prevalent as Christianity. I would not even want to demonize all Muslims that way, and I think it's one of the cruelest religions out there. I work with many South African Muslims and they run the gamut, just like Christians. Judge people by their actions. It's more time consuming, but more rewarding.

                   I can see this is a very passionate topic for you. You speak about it constantly. You might try reading some literature written by watchdog groups about planned parenthood. They're not a good group. They're an industry that sells the body parts of babies for profit and preys on vulnerable women, many of whom go on to have deep seated feelings of guilt, shame, and regret.

                    Any organized patriarchal religion is brainwashing and you don't have to be Catholic to understand that.

                    However, when you continue to support male-supremacist religions which deny the full personhood of 
females then you are supporting male-supremacy.

                   <p>
                    Of course celibacy is not realistic.
The reason for the celibacy rule in the Catholic Church was to prevent financial claims 
on the Church by married priests and their families.

                   <p>
                    What I pointed out to you had to do with the corruption of "Christianity" as presented by our 
Christian leaders in Congress ... who should very rightly be held responsible not only for their
corrupted religious beliefs but for the harm they inflict on others through those beliefs which
they turn into legislation which effects the entire nation.
THAT is "judging people by their actions."

                    Planned Parenthood provides reproductive services and other health services for 
women who are poor and cannot afford birth control, who cannot afford breast 
exams and pap smears.

                   <p>
                    You seem to still believe in the fake videos produced a while back about PPH
which have been shown over and again to be untrue.
                    <br/>
                    Seek information on that yourself and move away from the video and right wing 
distortions of Planned Parenthood.

thing to wake up from.

                        Sadly funny that you can't even accept the fact that the GOP APPROVED fetal tissue donations after abortions,
including allowing those who are handling the tissue donations to charge a minimum to cover the expense of storage and shipping.
Many of these places charge far more than PPH which barely charges enough to cover their expenses.

                       <p>
                        You have many other choices for the debunking of the video by the right wing, if you have the courage to research it.

                          My comment was about fetal tissue being APPROVED by the GOP ... which most of those who saw the lies of the video didn't even realize.

                          Re abortion ...
If it were "murder" every woman in America would pretty much be on death row.
Catholic women have just as many abortions as any other women.
And Catholics support abortion and reproductive freedom by huge majorities.
When Latino/Latina Catholics are added in the support is about 10 percentage points higher.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          "Murder" is the meme of Randall Terry which he seems to have used to move religious fanatics to actually murder living doctors who perform abortions.  Wasn't the slogan:
                          <strong>
                           "If you believe it's murder, act like it"
                          </strong>
                          ... ???
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Then Randall Terry sat on the side lines and watched.
Those people were actual murderers and they went to jail.
Terry should be held as a co-conspirator in the murder of doctors.

                           Killing a human being is murder. Just because the law allows for the murder of unborn babies so women need not deal with the consequences of spreading their legs doesn't make it good, moral, or healthy. I'm getting really tired of you. I come here to read about the fight against child molesters in the government, not debate feminazis about their immoral causes. Please. Get. Lost!

                            Again, you continue to repeat the Terry Randall slogan used to encourage
religious fanatics to kill abortion doctors.  And they did!

                           <p>
                            Your comments show your utter disrespect for women which suggests that you have
no real relationship with any of them.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            As we all know, if men could get pregnant ... abortion would be a sacrament.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Unless you can get pregnant, what you're saying is hypothetical --
Perhaps in your next life you'll come back as a female and be "good, moral and
healthy" and, of course, abortion free.  But guess we'll have to wait and see.

                            Notice you also rely on Rush Limbaugh for slurs -- "feminazis" ... ???  Really?
Rush is, btw, thought to be a pedophile.

                                 In order to be "male" the bonds with females and children have to be broken.

                                 But I think a return to the theory of Reincarnation and the spirit of it would be helpful.

                                 And beyond the male/female equality/power thing ...

                                <p>
                                 I think it would be most especially valuable in regard to the Native American concept of "7th generation" awareness and concern -- and for all Nature.

                                  I don't know what you mean about breaking bonds. It seems like maybe you have a low opinion of them in general? I personally would not want to be male because I cannot fathom not being female; it's who I am. But that being said I don't want to live in a world without men! I love too many of them. I also have the benefit of living in the South, where chivalry isn't quite dead. I can't even tell you how many times make strangers have seen me in some kind of jam and went out of their way to help me, and it's not like I'm some kind of super hot babe either, lol. A lot of men simply feel a basic sense of responsibility to look out for the fairer sex. I love that about them! 😊

                                   There is no human being -- and certainly no male on this planet -- who hasn't gotten here through the body of a female.

                                    Let's not forget there are greedy, elitist, and dishonest women in power, too. Women are just coming to the table later so they've had less opportunities to abuse power. There are good and bad people of all shapes, sizes, sexes, economic brackets, religions, and cultures, etc. Most men don't enjoy war any more than women do but they are taught that it is their duty to risk their lives for their country if the government says it's time to fight. Actually, that goes back to what you were saying about the elite and unjust wars. There are a few good people in government, but obviously they are the minority. 😟 That's one thing we can agree on, at least.

                                     Well, of course that's true -- but men still control Congress by huge majorities -- and have
a couple of hundred years of male control of our government and the country piled up . . .  right?
And we see the damage from this violence against women which resulted in "The bird with one wing."

                                     And you're saying what I repeat often -- among EVERY people, in every nation there are a few who 
will resort to violence to get their way.  No people are exempt from this and that includes women.

                                     And - again - of course, ALL organized religion which came thousands and thousands of years after the 
Old Religion is organized patriarchal religions --** i.e., male-supremacist religions.**

                                     The Old Religions had no "devil" and no "Satan" and no "Hell" which are the inventions of Elite Patriarchy
in order to frighten members involved with these male-dominated religions.  Religion = Mind Control by FEAR.
The Old Religions were based in Nature.

                                    <p>
                                     The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy and to create the ONE-all male god.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Patriarchy is a political system just as Colonialism was a political system.
                                    </p>

                                     Men certainly don't enjoy war once they get to experience it -- and as soldiers they have no right to conscience.
Plus ... their bonds with women and children have to be broken in order to send them to war.
                                     <br/>
                                     And, of course, a good deal of propaganda of lies is used to make these wars sound as though we are 
under threat.  In fact, the US has been heavily involved in creating "terrorists" as they are greatly in need 
of a new Cold War.

                                     You also see if you look at the Constitution that (while proclaiming "All are equal") our Founders
actually created an Elite Patriarchy and endowed them with land grants -- gave them immense 
influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
That was the set up.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Our nation was founded on violence against the native peoples here to steal their land.
Against Africans enslaved here.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The Founders saved the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy which guaranteed the Civil War
which also benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps of hatred which echoes on still today.

                                     I wouldn't be upset if we don't agree on things -- it is how we conduct debate that's important -- and 
we hope to learn from one another.  :)

                                     PS:  Would just qualify my post in this way . . . . 
Women have pretty much conducted a non-violent campaign to deliver women from oppression
over the last 50,000 years or so.
No one on this planet gets here except through the body of a female -- and men are our sons
whom we nurture and care for and love.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I don't recall women ever running an Inquisition or the organized torturing of people.
Nor burning people at the stake.
Nor building religious empires as the male-supremacist Vatican has done.
Nor writing Papal Bulls which called for the "enslavement or murder" of Africans enslaved
here -- and native peoples here ... all of which was carried out.
Sadly, most of the violence of the world has been done by males and this is still true today.
During the years of the Vietnam War, something like 57,000 men lost their lives fighting that
war.  But at the same time and over those same years, 57,000 women were killed by their 
male significant other, their intimate male partners, or husbands.
And women are ever more threatened these days by males in their lives ....

                                     MALES are also our sexual abusers of children -- 
when heterosexual women are involved in sexual abuse of children it is usually because
of their involvement with a heterosexual male.
The Catholic Church also shows this to be the case -- Catholic nuns have sexually abused children.
And 40% of Catholic nuns have been sexually abused and physically abused by Catholic priests.

                                     Homosexual males are 100X less likely to sexually abuse a child that a heterosexual male ...
and Lesbians sexually abusing children is beyond rare.
Gays and Lesbians seek adult relationship with other adult homosexuals and are NOT our 
sexual abusers of children.

                                      I haven't read most of your posts tbh and no offense but I have heard similar rants about the patriarchy before. Also you're rather , um, wordy. ;) I actually spent about ten years away from Christianity as an agnostic and was deeply entrenched in third wave feminist ideology.  I pretty much would break out I'm hives when I read Bible verses pertaining to male headship in the church and husbands being the leader figure in the family unit, etc. Those days are over and I no longer have the knee-jerk enraged reactions that I once did at the idea that men and women are different and have complementary roles. Instead of reacting in fear and loathing at the teachings of the Book, I see the love and beauty inherent in God's design. It is mankind that sins and corrupts the design. However if you look you can still find examples of strong, loving, husband and wife teams where they honor and cherish one another as The Lord intended. I have to confess it's a relief not to feel so opressed all the time.

                                       However, I do not consider my comments on patriarchy to be "rants" any more than I consider my
comments against anti-Jewish posts here to be "rants" -- or my comments about the oppression of 
African Americans or Native Americans to be "rants."  These are all injustices which have caused 
great harm and suffering to humanity.
Especially in the rise of "The Bird With One Wing" which turned the world upside down and brought
us Global Warming which threatens the planet and humanity.

                                       I actually had to look up "third wave feminism" and there seems to be little consensus about it
but I am amused when people ask where the "roots" of feminism begin as they of course
begin within us, same as fascist roots are within us.
Some of us seek control over others and some of us seek justice and equality for all.

                                       I agree with Marilyn French:  "Feminism is anti-domination of anyone by anyone else."

                                       Can only agree with you and Thomas Jefferson on the Bible though his criticism was
mainly centered on the violence of the Bible.

                                       Men and women are different but what we see of each today is often distorted.
Women were long deprived of any physical activity which would strengthen their 
bodies, but that is changing today.
And clearly women have been groomed to procreate and to support their husbands in
"complementary roles."  Today, women are in a position due to their earning power to 
expect the return of some of that "complementary role playing" from their husbands.

                                       Thank you for the honesty in regard to your belief in "God's design" and "as The Lord intended" as I now
have a more accurate idea of who I am trading opinions with.

                                         Actually, I am usually responding to ideas in a post and pay very little attention to the author...
except when a few posts are traded and I become more aware of who I'm responding to.

                                        <p>
                                         And I guess that means I'm one of those pesky challengers and questioners of organized 
patriarchal religion who believes that we should stop subjecting children to this brainwashing
before they have even reached the age of reason.

                                         Actually, I do feel that there is a spiritual connection person to person, the universe, Nature.
And likely Reincarnation which the major religions used to teach.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         But that has nothing to do with organized male-supremacist religions or one-all-male
god religions based in Mind Control and invented boogey-men.

            It was none other than STEVE BANNON who laid the "conspiracy theories to rest" in the wake of Breitbart's death:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Bannon, formerly a Breitbart News Network board member, told WND that for months prior to his death, Breitbart had been working overtime to finalize a refinancing of his news agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              “He died of natural causes,” Bannon said.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            “The family wants the matter put to rest, and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              WND is beginning to irritate me suspecting foul play.”
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              In addition to Bannon, Laurence Solov, formerly president and chief operating officer, was elevated after Breitbart’s death. Solov took Breitbart’s place as CEO.
             </strong>

              “Breitbart had an enlarged heart,” Bannon told WND. “He had been hospitalized for the problem last year and told to lose weight that he did not lose.”

             Not to be a dick, because your info laid out here is troubling.... but what if Bannon was thinking way ahead when Andrew was killed? What if Bannon knew that his ONLY chance to get vengeance was to go with the "official story" in the immediate wake of Andrews death.  Perhaps Bannon made a commitment right then and there to plot and maneuver his way to the White House some day.   Well some-day turned into the 2016 election.  Maybe, just maybe, Trump IS on our team and they have simply been using the past 7 months building their case to bring these sick pedo fucks/Andrews killers to justice.
