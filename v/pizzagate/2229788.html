            : Thanks for sharing this very interesting article on thermal depolymerization. Unfortunately, I have to remove this per rules 1, 2 and 4. This is just an hypothesis; you've provided no evidence of a link to child trafficking, or of your claim regarding the pyramids. This is purely speculative, which means it belongs in
