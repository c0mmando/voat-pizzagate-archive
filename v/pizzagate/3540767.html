<p>In my last post I invited you to our mission to bring down the enigmatic pedophile &quot;Xi Lee&quot;. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3538554">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3538554</a></p>
<p>Content on his sites seems aimed at sharing pedophile entertainment while also luring children and girls into casting for his morbid film projects. Sorry for not sharing direct links, the content is considered incriminating and handed to federal agents for investigation.</p>
<p>Our investigation recovered a lot of places and people involved,  but many questions remain to be answered. </p>
<p>Who are the children on his pages? What type of media has he produced? What nefarious business is he involved in?</p>
<p>The first question leads to a trail of a company called Willey Studios, that seems to be the company responsible for distributing the images online, and possibly producing the images as well.</p>
<p>The girl in question that was found on Xi\'s pages is listed as Emmie in Willeys\' databases. You can find Emmie on Xi\'s pages by Googling &quot;XIan Gods of Russia Europe and Beyond!&quot; and browing the &quot;Xian Gods&quot; pages, Emmie is seen on at least &quot;Xian Gods 1&quot; and &quot;Xian Gods 2&quot;. I won\'t link to it directly due to the legal questionability of the content.</p>
<p>Some of these pics of were put through Google search and following leads to other web pages and eventually the source was uncovered, as was the case with the girl listed as Emmie. Willey Studios has been distributing their media on several web pages most of which are now offline, as early as 2003, and collections include thousands of pictures and dozens of children. The pages related to Willey can still be viewed in the Wayback Machine. A second domain was found also claiming to be the agency behind Emmie, called Agency Modeling, but they use the same contact details as Willey Studio.</p>
<p>It is possible that Willey Studios is not affiliated with Xi, however, little is known of the company. Are they still active? Who are they? Where are they based? Have they continued business under a different name? Are the girls safe?</p>
<p>You can help answer these things by taking up the task of investigation yourself. </p>
<p>To help you on the way, I will list several starting points where you can take off and share what I know, so that we may find the people responsible and perhaps connections to Xi. </p>
<p>The things I share do not directly include incriminating content and are pages recovered with Wayback.</p>

<p>Now, Agency Modeling has several archive URLs of their models. They are formatted as follows:</p>
<p>www.am-archiveX.com, whereas the X must be replaced with a number from 1 to 13. Number 6 is for Emmie. 7-11 were not in use.</p>
<p>Since these are real people they should have names, relatives, lives, adresses, jobs, phones... And the same goes for the girls.</p>
<p>I hope you guys manage to dig up more than I can because my skills and equipment are limited and I know some of you out there can do some pretty impressive work. Good luck!</p>',
