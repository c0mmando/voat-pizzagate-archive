            One of the best RESEARCH posts I have read in a while! This info is SIGNIFICANT and should be carefully studied. It reveals the historical  foundational structure on which current Pizzagate investigation rides.

            "Researching the IHD’s activities in Africa at the RAC resulted in encounters with documents that mentioned numerous organizations and entities with whom the RF corresponded or collaborated: the Wellcome Trust, the U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, the British Colonial Office and Foreign Office, the French Colonial Office, Pasteur Institutes (Paris, Dakar, and Algiers), the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, and others. It was through such mention of Wellcome that I determined to add the Wellcome Trust to my study."

            "The ‘father of the British Secret Service’ was the Elizabethan lawyer, politician, diplomat and spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham. He was a Protestant and as a young man during the bloody reign of the Catholic Queen Mary was forced to flee abroad to escape persecution. While in exile, Walsingham learnt Italian and French and became acquainted with the work of the famous Venetian Secret Service that used its spying skills for trade and commerce under the cloak of diplomacy."
           </p>
           <p>
            The modern global conspiracy begins with the East India Companies (English, Dutch, etc.), which was a revival of Roman Empire trade/slave traditions now applied to the "New World". Follow the bloodlines of the original British East India Company investors. Some lead to American patriots. Here is one family line: Thomas and Hugh Myddelton (Middleton).
           </p>
           <p>
            "The cultural relationship between Wales and England is shaped by military, political and cultural elements. Within a century of Henry Tudor’s victory at Bosworth the Welsh influence at court in high finance, commerce and in exploration would flourish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Articulate and able, the WELSH gentry who were present at court in England and who held positions of influence, while loyal to the King, nevertheless retained a “national identity”, and among the best examples of these “Ambassadors from the West” were the brothers Thomas and Hugh Myddelton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their entrepreneurism helped to LAY THE FOUNDATIONS for the British Empire, brought significant improvements to the health of the London populace – and helped to preserve the Welsh language.
           </p>
           <p>
            Born in 1550, in the North Wales town of Denbigh, Thomas was one of four brothers, and from an early age his enthusiasm for life seems to have been guided by that Tudor Zeitgeist which motivated the able, well-born young men of the age."
           </p>
           <p>
            Early voyages to foreign countries and observation of international trading would contribute to his future success as an entrepreneur and FINANCIER at the highest levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            His apprenticeship to Fernando Poyntz in London was the beginning of his meteoric career.
           </p>
           <p>
            On completion of his apprenticeship he set up in ANTWERP in 1583, and on returning to London he established his own SUGAR House with massive success – a position he consolidated by marrying the daughter of his future business partner.
On her death, her father helped Myddelton find a second wife – whose first husband was another business associate.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the war with Spain he invested in some very successful speculative ventures, and he was invited to invest £500 in the East India Company in its Charter of Incorporation – granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1600.
           </p>
           <p>
            The subsequent focus on “Empire” was initially forTRADING ambitions and PROFIT, rather than domination of overseas territories."
           </p>
           <p>
            Myddelton largely stayed out of politics under ELIZABETH l. Under James I he preferred the role of FINANCIER, so it was against his will that he was elected an Alderman in 1603. He then refused to take the Oath of Office so he was thrown in to Newgate prison!
           </p>
           <p>
            This action prompted a swift reprimand from King James I, and Myddelton was released as he was involved in “important service for the state”. Three days later he was KNIGHTED at the coronation, and then became active in civic matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hugh Myddelton, ten years younger than his brother Thomas, followed him to LONDON. A talented GOLDSMITH, SILVER prospector and a brilliant engineer, he became a PERSONAL FRIEND of SIR FRANCIS WALSINGHAM and SIR WALTER RALEIGH."
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas had been an original Chartered Adventurer in his brother Hugh’s New River Company, and, at the same time, in the proposed VIRGINIA COMPANY. Opening up these territories was to provide a HUGE INCOME for the Crown, and the King’s gratitude was clear."

           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas Myddelton made huge sums from sugar plantations on the Island of Barbados (Caribbean). This Island was the beginning of the African chattel slavery system which was imported to South Carolina by his descendants and other Barbadian plantation families.

             The reason all of this is important is that it indicates that a heretofore unknown MK Ultra program seems to exist under the guise of "art therapy". And we know it's a lie because the artists are very clearly drawing Satanist Abuse.

             Lady Diana's favorite London SERPENTINE GALLERY is a good one.
Former NY City mayor Michael Bloomberg was on the board of directors along with a Rothschild. Features disgusting "modern" art. Also hosted a Marina Abramovic "performance art".
             <br/>
             The City of London is the financial center of the NWO and the former East India Co.

             "September 26, 2013, 11:57 AM EDT
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be the next chairman of the Serpentine Gallery, a London arts institution, taking the post after his mayoral term ends."
             <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-26/mayor-bloomberg-to-chair-london-s-serpentine-gallery">
              https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-26/mayor-bloomberg-to-chair-london-s-serpentine-gallery
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Bloomberg reports that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will chair the Serpentine Gallery in London, the exhibition space run by Julia Peyton-Jones and Hans Ulrich Obstrist. The news, which was announced at a Serpentine dinner on Sept. 24, suggests, as has been rumored, that Mayor Bloomberg plans to spend a fairly significant amount of time in the U.K. after his mayoralty ends Dec. 31.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mayor Bloomberg had previously served on the board of the Serpentine, and it sounds like he was a pretty good board member, if this excerpt from a 2002 New York magazine article is to be believed (though note that the the Serpentine does not actually deal art, as it suggests):
            </p>
            <p>
             Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine Gallery, an avant-garde art dealer located in the glorious middle of Hyde Park, was intrigued to receive an invitation to a Bloomberg soirée at Sir Terence Conran’s Bluebird restaurant. Curiosity turned into delight when she found herself seated next to the host.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I found him absolutely hilarious and extremely endearing,” Peyton-Jones says. “He was completely irreverent and talked about the arts in a very straightforward way.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Flattered by his interest, Peyton-Jones did a most un-English thing: She screwed up her courage and asked him for money directly. The check Bloomberg wrote for £250,000 got him a seat on the Serpentine’s board alongside one of the city’s social lions, Lord Jacob Rothschild. “He missed very few meetings,” says Peyton-Jones. “His dedication was remarkable.”"

             Okay, so you're probably wondering what any of this has to do with Pizzagate. Well in 2011, The National Gallery of Art bans a Robert Wojnarowicz piece called Fire in My Belly, citing its satanic imagery.
            </p>
            <p>
             The film includes the immolation of a child puppet along with the artist masturbating. Immediately after, local groups stage a protest led by local art dealer and restaurant owner James Alefantis (photo). He and his gallery display the video on a TV in their gallery storefront.

               What's most interesting about the figures is that the angel figures are all male, the demons are female - all showing breasts, and hooves, and most of them appear to be pregnant - and -- most shockingly -- the angels are stabbing or lancing the demons' pregnant abdomens! This suggests two things to me: firstly, the concept of "slaying your lower nature", and secondly the ritual 'cremation of care', as the angel-men are slaying babies in the wombs of the demons - probably their own offspring - born of a union between the angel and the demon in question - which ties in with child sacrifice to Moloch. It's really quite shocking.

            Upvoated. Great link, lots of good, good info about the art world and how it may tie in to human trafficking. Lots of names you'll already know, but I bet you'll learn something new. I did.
