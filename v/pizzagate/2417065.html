<p>Launched in 2005, this publicly-funded (think Volkswagen) project by Berlin\'s top university hospital calls on pedophiles to undertake a treatment  that helps them control their urges.  More than 7,000 people have sought information on the program which is offered in 11 centers across Germany.  Candidates are those who have already commited abuses but have managed to escape justice.  Other programs deal with convicted pedophiles who have also been issued specific orders to seek medical care.  
</p>
<p>Dr. Beier calls his project &quot;Prevention Project Dunkelfeld&quot;  (PPD).  The term &quot;dunkelfeld&quot; is German for &quot;dark field.&quot;  Their slogan is &quot;You are not guilty because of your sexual desire, but you\'re responsible for your sexual behavior.  There is help!  Don\'t become an offender!&quot;  PPD is grounded on the principle that sexual attraction to children is a medical problem and &quot;not a crime.\'</p>
<p>Over 1 or 2 years, during 2-hour sessions every week, the &quot;patient&quot; is taught to develop strategies to stop himself from acting on his tendencies or from consuming child pornography.  The program also helps the &quot;patient&quot; to acquire a level of empathy towards potential victims which could go towards dissuading him from hurting them.  Scientists from around the world, including countries in North America as well as Switzerland and India, have been watching this project with interest.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, PPD started in 2005 with support from the Volkswagen Foundation.  The German Federal Ministry for Justice has supported it since 2008.  In 2014, PPD was expanded to treat juveniles with sexual interest in children.  
</p>
<p>The Diagnostice and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders-5 differentialtes between pedophilia and pedophilic disorder (when someone acts on the sexual urges or the urges cause significant distress and interpersonal difficulties, the International Classification of Diseases 10 sees it as a sexual preference disorder).  There are significant voices who believe that it ought not to be in the DSM at all but rather viewed as an unchanging part of someone\'s makeup.</p>
<p>The treatments have ranged from some which use a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous to chemical therapies that kill sexual desire altogether.  Most of these approaches come into play only after an offender has been caught.  As of September 2016, 2403 applications were received, 991 assessments were done, and 500 persons were treated in Berlin.  50% had already committed child sexual abuse and 75% admitted to child pornography.  After coordinating the nationwide network in 11 locations, PPD received (from 2011 to September 2016) 7,075 applications, assessed 2,298 persons and offered treatment to 1,264 people.</p>
<p>In November 2016, the German Parliament voted for a legislation to finance specialized treatment services for self-referred pedophilically inclined individuals through the health insurance program.  They can use this service anonymously.  The law has been inforce since January 1, 2017 and is a &quot;worldwide breakthrough.&quot;

<p>Switching over to the US, Elizabeth Letourneau, Ph.D., is involved with 3 &quot;family-focused&quot; research projects.  Letourneau is Director of he Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  In her &quot;Help Wanted&quot; Study, quantitative interviews were conducted with young adults attracted to prepubescent children but who have not commited abuse.  Many of these young adults said they recognized their attraction in adolescence but did not know what to do.</p>
<p>In May of 2017, a study by Letourneau appeared in the journal, &quot;Child Maltreatment,&quot; titled &quot;Preventing the Onset of Child Sexual Abuse by Targeting Young Adolescents with Universal Prevention Programming.&quot;  Her conclusion reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is a serious health problem of national and global concern.  Universal school-based prevention approacahes that aim to deter older children and adolescents from engaging younger children in sexual behaviors have the promise to prevent a sizable portion of CSA in a cost-effective manner.  Existing school-based approaches most often focus on teaching potential victims to protect themselves from abuse, and while these programs are associated with some positive outcomes, it has not been established that they reduce the likelihood of victimization.  More recently, promising programs have addressed peer-on-peer sexual harassment and violence, but these do not address sexual behavior against younger children.  There is a need for school-based prevention programs that target the onset of CSA.  The epidemiology of CSA indicates that young adolescent sexual abuse of younger children is relatively common and transient and frequently motivated by preventable factors.  We should make the necessary investment to design, rigorously evaluate, and disseminate programs that effectively prevent older children from sexually abusing younger children.&quot;</p>
<p>If the above is not a blatant invitation to to accept, promote, and condone deviant behavior, I don\'t know what is.

<p>While researching the Johns Hopkins studies, I came across an organization called the &quot;Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers&quot; (ATSA) with headquarters in Beaverton, GA.  The website claims they are an international, interdisciplinary, non-profit organization &quot;dedicated to making society safer by preventing sexual abuse.&quot;  ATSA encourages sound research, effective practice, informed policy, and comprehensive prevention strategies all designed to create safer communities.  It all just sounds too good to be true...because it is.  It appears to me that this is merely an organization with a facade that is doing absolutely nothing to discourage sexual abuse and more likely than not, encourages it.</p>
<p>ATSA consists of 3,000 members from 20 countries with 25 chapters in the US and 1 in the Netherlands.  It professes its practice standards and guidelines on the website, some of which you cannot access unless you are a member.  A few of the many topics include: Adult Practice Guidelines; Adolescent Practice Guidelines; Report on Children with Sexual Behavior Problems; Sexual Offense Specific Treatment; Civil Commitment of Sexual Offenders; aand Pharmacological Interventions with Adult Male Sexual Offenders.  Members include researchers, treatment providers, corrections officials, attorneys, law enforcement officers, and students.  ATSA claims it has the world\'s largest annual conference and leading educational venue for individuals working on issues related to the research tretament and management of sexual abuse.  Their official journal is &quot;Sexual Abuse&quot; published 8 times a year.</p>
<p>ATSA dates back to the early 1980\'s when a group of Oregon treatment providers, researchers, and other practictioners began meeting each month to discuss assessment methods and treatment options for sexually aggressive adults in Oregon State Hospital and other institutions.  They called themselves &quot;The Association for the Behavioral Treatment of Sexual Aggressives&quot; (ABTSA).  In 1985 they became incorporated, a Board of Directors and standing committees were created, and changed their name to ATSA.  Their first conference was held in 1987 in Newport, OR.</p>
<p>Their 35th conference in 2016 was held in Orlando, FL.  None other than Johns Hopkins Elizabeth Letourneau and cohorts were guest speakers.  The conference\'s focus was &quot;Different Roles, Same Goals: Preventing Sexual Abuse.&quot;  Letourneau presented the argument that child sexual abuse is a preventable public health problem and maintained that focusing on prevention of youth-perpetrated sexual harm is a worthwhile endeavor.  Further discussion focused on addressing needs of adolescents sexually attracted to children where Letourneau once again claimed that subjects reported attempting to seek help but were unable to find any.  She also reported that the subjects\' main struggle was not refrraining from acting on their attraction but rather figuring out how to cope with such an attraction and how to live a happy and healthy life.  The final topic pertained to the impact of sex crime policies on youth and their families.  Key findings by the presenter were that youth who had to register as sex offenders are 4 times more likely to have attempted suicide in the past 30 days and 3 times more likely to be approached by an adult for sex than youth who do not have to register.  Their final point was that caregivers of youth who are required to register, experience an increased average number of negative consequences than those who are not required to register.

            Some people have been able to teach and train snakes or bears to not bit and kill them, but what kind of nut job would risk trusting a dangerous creature??? Pedos can NOT be fixed ever. The only way to stop them is to put them down

            The death penalty for 2nd offenders would solve the problem. Fear can be a great motivator. Their "disability" is a constant menace to others.

            This is all so disingenuous. I work in an adult male correctional facility. I know what the ratio of child sex offenders is to the general population of offenders. I know they have treatment programs available and have for a long time. Do they work? I've heard they aren't very successful. I'm okay with them trying to treat it. What I'm not okay with is them hiding in the medical industry. It's not a true medical condition like schizophrenia. It's a personality issue, like narcissism or sadism. These are not nice people we are talking about. These are people with severe personality defects, ego defects, and empathy defects. The honest truth is only God Himself can help them. Ask Jeffrey Dahmer. They mostly won't humble themselves and admit they are sinners and have blame. They'd much rather hide behind the smokescreen of a "medical condition". It feels nicer and less shameful and if they fuck up, oops...it's just that i have this medical condition you see. And what the hell. Do you notice the part at the end where they're basically talking about how harmful the sex offender registry is to pedophiles? What we're trying to do is prevent more of these pedophiles from being created. Now we have to care about the feelings of the goddamed pedo itself. It's like saying death row is bad for serial killers. No doubt. But they've preyed on the innocent and the time to care about their well being is over with. Death penalty for child sex offenders. It's the only thing that makes sense.

             I agree. But I can't see that being agreed to by lawmakers.  I think we must and should push for it, but if not, we should at least insist on lifetime incarceration with NO parole under any circumstance.  But I agree there is really no turning them around.  None.  Btw, thank you for doing the job you are doing, not many are cut out for it.  Also, for your understanding.  We need more people like you, willing to try to understand the problem.  There really is no other solution.  Unfortunately.  I have always been against the death penalty, but even I must agree.  I am sure they would not be as kind to their victims for many have had their lives taken in the most horrific ways.

              I don't do much in the way of research. I just try to redpill others and encourage y'all, and downvoat shills. I do what little I can. People like you are the real heroes. Mainly I just need to know what's going on in the world. And I pray for you guys! I want God to have y'alls backs! 😁 Yes, I know lawmakers will never agree. I'm just giving my two cents.

               It' hard lately to do the same amount of research we have lost man of our voaters to other subs.  So, there are the same ones here all the time working hard.  Thank you so much for your voats of confidence and prayers.  You don't know how much it helps for you to talk to others.  Each one you convince will help our cause.  Each one is a Voat Disciple. :)

             I’m pretty much in agreement with this. I don’t think the “treatment” attempts are a big deal in and of themselves. The fact that people approached these clinics for help is a sign that these people are concerned with their predispositions. My problem is that I don’t trust the people doing the “treatment” for obvious reasons, and I agree that it’s a behavioral issue and not a “medical” problem as such. They say homosexuality can’t be “cured” either but I don’t really believe that, though I did at one time. The fact is much of this behavior is encouraged socially through various messaging through movies and music and all the rest, and without that social influence, I’m sure the frequency of these behaviors would decrease. An “awareness program” would only be putting thoughts into the heads of impressionable kids and I do not like that idea at all. It’s like sending in the DARE officer to 1st graders. Unless their parents are already junkies you aren’t doing kids that young any favors, only putting new ideas in their heads.

               They won’t get that far. Trump is going to have military tribunals exposing all of this before 2020. Might sound like a stretch still at this point but I firmly believe it all ends soon.

             Looking for connection and am having hard time.  I feel there is a strong chance they are connected.  The family has connections to GHWBush and to Scientology and Mary Kay has sisters living in DC.  Her father had an affair with a student!!!  Read my comments and those of Backsmith  A 3 yr old sibling of Mary K died in pool while under sibling care.  Too many questions.

             Good question.  I knew I heard that surname somewhere.  Need to do some research.

             Looks as though there is a close affiliation with Elizabeth Letourneau and ATSA.  First of all, their goals are exactly the same - prevention of child sexual abuse.  Letourneau contributes often to ATSA's "Child Maltreatment" journal.  Here is one classic example.

             I thought the exact same thing when I saw her name.  There is a massive amount of not-unattractive female teachers who like preying on teenage boys.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm wondering if there is a psychological "break" in there - molest a hetero girl when young, traumatize and stunt emotional development.  She gets married but still thinks she is closer to a teen.  And bingo, the careless life of a teen becomes what she becomes attracted to and voila, she's cheating on the husband (who's probably a creep as well) with a teenage boy.  Just a theory.

              Look at her father.  I believe he was a pedophile.  He had an affair with a student.  I believe Mary K was abused.  She passed it on.  Look at her husband Billy and what they are doing.  Ugh. I am still looking at the connection to Elizabeth.

                This family imo is suspect.  DC Scientology.  The father, patriarch at the head of all this.  Where does Eliz. fit in?  Did she go to school in DC, Did a relative move to the East Coast?  Idk.  funny they are both striving towards the same goal.

                Yep  And her 3 year old brother died in a swimming pool while in the care of Mary  and a sibling.  The father was a pedophile and had an affair  with a student.  I can't even get it all into my head.  I am still trying to connect them to Eliz.

                "The Tampa Police Department also came under scrutiny when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell. John Gillespie, the lead detective who requested the nude photos of Lafave, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting.[14]

                Lafave later attributed her indiscretions to bipolar disorder, which is associated with intense and irregular mood swings, and with hypersexuality and poor judgment during manic episodes.[15] "

                  I had to stop reading.  I truly got sick and dizzy.  Epidemic is an understatement.  There seems to be something at work here. Possibly MK Ultra on some because there are just too many.  Slaps on the wrist and low sentencing.  Idk, this Reeks to me.

                    Yeah, it's hard to stay away for too long.   I may have to stop &amp; rest now.  But it may just be a mini rest of  1 hr.  Will get back to their connection because I strongly believe there is one.

              And a good one.  There has to be some reason we are seeing more of this as of late.  I seem to be hearing about it more and more on the news.  I think they are creating them on purpose.  This is not just occurring on it's own.

            Dear drama queen, one single person trying to sell his services within a large hospital does not represent a whole country. It is good anyway, that there is research.

             This "drama queen" begs to differ.  Germany has set the ball into motion.  The US is following suit. AND you have the name that speaks for itself, Johns Hopkins.  The hospital recently ranked nationwide as #3 out of 4,700.   Now take the Bloomberg School, the only school of public health in the world that has a department dedicated to mental health.  Plus, it has ranked #1 in the nation for more than 20 years, ever since Public Health was added as a ranking category.  Currently, there are more than 50 accredited Public Health schools in the US.  Trust me when I say that any research study coming from JH is taken seriously, especially one coming from Bloomberg.  Finally, I would bet every cent I have that academic researchers all over the globe are very busy these days.

             Finally, you don't need a ton of corroboration in order to change the world to benefit the evildoers.  Do we Voaters not see this on a regular and consistent basis.

              Ben Carson is from Johns Hopkins.  Wonder what he knows.  Believe me that hospital has not been kind in the past.  They did experiments on minorities and the homeless.  Look up Henrietta Lacks.  I don't think that there has been much change , especially behind the scenes.

              I have relatives in Germany but really do not correspond, the woman has deep depression problems.  What the heck is going on over there?  Are we going to act the same way over this?  I hope to God not.  Well they have been trying to get rid of God for decades now.  Trying to get us to not believe.  Now I am wondering if it is wrong not to go to Church.  We do not have to give money.  Just attend.  I have been wondering if at some point, decades from now, if they will not allow us to even follow God.  Kind of like Communism.  No Crosses.  No Blessed Virgin Statues.  I will never stop praying.
