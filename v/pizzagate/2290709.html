Hotdogs and Pizza known to be pedo code for children to rape and sodomize. Subject: RE: Get ready for &quot;Chicago Hot Dog Friday&quot; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html/">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html/</a>. </p>
<p>From the email:
&quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?&quot; </p>
<p>Following this discovery Voat researchers discovered more background on Obama, known pre-election as a &quot;community organizer from Chicago&quot;, and was further linked to PG as he was also was pictured with &quot;friendship&quot; bracelets he shared with Joe Biden (also suspected to be a pedo), children sitting too comfortably his lap, the Alice and Wonderland themed halloween party, visits with James A on the White House logs.  All of this discovery and more documented in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> history, archives, please search for reference/verification if this is new to you .  
</p>
<p>Now, intelligence tips from Q on <a href="https://8ch.net/cbts/res/">https://8ch.net/cbts/res/</a>   92197.html (broken link copy to address bar) brings Obama back to our attention with regard to to the future Obama Presidential Library in Chicago.  First, before more on Obama, for those who don\'t know or doubt, a brief primer on Q Clearance Anon.  
</p>
<p>Q\'s (assumed to be Q Clearance military entity directly working with President Trump) stated purpose for intelligence drops is similar to our purpose here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>: to inform researchers like us to discover and disclose (redpill) our friends and family of the inner workings of the elite to ease our loved ones reaction when the deep state are defeated and people find out the sickness that is at the core of the authority we once trusted. Q has acknowledged in his &quot;drops&quot; (see entire 8 chan CBTS thread catalogue)  that the realization by the masses that a satanic cabal and all forms of corruption (drugs, trafficking, war, greed) would put 99% of Americans in the hospital.  We understand this as we first felt this way when we learned of the Podesta emails, and viewed the JA and friends instragram pictures, and realized the deeply connected evil that was going on at the top of our government for ourselves.  This is our joint mission to help others by reassuring our dear ones that God had this under His control, that people on the side of good have long known and have been fighting tirelessly for these things, and that through crowdsourcing, democracy is actually defeating evil on behalf of anyone still now suffering from SRA or other related abuses under the hands of others in this disgusting system, most especially vulnerable children.  
</p>
<p>The CBTS 8ch thread also plans to join with us here at Voat in the event that the thread at 8chan is under attack, and this notice is posted at the top of every new thread posted there, so we see that these boards really are the new form of discussion and connection on important issues, along with a sparse few media sources (Alex Jones, David Seaman, George Webb, Crowdsource the Truth etc etc) since the MSM has largely failed to bring the needed discourse and connection a free democracy should have from the 4th Estate (media) about important issues like corruption including Child Trafficking.  
</p>
<p>If we are passionate about the safety and security and freedoms of children or justice and good to win over evil, we must broaden our perspective not away from pizzgate, but view it through the lens of understanding, and thus defeating, the elite multi-faceted power structure needed to break this horrific evil.  Q summarizes this easily with a picture that also has formed here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>: a 3 sided pyramid of Saudi Arabia=main source of trafficking, Rothschilds=main source of funding, Soros=main source of fake news and propaganda.  According to Q and other evidence in the news, Saudi Arabia has been neutralized, and we are somewhere in a 10 day struggle behind the scenes, to neutralize the Rothschilds and defeat Soros tactics. Refer to news about the realignment of the Saudi princes, the sealed 1000+ indictments, and &quot;Russiagate&quot; investigation starting to unravel reported in the MSM from Nov 2017 to present as basic evidence for this, though there is much much more. It is being reported that this corruption covers 1.2mm records that will be eventually disclosed to the public in some way, and this is our mission to keep others from harm and maintain peace through any ways we can help inform others of the truth.  <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/15/ig-aims-finish-probe-comey-handling-clinton-spring/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/15/ig-aims-finish-probe-comey-handling-clinton-spring/</a></p>
<p>With that background, my intent is to shine light on Obama and his library as Q is bringing it to our attention and the larger strategy to bring down the deep state cabal behind all of this is aided when we focus on making one realization at a time, and spreading awareness on each topic as we have done since the time of the election in 2016 when <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzgate">v/pizzgate</a> began.  My concern with Obama\'s Presidential library is that is seems to have familiar patterns related to child trafficking, pedos, and other crime including enabling radicalization and the degeneration of  Muslim beliefs about marriage of child brides leading to abuses .  Looking at the articles below, could Obama be planning a new centralized hub of power to continue seeking more &quot;hotdogs and pizza delights&quot; in crime ridden Chicago, to possibly attract children with leisure activities, and provide a front for what he really seeks to do?  This method would be similar to using ping pong games used at Comet Pizza and the basement of the Obama White House to attract children and then using the area,  (like the Dupont Triangle complex in DC, the entire street CPP is on, and Pegasus Museum) to provide for the desires and appetites of politicians while under the premise of Presidential Library activities.  
</p>
<p>The articles below, among other unrelated details, speculate on the purpose of Obama\'s future library, questioning why the library seems to be constructed more for use for children to play than for what presidential libraries are actually for: a source of research and study of presidential service, access to records, and transparency.  Obamas past connections with Clinton and her campaign chair Podesta, who both worked under Obama, are reason enough to consider what might be going on in these future plans for the sake of children, who are our future.  Obama continues to be a controversial figure and elite middleman, along with other politicians, and we should give pause to reflect on his activities with others.  Such activities may seek to threaten our free democracy by individual aspects of Obama and his cohort\'s strategy functioning to perpetuate child trafficking and pedophilia as a hidden foundational practice in the larger scheme of how illegitimate government influences play out on in the power struggle of good vs evil on national and international authority levels.

<p>From Newsmax Article: <em>Bolded by me where relevant</em></p>
<p>&quot;Once completed, the library will include <strong>a play garden for children, outdoor picnic space, basketball courts and a recording studio.</strong> It won\'t have all of the former president\'s documents, letters, and gifts he collected while in office, unlike most presidential libraries, which typically house the early drafts of speeches, legislation and correspondence that researchers and students can sift through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the lack of personal materials, the library <strong>could still hold value</strong> for historians and researchers, according to the <strong>former head of construction and development for former President Bill Clinton\'s</strong> presidential library. Here\'s how <strong>it will be attractive</strong>: through the forums, workshops and programs they conduct,&quot; said James Rutherford, now dean of the William J. Clinton School of Public Service, to the Tribune. &quot;They can <strong>host conferences with administration officials</strong>, discussions on how Obama approached healthcare, how he developed the DACA <strong>(Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)</strong> executive order. That\'s how the center will become a research institution.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Apparently this library won\'t house the usual records, it won\'t be under normal scrutiny or oversight, and according to the article title will be the &quot;<strong>Obama Library More for Children Than a Place for Scholars</strong>.&quot;!?!? What is this...are (((they))) serious?  Please investigate.</p>',

            , this is a great post! If you repost it witha more powerful headline, I will flair it a "Potential Lead". I really like the summary to get people up to speed, but the real juice is your investigative premise: The Kenyan using his library to lure kids. How about a headline like...
           </p>
           <h1>
            Q claims Obama library raided -- but it's been primarily designed  to attract kids? WTF? Let's investigate
           </h1>
           <p>
            Or something like that. Please repost!

             Thank you Vindy!  I know it's crazy, but the same day I posted this 40,000 summary highlighting how

             fits into the larger idea represented on CBTS, Q was blocked out of the CBTS thread!   I know it's only a coincidence, as the whole issue is ripe for change, but what a thrill to live in these times, knowing that evil is lurking, but good is winning...BIGLY from all of our efforts and prayer! :)  Really appreciate it...working hard with a counselor to improve communication so my thoughts can actually make sense to people who don't follow patterns and spiderwebs...lol.  You have encouraged me to try to participate again!  Thanks for all you do here and for leading well in your role!

              An old writing tip: The best stuff usually comes at the end when first getting words down on paper. Most effective final presentation is to put that stuff at the beginning, then build case proving it with points you originally started with.

              And yes, is a great time to be alive!

             This is absolutely false. This is from a code list that was made up after the Podesta emails were released.

            This is absolutely false.  This is from a code list that was made up after the Podesta emails were released.

            Visiting the White House does not equal visiting the President.

             My concern with Obama's Presidential library is that is seems to have familiar patterns related to child trafficking, pedos, and other crime including enabling radicalization and the degeneration of Muslim beliefs about marriage of child brides leading to abuses .

            So dumb!   There's not one crime category where the Crime Rate for Chicago falls within the top 20 cities in the US.  It has high numbers but also a giant population.  It has more people than 15 states.   The University of Chicago is in a safe area.

           <p>
            The records will be digital.   The Paper Records will be under the normal scrutiny or oversight of the National Archives, because the National Archives is retaining control of those records.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scrutiny and oversight in this case has to do with preservation and protection of paper records.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is literally an attempt to manufacture a controversy.  Scholars can go to the National Archive if they need to.

               It's all over the internet, what's the matter w/ you? I'm really thinking that you are irredeemably blue-pilled. Others are convinced you have an agenda, that you're paid, etc. I'm not quite there yet (w/ the being paid that is ... and I'm a tin foil hat wearing kinda dude) ...

               But, once upon a time, Superman was flying along and he saw Lois Lane fall off a tall building. Superman (being the cool dude that he was) swooped down and snatched her up. Superman says to Lois Lane, don't worry I got you. Lois Lane says to Superman, "You've got me? Who's got you?"

               Don't worry, the governments got you. But who's got the government? Don't be naive. The three branches have had over 200 years of infidels running the place. All it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing. It stinks above ground.
