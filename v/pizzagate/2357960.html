<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/12/four-for-friday-forget-me-not.html">CDAN did a blind</a> and I\'m pretty sure he\'s talking about David Copperfield.  If I\'m correct, it means that David Copperfield has trafficked young girls from Asia (while Epstein was concentrating on US and Europe).  He housed them in a dormitory next to the main house on his island at Musha Cay.  Wealthy businessmen would pay handsomely to go on to the island and rape these teens and tweens.  
</p>
<p>I will go through each of Enty\'s main points and show evidence pointing to Copperfield being the \'A lister\':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...  one of his best friends at the time was this now convicted child rapist/molester with the powerful friends. Much like his best friend, our A lister also owned an island and knew he could have something similar. While the friend focused his attention on the US and Europe, our A lister focused his attention on Asia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Epstein is the \'friend who also owned an island\', Lolita Island.. Copperfield \'knew he could have something similar\'.  Copperfield focussed his attention on Asia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On his trips to Asia, he met with some people who specialized in tourists wanting children or young teens. Our A lister arranged for a group of 20 of these teens to get visas to &quot;study&quot; in the country where his island is still located. The government of that country makes a lot of money from the A lister and also had many of their own government ministers at his home on the island.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bahamian government (you will see from exposethecriminals\' post) has ads which are pretty sketchy. I have no doubt that the Bahamian government turns a blind eye to the trafficking of girls while they themselves profit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The teen and tween girls were set up in a dormitory adjacent to the main house. Then, our A lister made bookings with Asian companies for his services. The thing is though, his services for years were one price and then beginning that year about a decade ago, his fees quadrupled. The difference was what men paid to visit his island. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For close to 18 months or so, our A lister was making millions of dollars a month. Just a ton of money he was making so men could rape these tweens and teens. Every two or three nights, the boat carrying 10-15 of these men would pull up to the dock and then be replaced three nights later with another group of men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copperfield is listed as one of the wealthiest entertainers in the world.  I don\'t think he made all his money from magic tricks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, our A lister got cocky. He started filming the tweens and teens and sending out little clips and photos of them across the internet to make the dollars flow even faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-copperfield/fbi-raids-magician-david-copperfield-in-vegas-idUSN182550820071019">In 2007 the FBI raided Copperfield\'s warehouse \'museum\'. In that raid they found $2 million in cash. They also seized a computer hard drive  and a memory chip from a digital camera system. Reported at the time was the fact the FBI had found a lot of child porn.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He also met a woman who he thought would be into that kind of thing and invited her to come to the island so they could explore together. She came and then almost crashed his whole world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5341857/civil-complaint-against-david-copperfield">This is Lacey Carroll, who was picked out of an audience and told to wait backstage for Copperfield.  He lured her to the island. Upon her arrival, he stole her passport and then raped her, threatening to kill her. When she escaped and returned to the US she immediately informed the authorities.     Copperfield held her head under water and told her \'that\'s what you will get if you ever tell anyone\'.</a>

<p>She went to the feds. The next thing you know, our A lister has all his cash seized and they find evidence of the porn and money laundering and he knows he is going to jail for a very very long time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it was Lacey Carroll who went to the feds and they raided his warehouse finding porn and money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse for him, all of the men who had paid in advance to visit the island complained to the companies they paid money to. Those companies were also mad because the agreement they had in place to supply teens for money was now canceled.
Our A lister was looking at decades in jail. </p>
<p>Then, the most fortunate set of circumstances came to be. Some new people came to power and they decided to look the other way. They made everything just go away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know who came to power in 2007. Whoever it was helped him and made all the allegations go away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They even managed to make the woman who turned on the A lister look like a loon.</p>

            David Copperfield aka David Kotkin
           </p>
           <p>
            Kotkin is known for a 'special magic act' for private parties, especially in Las Vegas. He is known for 'making people disappear,' and using a myriad of props including torture chairs and other 'magic' props used to torture and kill people. Kotkin is known for getting many of his customers at his magic show at MGM Grand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amazing how Kotkin keeps dodging the bullet and his victims do not see justice. And these are the ones that made it out alive...

            <em>
             In 2006, the famed magician bought the 100-acre island of Musha Cay and its surrounding chain for $50 million, and with $40 million and five years of remodeling, made it into what he’s dubbed “the most magical vacation destination in the world.” Copperfield found the island after apparently drawing crisscrossing lines between Easter Island and Stonehenge, and the Pyramid of Giza and the Pyramid of the Sun in the Yucatan, and determining the exact spot at which the two intersected. The main resort island is actually one of 11 islands, all owned by the illusionist, in what’s been named Copperfield Bay. The others boast names like Forbidden Island, Enchanted Island, Secret Cay, and Imagine Island—incorporating 40 secluded beaches in all.

             That made me think of those SICK rumored aristocratic "hunting parties" chasing naked children through the woods....but on the island they call it a "treasure hunt".....Good God I hope not.

              A Seattle woman has accused magician David Copperfield of luring her to his remote private island in the Caribbean, raping her repeatedly, and threatening to kill her if she told anyone. Her complaint reads like a horrifying pulp novel.
             </li>
             <li>
              The accuser says she attended a Copperfield show in Kennewick, Wash., two years ago and was pulled from the crowd to participate in the act. After the show, Copperfield's assistant told her to stick around to meet the magician. She was ushered backstage, where her picture was taken with Copperfield and she was asked her to fill out a questionnaire. Copperfield's assistant explained that Copperfield owned a private island and a resort, and often had "promotional work" for models to appear in brochures he produced. Copperfield called her seven months later and invited her to attend a "promotional opportunity" on the island. The woman's complaint says she was told there would be other guests on the island, and that she couldn't bring her boyfriend because there wouldn't be room for him.
             </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              she walked to the beach to try to find a way off the island, but Copperfield tracked her down.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             <a href="http://images.gawker.com/18k4ix67n3apspng/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_470.png">
              This is just a taste of what you'll get if you tell anyone
             </a>
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              After that alleged assault, the woman says she went to take a shower, and Copperfield came after her again
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             All in all, the victim says, she spent three days and two nights trapped with Copperfield on the island. When she returned to Seattle, the complaint says, she went "directly" to the sexual trauma center at Harborview Hospital and filed a complaint with the Seattle Police Department. The Seattle cops called in the FBI because the alleged rapes took place outside the U.S., and the Seattle Times says the U.S. Attorney's office is deciding whether to file criminal charges against Copperfield.
            </p>
            <p>
             For his part, the illusionist has released a statement through his attorneys calling the victim a liar and saying that while on the island, "she sun-tanned in her bikini listening to her IPod, jet-skied with island visitors, had playful conversations with guests, and swam on island beaches, day after day."

               I'm thinking in addition to human trafficking, he is involved in drug trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               He has access to moving around large freight on airplanes for his acts. Imagine, many of his props have hidden compartments, how easy would it be for them to hide drugs and even people in his props and fly them anywhere.

                I am curious about how customs treats him. Inside the country, i do not think he would be inspected by customs or law enforcement. So you could smuggle drugs from vegas to some other part of the country, no problem, via copperfield.
               </p>
               <p>
                Would he get scrutinized in another part of the world?

                 Well, his private warehouse in Las Vegas that was raided in 2007 was very big, worth at least several million. Given his large operation, I wouldn't be surprised if he or his company owns planes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In my experience private planes do not get heavily scrutinized. Persons running drug operations like Copperfield will only do so if they have the whole thing 'wrapped up,' meaning they choose a very small airport, or one where they have their own network of people working at. All it takes is one or two paid off airport workers to help make things 'easy' for them. One notorious airport for drug smuggling I've read about recently is in Aruba.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Copperfield is not stupid nor is the group he is part of that does this trafficking. They do many dry runs, develop many contacts and recruit people to tow their line. They do not do things where there is a possibility of being caught, they are very meticulous.

                  The vegas connection means organized crime. This makes sense in a lot of ways. it also ties into the SEIU and the drug cartels. This would also tie into the Clintons. How many diplomatic shows has copperfield done? How many shows for politicians?

            Makes me wonder about Marshall Sylver.... Syler Enterprise.
Passion, Proft and Power 
Seminars... also on Sally Jessie Raphael show he gave all the women in the audience... including viewers at home the opportunity to have an orgasim by merely touching a subjects knee... makes you wonder!!!!
Why was that important?
I think further investigation is in order.

                Copperfield is trying to get out of this straightjacket with the help of the MSM and the #metoo movement.  They pick an incident from 20-30 years ago and label it 'inappropriate contact'.  He issues a mea culpa, and goes right back to his rape island.  This has to stop.  When red pilling people, we must tell them about #metoo being a cover for child rape and abuse.

                and we all need to blast the comment sections on the Copperfield cover-up that is running everywhere today.  Copperfield has been tweeting about the past incident in question.  LET'S GET HIM !!

                   It is chilling alright.  Many on this board though would not find it chilling.  We have racists galore on here.  I find it as you do, chilling and beyond racist.  The people that come to this island use these dark skinned children because they are worthless to them.  Garbage is how they see them.  Worse yet, is someone like Oprah dumping on her own race.  I think I am going to cry.  Those beautiful little children.

            this is what celebrities, politicians, bankers and businessmen that can afford to buy an island do and they fly their victims in and out with their private jets ..... and if they dont own an island then they hang out with the people who do ..... the pedophile elite are all connected and the big picture is more gruesome than anybody not aware of their lifestyle can imagine .... the victims cant report because they are either already dead or they have been threatened with death or everyone they report the crimes to are corrupt and part of the ring

             I can't help but think Seattle was the wrong place for Carroll to report him, given their pedo mayor. We should make a list of island owners - Epstein (obvs), Copperfield, Branson... Yacht owners too

              There is another one I just saw on this expose on the house of Saud...Its a brit that was taking bribes from the Sauds and he owns an Island too..As soon as I heard the details of that situation and the players involved I had a feeling he too had his proverbial hand in the cookie jar of trafficking. I bet he does.

                  It looks like someone has made a post about the Al Yamamah arms deal here which is where he was taking the bribes from the Saudis. Interesting...I think pretty much if you have a private island you are most likely involved in some shady shite.

                   Barely a trace of Austin online, he's mentioned on island's Wikipedia page. Also named here re Saudi connection, seems like he's in trouble with Serious Fraud Office

              chrissy teigen and john legend are in this too they practically live on yachts .... theres so much about her .... she was a prostitute on the yachts ' yacht girl ' and cdan said she only ended up with john legend because the guy she was with didnt pay her as much as they agreed on. ... and i am also very suspicious that john actually broke up with her and she said you're not breaking up with me and they stayed together so i'm guessing she's got the goods on him to blackmail him into staying together ' as a couple ' she just made a guest appearance on amy schumer too so i'm guessing schumer has been introduced to the elite cabal pedophile lifestyle. dave chappelle in his latest netflix special more or less says schumer and key and peele sold their souls to take over from him

                its not what you know in hollywood or the music industry .... its who you know and how low you will go. the stars can be replaced. the talent is everywhere. if you want to be a star you have to play the game and get on the casting couch and go to satanic rituals and shut your mouth and do as you're told. its a huge mind fuck and thats what chappelle is hinting at now. he's telling stories in his stand up now that paint a picture of lies deceit and total grifters running the game thats why he turned down 50 million dollars. they get these kids hooked on cocaine and introduce them to satanic rituals and prostitute them out to impress their friends while the stage mothers turn a blink eye. i will never think of poltergiest the same way knowing that heather orourke was being raped both on and off the set by spielberg and his pedophile mates.

              "What are those?" I asked. The mannequins pinned up there like human creepy-crawlies made me think of the dark butterfly in our room.
             </p>
             <p>
              "They're incredibly rare life-size models," Copperfield answered.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Models?" Raf asked, turning slowly to look at M.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Around the turn of the last century," Copperfield said, "it was illegal for artists to hire real-life models, so they used articulated lay figures like those. I even have one that belonged to Cézanne."
             </p>
             <p>
              Watching the models dangling from the wall, I remembered reading something about a warehouse he owned in Las Vegas that was recently raided by the FBI during their investigation of the alleged rape: entry requires tweaking a mannequin's nipple.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other weird contraptions flitted across the screen. "Initiation devices," Copperfield clarified.
             </p>
             <p>
              "What sort of initiations?" I asked.
             </p>
             <p>
              "You know, trick chairs, paddle machines that whack you in the butt, novelty electroshock games, kind of benign hazing things like that. I also have tons of ray guns. You've gotta come out to Vegas and see my warehouse. It's huge. I have a whole room full of ventriloquial dummies."

            Wow. I ad never heard any of this before. 18 months ago, I would have dismissed it as sensational rubbish. Thank you for the substantial links. I will follow up and get informed on this. Let justice be done. Pray for Lacey, right? Dang!

             We need to keep communicating, talking, effectively sharing.
The Awakening is underway and spreading, but the powerful, wicked forces are determinedly pushing back.
Keep. Fighting!
