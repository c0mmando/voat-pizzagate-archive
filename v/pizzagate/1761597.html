</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adopted Children</strong>
- Maloney and his partner, Randy Florke, have 3 adopted children. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;Their son, Jesus, 14, whom they adopted when he was 3 1/2, had just gone back to his second year of boarding school, in a New Hampshire town not far from the one where Mr. Maloney grew up.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Four months after the two met -- Mr. Maloney was on the advance team scouting New York for the Democratic convention that year and Mr. Florke was working for the decorator Juan Pablo Molyneux -- Jesus appeared. He was the grandson of Mr. Molyneux\'s chauffeur; Mr. Florke had been told of the man\'s worries about the boy, whose parents were battling drug addiction. Mr. Florke asked if he could help out one day. Soon, Jesus was spending weekends with Mr. Maloney and Mr. Florke. When Jesus\'s mother died, they adopted him.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;One night in 1998, Mr. Maloney was in India, at a state dinner with the president, when he received a cellphone call, intricately patched through Air Force One. Mr. Florke had seen a house in Harlem and, well, he\'d bought it. \'\'I said, \'Uh, it\'s not really a good time to talk,\' \'\' Mr. Maloney said. \'\'This is sort of the pattern. He pretends I\'m part of the decision, but he\'s gone ahead and done it anyway. This is how Daley arrived. I was in Los Angeles, and I got a phone call. She was just 5 days old, and Randy said, \'What do you think, I don\'t want to do this without you.\' And it turned out later he\'d adopted her on the spot.\'\'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/UTBgi">http://archive.is/UTBgi</a></p>
<p><strong>Houses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The couple has renovated at least 11 homes.</li>
<li>House #1: A farmhouse.</li>
<li>House #4: Near Dupont Circle.</li>
<li>House #11: E. 28th apartment</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Randy Florke</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maloney\'s partner is Randy Florke, a designer and entrepreneur. His company is The Rural Connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;In 1994, Mr. Florke opened the Rural Collection, a store on Perry Street from which he sold the chipped-paint, country-style furniture of his native Iowa. Jesus took his naps in the whitewashed drawers of the old dressers. Mr. Maloney, who post-convention had spent six months working in Little Rock, came back to New York and joined Wilke, Farr and Gallagher, a law firm; Mr. Florke and Mr. Maloney started looking for a house in Sullivan County.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Florke was a former model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randy Florke starred in a relaity show with his family titled &quot;My Flipp\'n Brother.&quot;

            Excellent research! Thank you. There is absolutely no coindences when it comes to anyone involved with the Podestas and the Clintons. The associations between so many fricking people is sickening!

            Interesting. Just watched Youtube video last night of compilation of news stories regarding Terry Reed and Mena, Arkansas etc. I had Mahoney's name down under a possible good guy. So I'm going to guess somehow they compromised him or got blackmail on him at some point. Very interesting.

              Oh I def see that now!!!!! - he's a wolf in sheep's clothing ... The worst of the worst I think are the people who "support" and voice one thing when in actuality THEY are the predators. The "White Helmets" and "Peace Keepers"  and it makes it difficult to challenge them &amp; is one of the things that brings tears to my eyes. Thinking you're being rescued when you are actually in greater danger

            I looked at a lot of google images. I'm not sure if that who's sitting next to Podesta but they do have similarities.  Definitely the hairline.

            some years ago my wife and I looked into adoption... we found it very expensive and also very intrusive. We didn't continue.

           <p>
            but for the politically connected, they can adopt a 5 day old "on the spot"... no corruption there.

            Well, well, well.  Sean Maloney shows up in the Podesta Emails posted by Wikileaks.   First one I clicked on is a fundraising email entitled "MY FRIEND SEAN."  It was sent by Bill Clinton sent  to John Podesta on October 27, 2012, in an effort to get Sean Maloney elected to Congress (linked here:

            You know I believe in arithmetic.  The numbers show Democrats are being outspent on the airwaves.  And the more money we have to fight back, the better chances we have to win.
           </p>
           <p>
            My friend Sean Patrick Maloney's district is being downright flooded with false attack ads from those GOP Super PACs.  If Sean's going to win, we have to stand up and help him fight back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sean's campaign is making its final ad buy decisions right now.  Will you help him finish strong?
           </p>
           <p>
            Donate $20 or whatever you can to Sean's campaign so he can beat back Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers and every other GOP Super PAC &gt;&gt;

            No one ever said elections are easy.  But our country deserves better leaders than these Tea Party Republicans in Congress. We simply can't afford a return to the same old, top-down policies that got us in trouble in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why we need to elect Sean to the House.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please donate $20 or more before Sean's final ad buy deadline &gt;&gt;

            Good work. What does the comment about the hairline mean? You think he has an impersonator? That's certainly possible, since they are everywhere, but I'm doubtful.

                Who's the guy directly across from Podesta? Green flannel and glasses? Has a lot of facial features similar to Podesta. I've seen this picture before but didn't pay much attention besides the girl and how she's holding her hands- she seems very uncomfortable
