<p>I listen to a variety of podcasts and most of them seem to at least acknowledge something is funny. Some of these people aren\'t exactly stupid and are considered the elite of modern thinking. Since I heard this, I\'ve been seriously questioning how deep pizza gate actually goes.</p>
<p>What I think we need to create is a list of people that have come out and quickly shot down this with out any actual reading or defense. Dig through and find pod-casters/celebrities/intellectuals that have came out and actually called it fake news, not people who are on the sidelines untill more information has come out.</p>
<p>The person I am speaking of is Sam Harris. I\'ve heard him twice, in two different podcasts now, brush this off saying it\'s fake news.</p>
<p>Now, to Sam\'s defense, he said paraphrased, &quot;Nobody is trafficking kids through comet ping pong, this is fake news&quot;</p>
<p>While Sam might be right, this just seems to be some sort of Genie/Bill Clinton use of diversion.</p>
<p>Yes, the Ping pong story might of been put there so we focus our efforts on it. It is most likely not true about comet, that still does not mean there isn\'t a HUGE operation going on that does not involve CPP. Which he never actually mentions or even tries to dig in. This, even if I am horribly wrong, sounds fishy and rubs me the wrong way. Specially for Sam who is capable of looking at information. No mention of hidden dialect in emails either.</p>
<p>This list isn\'t for demonizing, it\'s for watching. The more connections we have to look at, the better job we can do. I don\'t know if Sam fucks kids, but he sure does not seem to care that it\'s going on and made a point to say its fake multiple times.</p>
<p>So, I am nominating Sam Harris for the list of people that called Pizzagate fake news.</p>

            Yeah, I wish there was better photos of the plates or a leaked version of the menu, but I've watched a lot of videos about this gala and this is the most comprehensive video so far. Although, I haven't looked at anything about previous years' MOCA galas, so maybe that would be a good place to go from here.

            Did you watch the video? He talks about it a few times and the plates are more visible. I think it's pretty obvious from the video except for the walnuts. It's really too difficult to see if that's what they are, but it appears to be so.

            It sounds fucking weird, but with out a purpose in life, we are destined to die.  Sam seems to be trying to take away our belief structures by using logic.  We WILL kill ourselves eventually if we don't have anything to live for, while the jew's keep raking in Nobel prizes and have large committed families. This is the slow but inevitable destruction of western civilization.

            The first time I heard him say it, my throat knotted up a bit and I just took it.  The 2nd time he did it, I was wondering if he fucked kids.

            I don't know if i can support his podcast anymore.  At the same time, while he's not spending his time defending pedophiles, he does have a very brilliant mind and is pleasurable to listen to.

             Did you know Bryan Callen admits to being molested? He said it more than once on JRE years before all of this broke. He gets frantic when people bring up pizzagate. He got real pissed at Eddie Bravo.

              It really sucks that a event that you have no control over might dictate who you are attracted to for the rest of your life.  At the same time, you need to recognize that what you want, others feel you should pay a ultimate price for.  Even people in prison that have killed many people feel this way towards them.  If he admits to being molested, there is almost no question when you add up his reaction.  Lock him up.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The pope excused himself for using terminology that some might find repellent. “I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into – no offence intended – the sickness of coprophilia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true,” he said. “And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He also spoke of the danger of using the media to slander political rivals. “The means of communication have their own temptations, they can be tempted by slander, and therefore used to slander people, to smear them, this above all in the world of politics,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “They can be used as means of defamation. No one has a right to do this. It is a sin and it is hurtful.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Disinformation was the greatest potential harm the media could cause, he said, because “it directs opinion in only one direction and omits the other part of the truth”.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So no, Pope Francis said nothing about Pizzagate; his comments could just as easily be used against The NY Times, The Sun, or CNN. Gossip and slander/libel are hurtful activities and are certainly wrong; there are lots of ways to punish guilty people without spreading lies about the innocent or constantly dwelling on the negative.  Yes, the people behind these pedo scandals should be drawn and quartered, but if all you do is dwell on things like that 24/7, it will destroy you as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also remember that the Pope comes from Argentina, and lived through some incredibly violent times in that country, where the media was a full on propaganda machine and tool of the dictatorship.

            <p>
             People that aren't nessessarly doing the kid fucking themselves, but protecting people who are, which the Catholic church is famous for doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Should people who protect Pedophiles be considered pedo's themselves in some sort of way?  Is it deserving to be on here?

              If you look at the documentation, most of the cases presented from the 1950's - 1980's were actually brought before law enforcement, who told the bishops to handle it; the church then responded with the common practice of the time, which was to move them "away from the situation" in the assumption that a change of scenery would change their behavior (obviously, we understand the behavior better now).
             </p>
             <p>
              In the couple of the cases where there was an actual cover-up (more likely than not for PR reasons), then obviously those involved should be punished as well.  Popes Benedict and Francis have been forceful (Francis has gone off about it a couple of times) in their condemnation of all of those involved, as was Christ when He said "it would be better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea".

                There is a ton of documentation, from the John Jay report to Catholic historians writing about it; believe me when I say that Catholics are generally more pissed about it than non-Catholics.  The way I know that both Popes are absolved is that, because the Church is so big, there are people who can't stand one or the other and would happily point out any involvement.

             It is widely believed, not just by me, that CPP was to take your gaze off what was really going on and make US, the people against pedophilia look like idiots.  The staged a fake shooting and had him on many nightly news stations, all spouting the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our eye's are not on CPP anymore.  Although CPP MIGHT have a role in it, it is not what we are really after.  Let's not try to eat one another here.  I was not trying to hose it down persay, but the general movement that pizzagate has taken does not take CPP that serious anymore.  The people who run the place are more interesting and tell a far greater story than what the media came up with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I am not coming up with any list..  These are proven people in most cases, or at best people that MIGHT have connections with it and me making it has no baring on if the list is true or not.  I am trying my hardest to make sure we have good reasons to put the people on the list before they go on, but I will never deny adding anybody unless there is no evidence or merely just a hunch they fuck kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you think my list is bad, then submit your own names of people and they will get added.  There is no reason to not trust what WE as a community are creating, not just I.

            Do you think it would be a good idea to add a list of people possibly affected by pizzagate?  Like Macaulay Culkin, 	Corey Feldman and Corey Haim?
           </p>
           <p>
            Corey Feldman admits it is going on, along with Elijah Wood:

            These people say great things and they need our support, how ever we can give it to them.  Maybe just blaming people won't work for everybody, I do think listening to people that are on the inside are worth listening too.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also another list that we should be making too, people coming out against it like Roseanne  Barr:

               Funny that you pay thousands of dollars for such a generic dinner. Guess the majority of what they were paying for was the weird attendants like the ones sticking their heads up through the tables, and probably the after party. I watched a few really good videos about this dinner party, but now I can't find them.

                  It is funny sure, but if you know this is what they actually do, it gets a darker "secret in plain sight" angle, he is in on it 100% like actually visiting the tunnels and going to the high rituals deep, just check more youtube for real, not only voat, we dont have an specific place where everything is connected, there is many where you find important pieces,

                  </a>
                  , vimeo, youtube, facebook, twitter, instagram , there are many many more, for the ones trully trully obsessed like me it is a bit frustrating to find many who look in only on one of those places exclusively, but I think it will all come out at the end, already unstoppable, plus, IM on the case

                   That is what I am ultimately relying on.  If we can compile a list that does not look like trash and has very little "conspiracy", it looks better for us.  I also am holding onto this belief that, they are all going down eventually and we will get to see what is happening, list or not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But I think our job of right now is to not reach and take the obvious and stick with the obvious.  This way we can never look foolish and nobody can discredit even a single thing.  That will be powerful in the end.

                    I see we agree on most things, the difference is that I think the only thing that will convince the ones who dismiss the info is a huge number of people, and how do you do that? I think that you do that by spreading awareness of anything related and hoping to reach as many people as possible, make them google the term at least one time, encounter one doubt on a comment section, and go from there on their own journey of discovery, the only way true believers are made is this way, not by making a thesis, I think, though there is place in this world for your stuff, thanks for what you do, you deserve pussy for sure.

                     I just took a line from Neil Tyson.  Focus on whats real.  Your reputation is on the line for every conspiracy you entertain.  So, since I am already knee deep in conspiracy, what's real seems like even more of a priority.

              I saw her there, the outer dark video confirmed it for Pamela as far as Im concerned, Madona is obviously head deep into it too, Dan Schneider, the drummer from blick 182, the "astronaut" from n'sinc,  james franco and simon cowel are the ones I know for sure use the symbolism on everything they do and also have the connections with the CIA

               Have they all came out, with video evidence or some new's interview saying specifically it is fake news?  I will add them too the list right now, if anybody has conflicting information I will be updating it though.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's pretty safe to say we are all going to be a bit saddened by the amount of people that are doing this, Sam Harris was a huge hit too me.  I love the guy deeply and think he is one of the best minds in the world.  It would be beyond disappointing to find out he is or is protecting child fuckers.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will not be adding the Drummer, Lance bass , James Franco or Simon Cowel.  Not with out more evidence they are against this or pushing the fake news agenda.

                 I know it sounds dumb but Seth Rogen's joke in this podcast about eating humans jarred with me, although maybe I'm spending too much time in this subverse (at 54.15):

                 Having symbolism isn't the same as out-right denying it and calling it fake news.  The words people use to discredit Pizzagate are important.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No, I've not seen Sausage party, but can you provide a clip or some info besides movie people using symbolism?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't think we need to add the Catholic Church, it's just common knowledge they are child fuckers, but I will add the Pope on for good measure.

                     Is the odd thing about the video the "They", because it's only a woman in the room.  That's the slightly odd thing about this, the baby carrot joke just sounds like one of their jokes.

                     The big reason why I am not adding it yet is because for ever single person we get wrong, we look incrementally more stupid.  So EVEN IF they are part of it, with no good evidence, I don't want to post it.

                     I hope you appreciate me being careful instead of being mad I won't add people to the list.  If we dig up something worth while, I have no issues adding them.

                      I get what you mean, sure, if your goal is to change minds you dont want to get nothing wrong, or the least possible. you can add franco later when it becomes obvious to you too, or when he slips and says something too incriminating, one thing they do in videos is to put normal images over audios of torture, look for this in the shows and movies made by the people involved, kids begging not to die, and things of that kind
