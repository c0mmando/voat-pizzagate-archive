              THE DUTROUX AFFAIR
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I will begin in Belgium, with a case known as the Dutroux affair. This case is important because it illustrates how investigations can be undermined by a cabal able to place its members in crucial positions of power, and how powerful people can be implicated in abusing children. The Dutroux affair is was covered extensively by the mainstream media,
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/16/news/16iht-brussels.2.t.html?pagewanted=all">

              HUGE 4, NY TIMES
             </a>
             news in Belgium, where 350,000 people took the streets to protest the handling of the case, known as the famous
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">
              White March
             </a>
             , from a nation of just 10 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case begins in 1995, when multiple young girls began disappearing around the area of Bertrix. Young girls had been disappearing in this area for a couple of years but the BOB (equivalent of the FBI) was unable to develop any solid leads. A breakthrough was made when a suspicious white van was reported, and the police were able to trace it to Marc Dutroux, a known pedophile. Dutroux had been released from prison just a few years earlier, after serving a third of his sentence, despite reservations among those involved in the hearing and his own mother, who had warned the parole board that he would certainly cause harm again
             <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3522367.stm">
              5, BBC
             </a>
             . It was also revealed that Dutroux, though unemployed and receiving welfare from the state, owned seven homes and lived quite lavishly
             <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4422016/#.UW5SDyc3uqY">
              6, NBC
             </a>
             , from his involvement in selling children and child porn. It turns out that his mother was right, and Dutroux was responsible for the recent abductions. Girls as young as 8 reportedly starved to death in a makeshift dungeon in his basement, after months of sexual abuse
             <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/28/childprotection.dutroux">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The horrible transgressions committed by Dutroux are widely available knowledge and thoroughly documented, and though disturbing, are not important enough to focus on this case. Now, I will attempt to highlight the incompetence of the investigating police, and the subsequent cover-up of evidence by the state. Police had investigated Dutroux multiple times without any arrests. Once, they entered his home and witnessed the outside of a makeshift dungeon in his basement, while two girls were being held and starved inside. They even reported hearing voices, though they said they believed Dutroux's story that the voices were coming from the street outside
             <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/18/court-keeps-convicted-pedophile-killer-marc-dutroux-in-prison-in-belgium/">
              8, FOX NEWS
             </a>
             . Police ignored a tip from an informant, who said that Dutroux offered him between 3,000 and 5,000 dollars to kidnap young girls
             <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/dutroux/evil_1.html">
              9, CRIME LIBRARY
             </a>
             . Again and again, police failed to act on information, or acted with complete incompetence. Incredibly, Police had in their possession a video tape of Dutroux constructing the makeshift dungeon in one of his basements, and would have saved the lives of two girls who were being tortured while the police held on to the evidence, had they viewed the video tape and acted on it

            </p>
            <p>
             By September 1996, the official body count had reached 8, and public outrage over police incompetence mounted

             </a>
             Why had a known pedophile been released so early from his original prison term, and allowed to terrify a country while the police stumbled about, seemingly complicit in the carnage?
            </p>
            <p>
             When the case transferred from the police to the courts, the coverup became much more egregious. The lead prosecutor, Jean-Marc Conorrette, was dismissed from the case, which drew huge criticism from across the nation
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/15/world/belgian-hero-dismissed.html">
              12, NY TIMES
             </a>
             . Conorette became a hero because it was his initiative that led to the police actually finding two girls in Dutroux's captivity. He also was instrumental in finding the bodies of four more girls. Conorette would later break down in tears in court while describing the death threats he received when he was still involved with the investigation
             <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1456107/Judge-tells-of-murder-plots-to-block-Dutroux-investigation.html">

             Fuel to the fire would be added when a highly regarded childrens activist, Marie France Botte, claimed that prosecutors were sitting on a politically sensitive list of high profile customers of Dutrouxs thousands of video tapes
             <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-02/news/mn-39974_1_death-penalty">

            </p>
            <p>
             Marc Verwilghen, the Flemish parliamentarian who became the most popular politician in the country after leading the inquiry into Dutroux, claimed that many in the Belgian establishment, including heads of government, refused to cooperate, and sought to stifle and ridicule his report. He claimed that magistrates and police were officially told to not answer certain questions, in what he described as a 'characteristic smothering operation'. He was further quoted as saying 'For me, the Dutroux affair is a question of organized crime'.
