<p>It looks like my theory is starting to stand on it\'s own now: Tuscon appears to be a recreation of the Comet Ping Pong false flag with Meyer playing the role of Edgar M. Welch.  The added bonus was going to be draw Sawyer into this mess, hopefully discrediting him.  Most likely, this was a real trafficking site.  Was this &quot;event&quot; cover to destroy the site?  Or was the entire event staged in order to draw in Sawyer?  In either case, V4CR is not involved in Tuscon even in any way that I can tell.

<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&quot;The founder of the homeless advocacy group, Veterans on Patrol, who uncovered an alleged sex trafficking camp in Tucson, Arizona last week is misleading the public about evidence he claims to have found on the encampment, a former Navy SEAL who investigated the scene warns.</p>
<p>As the Gateway Pundit reported, Veterans on Patrol founder, Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer, stumbled upon a camp last Tuesday where he found trees with wrist restraints, children’s clothing, pornographic material, dozens of boxes of brunette hair dye, sex lubrication, a baby crib, a stroller, an outdoor bathroom, children’s dolls and a 5 feet tall underground septic tank that Meyers has described “as being impossible for a child to escape from.”</p>
<p>But Meyer, who has a history of inserting himself in the center of controversy, sparked national outrage with claims that he found the corpse of a child near the camp and a child’s skull.</p>
<p>According to the Tucson Police Department and Craig “Sawman” Sawyer, a former SEAL Team One sniper and founder of Vets4ChildRescue, who investigated the camp, there was no child’s body found.  The skull was that of an adult and was found 20 miles away from the encampment.</p>
<p>Meyer contacted Sawyer via a third party the evening he discovered the camp, claiming there were children on the premises and that he needed assistance to secure them from cartel. But when Sawyer arrived, armed for confrontation, there were no children present on the site.</p>
<p>Sawyer published a video on YouTube Friday night, warning that Meyer is sensationalizing “the very real problem” of child sex trafficking in the United States with false claims.</p>
<p>There may very well have been child trafficking taking place on the camp, Sawyer maintains, but there is no physical proof– no dead bodies, no perpetrators, no children, no blood – of criminal activity.</p>
<p>“The circumstantial evidence at the site suggests there is something more than just a homeless camp. But in the end, there was no physical evidence of a crime,” he says. “Child trafficking is a real problem and it’s a big problem. Just because this site was sensationalized doesn’t meant the problem doesn’t exist. Blowing things out of proportion and exaggerating doesn’t help legitimate organizations or law enforcement to vet the problem or save our children. Our organization has nothing to do with the sensationalism surrounding this site and we are not associated with Veterans on Patrol in anyway.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, large portions of this story were then blown out of proportion,” he continued. “There were over 20 officers and command staff involved in the investigation. The claim that TPD was not there and did not conduct an investigation is false. The claim that there were children on the site is false. The claim that condoms were found on the site is false. The claim that there was a bloody knife found on the site is false. The claim that there was a shallow grave found on the site is false. The claim that a bone sticking out of the ground was found on the site is false. The claim that a human body was found on the site is false. The skeletal remains were found 20 miles away, in Morena, Arizona, not south Tucson.&quot;</p>

              I don't care if you believe or not! Good advice is good advice. Even if Q is a LARP, the Q phenom has red pilled a lot of people and made people themselves dig! My bio is biblical and my photo is Michael the Arch-Angel. I believe in a God so powerful He can even use false messengers to get His truth out in spite of themselves. He used an Ass to preach to Balaam. I believe God can still use Asses to make people think about the Truth. My only question is now "Are you (

             You've got a lot invested in the SEAL (&lt;&lt;&lt;- that's how it is written) being the nemesis.  Why?  TGP has been reliably correct.  Every time.  The burden of proof is you to disprove.

              OK, fair enough.Although I'm not  making the Seal  out to  be a  bad guy,  my  point  is the fact that he has SEAL behind  his  name does not  make him more credible (in and  of  itself)
   We  have two unkown people, who  nobody here really  knows, 
Meyers  puts  out the story  first, claims police won't respond, of everything that has  been said, that appears  to  be true (everything  is suspect right now,  however) 
  We  have a  Navy Seal who then joins Meyer's team, puts  out a report that is critical  of  Meyers. A Navy Seal IS BIG Government, he has ties and connections  to  and  is  heavily invested in the  US Military; not to say  he  isn't a stand-up guy and a great Patriot-no one  KNOWS him yet.
    Now we se a lot  of innuendos and bad reports about Meyers; well maybe they turn  out to  be true, but this  is also typically what  happens  to  whistl;e blowers-they report, then they get attacked. He DIS find a child's skull-that is pretty damned significant-how many people can go into the desert and  find a child's skull? 
  I have  made  no conclusions, the  info  is still  coming  in

               Or....maybe some of us know those who know Craig Sawyer.  The skull was found 20 miles from the site.  SUPPOSEDLY - the coroner said it was an adult skull.  It looked a little small to me.

               "A Navy Seal IS BIG Government" - It's evident you've never served this country in a military capacity.  You need to understand how "this" works.  SEALs, generally are unassailable, but it may happen.  Sawyer served on DEVGRU aka ST6.  Different set of standards, run by a different set of men.  Different service, different CoC, etc.  Flynn is from the same CoC.  CAG, Grey Fox, ISA, TF Orange, etc.....all a completely different CoC and nut subject to the same corruption as "big green Army".

                Ok, now that  my  bp is down a bit....
Only a  MORON would argue that a SEAL is not GOVERNMENT; he takes an OATH, he is knighted for life as a SEAL, he has  undergone COUNTLESS mental PROGRAMMING to be accepted and pass the test to  become a SEAL, he swears under penalty of prison not to reveal government crimes and secrets; he is  POLITICAL capital for government. If he chooses honor  over his sworn oath and decides to reveal  government crimes  (like drug trade) he may be imprisoned, or  killed. THAT is  coming from HIGH LEVEL EX MILITARY whistleblowers.
I didn't say he wasn't a  brave warrior,
So why don't you take your "pipe down" bullshit and- well, you  know what I mean:)

                    So "pipe down", son, because you have outgrown your bluster. Give us credentials of your big insider Washing D.C. insider bullshit facade or stop pretending. Oh wait, you are just a road salesman pretending to be a big wig Washington D.C.insider. I forgot.

                Hey-FUCK YOU and you comment-I have served, DICK and you happen to be apparently one of those  MINDLESS JACKASSES that think that because you are military your SHIT DOES'NT STINK-for your information American soldiers are MERCENARIES for INTERNATIONAL JEWISH BANKERS who conduct the INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRADE out of AFGHANISTAN-so save your BULLSHIT RHETORIC for some of the DUMMIES who like to rave about being in the military!
   PATRIOTS  on the other hand DO GIVE A SHIT  if they kill women and children without regard to whether they are truly  enemy  combatants-if military member were TRUE PATRIOTS they would REFUSE ILLEGAL ORDERS and these  illegal wars  would STOP IMMEDIATELY.
  And if I have to lower myself by explaining my  point about a SEAL  being HEAVILY INVESTED  to GOVERNMENT you're too below my  pay grade to waste any  more time on~

             <p>
              My theory as to what went wrong in the attempt to psyop pizzagate:
             </p>
             <p>
              The cabal is arrogant on a whole new level. Since they think we're all stupid sheep fit only to be exploited/culled as they see fit, they severely underestimated the chan's investigative/digging abilities.
             </p>
             <p>
              The digs that correlated that land to Cemex, all the areas owned by Cemex (close to a lot of likely methods of trafficking) combined with all the Cemex ties (that implicate the cabal) have exposed much more of their "pizza ops" than they hoped.
             </p>
             <p>
              They can't silence the chans either due to the anonymous nature of the chans and due to the toxic can of worms that would be opened if they went for a direct attack. Going after the chans directly (would be seen as an act of internet censorship) would draw the wrath (and unity) of certain cyber vigilantee groups that they know are VERY dangerous to piss off.

            I have been following this situation since it started - it is unclear to me whether Meyer is a plant or just extremely inept and somewhat imbalanced. There is evidence to support both ideas. Craig Sawyer showed some skepticism even in the beginning and seemed open to the idea that the camp could just be a very strange homeless camp. His sudden retraction of support for VOP and declaration that the discovery of the site was a hoax came off as looking scripted and forced. Alex Jones' retraction regarding the matter is also significant, as he very rarely makes retractions - the only other one I can think of is with CPP and JA.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I would like to bring attention to is this: in one of Meyer's recent videos showing his team patrolling through the desert south of Tuscon, he comes across what looks like, and which he declares to be, a migrant camp used by coyotes to smuggle immigrants northwards from Mexico. However, Meyer rummages through a nearby shack, and finds some children's books, and a flyer from Marana Elementary School, which is north of Tuscon. This seems very incongruous - why and how would a document from a children's school north of Tuscon be in the desert many miles to the south, especially at a site used by people supposedly traveling north, who probably don't even know English? One possible explanation could be that it came from some nearby abandoned mobile homes, which had apparently been ransacked, but this doesn't entirely make sense either.

             Meyer is the ringer.  But read back on Edgar Maddison Welch's background.  By "social media accounts", he was a gun-toting, cigarette smoking redneck at first pass.   By the time we got to his grandfather, some anon posted his arrest record - 17 years (approx) in the pen for hard pedo crap.  He also founded a film production company (in the 50s) called Forever Young Productions, which was an active corporation as best as I could tell, as recent as 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm pretty confident that Meyer will come from a similar background once the veneer is scraped away.  Albeit a much thicker veneer.  They learn from every false flag and improve the production value.  Sandy Hook, FTL Airport, and CPP were sloppy.  Parkland was much, much better.  The TX church shooter was pretty good too.  What they've done is build a tolerance of mass killings in the general public.  The DS can go whack 10 people for a "cause" without any significant backlash at this point.

             LV is something far more complicated, I believe.  It took some serious $$$ to pull that off.  Whatever the real story is.

            Not a legitimate source. Sawyer kept altering his story even before he did his 180, his calls are recorded, he lied. Fact he said 3rd party scrubbed his first video, did not report all he saw. Lied about police investigation, no detectives, no forensics done confirmed. Sawyer did two trips to the bunker underground holding tank that was concealed buried and hidden.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It looks like my theory is starting to stand on it's own now: Tuscon appears to be a recreation of the Comet Ping Pong false flag with Meyer playing the role of Edgar M. Welch. The added bonus was going to be draw Sawyer into this mess, hopefully discrediting him. Most likely, this was a real trafficking site. Was this "event" cover to destroy the site? Or was the entire event staged in order to draw in Sawyer? In either case, V4CR is not involved in Tuscon even in any way that I can tell."
           </p>
           <p>
            Lies, Sawyer is discredited he inserted himself into and lied, Welch lol a crisis actor in a hoax to smear pizzagaters, exactly what "CS" the non expert and fraud did to the hundreds invovled in VOP. V4CR is a criminal NGO fake org that has rescued NO CHILDREN, VOP has saved 38 children and hundreds of homeless, 10k plus helped homeless in Arizona.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Meyer (most likely) has a criminal background:

           </p>
           <p>
            Dsicredited and irrelevant Half the 80% of the country has a criminal background, if you smoked pot you are criminal, ever stole something a candy bar...btw most of that in the US not HIM lol. He is a reformed former over a decade ago drug addict? How we do know years ago Meyer in his church testimony and his public speaking spoke of it,.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Meyer was arrested as recent as last year:
            <a href="http://www.kvoa.com/story/36120490/veterans-advocate-arrested-at-hospital">

           </p>
           <p>
            Charges dropped as in all cases for protesting and civil disobedience, In other words a false arrest that is happened twice, gov admitted they were in the wrong, Meyer in the right
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sawyer was contacted by Meyer to come help"
           </p>
           <p>
            No evidence of that plus Sawyer said that until he invented his "new" story. He said a third party contacted intially aka NOT VOP he inreality inserted himself. MigratoryPatterns pointed that out.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sawyer recognized something was wrong and backed off"
           </p>
           <p>
            No he did not. he contacted the FBI and made 2 interviews saying him and his experts were convinced it was child sex trafficking site and admitted their was no investigation on road officers coming not to the site but a fucking gas station, his own words.

            Thats after one week of people exposing her families conenctions to Cemex who ahs a long corrupt record of shady shit been condemned internationally for their crimes in Palestine. "Chelsea" claiming that inf act supports the VERACITY of the story. Proving they are scared and trying to kill it with "smears". BTW pizzagate was real and is real so what are you saying its not? Get lost shills.

            "From the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The founder of the homeless advocacy group, Veterans on Patrol, who uncovered an alleged sex trafficking camp in Tucson, Arizona last week is misleading the public about evidence he claims to have found on the encampment, a former Navy SEAL who investigated the scene warns."
           </p>
           <p>
            Loaded false article Sawyer lies and the article is way imbalanced, First Sawyer didn't investigate he did a photo op and hid most of the evidence he was shown which was clear and evident a rape trafficking camp, Sawyer lied like a dog AFTER his 180.
           </p>
           <p>
            "As the Gateway Pundit reported, Veterans on Patrol founder, Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer, stumbled upon a camp last Tuesday where he found trees with wrist restraints, children’s clothing, pornographic material, dozens of boxes of brunette hair dye, sex lubrication, a baby crib, a stroller, an outdoor bathroom, children’s dolls and a 5 feet tall underground septic tank that Meyers has described “as being impossible for a child to escape from.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It is impossible its deep and now buried not checked for fingerprints and dna the idiot did a 180. Gateway Pundit low IQ Meyer wasn't alone why do they make it all about him and ignore the dozens of VOP? Many of whom are former veteran, and locals who testified to the scene and homeless man as verified in the early videos who provided the intelligence? Because you are idiotic shills and denialists doing no real investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            "But Meyer, who has a history of inserting himself in the center of controversy, sparked national outrage with claims that he found the corpse of a child near the camp and a child’s skull."
           </p>
           <p>
            No he never did. In fact I watched the video of the skull found it was a child's skull, IT WASN'T FOUND BY HIM BUT ANOTHER TEAM OF SEARCHERS....it was late decomp stage. Hell 30 minutes of the video is him driving to the site. Thanks for proving you don't know what you are talking about. BTW Meyer has never made himself the center of anything....that is a lie, one tiny news story that is distorted to hell and some peaceful protesting and dropped false charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cut the rest of your garbage "theory" why don't you go get some facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            No Standoff, Gov not shutting them down, local support out the ass, you clearly have been proven wrong.

            This makes sense to me, because like I've been trying to say, the conversation about Tucson
            <em>
             so far
            </em>
            has kind of come across like people are trying to make connections between factors that aren't directly related to each other.  At the least, there's a very poor grasp of city/state geography  (CEMEX plant isn't close to Vail, Tucson isn't anywhere near Albuquerque, etc).
           </p>
           <p>
            However, there's no doubt that Tucson is a massive hub for human trafficking, and that most likely involves trafficking children for the sex trade.  Most of this shit is probably run by the Mexicans.  But we do have the John McCain connection in Arizona; the McCain Institute would be known to the Clintons, as Hillary does have involvement with it (she spoke at one of their past symposiums).
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally (as a native who saw a lot of shit back in the day), I'd recommend at least some scrutiny of people that facilitate the continuous flow of illegal immigrants.  This might sound insane, but there are a number of charities/organizations in Tucson that deliberately enable human trafficking.  I had classmates that used to volunteer with this bullshit.  Tucson is a hub of this stuff, as many activists moved in from other states and set up shop in the early 2000s.  This is fairly high-profile; in 2007, two of these organizations signed some kind of agreement with Mexico allowing them to provide aid south of the border (

            Humane Border puts out water stations in the Sonoran desert.  While well-meaning, what this does is help create easier routes to major population centers.  It looks like they have some former Washington DC denizens on their board of directors.  Founded in 2000 by a Rev Robin Hoover (
            <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2002/07/thirst-justice/">

            ), who was the pastor of the First Christian Church in Tucson.  The other big one is No More Deaths:
            <a href="http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/en/">
             http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/en/
            </a>
            They offer legal services in addition to water stations, and are connected to the Tucson Unitarian Church.  If anybody's in Tucson, the U of A library apparently has extensive records on Humane Borders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both of these organizations popped up right about the time the Sonoran Desert became one of the major corridors in the US for illegal aliens to enter through.  In principle, it's terrible that people die in the desert every yer from exposure, but at the same time, I can't help but wonder if these activities help encourage use of the area by human smugglers (for the record, many illegals pay somebody to bring them in).  It saves the kids, sure, but it also makes it easier for criminals to operate.  What would be telling here with the purpose/function of these organizations would be their connections to other organizations.

               Everything you say might be true. How would we know with Sperger King Lewis at the helm? I'm sorry but he is a PR nightmare. Don't say to me "fuck public relations" because he has elected himself as spokesman and a spokesman IS public relations. I will watch the video you posted and if I see evidence that leans your way I will admit it because I don't "have a side" of this that I plan to take, or an agenda. I just want the truth. Lewis needs to become the Chef, trash man, bottle washer, butt wiper, caring for elderly veterans, and stay the fuck away from a camera.

                 If you go to 47 minutes in this video you can this bullshitter at work. He finds a place where, most likely, illegal immigrants are using a waypoint on their long journey from Mexico to the U.S. They probably use these places to get out of the elements, maybe restock with water that has been dropped, get out of the weather, etc....
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 Naturally there are things left there by the families. He IMMEDIATELY declares, with absolutely no evidence, that "this is a place where children are being kept prisoner." He then proceeds to go around the local area telling people living in the desert that these are "child trafficking" nests.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 Illegal immigrants, dope smugglers, and human traffickers are using some the same trails and same waypoints. They probably encounter each other on a regular basis. Everybody has to get across that desert alive and they probably use some of the same trails just like people have used the same trails across the wilderness for centuries.
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 I think this guy found his 15 minutes of fame, the donations are pouring in, and he is milking it for all its worth. I have watched over 30 of his videos and sometimes he has the "crazy eyes" and rants like a meth head. "his God is coming to kill all the evil people" etc...
                </p>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                 No doubt there is some terrible shit happening out there but this guy is a nut case that brands anything he finds as "child trafficking" whether it is or not..

             If Lewis is really a good guy that wants to help the world then he needs to abdicate the king throne at VOP and let somebody else be the leader because he is a fuckup bad nightmare for any movement and I would not let him manage a Snow Cone stand.

             He is a fuck up, always has been one, will always be one, and he needs to become a grunt laborer in the movement and shut his damn mouth.

All Strongly respected by the community. You refuse to educate yourself. look into things, go down there, call the damn people. talk to witnesses. No my fault you refuse to believe truth. You would rather have a CIA hack with a CGI background in a suit tell lies. Instead of a real person give you truth. You are sick.

                      Really you are not an expert you have no credibility, you a factually inaccurate, If you want to be taken seriously then stop being wrong. BTW I'm not VOP lol you just keep assuming sperging, not understanding things...Keep at it Common Sense isn't your strong suit that fine, you might wanna go buy some new drobes.

            Thanx for the update blacksmith. Here are some more details we can attempt to parse into facts. As keyboard warriors, not having our boots on the ground, it is incredibly difficult for us to understand what the truth really is.

            This first video is from a guy that has his boots on the ground at the location. My initial gut feeling is that this guy seems logical, attempting to be accurate, and attempting to interpret what he sees in a rational manner. Of course I don't know that for a fact because i'm not there. He seems fairly neutral about the situation.
