             Alefantis Claims to not have a basement in Comet Ping Pong posted by BBC YESTERDAY

            Soon there were protesters outside of Comet Ping Pong. Alefantis even invited some of them in - they filmed the encounter and put it on YouTube.
"They ignore basic truths," Alefantis tells BBC Trending. For instance, the conspiracy supposedly is run out of the restaurant's basement. "We don't even have a basement."
"Sometimes an innocent picture of a child in a basket is just an innocent picture of a child in a basket and not proof of a child sex trafficking ring," he says.

             Alefatnis admits to having a basement in Comet Ping Pong to store tomatoes and sauces

           <p>
            ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, store them in the basement, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in"

            I personally think they are a little too accurate, nobody would be able to create them just from seeing a few guys, at night, presumably quite far away. My theory is they were created afterwards, as a kind of message or blackmail to the Podestas, possibly because they were in fact involved but thought they were off the hook.

            Well said. Can I ask, If like me you have not been investigating very long and want to help but not sure how best to help. Is there a structure or organisation to all this. Are there people here who have boring jobs needing delegated? If so, dont be shy! Delegate!

             There is, but unofficial. Read the forum and check who posts the most, and who is the moderator. BUT! This forum has no way of controlling false prophets, so also be weary. Everybody could be a double agent. Don't dismiss this as paranoia.

             Alternatively, I would encourage you to copy this question as a post. You will get some help.

              AH! Thank you! What I can do is ask and then if I am given a task I can bounce the task of a few people that seem trustworthy make sure its down the correct path?
