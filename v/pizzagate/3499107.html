<p>This relates to pizzagate because although the perpetrator of this child sexual exploitation victim wasnt an Elite himself, there has long been a firewall in the Judicial system whereby the multiple personality disorder (now called DiD dissociative identity disorder) caused by sexually traumatising children has been used as a means of discrediting their testimony </p>
<p>from the article:</p>
<p>On 6 September, at the District Court in Sydney, Australia, Richard Haynes was sentenced to forty-five years in prison for sexually abusing and torturing his daughter, Jeni. The case made international headlines, although not because of the depravity of the crimes which, sadly, would not usually have received that level of media attention. What was unique about this case was that when Jeni Haynes, now aged forty-nine, appeared in court to testify about the abuse she had suffered as a child, she did so while expressing several of the 2,500 personalities that she describes as living within her body.  
</p>
<p>Jeni Haynes has a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), although most people are more familiar with the older name for the condition, Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD)—I’ll refer to both from now on as MPD/DID. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) stipulates the following as the primary criterion for diagnosing the condition:</p>
<p>Two or more distinct identities or personality states are present, each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self.</p>
<p>These shifts in “personality states” must be accompanied by amnesia, including, crucially, an inability to recall certain traumatic memories. A sufferer from MPD/DID thus appears to have multiple people—usually referred to as alters—living within her body and will regularly switch between each of these alters, giving her access to different memories, as well as different biographies and emotional dispositions. Jeni Haynes recounts that the first distinct personality which developed in her was that of a four-year-old girl called Symphony, who would go on to testify in court more than forty years later. Over the course of many years of abuse, Haynes developed hundreds and eventually thousands of other personalities, each of which held a particular piece of traumatic memory.</p>
<p>The theory behind MPD/DID is that creating multiple personalities can be a way for the human mind to cope with the effects of trauma, particularly during childhood. By splitting off and locking away awful memories within the form of a separate personality, the patient can protect herself from emotional distress. MPD/DID is strongly linked to child sexual abuse, with something in the region of 90% of patients reporting such experiences.</p>
<p>MPD/DID was a psychiatric phenomenon that appeared suddenly in the 1970s, following the release of Sybil, a book (and later a film) that portrayed a woman who had developed multiple personalities as a result of childhood trauma. Within a short time, the condition became astonishingly well known. More people were diagnosed with MPD/DID in the five years prior to 1986 than in the preceding two centuries. But then, just as suddenly, it disappeared. Although there are still patients such as Jeni Haynes, who carry a diagnosis of MPD/DID, the number of new diagnoses dropped off sharply in the mid-1990s and, over the course of that decade, public and clinical interest in the condition declined rapidly. A review of the scientific literature between 1984 and 2003 demonstrates the steep rise and fall of a condition which, as the authors note, does not currently “command widespread scientific acceptance.” Even in 1999, at the tail end of the period of enthusiasm for MPD/DID, a survey of American psychiatrists revealed that only about one quarter believed that the diagnosis was “supported by strong evidence of scientific validity.” This highly controversial condition had only a brief period of acceptance among mental health professionals. Nevertheless, MPD/DID captured the public imagination, not least because of its exciting potential as a narrative device: fiction of the period, including the film Primal Fear and the novel Alias Grace, featured the condition prominently.</p>

            Primal Fear presents the disinformation position that DID is not real. After rewatching the movie last year, I meant to do a post on it, cuz it goes even deeper than that.

            My name is Brandon Henry I am a victim of PizzaGate. I was sexually abused as a child by my Satanic family members. I have been on the run for a year now after they tried to murder me. Please look out for me as I am in a very dangerous situation right now; my hotel has no available rooms listed online but the entire hotel is empty. I heard people above me moving things. The manger of the InTown Apartments in Santa Cruz Chile left earlier today for a "meeting" in Santiago. This is so there would be no witnesses here for my murder. I have linked a book I wrote on here before, please take what I am saying very seriously. A targeted individual like myself has never made it this long before (most targeted individuals are fake as are over half of the posters on this board). I am in NO pain which would cause me to die "naturally" &amp; also in no way want to kill myself.

            </p>
            <p>
             I had a bit of a look on your user profile here to get a better understanding of your situation. It seems you've been under immanent threat for over a year now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im not certain how this community can help you, is there anything specific you hope to gain or achieve in posting here ?

            They have tried to discredit Victims at all costs. I totally believe that DID exists. Sometimes I push things out  of my mind when I don’t want to deal other them. Kind of like putting it on a back burner. Then I can go back to it whenever. Imagine the pain and suffering this girl endured. You can’t. It’s that horrendous. Why wouldn’t her mind put these things in different compartments? Then give them a name. It’s kind of like filing them and calling them up when She needs them. I certainly see why they want to discredit DID. They are protecting themselves and their perverted pedo elite friends.

              Yes I remember them now. They actually have been discredited I believe. Didn’t their daughter charge the father with sexual abuse?  She is of opposite thinking entirely.
