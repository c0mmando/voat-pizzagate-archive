            I must agree.  End game=prosecutions and convictions. The assumption, based upon, at the LEAST, the relevant and circumstantial evidence, should be enough to begin intense investigation and indictments and convictions- assuming thorough investigating. THEREFORE, the assumption must be that there is collusion and/or blackmail on low/mid/high level law enforcement, attorney, judicial, etc(× 100)
           </p>
           <p>
            Our own AG won't investigate this shit... what other Prosecutors without balls want to try?
Are the Federal Prosecutors who are ABLE to prosecute this going to investigate???

            This forum serves a twofold psy op purpose - 1. To get help researching leads, that you can file into the dustbin of history because the swamp isn't draining. and 2. A honeypot so that the swamp can read errrrthang we gots on them. They can then track our IP addresses through the ownership of this forum and individually target the best researchers for severe harassment and threats before issuing a well timed debunkery in the media of anything that comes out of this forum with any credibility whatsoever. Which brings me to an interesting question, why are we even here? Seems best to just go home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice how everything is all about sexual harassment now, and elite cults of adults, and the reason we all came, to save the children, has long since fallen by the wayside? I did.

            Pizzagate is an ingenious psyop (Podesta's password was not 'p@ssword' and Wikileaks is a limited hangout) - so the sub is, on one level, designed to entice you into believing something false. It also encourages you to believe in interlocking psyops, 'Q' being an outstanding example. Likely more than half of the regular posters on here are agents (if someone puts 'whoa!' or 'it's happening!' in their title you know they are for sure.) They experiment with various themes and approaches - how much does celebrity rubbish (weinstein, nxivm) work? When is it best to try ridicule, when is it best to try distraction? The sub doesn't have Luciferian symbolism by accident - goats? - and what shape do you get if you put the two triangles in 'voat' together?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, to answer the question, the endgame to this forum is your head.

             I can attest personally.  NXIVM is not « rubbish. »   Whether you are a shill or a sheep, I feel sorry for you.  Not everyone is strong enough in themselves (inured to peer pressure, mostly) to dig into this.

            "It does not seem that there ever intends to be a final summary to send to law enforcement". Soooo, you are telling us you think it is a matter of law enforcement getting the evidence?

            "or a campaign to inform the public as much as possible"...That is what this forum is, but the public uses the TV and left vs right web sites. In short, they are useless eaters that complain about the MSM, but use it for informing themselves.

            : assuming we are prisoners of  Zionism, surely prisoners can set some rules of behavior amongst themselves. By social contract we can prohibit sexual exploitation of children  who become so  crippled  by their experience  that they cannot become useful members of society or live satisfying meaningful lives for their own benefit. It is disturbing to see Jewish domination in finance, the Internet, the news media and the entertainment industry. We see the Clintons and the Trumps marrying into Jewish families, even the Kennedys. Are they guaranting protection for their decendants?  Still there are matters so morally repugnant that we cannot sit back and allow it to happen. Pedophelia  and human trafficking ranks up there with murder and theft  as a crime against humanity though I have asked myself why it wasn't prohibited by Moses'  ten commandments. Anyway, we are just trying to make.the world a better place

             here here...I think the printed word is quite powerful, but NOTHING compares to a fully moral and intellectually integrated man of conviction using the verbal power of articulation to convey a message directly to the masses...much like music, when the pitch, tone and rhythm of presentation are synchronized to the emotional resonance of the heart while synthesizing the brain/mind apparatus towards an absolute purpose of love, joy. harmony and passion, the walls simply begin fall away...for everyone...physically and metaphysically...
            </p>
            <p>
             why do you think "Stand By Me" captures everyone, everywhere, everytime worldwide?...English speaking or not...it's the true love way...
            </p>
            <p>
             thank you for the discourse...I love it...

            I send evidence to law enforcement all the time, we have collected hundreds of pages of new information on what appears to be the "NWO", or Skull and Bones, Dyncorp, NXIVM, etc. Major news stations have picked up articles written here. Major news stations have "debunked" them. I get it, it sucks that nothing has happened yet, but there are now thousands of regular people on Twitter who are waking up and seeing this.

               Truthplease5, I'm pretty sure he let the domain name registration lapse and no longer owns it. The archive is available in our sidebar, though. He may have a plan to bring it back online somehow. His Twitter handle is

               He has a Twitter account -

            I think you already have the answer you were looking for but here is my take on this. There is no end game to the problems this forum address because this is a fight that will never end.  My view on this is that this platform is mostly for public awareness. Also it helps in training people how to investigate corruption by teaching through example.  As to our findings ever being  used, everything we post is recorded and studied by the NSA and by others. Is that fact related to the increase in the number of Pedophile arrested in the last 2 years? You can answer that for yourself as all I an can do is guess that it is in some small way. 
 Here's some easier questions for you to consider. How many people who are involved in forums like this do you think will take what they have learned here and use it as they run for or serve in public office? How many of us will talk about this to relatives who serve in public office? What could stop you from being one of them? Yea we are having a effect I have no doubt.

             The Deep State has had a 1000 years to entrench their position.  "We" have been fighting them for 18 months in the clear.  This will go on for years and years.

              I don't disagree. The personality traits of the molesters is such that they are drawn to positions of power and as such we will always have to fight. We do have the ability to improve our current situation but this fight will never end as long as we have positions of power. It's what a lot of them live for.

            LEA view is site and the PG board. This is the only place I know of on the net you can call a jew, a jew and not get banned for it. You are right in the fact there is no summary and some people dig for a hobby.
           </p>
           <p>
            PG points to those in charge who are doing, what one can only describe as evil. That fact alone tells you (((they))) are watching.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact citizens have to do this work for LE is disgraceful and is a big red flag that they are in on it. It all starts with the ones who are supposed to be enforcing the law. Until "good" cops step up and start putting down the "bad" cops, nothing is going to change. It not just the cops though, it is judges, lawyers, the rich and wealthy, politicians, all the way down to the degenerate homeless scumbag pedo stalking your kids coming home from school. The problem is so massive it is hard to make any headway.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all starts with the people who are supposed to protect us. They need to step up and start making arrests. If you get caught with a gram of weed on your pocket, you go to there and then. If you are rich and powerful, well, apparently you are untouchable.

            This whole forum represents a limited hangout for do-gooders and well-intentioned morons for the most part...
           </p>
           <p>
            Save of a handful of good researchers (most of which left after the first 6 months), this place hasn't presented anything of genuine significance...the issue of organized crime is never analyzed and elaborated upon due to the narrow focus of the subject and the rigid requirements for presenting overlapping/integrated topics of research...just more deriving, and deriving, and deriving...were at the point of picking flyshit out of pepper...
           </p>
           <p>
            If you truly want to know why this forum doesn't make strides, look no further than an organized attempt to ignore the pervasive issue that is ZIONISM and it's world domination as the top secular movement of the world organized crime syndicate...the individuals who "run" this forum have no personal understanding of the real gangsters who CURRENTLY run the world - overtly and covertly - and are still throwing red, shiny balls for people to chase instead of publicly exploiting the gangsters and gaining any further public understanding of the methods and objectives of ZIONISM...wouldn't want to hurt a kikes feelings now would we?...
           </p>
           <p>
            With that being said, I find it more useful/important to understand that the Zionist State of Israel (and the Zionist City of London)

            (The U.S. Constitution WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS applied after the document's ratification, is simply the perfect outline of forming and conducting a centralized, statist government over a nation...WITHOUT THE EXPLICITLY STATED AMENDMENTS THAT APPLY FORMAL BOUNDARIES AND DIRECT LIMITATIONS OVER OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEIR APPLICABLE POWERS, THE UNITED STATES - the people - WOULD NOT HAVE THE OPPROTUNITY TO BE CURRENTLY EXISTANT...)
           </p>
           <p>
            Acknowledge the truth of the matter or not, but the courage and benevolent spirit of the people of the United States and their individual freedom to speak and act on their beliefs without infringing on another individual's sovereignty or having fear of their individual rights be infringed upon - as well as our unquestionable imaginative and militaristic advantages - are the only things keeping the darkness from taking the last castle...believe it...

            NOW...Israel continuously utilizes the United States' technological, intellectual and MORAL advantages by infiltrating/controlling every major technology company in America, formal implicit control of our patent offices, subverting, intimidating and blackmailing ALL politicians/public figures in one way or another depending on the position of power and the person of focus...(yeah I'm serious....ALL OF THEM...through ignorance or incitation...doesn't matter in the big picture...)

            I give great respect and admiration to these guys for bringing a great deal of understanding of the world's current affairs and how the Zionist State of Israel is completely and utterly criminal in their intentions to subjugate and enslave humanity using A.I. and drone technology

            And to get it out there, the NOAH Conferences, described as "The preeminent European event where Internet CEOs, executives and investors gain deep insights into the latest proven concepts, network with senior executives and establish new business relationships" are held in the Zionist City of London, Zionist Berlin and Tel Aviv...

            Look at the itinerary/presentation from NOAH Conference's March show in Tel Aviv and tell me if any of these presenters/companies have been directly connected or involved with the research presented on this forum involving human trafficking, organ trafficking, organized criminality, etc...

             This old chestnut is often brought out by the pessimists. Of course when pizzagate first burst onto the scene all the information was new to the public and came in thick and fast because of all the crowdsourcing.  I'd never seen anything like it.  And yes, there were a lot of good researchers but clearly too, there were people working with intelligence/police or whatever who had access to information and had been aware of what was going on in DC for a long time.  There was disinfo too (as now). Some people did their thing and then left.  It's only natural that the initial data dump would eventually slow.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that's when the people who were/are in this thing for the long haul came into their own.  As information avenues become harder to find we now have many good posts consolidating information into larger pieces of the puzzle.  Remember initially, the only posts allowed here were strictly Comet Ping Pong and CF related. As our understanding of what we were dealing with grew there was pressure to open up the forum to other pieces of information to do with governments in other countries, NGOs, the entertainment industry and so on.   This is a huge deal in terms of the public understanding of what is happening in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of Zionism: I was told a few years ago by an undercover agent working within the area of animal activism in the heart of London about that particular threat.  It was something completely outside of my own knowledge base, but I keep his words in the back of mind and will post anything factual if I come across it.

             Everyone here feels frustration at the slowness of political action, public awareness and any evidence of justice. How you deal with that is an individual matter.  I am reminded though that the world has been corrupt for millennia, so we can't expect to clean up in a matter of  months.  What I do sense, is an annoyance and irritation from some forum posters that 'we' are still here, posting, us little morons with no lives.. or so the insults go.. makes me smile.

              The truth community should switch targets. Start aiming directly at our politicians and demand action. Such as the useless Jeff Sessions. We should target him, district attorneys, etc....shame the hell out of them for not doing their job. That would probably cause them to censor our internet even worse, and faster, but its the only thing left that I know to do.

             Quicktor you are the sharpest knife left in the drawer that is still willing to put up with the hassle it takes to point people toward the real perps and the true reason that the problem is an institutionalized cabal. I used to try to do what you do and I got tired of being called out by our lead mod for my efforts.

             I never will forget the day our lead mod told me that "I was distracting attention away from the real problem and the real perps such as Hillary, Podesta, etc... and the utterly meaningless Jesuit/Chabad Washington D.C.fake drama with Sessions, Mueller, Comey...&gt;&gt;&gt;All good Freemason frat brothers that have no intention of harming each other. That is monkey food cooked in Washington D.C. for the lower apes to consume.

             Until a true understanding of who the secret societies are and how they operates reaches critical mass there will be no "great awakening" because the Washington D.C. monkey food fake drama is artifically manufactured, meaningless, and designed to be the shiny objects for us to focus on.

               One of the problems we face is that Trump and Zionism are a package deal. In order for the Trumpers to continue their faith in Trump they have to accept/ignore Zionism because if they don't accept or ignore Zionism Trump Daddy has to get the fuck out of the Savior role in their minds. Many people need Trump as their savior so we have a lot of people overlooking and accepting Zionism. This is a huge problem. Israel is in the process of minting a coin with Trump's face on it right now and I am NOT joking. Look it up. Trump just won the "Friend Of Israel Award" and I think he is the first American President ever to win that award.

                 They don't care. They also don't care that his son in law Jared Kushner is a Chabad Kingpin. They don't care that Trump's father was Chabad. They refuse to even look up the word "Chabad" because they don't want to know.  If it means that they have to give away their Trumpy Bear they don't want to hear it.

              Well, this forum was initially set up for someone to win an election, wasn't it?  That's why the emphasis was on the 'monkey food' as you put it.  My motto is 'to work with what you got'.  I think posters here now are not doing such a bad job of expanding on the initial focus.  Maybe at some point we'll get past the partisanship.

            There will always be evil, and we'll always need people to investigate, expose and keep that evil in focus.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're in a point of history where those who are tasked with dealing with this evil ARE the evil and we hope that Trump's tenure can drain as much of that as possible.

            Pizzagates, greatawakenings - all of this - will be constantly neccessary until humans undergo some fundamental paradigm shift towards...not fucking kids and not being pieces of shit.

            .Hillary and John Podesta don't have the time to orchestrate a world wide conspiracy to promote and cover up these crimes. This is not an Octupus growing longer and longer tentacles; its more like a virus jumping from person to person. When elites do it, it gives permission for others to do it both their peers  and the bottom feeders. True it take somekind of conspiracy amongst a large group to shelter criminals like Saville. We need to take care not to look like paranoid nut cases recognizing that there will be overlap amongst  groups. Its not a cabal so much as it is a mindset.

             I would not say it's a virus.  I'm not going catch pedophilia from some one.   It's more like a seed.   A bad seed within 1 out of 100 people or something like that.  Since it grows within, these people can be just like the folks around them for outwards appearances.  So you could find them in all walks of life.

              Evidence of Satanic pedos in high places and child sacrifice/torture (sold as videos) is what got the PIZZAGATE COMMUNITY UP IN ARMS!
"Mission Statements are cr@p" 
The evidence we uncover gives us the ongoing motivation.

            I’ve often thought this.  There are days when I think the momentum is fizzling out but then someone posts something with a whole bunch of evidence and connections and we get involved again.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I honestly can’t say.  I’m just grateful that everyone here is helpful and kind and willing.  Compare it to Reddit where everyone is hostile and appears to have been paid to discredit pizzagate.

            Every time I search for old voat posts I simply put the word " voat " after the subject in searching for and it ALWAYS  brings results . Also if your trying to find a conversation with another voat member , you can do the same thing . For instance if I'm looking for something that a member said a year ago , all I have to do is remember a few words , their username , and the word " voat " and voila!  I have felt that ultimately we have all been compartmentalized here since day one .

            I have asked this myself many times as I have watched this site for a long time, without commenting much.  It is difficult for the researchers to come up with the depravity day after day, hoping, waiting, thinking that something will happen.  This is has been going on for so long (millenniums!), I do not believe they are going to stop now.   They know that the majority of the public will never believe it, don't want to believe it, can't believe, or don't care.  How can one go to law enforcement, when law enforcement is one of the culprits?  Just look at what happened with Alefantis pizza joint, cops were involved, helping them cover it up.  A campaign to inform the public will most likely be silenced or as I mentioned above, people just do not frigging care.
           </p>

            However......there are now a lot of people who are onto this stuff, who are getting what is happening.  Took me a long time.  You have to "get it" at a deep level, so that it shakes you to your core, otherwise you just continue to be blind.  There will still be people shaken by this forum, if they do not censor it first.  This is still a very useful forum with one huge objective.....to give people a glimpse into what their governments, CEO's, media, big corporations (you know, the degenerates) are doing in their spare time with babies, toddlers, young children.  If this forum can get through to even a handful of people....well, it mushrooms from there.

             &lt;&lt;“You have to "get it" at a deep level, so that it shakes you to your core, otherwise you just continue to be blind.”&gt;&gt;  You said it perfectly.  When I first arrived here I thought I was pretty savvy about how sh*tty human beings can be.  Over time, my education — thanks to all the citizen diggers, bakers and broadcasters here and in related forums — has mushrooomed.  I had NO idea, it turns out.  I was processing the anecdotal and incomplete reports that bubble up in the “news” and throughout history through a lens of abnormal psychology, seeing these animalistic people as broken and perverted one-offs.  Sure, I knew there are occasionally highly successful charismatic cults created by really high functioning psychopaths, and sure I knew governmental black ops like MK Uktra and plainsight slaughters like genocides in foreign countrues were only the tip of an iceburg, but I had no reference point or personal experience to suggest the scheme that so apparently has infiltrated everywhere, every level, in every possible sick and twisted nihilistic manner.  I am comparatively woke, now, which is a very alienating feeling, as I have come to view Every. Single. Person. with suspicion and skepticism. The antics of Shillary &amp; co. in the election were also part of dividing me from many longtime friends and people I used to trust/respect/assume with whom I had important values-in-common.  I am no bible-study student, but really do feel I ate the apple now, and I can never go back.  So be it, if I can help even just one single child avoid being harmed, and stop production of a new molester in the future.  You fellow citizen goats and others are my salvation, you give me hope and relief that I am not alone.

            A good question

            .  I've been lurking here from  Day One, then became inspired enough to start participating. Initially the purpose seemed to be one of gathering evidence to implicate Alefantis and the Podesta brothers. When  no official investigation took place, (which was so disappointing) it evolved into a public awareness campaign which I think has been successful.  How might we measure this?
           </p>
           <p>
            I jumped in because of a sense of civic duty. I also wanted to see the qualjty of postings and comments improve so that we could be taken seriously and I think that is occurring. Ive tried to tame my own sharp tongue  Just exercising good manners when commenting improves our appearance though it might not be as much fun.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think.we need a brief "Mission Statement" at the beginning so that a first time lurker knows what we are about and will want to come back for more "news". Haven't we become something of an online newspaper about pedophilia?
           </p>
           <p>
            Can anybody  contribute to Wikipedia? If so, we need major revision so that we are not presented to the public as a debunked conspiracy theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            And finally we need a way to search. If we are evolving into a pedophelia encyclopedia, we need to be able to call up all postings related to a particular subtopic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm eager to hear what the rest of you think regarding this very important issue that has been raised.

             Nothing wrong with having a Mission Statement.  Good idea.  Focus.

             I always appreciate a good lawyer.  Thanks for your excellence guidance and the confirmation that sharp minds are paying attention.  I'm not sure how we will ever clean the kitchen with so much "free speech" being thrown about hourly.  The profanity, the shrieks, could they be necessary?  I'm a fish out of water in this rightwing world on voat.  I hang in here for sanity in an insane world.
            </p>
            <p>
             I pray that the profanity, if given space to vent, just wears itself plumb out.

              I use the fuck word on occassion. But when it is contained in every sentence then it's time to give the writer or speaker a thesauras in order to expand his or her vocabulary.

                 No. I just want to know what the fuck they are talking about.  Wordsmithing is an art and I like fine art.

                 Regarding women: I'm afraid the women have abandoned all modesty and  have embraced all the vulgarities of menfolk. There are more female teachers sexually abusing their students than male teachers judging by news reports.  Who cares? With gender fluidity we won't be able to tell each otber apart!

               I used it yesterday here.  Like to shock folks once in a while. The JC I met said, No problem cussing up a storm, life's tough sometimes, just don't include his name.  He doesn't understand what it's like and gets pissed off.

             would this be possible?  Maybe we could resticky the executive summary and add our mission statement to the beginning.  🤔

              Yep, I think this is a great project. I've asked Cat_anon to add the Executive Summary to his thread so it satisfies Rule 2. I can prepare a sticky on this soon, hopefully. Still working on my boat, but that should be mostly finished in the next week or so. I just restickied the Executive Summary, also.

                If you make a thread about the need to edit the Wikipedia page, with info about how to go about doing it and a headline that says something along the lines of "Wikipedia editor needed", as well as what should be added/changed to the Wiki article to get the discussion going (including links to proof what it claims is wrong), I will sticky it!

                Early on we had a call to edit the Wikipedia page, only to discover that Wikipedia is controlled like all MSM. If you do a SearchVoat.co search, you'll find those threads. At the time, I don't think there was anyone willing to sully their well known Wikipedia editor identity bypushing back against the narrative.

            We are like dandelions thriving in your yard.  Plant enough seeds and some will escape the weed killer.  Parking all the information we have discovered in one centralized, organized place makes an easy target on the internet.  Having many anonymous people holding one or two (hundred for some) scraps of information, makes us decentralized and tougher to silence.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this ever gets hotter, because of wide-eyed MSM focus on the subject matter, substantial well documented original source material awaits discovery. It's difficult to disrupt because we the people form the best search function.  Ask a question and someone pops in with an answer including footnotes.  It gets debated, shilled, scalded and may even survive all that.  It's a Rough And Ready process.

             Should we call ourselves Crowdsource Siri?
You are correct. The current strategy is best. I think writers now come here looking for info. They take small chunks and publish stories using our research. This gives us a geometric expansion. Many posting here have their own private cache of research. If archive services go down, we still have the info.

            Many folks on here believe law enforcement, child services, NCMEC, the FBI are all part of some overarching global cabal who not alone allow child trafficking, but a cannibal pedophiles themselves.

             They believe that because there is a lot of evidence of that happening.  Look at the FBI's intimidation and harassment of the Franklin victims.

             Some folks on here have a background in computing so are able to digest the technology reports from organisations like the NCMEC, THORN, Facebook, some of the AI companies, and all those alphabet agency platforms and know BS when they see it. If you want an arrest strategy for anyone/someone go to the police and the law courts.  We're here to figure out just why they aren't doing their jobs.

             .  Rewind back to Oct 16.  Nothing in today's news, was in the news then.  Russia, OP Crossfire Hurricane, NXIVM, ad nauseum.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying it's all related.....but well, yeah it is.  Deep State.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is the "nourishment" and one of the cash flows of the Deep State.  Not to mention adenochrome/pineal gland issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider "Pizzagate" the religion at the core of the DS' actions.  Everything they do is to further their "religion".  Whatever you want to call it.
            </p>
            <p>
             MKU, Monarch, Mockingbird, Bluebird, children's entertainment, commercials, social reordering - inputs and outputs to achieve their "religious goals".
            </p>
            <p>
             The modern world needs to extinguish this religion to the dustbin of history.

            AG Sessions is just about to pounce on this . The indictment of Flynn Jr has slowed it down but not stopped it.

              How would we know?  Though I have to say I've seen some of the voat research filter through to other blogs and mainstream articles.  Think butterfly effect.  I personally believe that crowdsourcing research is extremely useful.  If the politicians are not acting on information you need to look to them not to the researchers here.  How's Trump working out?

               Every so often I think the same, what will come of this, or will anything.  Then someone posts a tweet and I read the replies.  Where do they get those ideas?  Who told them that?  Not the MSM. .  The constant everyday posting and comments have had some effect on people.  I truly believe this.  When reddit shut us down everybody heard about it.  They knew where to come. Many joined us.  Some come then go.  Those are the people you see doing the memes.  Who else was digging up info about JP HRC and the Cabal?  What about Seth Rich?  Where did they come up with the info for those memes?  I rest my case.  That's why I am still here.  And the Children.

                I agree. It's simple Maths.  Look at the viewing figures for some of the more popular posts on this forum.  They are in the thousands.  To think that doesn't have an influence is....

                 I know that is the reason we keep coming back here everyday.  My husband keeps asking me, how long is this going to go on.  How long will you keep doing this?  I say, As long as it takes.
