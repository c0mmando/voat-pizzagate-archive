            Not surprising since Megan was a plant to marry into the royal family. She is tight with Oprah and even moved in next door to Oprah in Montecito last week. Oprah, Tyler Perry, and Obamas have wanted to get at the royal family forever.. and Harry presented the perfect opportunity. Another way for them to extort the royal family / Queen, besides using the Prince Andrew, Epstein route.
