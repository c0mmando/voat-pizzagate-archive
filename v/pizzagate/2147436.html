            Not trying to blame him.... I'm a victim of satanic ritual abuse of the worse kind. I can't believe I'm still alive to talk, but I spent many years silenced and in denial about what happened to me. It was not my fault, but then again people yelling at me and telling me I was in denial, helped me snap out of it. Remember, victims often are tortured to the point of near death. It often takes traumatic moments to get them back in gear / out of denial.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cheesy gigs are often given in exchange for silence. I had my own version of a "cheesy gig" offered by my tormentors. In my experience, the gigs are always less then needed to survive. I am willing to bet Corey has made next to nothing on his Corey's Angels gigs. Remember, he had to self fund the production of the CD he put out.

            I meant I was in agreement with you about him possibly being kidnapped / tortured. DTM is the one who wrote about him being offered pathetic gigs in exchange for his continued silence.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as "Telling the truth and paying for it" ...
           </p>
           <p>
            He's barely come out and said anything. By not naming the perps, he gives them opportunity to continue victimizing others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corey is a fool if he thinks keeping his mouth shut will placate his abusers / tormentors. Corey Haim was taken care of by them. They will always eliminate the victim rather than risk them having a change of heart and spilling the beans. If you have any kind of drug problem they are delighted. It makes their job so much easier.
           </p>
           <p>
            I went to one of his house parties several years ago. The guy is in total denial. See VICE article about his paid "parties" at his home.
My personal assessment was he is / was involved in some kind of pimping prostitution of women, AKA Corey's Angels. He's being led down the wrong path.
Also, he is always defending Michael Jackson. He seems to be under some massive hypnotism / programming.

            Feldman has had ample opportunity to come forward about what happened to him / others kids in the industry.
Instead, he gets these pathetic gigs (Coreys Angels) from Hollywood that buy his silence like ESOTERIC said.
           </p>
           <p>
            He needs to spill the beans on Stephen Spielberg already. The pedophile empire needs to be exposed.
Spielberg's victim Johnathan Brandis's "suicide" is one of many convenient deaths in Hollywood.

            'Weird Science' was a hugely popular movie with my junior high bro's.... in case you don't know the premise; it was about a couple of teenaged geeks who created an ADULT female A.I. sex slave on their  giant 80's dinosaur computer, and used her to get revenge on the popular jocks..... starring Kelly Lebrock...former wife of alleged C.I.A. asset,( and self proclaimed Ninja....lol). Steven Segal.....
Thinking about that movie now, I see a whole bunch of gross programming..... check it out.

            Iistened to the broadcast and I came away with a conclusion that she is refering to what Corie Feldman was exposing. Kelly is British with a full command of the English Language and she would know what 'atrocity' means. The word atrocity can only refer to Pizzagate-esque abominations! Another voice, anither puzzle.... how many voices will it take before public finally pulls its head out of the sand?!
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW - I am 44, and Kelly was my huge crush, I am very familiar with her work.

             Feldman is a goof and a sellout. When nobody calls your number, you talk shit. Give him a second rate gig and he sells the lie like the rest of the Hollywood assets. Check out Feldmans newest gig where he gets on national tv but intentionaly discredits himself, in exchange for the half baked fame. That is the way the game is played.

              I’ve come to think Feldman is a controlled opposition satanist who may have sacrificed Corey Haim. We don’t know Feldman’s motives when he did that interview. It could have been a warning to someone not to speak out. That bleached hair is a freemason signature.
