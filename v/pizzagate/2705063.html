<p>I am not a Q follower but this is interesting, George Webb seems to be approaching outing Q and certain people are not happy.

<p>I heard something about Robin Gritz on George\'s channel coming from the comments which was that she may have been some kind of joint FBI / CIA type. I do not have any details. Robin Gritz and Jenny Moore were friends near the end.</p>

            Here is an interesting somewhat related story. There was some dude who made up what sounds like a Q post to me. Referencing Alice in Wonderland. No mention of any proof that the tweet from DJT ever existed.

             CONSPIRACY theorists have been sent into overdrive with speculation about a bizarre so-called "psyop" against US citizens after Donald Trump allegedly warned of a psychological operation in a cryptic tweet.
            </p>

             By JON AUSTIN
PUBLISHED: 16:36, Thu, Nov 30, 2017 | UPDATED: 15:46, Fri, Dec 1, 2017
            </p>
            <p>
             The scare was started by conspiracy theorist Simon Parkes, an ex Whitby town councillor, who claims to have contacts on Capitol Hill.
            </p>
            <p>
             He wrote two posts on his website about the alleged tweets from Mr Trump, who regularly uses the social network site.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Parkes wrote: "President Trump tweets - 'The time is upon us - operation Alice in Wonderland is about to start’.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Clearly the president wishes to alert the people to some subterfuge about to take place.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The tweet was swiftly removed around 15 minutes later."
            </p>
            <p>
             Two days later he updated hits claims, adding: "I was alerted by a contact in Capitol Hill.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The tweet was taken down extremely quickly, I think by the President himself who thought better of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The tweet was in reference to a planned psyops which would take the world into an Alice in Wonderland - nothing is real - set of happenings.
            </p>
            <p>
             "My contact was of the opinion that by tweeting even if it was removed almost immediately that it might have prevented whatever it was.
            </p>
            <p>
             "When I sought clarification I was told the tweet was removed in 15 seconds and not 15 minutes, that was my error."
            </p>
            <p>
             Psyops are defined as those to influence the emotions, aims, reasoning and behaviour of governments, organisations, or individuals through covert psychological means.
            </p>
            <p>
             Conspiracy theorists claim future planned psyops will include so-called false flag events using holograms to trick us into believing aliens have landed to see how the public reacts.
            </p>
            <p>
             The posts were quickly picked up by number of other conspiracy theory websites and YouTube channels, but none appeared to add any more detail, and most simply repeated Mr Parkes' claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             No screen shots have emerged of the alleged tweets, convincing many that Mr Parkes got it wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Viewers of YouTube channel Lucid Dreamer were not convinced it happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             James Garner posted: "Someone would have screen shot it. Not seeing one out there."
            </p>
            <p>
             Another with the user name Guts1 added: "I don't believe this because I did not receive a tweet notification about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             "So I would be able to see it on my phone even after it had been removed."
            </p>
            <p>
             Jon Watts wrote: "Why there is no other information on this anywhere on the net?"
            </p>
            <p>
             The only other reference Express.co.uk found to Mr Trump and Alice in Wonderland was when Harry Potter author JK Rowling used the Lewis Carroll novel to attack him.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Mr Trump tweeted about cancelling press briefings due to being unhappy with news coverage, Ms Rowling tweeted the famous quote from the book: "`I don’t think–'
            </p>
            <p>
             “`Then you shouldn’t talk’, said the Hatter."
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Parkes has made some outlandish claims in the past, including that in 2011 he stopped "Satanic scientists" from using the Large Hadron Collider to open a portal to bring the Devil to earth, by group meditation, as revealed by Express.co.uk.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also claims on his website to be a "life long experiencer of aliens, shadow people, elementals and ufos”.
            </p>
            <p>
             He claims many of his relatives have worked in the secret service and he also charges a fee to "read people's souls”.

            Thanks EYJP for bring this up.  I don't know much about QAnon.  I have always said I am just too busy on here, but we should all be curious as to whether Q was for real at the beginning and now is not.  Which means that he/she may have been disposed of or locked up.  Or if from all along was CIA or Mossad connections, etc.  We all should have open minds and want to know the truth behind this Anon.  I don't know for sure about Webb either, although there are many that have doubts about his sincerity.  As I said, I don't know much about either, but was hoping to learn more.  Thanks again.

             Just to assume Q was never legit, if GW is correct about who it might be, then it's been a PsyOp. I saw this on another article I pulled up after finding the Wikileaks tweet a few days ago that basically said they agreed Q was an insider group pulling a fast one on activists.
             <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-q-group-the-directorate-hunting-down-edward-snowden?ref=scroll">

            </p>
            <p>
             It basically makes me wonder why this would connect back to trying to hunt Snowden since I don't follow Q and I don't know what is being dropped. I did watch it for a while in the beginning but the NLP combined with the MK Ultra trigger words and symbols being frequently used, combined with other fake stuff that people were saying would immediately happen and didn't turned me off immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was more surprised that I hadn't even seen the Wikileaks tweet than anything. It's like 6 months old now I think.

              I don't follow any of these anymore since the talk about Assange and Snowden.  I take all of that as a grain of salt truth.  I take it in, but don't know what the real truth is about either one of them.  BUT.  I still think we should be allowed to discuss this openly without being downvoated.  I have no problem with them following Q, that is their decision.  But really, after all the fake news we have been talking about, this certainly could be in that category.  At least it should be considered.  GW talking about it, well that is enough to put a doubt in my mind, or that he is trying to spread disinfo.  As usual, we are left holding the bag.  Will the truth about this, like many other things, ever be told. SMH.

               I'm shocked after two weeks you are still upset that I'm here, I've been here for two years. Get over it, you have like 75% of the people here following Q and approximately two dissenters. Too bad Wikileaks disagrees with you though. That must be tough.

                 So I went and looked at the Wikileaks ICE database you're referring to. It did not bother me but maybe I'm a retard. Personally I think if Wikileaks lets people know who cops are that is fine. Are ICE agents legally allowed to hide who they are? Are you against ICwatch also? Are the identities of ICE employees supposed to be legally hidden from public information because I don't see actual doxxing, just outing their LinkedIns. It might be uncomfortable for them but if it's not a legal requirement for them to hide their status then what is the problem?

            you need to take some time out to explain how any of this is relevant to our investigation of pizzagate (see Rule 1), otherwise this will be removed in 24 hours.  (perhaps you meant to post this to

              Thanks for editing, EYJP. I am switching this flair to "Possible disinfo". I'm sure Webb, who admitted to being Mossad and may have been manipulating Jenny Moore, would LOVE to out Q. Or make people believe he had. Thanks for getting the word out.

               He later claimed that he only said he was Mossad to get Mossad people to talk to him, FYI. I have no idea who he works for but it's obvious to me he has a ton of insider knowledge. It seems like nearly everything he talks about on his channel eventually comes to pass in terms of legal maneuvering. Did you hear about Robin Gritz being outed as a potential FBI / CIA employee? She was friends with Jenny Moore at the end as well.
