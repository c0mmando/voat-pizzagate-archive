<p><strong>Basement did you say?  Did you know that 304 Park Avenue is the address of the National Press Club?</strong></p>

<p>There’s no way to detect it from above ground, but right below the Waldorf is a little-known extension of Grand Central Station, built in the 1930s to help Franklin Delano Roosevelt keep his polio diagnosis private.  Rumors swirl about the station’s continued use, but on a rare tour, we saw proof that it still caters to commanders-in-chief.  “It takes seven minutes to get from here to JFK [Airport],” said Grand Central historian Daniel Brucker, neatly dodging my question about evacuation protocols on the elevator doors. </p>
<p>Though he swore confidentiality to the Secret Service on some of the site’s features, he did gesture toward the absence of an electrified third rail on the escape platform. Why? Visiting presidents use dual-mode diesel locomotives that don’t need outside power to function; it’s a precaution in case of power outages or larger catastrophes.  </p>
<p>Roosevelt didn’t want the world to know that he had polio, so he commissioned the Waldorf train station—and a bespoke locomotive—so that he could commute between New York and Washington with ease and privacy. The train’s last car was built to accommodate his presidential limousine; its two, ultra-wide pocket doors allowed his driver to three-point-turn the limo off the train and into a custom elevator leading to the hotel’s garage.</p>
<p>But the train, with its ironclad construction and pop-out gun turrets, has been permanently abandoned under the Waldorf. “It was housed there to be protected from the elements,” explained Brucker, “but in 1945, it was being prepped [for a presidential voyage] when FDR suddenly died. It hasn’t moved since.”</p>

<p>Well, we\'ve had a few posts on here about the Black Cat and this person thinks that there is a connection with Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong : <a href="https://voat.co/v/AskPizzagate/1578642/7724295">here</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1545101/7528044">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Well, what about SPiN at the  Standard Hotel LA ?</strong>: 550 S Flower St (at 6th St)</p>
<p><strong>Tunnels? Well, they certainly are in that area.</strong> See:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2899411/15457741">The Standard Hotel\'s new owner is Gaw Capital. Connections with Alphy\'s Soda Pop Club to Brightest Young Things and Transformer DC.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, listening to Jimmy Church\'s radio show on youtube from 9th Jan I was struck when Jimmy &amp; Brad talked for a while about the tunnel system in California that parts predated the building of the city, and other parts were built to connect mansions and clubs together, including the Playboy mansion and The California Club. I haven\'t started digging into this yet, but there could well be serious correlation with the DC tunnels and child trafficking.</p>

            So, listening to Jimmy Church's radio show on youtube from 9th Jan I was struck when Jimmy &amp; Brad talked for a while about the tunnel system in California that parts predated the building of the city, and other parts were built to connect mansions and clubs together, including the Playboy mansion and The California Club. I haven't started digging into this yet, but there could well be serious correlation with the DC tunnels and child trafficking.

             EDIT - CORRECTION: The address in the article for SPiN is incorrect. They are at 304 Park Avenue South which is a few blocks down (see google map) . However, Park Avenue South is also part of the Park Avenue Tunnel system

           <p>
            Spin is a few blocks away? Or is it more like over a mile away? Because the truth is it's over a mile away.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you Google Park Avenue Tunnel System, you're not going to find results because it's a term nobody uses.  Why? Because the tunnel on Park Avenue South doesn't connect to the other tunnel at all. One is for Metro North trains and one is for local car traffic. Like the train tunnel this is a terrible spot for trafficking because it's not private.  Anyone can go to it.  Cars run through it 24 hours a day.  Here's a video what the tunnel looks like.

           <p>
            Did you not read your own link which clearly spells out this does not run the full length of Park Ave South, And that tunnel starts on 34th street and exits on 39th street.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again there is no connection to Spin which is 23rd Street.

             IMG Worldwide continues its takeover over of SL Green Realty Corp.’s 304 Park Avenue South between East 22nd and East 23rd Streets. The global talent agency has signed a slew of expansions at the building in the last few years. And now the firm, whose clients include those in the sports and entertainment realms, has signed an 18,032-square-foot deal for the whole sixth floor, according to a press release from the landlord.

            <p>
             IMG will now occupy seven floors of the building. Before this lease, the company’s most recent expansion was last October when it took the entire 10th floor, which is also about 18,000 square feet.

             304 Park Avenue South is a 12-story boutique office building that is ideally located on the southwest corner of 23rd Street. The building is just steps away from the beautiful Madison Square Park and within walking distance of both Gramercy Park and Union Square Park. It sits in the center of some of the city’s most exceptional restaurants and is surrounded by every other amenity needed, from shopping to subway access. The 6 subway line sits directly in front of the building with nearby access to the subway lines 4, 5, N, R, W, F, and V.

            So, going to Google maps one can see the entrance to SpiN is actually round the corner on 23rd Street :

             23rd Street is a local station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Park Avenue South and 23rd Street in Manhattan, it is served by 6 trains at all times, &lt;6&gt; trains during weekdays in the peak direction, and 4 trains during late night hours.

             The Lexington Avenue Line begins in lower Manhattan at the inner loop of the abandoned South Ferry station. North of the station is a merge with the tracks of the Joralemon Street Tunnel from Brooklyn, which become the express tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
             From Brooklyn Bridge, the line continues northward in a four-across track layout under Centre Street, Lafayette Street, Fourth Avenue, and Park Avenue South until 42nd Street. At this point, the beginning of Metro-North Railroad's Park Avenue tunnel in Grand Central Terminal forces the Lexington Avenue Line to shift slightly eastward to Lexington Avenue; its Grand Central–42nd Street station is located on the diagonal between Park and Lexington. Just south of Grand Central, a single non-revenue track connects the IRT 42nd Street Shuttle to the southbound local track; this was part of the original IRT subway alignment.

             On May 27, 2015, the New York City Council approved plans for a developer to build
             <strong>
              One Vanderbilt
             </strong>
             , a 65-story skyscraper. The MTA mandated that the developers pay for station improvements at Grand Central to allow for the building's construction.[55] In 2015,
             <strong>
              SL Green, the developer
             </strong>
             , gave $220 million toward the building's construction,[56] of which two-thirds of the money would be used for station redesign;[57] this marked the largest private investment to date to the New York City Subway system.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2018 the 9:30 Club was named one of the 10 best live music venues in America by Rolling Stone Magazine.[2] The club was originally housed in the ground floor rear room of the Atlantic Building at 930 F Street NW,[nb 1] in the city's downtown area, where it opened on May 31, 1980,[3] with a legal standing capacity of only 199 patrons.[1][4] In 1996, due to its increasing prominence, the club was moved to a roomier space, its current location at 815 V Street NW,[1][3] where it anchors the eastern end of the U Street Corridor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nightclub 9:30 was founded by artist and dancer Dody DiSanto and her husband, Jon Bowers, a local real estate developer and music enthusiast who had just purchased the Atlantic Building in 1979.[1][3][8][9] The venue hosted its first show on May 31, 1980,[3] featuring New York-based jazz-punk outfit the
             <strong>
              Lounge Lizards
             </strong>
             [more in another post] as headliners, and local new wave band Tiny Desk Unit as the opening act.[1][3][10] New York's The Fleshtones were the first band ever to be booked at the club.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since its origins, Nightclub 9:30, which allowed fans as young as sixteen to enter, was known as a progressive venue noted for its talent in discovering up-and-coming acts.

             The Berlin Eberswalder Straße station (until 1950 Berlin Nordbahnhof ) on the Bernauer Straße was the starting point of the Berlin Nordbahn . Except for a few years at the end of the 19th century, it served exclusively for freight transport. Due to its location between East and West Berlin he lost as a result of the division of Berlin from 1948 in importance, but was still long time for individual residents in operation. The GDR shut down the remaining facilities of the station in 1985. The created from 1992 Mauerparkcovers most of the areas of the former station. Of its buildings little is preserved, the most famous relic is formerly running under the tracks listed glade tunnel .

             could be rediscovered, which extended from there about 80 meters under the Berlin Wall to Oderberger Strasse. After completing the work of the water companies, the excavations should be continued and, if necessary, a place of remembrance set up. [10]

            <p>
             The Gleimtunnel is not a tunnel in the mining sense. Rather, it is a 130 meter long and 23 meter wide underpass consisting of steel track superstructures supported by 78 cast iron Hartung columns . Due to its location in the restricted area after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 until 1990, the building is still in a relatively original condition. For example, most of the pillars still have the capital capes that have already been lost to the Yorck Bridge pillars or have been removed as part of road safety measures .
            </p>
            <p>
             Via the Gleimtunnel, the inflow tracks of the northern northern train from Berlin ran parallel to the Schwedter Straße to Bernauer Straße , where they ended at a terminus station, the so-called Nordbahnhof (
             <strong>
              later Eberswalder Straße freight station
             </strong>
             ). The eastern part of this former railway area near the Max-Schmeling-Halle and the stadium in the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on the former parade ground is now part of the Mauerpark .
            </p>
            <p>
             The Gleimtunnel received its name on November 9, 1911 after the road that leads through it. At the
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin">
              Battle of Berlin
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             From 2007 to 2013, the Gleimtunnel served once a year as the venue for the
             <strong>
              Gleimtunnel Party
             </strong>
             , which takes place on 2 October each year . This multicultural and free event took place under the motto of crossing the border - the meeting of East and West - the meeting of two different neighborhoods, as well as the common celebration in the Day of German Unity . From 8 pm on 2 October the passage for motorized traffic was closed. Dancing people gathered for Oriental beats and electro music. The Gleimtunnel Party was organized by the project Intercultural Encounters and funded by the Social City program promoted.

            UPVOAT!  Another Spectacularly detailed post.  I was a fan of Susan (I don't see movies) but have watched her over the years in interviews etc. But since we started posting about her involvement in the ping pong clubs with her SpiN clubs, well I am more than suspicious.  I think you are Spot On.

            YEP.  Naked Ping Pong is a thing.  We are talking about it. Can't believe it.

            Sarandon has been rumored to be involved with aspiring filmmaker Jonathan Brinklin, 33, seen in the above video, who is a partner in Spin, the Flatiron District Ping-Pong club Sarandon invested in.   (Unfortunately video is gone) Gee isn't that shocking?  This is just my opinion but I think they do this on the sly when maybe the club is closed or in private parties.  But I am sure this will be a thing soon if not already.
