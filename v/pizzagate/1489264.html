            Note this paragraph... "By the time we arrived in Haiti, after a stopover in Miami, we had missed three landing slots at the airport. Aid agencies -- genuine aid agencies -- from other countries were being turned away, refused permission to land. But we still got a slot straight away. The guy who ran our charter seemed to think that the Scientologists had some real influence with the US Government, who were assigning the slots."
The Scientologists probably work with the Clinton Foundation. We know this because Greta Van Susteren is a Scientologist and she has attacked psychiatric medicines on her show saying they raise the risk for suicide knowing that this has to be at least in part a statistical phenomenon because depressed people take those kinds of drugs. In 2012, an orphanage and school opened in Haiti called The Greta Home and Academy, which Greta and her husband helped found alongside Samaritan's Purse, the Billy Graham legacy charitable organization that Greta is very friendly too. The Scientologists also opened an orphanage there. And Glenn Beck recently

            </a>
            brought some more Haitians here in an "underground railroad." Well that's trafficking is it not? If it's off the books it is and that's what an underground railroad implies. LAWBREAKING. So why is Greta important? She's part of the Clinton Global Initiative. She joined them and started joining Hillary on her plane and IMMEDIATELY started pushing gun control based on Hillary's talking points about Fast and Furious. When Ailes left Fox it triggered a part of Greta's contract that allowed her to leave too and she did to be replaced by Gretchen Carlson who had accused Ailes. The Clinton's called Greta "maleable." It could be that she was approached by the Clintons through the church of Scientology. That's my theory anyway. See: Greta's husband (John P. Coale) worked with Sarah Palin, and Greta was especially friendly to Palin during the McCain run and thereafter, visiting Palin in Alaska many times. They were good friends, so I theorize that Palin is a secret Scientologist or is at least very friendly to them perhaps because of the influence of Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son, because both Greta and her husband are Scientologists and have worked with Palin. Chris Christie also is friendly with Greta's husband. Who did Trump dump off his staff? Christie. It's been rumored the a part of the government critical of Trump recently accusing him of being in cahoots with the Russians is the same one that started Scientology. Perhaps Trump had to purge Christie from his transition team for a reason. Again that's just a theory, but it's an idea.

            Yes, the Church of Scientology provides "massages" as part of their evangelism. These massages are supposed to be therapeutic (especially for PTSD caused from sudden trauma like a disaster might entail) and introduce the person to some of the ideas of Scientology. They send missionaries to disaster areas to do this kind of massage including the Haiti earthquake. It wouldn't surprise me if a lot of chiropractic doctors, holistic medicine suppliers, supplement suppliers, etc are fronts for Scientology since they are the kinds of people that distrust mainstream doctors and push an pharmaceutical and anti-psychology agenda and supplements like Sea Silver and all the others are sold in the same kind of pyramid scheme method as Scientology itself, but I don't know about that for certain. It just makes sense to me. You can find a lot of articles on the subject if you do a google search, but here are a couple...
