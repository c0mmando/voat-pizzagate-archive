            Well, I don't think Epstein is of any use to them now and that camera could have been shut down remotely as the technology to do that is possible. My question is why would they want to keep this guy alive?? As someone who has had safety box breakins at banks can attest, they had their hands on that black book years ago. They have already altered who's in it and like with Heidi Fleiss and her black book, certain names disappeared within a day after it was discovered (Robert Redford to name one). How do I know that?? I was an actor in Hollywood and I knew girls that worked for Fleiss and serviced that community. So, forget about that book, it is combed through and altered, probably years ago. Maxwell is the one to dig on. Mossad tells the C.I.A. how far to jump and you better believe they were on this years ago.

            So, Epstein. Not likely a face reconstructed or whisked off to a secret location(Middle East).  Keep in mind as well, The Saudi's are doing everything they can to keep it all under wraps. as with Brunai and the young models they flew over there, coverup at all costs. Why? These are supposedly pious countries that do not endorse any of this activity. Their perspective countries would turn on them for doing what they are forbidden to do and if it all comes out there could be revolts and God knows what else. Epstein is gone though. Most likely dead as far as I am concerned. I mean, for God 's sake, he was plucked out of nowhere(a high school teacher!!) and handed the reins of Brownstone operations!!Why oh why, the Royal family let Prince Andrew get on a plane to go to Pedo Island is beyond me. Of course MI5 MI 6, The Mossad, would all have known what Epstein was up to. maybe they intentionally set the Prince up(The Royals I mean) or maybe they just assumed they would never be exposed. A real mind bender

             nice comment. I think, They thought they would never get caught, is the only explanation. I'm sure all of this started before the internet, email, texts, camera phones, backdoors and NSA so they were stupid and cocky and sloppy.
