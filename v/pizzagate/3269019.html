<p>Someone left a very interesting comment on that video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Clinton Foundation mega-donor and longtime Clinton family friend Gilbert R. Chagoury (1946-) was denied a visitor visa by the State Department in 2015 for terrorism-related reasons according to government documents, the LA Times reports. Chagoury’s visa denial derived from his political support for Michel Aoun, a Lebanese Christian politician whose political party is part of a coalition with Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group backed by Iran and which currently holds a terrorist organization classification by the U.S. government. According to the LA Times, “Last summer, when Chagoury planned a trip to Los Angeles, he applied at the U.S. embassy in Paris for a visitor’s visa and was refused, according to interviews and government documents.” </p>
<p>“....</p>
<p>...Chagoury has a long history of legal drama. Once known as the “Kingpin” of Nigerian corruption, Chagoury’s name was once added to a federal terrorist no-fly list back in 2010. After spending several months and thousands in legal fees, Chagoury convinced the U.S. to issue him a written apology, granting him a waiver to fly freely to the U.S. again. The U.S. government did not however provide an explanation for Chagoury’s being added to the list in the first place. The billionaires name also appeared in email exchanges from when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Clinton Foundation senior official Doug Band emailed Clinton’s closest aid Huma Abedin and aid Cheryl Mills requesting help connecting Chagoury with the State Department’s “substance person” on Lebanon affairs. Abedin later promised to contact the “substance person” about the request. “This is very important,” Band replied, noting the urgency of the request. Chagoury has donated $1 to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation. His company also pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009, the same year the Clinton Global Initiative awarded the Chagoury Group its annual prize for “sustainable development.”---Jerome Hudson 29 August 2016 </p>

<p>There were reports floating around that there were video records and logs of 30,000 people who went “missing” during the Argentina “Dirty War”, where those 30k were sold off to elite people to be played with and killed.
Turns out that the Dutch princess Maxima’s father was the record keeper. He died last year, with one of his daughters following closely behind him.
The daughter found the videos and told some friends about it, ended up dead a week later. One of the people she told? Avicii.
Since then the house was raided twice. The first time was to grab all the videos stored in a garage, where they left the written logs behind. A raid occurred again where the logs disappeared.</p>

            In 2016, Operation Smile filed that it was about a $60 million a year operation with $20 million in real estate and $20 million in public awareness campaigns with about $10 million in payroll and $20 million in fundraising expenses.

            This campaign is run through United Way, or was, as it seems the page has changed since I found the same scheme of fake congressional payroll contributions with the Philippine Children's Fund of America.

            <p>
             The Urenco Group is a nuclear fuel company operating several uranium enrichment plants in Germany, the Netherlands, United States, and United Kingdom. It supplies nuclear power stations in about 15 countries, and states that it had a 29% share of the global market for enrichment services in 2011.[1][2] Urenco uses centrifuge enrichment technology.
            </p>
            <p>
             In July 2012, it was reported that a sale of the government interests of Urenco was being sought.[4] Urenco, headquartered in Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire and registered in the UK, is one third owned by the UK government, one third by the Dutch government, the rest by two major German utilities, E.ON and RWE (one sixth each).[5][6] RWE has announced it wants to sell its share.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the United States, where Urenco is represented by its marketing subsidiary Urenco, Inc., the Urenco USA facility became operational in spring 2010. Called the National Enrichment Facility, it is located 5 miles (8.0 km) east of Eunice, New Mexico, and is operated by Urenco's subsidiary Louisiana Energy Services (LES). Urenco also owns a 50% interest in Enrichment Technology Company [nl] (ETC), a company jointly owned with Areva.

               There is serious organ harvesting going on in St. Louis
              </strong>
              and if the Freemasons are involved you can bet that the Shriner's Hosp. are doing their share, and it will get pretty sick since they are heavily involved with children.

             "Before 1824, the Rothschilds had married into other leading Jewish families. From 1824, they tended to marry each other. Of twenty-one marriages between Mayer Amschel's descendants, fifteen were between his direct descendants. In July 1824, James married his own niece, in 1826, Nathan's eldest daughter married Salomon's son Anselm. It was an alliance that stood them in good stead..." DRAGONS, p. 205

             "The 99 year British lease on Hong Kong expired in July allowing the Red Chinese to take over. Hundreds of newspaper stories and TV reports have covered this event but not one revealed how England first gained control of Hong Kong! The truth lies buried in the family line of David Sassoon, "The Rothschilds of The Far East," and their monopoly over the opium trade."

             "Solomon Sassoon (son of David Sassoon) moved to Hong Kong and ran the family business there until his death in 1894. Later, the entire family moved to England because with modern communications they could operate their financial empire from their luxurious estates in London. They socialized with royalty and Edward Albert.
             <strong>
              Sassoon married Aline Caroline de Rothschild in 1887 which linked their fortune with that of the Rothschilds. The Queen also had Edward knighted.

              In the past week Busson – "Arki" to his friends – came in for a sustained drubbing in some sections of the media, which accused him of presiding over an evening of "ostentatious vulgarity" that is considered ill-timed in this era of economic austerity. The event? The 10th ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) charity gala auction, held last Thursday, during which the fabulously rich bid thousands for a range of luxury lots. And managed to raise eye-watering millions (£17.2 million) for an array of children's health and education projects in the UK and abroad. This year's guests of honour just happened to be the newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who announced a £5 million partnership between the Prince's Foundation and ARK, which will fund Outward Bound trips for British youngsters living in inner cities, as well as supporting projects in Africa.

            <p>
             Fifteen years ago this month, on Jan. 20, 2001, his last day in office, Bill Clinton issued a pardon for international fugitive Marc Rich. It would become perhaps the most condemned official act of Clinton’s political career. A New York Times editorial called it “a shocking abuse of presidential power.” The usually Clinton-friendly New Republic noted it “is often mentioned as Exhibit A of Clintonian sliminess.”..

              Gilbert Chagoury
             </strong>
             is well known as a close ally and business associate of Rich. The Nigerian media declared in 1999 that the “Gilbert Chagoury-Marc Rich alliance remains a formidable foe.” They sold oil on international markets together. In 2000, Chagoury was convicted in Geneva of money laundering and aiding a criminal organization in connection with the billions of dollars stolen from Nigeria during the reign of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.

In this manner they have removed almost the entire wealth of this nation into the hands of the Central banking cartel, through its many corporations, which then dictate to governments through the legislation dished out through the United Nations which acts as a front, a proxy, for the old money families running the Bank for International Settlements, a private entity that will take full control of the corporate empire when they have achieved full command over nations in the activation of the emergency systems, which through the secret societies they have successfully installed.

             <p>
              In Britain that would be the Contingency Act and in the United States the Patriot Act. These are the corporate governance platforms they intend to control all nations, not as people but under the rules of commerce.

           <p>
            From its founding in 1989 through 2002, the Annenberg Foundation was led by the late Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg. The Honorable Leonore Annenberg served as Chairman of the Board from 2002 until her passing in 2009. Today, the Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors comprised exclusively of Annenberg family members. The Board of Directors consists of Wallis Annenberg, Chairman, President &amp; CEO, and three of her adult children: Lauren Bon, Gregory Annenberg Weingarten and Charles Annenberg Weingarten – all of whom serve as Co-Directors and Vice Presidents.
