            What is interesting is that I showed some of this artwork to friends of mine.  I included the murals from our favorite family friendly pizza joint.  Remember, one of the murals had a female figure wearing antlers and holding a severed head.  They kind of shrugged their shoulders like it was not a big deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            I then asked them what they would think if they walked into my house and saw such artwork.  Or, what if they were dating someone and saw they had such artwork in their home.  It is a totally different perspective.

            I am fully behind pizzagate and the implications for Pedosta, but let's take things in context. He was at a fundraiser. He was involved in fleecing donors of their money, hence "the meal." Speculation is great and I don't condemn your attempt to make 2 + 2 = 4, just look at things and ask yourself if you might say similar things in similar situations.

             Correct.  But, I would not have a cannibal painting on my wall just to make that point.  There are many other situations that could be put on canvas.  They are into cannibalism.  It is obvious with their associations with Abromovich.  I agree many people have made those comparisons, but no one I know in the "normal realm" has used that kind of comparison.  They are in another world entirely.

              I am well aware of the painting, just trying to say that every flippant utterance by Pedosta is not a subliminal hat tip to his supposed cannibal proclivities. Is he a sick bastard? Yes. Is he allowed to make lame jokes about how he is fleecing the people he is cooking for? Also, yes.

             Podesta is a fellow Tribal member.  If he screws up or double-crosses them (not likely at this point), they will just take him out.  They won't eat him.

              Fuck off shill. No one wants you here. Make an actually useful contribution to society for once (shilling isn't an actully useful contribution).
             </p>
             <p>
              When the time comes, lets make sure all the shills get rounded up too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since shills try to distract and deflect their dark master's crimes, lawfully they are either accomplices or accessories to said crimes themselves. Possibly also guilty of obstruction of justice too.

             Now that Lynn de Roschild and the elite have disowned him he may well be left without protection. I wonder whether that's why he took a job at the Washington Post.

              That was likely a ploy to make you idiots believe that Lynn no longer has anything to do with Pedosta.  It was a distancing move.  Obviously, it worked on you retards.

               The tweet came from the same account that was attached to the official Economist twitter account. It was rather strangely worded, but was sent at 10.49pm - she probably had too much to drink that evening and unwisely lashed out at Podesta. No doubt she regretted it but she has NEVER denied sending the tweet. I know you aren't a retard equinelover - just a thoroughly nasty piece of work.

             Very good point Kazza64.  People who lack decency can hardly trust each other. Their is no honor among thieves.  While the existence of such people is a travesty for the rest of us, at least we can hope they live in fear of each other.

              Excellent statement, imo.  This is why they have to blackmail in order to get results.  They still have to keep blackmailing over and over even those that have given in to the dirty deeds.  They do not even trust their partners in crime.  Why?  Because they know how evil and dishonest they are, and that they would and could throw them under the bus in a NY min.  The best way to upset the apple cart is to get them to fight among themselves.  To start turning in their own.  This is what we must figure out how to do.  They will be in a panic for they won't know who will be next.  The secret is to devise a plan and get the ball rolling and there will be a chain reaction so to speak. So yes, they will all be ready to turn them in to save their own necks for as you say "there is no honor among thieves".

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "On the wall in his office at Hillary Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters, campaign chairman John Podesta has an oil painting on loan from his lobbyist brother, who is an avid art collector. The image shows two men hunched over a dining room table, bearing knives and forks. On the table lays a man in a suit, who looks vaguely like Podesta. "It's better to be the guy with the fork," Podesta quips to his colleagues, if they ask about the image, "than the guy on the table."
