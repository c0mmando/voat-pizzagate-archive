<p>I have evidence that an IP, 162.212.171.37, accessed our DynCorp page and proceeded to create the same spam attack situation which had brought down the Pizzagate Review but was unsuccessful this second time.</p>
<p>When I looked into our analytics the page itself was being accessed by Waltham, Massachusetts. As it turns out, that\'s the headquarters for Raytheon. &quot;The Raytheon Company is a major U.S. defense contractor and industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in weapons and military and commercial electronics&quot; and additionally cyberdefense. They are deeply connected to DynCorp, and a quick search can prove that. &quot;DynCorp is also interested in participating with Raytheon, as either a prime or a subcontractor&quot; for instance (<a href="https://washingtontechnology.com/Articles/2012/06/11/Top-100-DynCorp.aspx">https://washingtontechnology.com/Articles/2012/06/11/Top-100-DynCorp.aspx)</a>)</p>

<p>I don\'t know how many have followed the story of the Wiki thus far, but this isn\'t the first time the website has been targeted. This time, however, we were prepared.</p>

<p>Update: FUCK DYNCORP <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/DynCorp">http://pizzagate.wiki/DynCorp</a></p>
<p>Will publish analytics information tomorrow if necessary, but I also have the IP accessing the DynCorp page and subsequently becoming spam. Honestly, it\'s safe to say whoever started the attack attempted to do so from Waltham.</p>
<p>Update 2: Next attack came from 162.212.173.137 from the DynCorp page again.</p>
<p>So far, both IP addresses can be found listed at Wilmington, Delaware here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iplocation.net/">https://www.iplocation.net/</a></p>
<p>Update 3: Next attack came from another address, 107.150.64.136, but still listed as Wilmington, DE. This time, I could find whois information saying this is at 1521 Concord Pike in Wilmington, Delaware</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/ti5jD">https://archive.is/ti5jD</a></p>
<p>Note: Every one of these attacks starts with a direct landing on the DynCorp page</p>
<p>Update 4 - User JrSlimss points out a recent update which appears to be the possible motive for the attack:</p>
<p>I think I know why I pissed them off. I think it related to my comment on Voat which had the Pizzagate.Wiki link. Repasted as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; Fun fact: As many know, Claude D\'Estree, who is murdered researcher Monica Petersen\'s colleague and is the most outspoken about her not investigating the Clinton Foundation, previously worked for DynCorp. However, D\'Estree didn\'t just work for DynCorp - he was their direct link to the US Attorney\'s Office during DynCorp\'s biggest child trafficking scandal which took place in Bosnia in 1999. The US Attorney\'s Office that should have been prosecuting DynCorp, but never did. That whole incident was so big it literally got turned into a Hollywood movie called <em>the Whistleblower</em> with Rachel Weisz. (<a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/DynCorp">Link</a>) &quot;</p>
<p>Ok, so why that pissed them off. The thing we linked that it doesn\'t seem like anyone else really focused on? That DynCorp had its employees working within the US Attorney\'s Office as contractors at the time DynCorp should have been under investigation by the office for the 1999 Bosnia child/women trafficking scandal. After finding this (<a href="http://archive.is/qZY5k#selection-1557.112-1557.140">Link</a>) and if my guess is correct, this should have been a major conflict of interest by the US Attorney\'s Office and the issue should have left the US Attorney\'s Offices\' control and gone to the Office of the Inspector General - an independent party. It doesn\'t seem like that transfer ever happened. If correct, this is the sort of thing that deserves a congressional investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Note: To those defending DynCorp as a &quot;decent&quot; company that &quot;protects us&quot;, they have several scandals involving the rape and trafficking of minors. So many that we had to separate them by country.

            I've been identifying all cameras etc in area. Its been a slow process ot figure out approach to not get tagged. I'm actually thinking using a razer so gait isn't identifiable.

            The Dyncorp wiki - I think we need to expand our brain on this and see people who have been murdered/suicide/gone missing in relation to those who work/worked for "Dyncorp" - I found this from another thread " concluded that Monica committed suicide based on a quote from her professor/boss Claude d'Estree (who previously worked for Dyncorp, FYI)."

             True. We could set up a sub-wiki or something at, say, dyncorp.pizzagate.wiki . Our page is getting enormous, but it's all worth saving and expanding.

              I'm just so overloaded trying to look through all these different branches. At first it feels like everything is somewhat maintainable, but even with a community working wondering what the FBI is doing, this is such a massive web. Almost every topic can be given to a group of 10+ people, I'm trying to get through as much as I can but it's hard to want to follow a lead all the way through. There's so many people that could be a key but also just be a dead lead.
             </p>
             <p>
              We do need some type of a mega brain though, the stickied post on pizzagate is good and all, but this is stuff that needs to be updated daily. I sort of wish we had a way to set it up where the sticky post is the focus and the information that's been found - then the comments are just links to those topics in relation to pizzagate. For instance just a DynCorp sub, Strafor, German Ping Pong, I feel maybe if we were doing that, we would start seeing things cross like the human trafficking with shipping containers might go into DynCorp territory.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also have a lot of concern for people who can bring darkweb/deep web into the conversation. It's dangerous, I wouldn't ever promote doing it, but just what if there was a missing child from one of these charities on the dark web? What if someone actually had information on the code? I just feel we are doing so much research on the surface I can't imagine there wouldn't be a huge flag.

               I have been looking through the archive of posts on here, I'm going through old stuff but I feel anything over 1 month old needs to be looked at again since this is always developing.

            Waltham is a suburb of Boston
           </p>
           <p>
            in 2009, web tracking was used to collect the IP addresses of visitors to a website that was linked to by trolls from digg.com
           </p>
           <p>
            one user, in particular, did a few quick searches for other things "J" related, and thereby "outed" themselves and their agenda/motivations.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            many years later, a group of #BostonTrolls were outed as working for a company called "field work quant work" website is fieldwork dot com but do not go there because they will harvest your infos.
           </p>
           <p>
            instead use google image search and find pics of their office spaces which are very nice and look very expensive
           </p>
           <p>
            field work quant work operates a front as a "consumer research", for example they would survey parents diaper changing habits on behalf of diaper makers.
           </p>
           <p>
            on the back end, they run a bodega of internet shills

            1) would dyncorp be that stupid - start a hack from their own page here? Why that page? Why not cover their tracks by coming in elsewhere? Why use an identifying IP - these people have tools and skillz. 
2) would a bad acting mod be that stupid - burn all his chances of obstructing the cause by carelessly deleting everything?
Just my opinion but looks to me like the mod actios and the hack might be both done by 'friends', designed to get us to focus on these issues.

             If you know anything about my history by all means I'm not trying to pull a fast one on anyone and I have absolutely no connection to any of the mods here. I posted this as quick as I could because after what happened at the Review I wanted to be sure the content got out to people before it could be taken down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust me, I want nothing more than for my site to NOT be the target of a vicious attack, but until then, making it public is our best protection.

             Thank you and I completely understand the skepticism at this point

              Next time take a screen shot of the page showing the Dyncorp page was access from Waltham MA.  Make sense? Just you saying you saw they were from Waltham MA isn't enough. :-)

               I understand. Mind you, I had no idea Waltham was even a place on earth until the name came up on my Google Analytics live overview as the attack was happening. Some of this stuff you just can't make up.

                Wasn't the IP address from CachedNet in Delaware? How would Google Analytics even find Waltham if the ip was from a place in Delaware? Maybe the attacker had a Google account and that was picked up?

                 Exactly why I thought it worth still bringing up. The location data that appears in Analytics does not necessarily come from the IP registrar a I haven't received any traffic from Wilmington, Delaware. Waltham is a particularly unique location, however, because you can see in Update 7 that Google Analytics ends up storing that location as (not set).

                  You might try SnagIt for making screen captures easier. It save me a lot of time.

                   To be honest I never used analytics thinking something like this would happen and the DynCorp page wasn't even made by me. The whole scenario was sort of like spotting a UFO that was there for just a few minutes while you were at work or something, it just seemed so out of place. I got SnagIt on the toolbar now though, thanks!

            They didn't make a mistake showing they were accessing from Mass. They also don't care that every IP shows there name. By looking at the time spent of each visit It looks like they scanned for ports, ran a traceroute, basically sizing up the wiki to find out where it will hurt the most to attack, how to attack, etc... The rest of the IP's reporting 0 seconds indicates they just pinged the Wiki. They did this because they want us to know they have servers in all those cities. The owner of the Wilmington office building has a Private security firm with brandhes all over the country. They knew we would find that since we are nosey no good researchers...Anywho, they are flexing there muscles and indicating that they own the servers, and that translates to alot of IP's, simply put, a massive Botnet Army that isn't running on some bullshit comcast internet package. They have Bandwidth out the you know what. So, I guess we will see if we strike a nerve once again probably here shortly,

             U.S. State Department Tied To Child Trafficking Operation With Billionaire Epstein (Video)
            </em>
            <a href="https://thelastgreatstand.com/2017/01/01/u-s-state-department-tied-to-child-trafficking-operation-with-billionaire-epstein-video/">

            </a>
            Wide ranging article but also interesting is  FAA records and Epstein’s pilot’s flight manifest indicate that Epstein’s Bell helicopter used the same tail number of N474AW. This was the same tail number used until 2006 by State Department contractor Dyncorp for counter-insurgency operations in Latin America.

            Awesome. I bet comments like that give their controllers heart palpitations. If shit goes south you just know there's a kill-order on all shill operatives, or if they're lucky, a big fat batch of CP will end up on their home computers for perma-blackmail.

            I think it's worth mentioning that George Webb in his videos talks a lot about balkanization in the Balkans (at least in his later videos) and HRC using a group called OTPOR, whom she still uses, to create all the chaos there.

           <p>
            She did all this when Bill was pres and she was in the white house. So, there could be some ties here from HRC/CF to what's going on...just a theory at this point.

            We will all go back to our wholesome activities as soon as someone actually gives a rational and believable innocent explanation for the things that have been discovered so far. It would also probably help if the media stopped calling this 'fake news' because that's a lie, whichever way you look at it, and that lie obviously just fuels suspicion. This investigation didn't come from a fictional news story, it arose from verified emails. Perhaps the interpretation of those emails and everything else that has been unearthed since is wrong (although that seems unlikely, given that no one anywhere has even tried to provide an alternative explanation) but the fact remains that there are facts that have been presented, and people have interpreted those facts, and those facts have led to the discovery of further facts that only strengthen the allegations. Therefore it is not fake news at all - how can it be, when the whole Pizzagate investigation is based on facts and evidence - this sub for example is meticulous about ensuring all claims are sourced and evidenced. You might disagree about what the facts mean, but if our interpretation of them is 'fake' then your interpretation of them has to be fake also. That is, if you even have an interpretation? It seems as though your rationale consists of deciding a priori that any claim made about the world that seems crazy to you must be a lie, no matter what the facts are or what the evidence suggests. That is a pretty solipsistic worldview, as well as being a stupid one.

            You really need to stop and take a look at yourself and what you're doing - you're defending pedophiles and child murderers, you're one of those people everyone likes to tell themselves they're not - you know, the people who didn't speak up about the Holocaust, the people who tried to cover up the child abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests, the person who didn't call the police when they heard their neighbour being murdered, because they thought someone else would do it, the person that crossed the street when they came across a woman being raped, pretending they didn't see, you're the people who carried on torturing the guy in the next room just because someone wearing a lab coat and holding a clip board told them to, in that infamous psychology experiment by Stanley Milgram. You're the weakest link, the empty vessel, the automaton, the human meat machine. You don't have to be, though. You could decide to think for yourself, you could realise that you have more reason to trust the truth of what the people here are saying than what the people in the corporate media are saying. You could realise that when you have different groups saying different things it is best to look through the evidence for yourself with an open mind.

            Still want to see how you tied this to waltham...I'm trying, but missing something.   When you get a chance,  can you share the evidence on archive.org, or sli.mg?

            Archive of the /24 registry, for example, goes to Delaware. Hidden by cachenet:

            And the arin registration for the ip of the last hop off a tracert to them shows "trans-media" and passes through an att-cable address :

            Which isn't telling of anything in particular, but i wouldn't expect dyncorp to run out of an apparent consumer-grade connection.

            Still looking, though, this is interesting stuff.

            Ha!
           </p>
           <p>
            And the geo location of the last hop before your attackers subnet is in Dublin.

              dunno about those locations - i would instantly suspect a botnet (whether corporate "professional" or underground "hacker") and a coordinated ddos.
             </p>
             <p>
              the link i posted is really relevant -
              <a href="http://archive.is/OIgtQ">
               http://archive.is/OIgtQ
              </a>
              - it shows that the /24 block of your first IP addy listed (162.212.171.0/24) is associated with a company called CachedNet.  it appears to be the kind of company which a professional botnet could hide behind.  (i'll follow up with some info about them...need to dig to be sure...but spamhaus thinks it's leased out to spammers:
              <a href="http://archive.is/rzKYp">
               http://archive.is/rzKYp
              </a>
              not ruling out dyn, but definitely blurring the lines of ownership)
             </p>
             <p>
              then, i ran a tracert to your 162.212.171.37, and it looked like this:
              <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ST4JEg.gif">
               https://i.sli.mg/ST4JEg.gif
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              i use a site called mxtoolbox.  it's an amazing resource for ip based information.
             </p>
             <p>
              see the second to last hop?  104.160.16.2 resolves as an att cable modem node.  this indicates that the .37 address is somewhere in a consumer-grade network, not a real corporate network.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know, I KNOW that based on the stories/reports/info posted about Dyn's history that they are involved in the pizzagate/pedocracy story...but my gut tells me that the spamming/ddos you're experiencing is made to look like Dyn, and not really from them.  (now we're stuck in the princess bride conundrum.  you can't trust the IP in front of me, and you clearly cannot trust the IP in front of Dyn...)
             </p>
             <p>
              safe assumption:  both bad.
             </p>
             <p>
              hth, keep Dyn on the list, but they're not alone.

               Started digging into CachedNet LLC more too, and I did find that a Kristian Hokka has an address at

                Oh, and this needs to be stressed.   Do not launch any portscans or assault of any kind on any of the cachednet ip addresses.
               </p>
               <p>
                1)  each individual node is housed in compromised networks, you'll only really affect one or two people (innocent bystanders? ) at a time.
               </p>
               <p>
                2) you know they're expecting it and will be logging inbound traffic.  Malicious honey pots, potential legal issues for anyone involved.

                  I'm curious as well how you tied this attack to Waltham MA. That's real important. Did you take a screen shot when it first happened? Without that this Waltham evidence can't be trusted. Sorry.

                well, it's showing delaware because that's where the LLC is located.  if you trace out all of the nodes, they're global. (which is why they're seeing the same thing in NZ)  i found hokka too, he's in finland or denmark, or one of those stupid nordic states, relatively untouchable.  i'm sure they use a dynamic dns registration...it's 101% likely that the .37 address you see hitting you is an infected computer/dvr/modem/router just hanging out in some unsuspectiong doofus' home, and they can't understand why their internet is going so slow tonight.

                i'd love to help with your spreadsheet, but i'm not sure i trust you and google docs from unknown sources are a great way to spread malware. (hope you understand)
               </p>
               <p>
                can you give me a screenshot of what you're looking at through some other means?  static document, or maybe even just describe what you've got on your hands?  (msg me if you are worried about doxxing, or black out the really sensitive bits)

             what would your sign say? You could park a crappy van out front with Pizzagate written all over it. I say crappy only because they would probably try to destroy that too.

            I posted this comment on the original:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One thing that I noticed when looking through Epstein's Black Book, was that Bandar Bush ( Bandar Bin Sultan) was listed under the section of Israeli contacts. Bandar Bin Sultan is of the Saudi royal family, who was a former US ambassador and head of Saudi Intel. He played a big role the Libya and Syria takedown Op, and even traveled to Russia before the Socchi Olympics - reportedly threatening Putin with the possibility of terrorism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for linking Epstein to Dyncorp and possible Intel activities. Great research. He apparently has connections to Saudi Intel, and obvious connections with high level Israeli officials.
            </p>

             Pffft, right? It got back to almost the same number of upvotes in the matter of a couple hours. They must just assume we're lazy, complicit, and stupid as fuck.

            It is interesting they would waste that account like that.  Not logical to me.  Did they think no one would notice all these posts being deleted? They would have been better off deleting a comment occasionally or something.

             , or maybe it's Jennifer Palmieri, who -- on the eve of what could have been an explosive release by Wikileaks -- warned everyone on Twitter that the next thing from Wikileaks would be "a whopper."  That was the beggining of their impotent "fake news" defense.  What a shame we cannot ban these terrified shills.  I know if I had only a limited period of freedom left, I'd be outside breathing in fresh air, not advancing the Palmieri arguments to y'all.

            The politician who was in Bosnia during that time controlling all the political and money making aspects of nation building was from MA, also. John Kerry, your current sec of state.  Nothing would have got trafficked without his knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kerry's intern in Bosnia went into hiding during the Kerry presidential campaign and her family used Drudge to sunbeam her. And then they called off the scandal ( because the family were still liberals after all ) after she was sunbeamed and felt safe. That was my theory at the time because it was the only thing that added up.

             This might be the NSA/CIA cache of "dark" IP addresses which only come online for special operations. Of course they would be using a shell company for this purpose and not IP addresses in the address range of some government agency.

             While semicolon usage has, sadly, waned of late, in this case, a mere comma would be in order.

              My 11th grade English teacher would disagree, but you're entitled to your opinion.

              I can hear her now,  "use a semicolon to separate 2 independent clauses in a sentence, closely related, with no coordinating conjunction."
             </p>
             <p>
              Initially I typed in a comma.
Then I went back in, erased it and typed a semicolon as per mrs. what's-her-names  memory.
(she was a bit of a bitch though, as I find most grammar Nazi's are.)
              <br/>
              For that reason, if I know there's a grammar Nazi on board I like to f with them, just to rattle their brain cage.
             </p>
             <p>
              You know why nobody's using a semicolon anymore?   They  confuse colon and comma  rules!
              <br/>
              Unless you think the word  "then"  is a coordinating conjunction, which I don't.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I were to evaluate your sentence I'd suggest removing the comma between the words   'case'  and  'a'.    It's unnecessary overkill.

               I considered that, but I tend to err on the side of too many, just to help make things bite-sized.  It's a preference, and we all have those, after all...
              </p>
              <p>
               I still say the semicolon (not colon) in the graphic is not correct, though.  It's true that semicolons separate clauses; your teacher was right about that -- and ignorance of that rule is utterly epidemic today.  However, I believe a comma is in order when giving instructions, as you were.  The semicolon really looks wrong, at least to me.

             He was an early add by KKWR when we were scrambling for mods to help clean the place up.  His account was older so it seemed like a good pick.

             He's been admonished a couple times by me, but not enough to seem like anything more than a mistake in judgment on his part.  Had I know he'd continued cancermodding I'd have booted him earlier.

               I think we're moving in that direction.   Yeah, I missed most of the fun, too - I just happened to be around for the cleanup.  Kevdude was the one in the arena when it happened.
