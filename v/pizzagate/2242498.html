            Sessions is Deep State. Trump intentionally loaded up on globalist bankers and Deep State ops. He also didn't go after Hillary, has continued the obscene military spending and war mongering, he is desperatly trying to fabricate a war with third world North Korea, he war mongers against Iran who hasn't invaded anybody in over 100 years unlike the US perpetual invasion resouce theft cylce, he has not made any arrest or ever mentioned pizzagate, he has been part of the cabal he is supposedly fiighting his entire life, his son in law owns the 666 building where Lucent Technologies makes the RFD chip for the beast system chip in the wrist agenda, he was tight pals with Epstein and Larry Silverstein the coincidental owner of all three collapsed buildings on 9/11, he blames the Saudis for 9/11 not CIA and Mossad and our government, his pedo island visit is on record, he is a lifelong Jesuit and was a controlling holder of share of the CIA/Mossad/NYC mob Resorts International(manages Mandalay Bay hotel in Vegas), Uses Masonic hand signs and hand shakes and was on the presidential ballot and at the debates which only cabal members are allowed.

            Trump and Sessions are giving
            <em>
             juuuuust enough
            </em>
            rope for the Deep State to hang themselves before the all-bets-are-off pincer attack.
If Trump ever doubts Sessions allegiance to the White Hats fighting this dark entity, he'll be replaced with a Gowdy/Gowdy-like figure with teeth barred and a hard-on for public justice.I think Sessions is playing the part of an old worthless muppet, not that he actually IS one. It's being made to appear so.
           </p>
           <p>
            I.e., if Trump truly wants to "Drain the Swamp," he has to play dumb and act as deceptively as they do to make progress. It's not something that will happen overnight, and likely there will be a behind-the-scenes buildup before the Cabal is taken down. Saudi strings have already been cut. Podesta Group has folded. Hollyweird is being exposed -- and in some cases connected to close ties with the political elite (think, Weinstein living next door to Hillary while "everyone knew what Harvey was.") Now we've even got Golobalist-types accusing others of Pedophilia ------------------- that's a scorched-earth move to even bring it to the public consciousness that it's a recurring issue. And when it starts to come out and the biggest names begin to be named,
            <strong>
             get ready for the biggest fireworks show since 1776.

            Sessions is a fucking country bumpkin backwoods inbred retard like the banjo player in Deliverance.

            We will never ever get any heroic action from Sessions instead he's going after marijuana smokers and he's tripling down on the illegal civil asset forfeiture that cops use to steal your money and car all over.

            The whole Sessions' recusals are to let Deep State think he is a worthless puss.  Trump played along to make it look like he is frustrated with Sessions' AG performance. It is the The Sting. Sessions is going to light up the Deep State like a Roman Candle. Deep a State is being played like a fiddle. Robert Mueller is Trump's MOAB.  They think he is taking Trump apart, but instead has been methodically putting a massive takedown of the Cabal. Deep State/media do not see it. Coming. They love Mueller saying if Trump fired him they would riot in the streets. Little do they know.

            I think Pelosi has a clue, which is quite funny because supposedly she is suffering from Alzheimer's.  You think that DC pharmacy was a leak? Yes, I think so, but a leak from Pelosi. Notice how Pelosi is out in speeches and mumbles, vacant look, confused stance.  She also is the only one that only recently came out and asked for a new special prosecutor. She knows what is going down and when she is put on trial her defense will be she can't comprehend the charges against, therefore, she can't adequately defend herself. Hoping public will have sympathy for old lady with too much plastic surgery and Botox suffering from Alzheimer's.  She is dumb like a fox.

            Everyone in DC Government is a politician competing with everyone else for promotion and appointment to ever more powerful positions in Government.  Sessions  absurd new standard just gave blanket immunity ad infinitum to everyone in Government.  I'm having more and more serious doubts about this 5D chess stuff. It's looking more like a bad B movie script.  I hope we're not all just being had.

            The jury is still out on this. - And Yes Q mentioned how you attack dangerous animals. - Here's a few lines from the article that show they are in a positioning game. - Circling the kill if you will: During his confirmation hearing in the Senate earlier this year, Sessions had sworn under oath that he would recuse himself from any potential investigations pertaining to Clinton due to his role as a top surrogate on Trump’s presidential campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sessions reaffirmed his commitment on Tuesday. He said: “I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He nonetheless demurred when asked to explicitly say whether he had recused himself from any such inquiry into Clinton at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            “To announce recusal in any investigation would reveal the existence of that investigation, and the top ethics officials have advised me I should not do so,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think he's cucked, I think they are playing the long game. I'm looking at

             I'm also torn on Sessions. We have caught wind, anyways. Cracks are forming. If Sessions are with them he will fall, if not then we are doing better than we thought.

            What Sessions did will hamper any prosecution of high placed politicians to the point where it is impossible because it would be seen as 'political retaliation'.
           </p>
           <p>
            That precedent places the likes of Clinton - and Trump too - above the law FOREVER. He basically said one cannot prosecute political opponents.

            Well to play devils advocate, this could be the long game to get HRC camp to feel at ease before the shit sandwitch storm. They have 3 more years and frankly a big huge mega bust of the lefts generals will carry more water in 2020 the summer before the next election than it would right now.

            I feel that this is really an Ace up Trumps sleeve and he knows how to string them along.  Just enough pressure to stir the pot and keep libs guessing, but only to be pulled out when Trump is sincerely back on the offensive.

              Wow.  I guess I can tell you really like Sessions.  I had some faith in him too and I have voted Dem for quite a while.  So, really, it is just a difference of opinion. It has been mentioned before on here that possibly there could be something in Session's past.  That was not posted by me.  Also if you know me at all, and I am on here almost every day, almost all day long, that I have said that I did not vote for Trump but am willing to give him a chance.  So, I think your attack is unwarranted.  Like I say I am entitled to my opinion.  So are you.

            Q asked the questions on his latest drop:  how do you catch a dangerous animal? Do you attack it from the front? Do you walk through the front door? Do you signal ahead before attacking?  Lets hope its a front designed to let their guard down.

             I agree.  Trump would fire him if he wasn't doing exactly what he wanted him to do.....
Along those same lines, I am suspicious, if Sessions is truly in good standing with Trump, about WHY the GOP Congress is grilling him and demanding an investigation into Hillary/Uranium 1 that is likely being investigated already....
The conspiratorial view might be that the establishment types in Congress want to control any investigations into Hillary/Uranium 1  (remember the questions Trey Gowdy DIDN'T ask when Hillary was before Congress....He missed a huge opportunity to make several of her email/server felonies very clear).
             <br/>
             What if the pressure on Sessions from Congress is in fact a demand to Trump to "show us your hand"?  The establishment GOP would be as worried about what Trump has as the Democrats....
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps Trump has reason to believe Uranium 1 indictments will be generated "accidentally" from the Mueller investigation, or similar, which would look a lot less like targeting political opponents than having his named DOJ Head establishing a special prosecutor to do it....
Given Session's history --and what he gave up to support Trump's candidacy-- I still have an easier time believing that Sessions is "taking one for the team" rather than all-of-a-sudden turning into a cuck.  Can't criticize others, though, who have lost patience.  Having plenty of difficulty maintaining patience, myself.

              Oh completely agree, i am teetering on the edge of giving up myself, I try to word myself carefully so i am not misunderstood, there is alot of dissinformation around so i like to just give the information that i can without name calling, unless they are a blatant sex case/sympathiser then i lose my rag, but for wanting to believe i have no issue with that at all. Facts is what people should stick too to dismiss or validate. Not attacking someone. We're all guilty of being caught out by bullshit.

               Yep.  Key is to be able to say "I was wrong to believe that"....If you're capable giving up a belief when contrary evidence is presented (amazing how many can't do that), you can really build up a lot of knowledge from immersion in websites like this....Thanks

            Citizens on both ends of the political spectrum hate this guy. For different reasons of course. But it always kills me when I leave the voat bubble and see brainwashed turds saying this guy's got to go. Why is he still in power? We really have no say.
