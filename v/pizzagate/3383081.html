<h1 id="md-innovating-geoengineering-and-oceans-governance">Innovating GEOENGINEERING and Oceans Governance</h1>
<p>The world\'s oceans have moved to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy, as maritime rivalry increases in Asia, sea routes open through the Arctic, and the oceans confront a slew of environmental catastrophes. IIGG hosted a June event, &quot;Governing the Ocean Commons: Growing Challenges, New Approaches,&quot; in which oceans experts and policymakers explored new approaches to sustainably managing the global ocean commons. The discussion featured Scott Borgerson, chief executive officer of CargoMetrics and cofounder of the Arctic Circle, and Ghislaine Maxwell, founder of the TerraMar Project. At the same time, geoengineering is becoming increasingly plausible, and although innovative scientific advances could help tackle climate change, geoengineering raises major concerns over the unknown threats it could pose. On June 6, experts gathered to discuss these issues and the future of geoengineering governance in &quot;Reengineering the Planet\'s Climate: Technological Possibilities and Policy Choices,&quot; a roundtable featuring former undersecretary of state for global affairs Frank Loy, Jane Long of Lawrence Livermore Labs, Steven Hamburg of the Environmental Defense Fund, and Riley Duren of NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Labs at CalTech.</p>

              ...On May 3, 1998, the Cincinnati Enquirer published an expose titled “Chiquita Secrets Revealed” by Mike Gallagher and Cameron McWhirter. The articles detailed Chiquita’s complicity in international drug trafficking, bribing foreign government officials, suppressing the unionization of workers and poisoning employees with hazardous pesticides....Before Chiquita Brands International, the company started in 1899 as United Fruit Company. Both a representative of J. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation and a law partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Allen Dulles had economic and legal ties to United Fruit. From 1946-1950, Allen Dulles served as Director of the Council on Foreign Relations. On August 23, 1951, he was appointed Deputy Director of the CIA. Exactly a month before Allen Dulles became appointed the Director of the CIA on February 26, 1953, his brother, John Foster Dulles, became the US Secretary of State. In 1952, democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz succeeded in passing the Agrarian Reform Act. Arbenz reimbursed the company at their declared tax value of the land. United Fruit lost millions of dollars. On June 27, 1954, CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and Phil Roettinger orchestrated the coup d’etat ousting Arbenz in a covert operation designated PBSUCCESS. Arbenz fled the country while United Fruit regained the land. Corporate raider Eli M. Black renamed the company United Brands in 1970. Black mismanaged the company and eventually committed suicide by jumping out of his office from the 44th floor, The SEC was investigating him at the time for bribing Honduran President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano with $2.5 million.

             My story isn't so much about Muslims, but more about how Obama tried to flood America with illegal aliens from Central America.
             <strong>
              I live on Cape Cod, and back in 2014 Obama and our liberal black Governor (Patrick "tax it all" Deval) agreed to ship hundreds of "unaccompanied minors" who had been caught trying to cross the Mexican border to an Air Force base on the Upper Cape.
             </strong>
             The plan wasn't announced to the locals mind you, and most of these "children" had no identification. Many were young adults who knew they would get preferential treatment if they said they were under 18, and were from MS 13 hot-spots like El Salvador. We first discovered the plan when local contractors were hired to renovate living quarters on the base and someone spilled the beans. Residents of the towns surrounding the base were furious, as part of the plan included integrating these "children" (many of whom didn't speak a word of English) into their schools. The locals protested, had town meetings condemning the plan, and finally under a great deal of pressure, the governor cancelled it. If we hadn't caught on in time, it would have happened, and I suspect this is how Obama managed to get so many of these people into the country.

            Arctic nations joust but North Pole payoff may be years away
           </h1>

            <p>
             By DAVID J. LYNCH | Bloomberg News | Published: August 28, 2015
            </p>
            <p>
             WASHINGTON — Even as melting Arctic glaciers threaten to swamp shorelines, nations from Russia to the United States are betting that warming temperatures also will unlock trillions of dollars in new wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It is potentially the biggest strategic opportunity in America since the Louisiana Purchase in 1803," said Scott Borgerson, a former Coast Guard officer and now an adviser at Catalyst Maritime.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Barack Obama begins a three-day Alaska trip on Monday to underscore the urgency of combating climate change. His visit comes as the Arctic's potential for oil and gas production and shorter trade routes when the ice melts puts it at the crossroads of economics and geopolitics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Already, the polar economic dawn includes server farms for companies such as Facebook and Google, which enjoy lower cooling costs in the north. Possible future rewards include an estimated 90 billion barrels of oil and 1.7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that await discovery in the Arctic, with the vast majority located offshore, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey report.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any big financial payoff, however, is probably decades away. Falling commodity prices are discouraging exploration for Arctic oil and gas, while new trade routes across the top of the world are falling short of expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Arctic development is a lot slower than people thought," says Malte Humpert, executive director of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based policy group. "The hype is wearing off. It'll be many, many years before we see the development people have been talking about."
            </p>
            <p>
             That hasn't deterred Russia, which has been the most assertive, and theatrical, in advancing its claims. In 2007, a pair of Russian mini-subs descended more than two miles below the polar icecap to plant a titanium flagpole on the North Pole's seabed, a purely symbolic gesture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Russia, which boasts half the Arctic coastline and depends on the region for roughly a fifth of its national economic output, is expanding its Northern Fleet, upgrading regional facilities and staging unannounced military exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Arctic's incredibly important to Russia," says Heather Conley, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "They're basing their future economic development on it."
            </p>
            <p>
             Russia's not alone. Canada and Norway are preparing their militaries to defend territorial claims and forestall a 19th century-style resource grab. The cash-strapped U.S. Navy is concentrating for now on improving its ability to operate in the unforgiving north.....

            <p>
             Scott Borgerson, CEO of Boston-based tech company CargoMetrics, is denying a Daily Mail report that Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's alleged madame, is hiding out in his Massachusetts home.
