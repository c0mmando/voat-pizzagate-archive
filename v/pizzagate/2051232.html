<p>User explains why they deleted the Wikipedia page of Michael Aquino;</p>
<p><strong>The Wikipedia deleted the article four months after I posted the following about Aquino:</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1984, one US Army lieutenant colonel Michael Aquino, a psychological operations specialist, was being investigated by the military concerning allegations of pedophilia surrounding a daycare center at The Presidio of San Francisco when it was still a US Army post. No charges were brought against Aquino. He was protected by his fellows. Aquino was a member of the Church of Satan but split off as a founder of the Temple of Set (Set referring to the Egyptian god of whom Aquino holds Satan is a derivative). This concept is the opposite of unity and oneness and wholeness as expressed by Jesus.</em></p>
<p><em>The Set followers are solipsistic, meaning they hold that the self is the only knowable reality (not self in God and God\'s self in one but rather the self as willpower apart from God). This stream is heading in the opposite direction of Jesus Christ. It is antichrist. It is the individual human will above all. It leads to the Leopold and Loeb mentality. It is in line with Nietzsche, Machiavelli, Ayn Rand, humanism (the apostate brand), libertarianism (also the apostate brand), militarism, capitalism, etc., which cascades into sociopathy where others are seen as there to do with as the strong please since to evil minds, survival of the fittest is the law and the fittest are those most capable of ruthlessness for selfish aims. Lust can easily be unbridled. Appetites, distorted by abuse, can be hedonistically indulged without compassion. The downward spiral is all rationalized away. These currents never lead to Christlikeness. They never lead to giving and sharing all freely. They always lead to taking for self at the expense of others. They license deception to achieve their aims, which they often claim are ennobling no matter how depraved. It is the hypocritical direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>MindWar</strong></p>
<p><em>Along with retired major general Paul E. Vallely, who has been a senior military analyst for FOX News, Aquino co-authored a paper entitled, From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory. That paper advocated in 1980 much of the mindset that is being projected now by the US military. The basic tenets of the paper include being absolutely convincing that you will outlast any enemy (never quitting) and completely dominating mass media both foreign and domestic including not allowing the home front to hear or see any information coming from the other side. By extension, this leads to terrorizing (if the first stages in the MindWar fail) an enemy into believing in the futility of resistance.</em></p>
<p><em>Fascinated by Nazi paganism, Aquino conducted satanic rituals at Nazi SS (Schutzstaffel; defense echelon) chief Heinrich Himmler\'s Wewelsburg Castle in Bavaria. Aquino wrote about the ritual he conducted at Himmler\'s castle as follows:</em></p>
<p><em>... the Wewelsburg was conceived by Heinrich Himmler to be the &quot;Mittelpunkt der Welt&quot; (Middle of the World), and as the focus of the Hall of the Dead was to be the Gate of that Center, to summon the Powers of Darkness at their most powerful locus.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you connecting the dots yet? Perhaps as a propagandist, you knew all of this. Well, others will be reading it for the first time. They\'ll go out searching using Google, etc. They may run into &quot;The Finders&quot; and the &quot;Franklin Pedophile&quot; case and how it connects directly to the White House and how people &quot;mysteriously&quot; died surrounding the issues and how the FBI and U.S. military combined to cover it all up. Think 9/11 cover-up.</em></p>

            Great post. Aquino loves to threaten anyone who posts info about him online that he will sue them and come after them. Well documented by many individuals, you can even see the exchanges on some blogs. If you say left he will say right, it is a no win situation with this twat as he has no idea who he even is, he is all smoke and mirrors in a high up paid position. Obama kept up his contract, not sure about the Trump admin. Look at the pics of all these morons dressed up in their Halloween costumes summoning satan to possess them lol!! It's laughable. Aquino wife Lilith (yes, the satanic sex God name Lilith or Lily-notice how many celebs name their girls Lily) is also a major culprit in the child sex orgies as she was active in the McCarten preschool case. Everything said about this asshole is true and yes he did order Johnny Gosch kidnapped. This piece of shit was even abusing the kids in the military daycares subjecting them to MK Ultra mild control techniques for fuck sakes. So much about this guy you could go on forever.

             Well they are discussing Principia Discorida in that thread which includes, in the book Illuminatus, allusions to Alfred Kinsey, so yeah...  Pretty deluded.

            The Military Men attending those Satanic Gatherings will someday be Veterans.  Many Veterans go into LE.  This will become a huge problem. We know that some of LE has already been infiltrated and this is their plan.  They are churning out Luciferieans for Community Policing.

            Dear Mr Mckee
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for your email to the Commonwealth Attorney-General’s Department dated 2 August 2017, concerning the Ordo Templi Orientis organisation.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have asked the Commonwealth to intervene in a matter before the High Court of Australia. Your enquiry relates to a private legal matter. It is not appropriate for the Attorney-General as the First Law Officer, nor the Attorney-General’s Department, to intervene in, or provide legal advice or assistance to members of the public about private proceedings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, you have requested that the Attorney-General instruct the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC) to initiate investigations about the registration of Ordo Templi Orientis. Both the ATO and ACNC fall outside the portfolio responsibility of the Attorney-General. Therefore it would be inappropriate for the Attorney-General, or the Attorney-General’s Department, to direct such investigations. If you have not done so already, you may wish to contact the ATO and ACNC. The relevant contact details can be located on their websites:

            RE what the child survivors draw. In the OTO I found if in their leaked training materials if you have a gold triangle on the front of your robe that means YOU MUST BE A MASTER OF FAGGOT BUM ANAL SEX TO OPEN THE GATES OF HELL as exposed in this channel 4 documentary, also known as "Master of the Hermit Traid XI" in the OTO child sex cult - the highest level in their order - only the fag can be the enlightened one and only the faggot can rule us all is the belief of this Australian / American / global OTO.org kiddy fuck cult. The Gold traingle placement on the robe is only reserved for those who are masters of faggot child sex magick. See the documents exposed here:

             Reminds me of another Democrat donor who flies on Airforce one with Obama. Australian gay judges have ruled it's a crime to disrespect "Queer Hero" Terry Bean even after he was arrested for little boy sex, and it's a crime to say obama is friends with gay pedophiles even though Obama says on CSPAN video "Terry Bean is my dear friend".

            I'm an atheist libertarian fan of Ayn Rand and Nietzsche. Pizzagate is real. Child molestation is evil. Satanism is dumb. Don't lump everyone into the same pot.

            The dark force that Aquino adheres to truly comes from the one he worships. . .satan, also under the guise of lucifer, molech, baphoment, baal, you name it, if it's not the true creator it is the ultimate deceiver that caused sin to come into the perfect world God had created for Adam and Eve.  Once sin entered the world, satan had already been given his reign over the earth since his fall from grace.   Due to this there has been an underlying war between good and evil.  Those who understand this must stay strong and keep working together to #FightTheGoodFight.  Sadly satan requires his followers to take God's greatest creation. . .humanity in it's purest, most innocent form as children and abuse, then in many cases torture and kill them as a source of evil power. This is excellent research and work from redditsuckz  Thank you!

            I don't really mind the Temple of Set. I like how Aquino branched out from the Church of Satan because they were stuck in a "lol fuck Christianity!" mindset and couldn't evolve as a unique religion. Also Mind War and its squeal are great reads. Aquino knows a thing or two about the occult and shares some really interesting things in his books, which I honestly find kind of rare since people who know legit occult knowledge tend to keep it private and only use it for themselves or their small circles.

            He could easily be some elite occult pedo but I'm on the fence. Some things just don't add up with him.

     This would  be  funny  if  you  were  kidding-both entities (really one  of the same) are entirely  involved in  the sexual torture-abuse-military mind control of children-to soft-pedal either one  of these groups  is  to be a  USEFUL IDIOT or someone  with  an agenda

              Did I doubt this could be true? I specifically remember me saying this could easily be the case. I'm just not buying that claim at face value because, from what I seen of him and read of the temple, I feel like something else is going on and I'm not totally convinced it's actually malevolent.

              The only thing I've "pedaled" is a book that's well worth a read. If you're interested in the occult, psyops, human engineering, etc then this book is a really interesting read.

              Don't mistake my neutrality as anything other than that - me being neutral. The only major Satanic sect I have any real beef with is the Temple of Satan. They
              <em>
               hate
              </em>
              the Temple of Set and Church of Satan because they don't "do anything", they're not politically active or fighting for any causes. These guys are the progressives of Satanists and they have very real and clear agendas which makes them the only one of the three I take as an actual threat.

               You're welcome  to  your  opinion but your statements about these satanic churches/characters  behind them is naive at  best-they do  put  out a plethora of literature  that "intellectualizes" their mission, their  activity, rationales, etc.-but it is  nothing more than a  front for  introducing satanic  ideology  and  control to their  neophytes  and  members-any serious  researcher  who  doubts  the connection  between  these  two satanic groups  and child trafficking, the  military, mind  control and child rape/torture is either  new  to the  game hasn't  done  their  homework

            For some reason, I thought the Satanic Temple were Atheists and the Church of Satan were more hardcore.  It sounds like it is not accurate, or they lie in the FAQ.

               Well according to the Facebook page of McKinley Climatic Lab at Elgin Airforce base, the catholic church which serves their community is St Michael the Archangel Church and going to the Facebook page of that church community, one of the talks from Father Reid is posted :

              </p>
              <p>
               Their description:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Wherein Fr Reid discusses the cost of discipleship from an inward perspective; finally uses
                <em>
                 'sine qua non
                </em>
                ' in a homily, and encourages everyone to have a heliocentric view of the universe (on a spiritual level that is- in reference to the Son... see what I did there...).

              </blockquote>
              <p>

                 That Reddit connection is interesting.  Yesterday, I think I identified a British computer scientist (Oxford educated - and family connections go way back) who may well be connected with the Evil Limited company and he hangs out on Reddit too. (Evil Limited: think AI, bots, and some of the YT pretenders who talk about such matters ;))

                 Apart from everything else, I believe that our behaviour is being studied on these forums.  So,some of the stories we see in the media these days are planted for just such purposes.

                  I have a theory that humanity is not as fucked up or "mean" or "evil" as it appears to be on forums but is designed to look that way.  I think we have been hoodwinked by "Satanic Trolls"...or even "Satanic AI bots".

                   Rockefeller covers some e-mails from HB Gary, the security and intelligence firm with federal government contracts whose emails were stolen and published by Anonymous after that group of hacktivists learned the company was investigating it. Of particular importance is a reference to "persona management" software, which HB Gary suggests using to influence public opinion.

                   This software -- Fox News reports the federal government is offering contracts for the development of persona management software, but the HB Gary documents make it seem that it already exists -- could be used to generate fake online identities, complete with Facebook, Twitter and Linked In accounts, subscriptions to RSS feeds and automated abilities to contribute content like retweets and status updates, everything that makes a fake person essentially indistinguishable from a real person online. A single operator can manage up to 10 personas, so a team of five can deploy 50 people on the Web.

                  <em>
                   On the blogs, the fight was particularly fierce. Fox PR staffers were expected to counter not just negative and even neutral blog postings but the anti-Fox comments beneath them. One former staffer recalled using twenty different aliases to post pro-Fox rants. Another had one hundred. Several employees had to acquire a cell phone thumb drive to provide a wireless broadband connection that could not be traced back to a Fox News or News Corp account. Another used an AOL dial-up connection, even in the age of widespread broadband access, on the rationale it would be harder to pinpoint its origins. Old laptops were distributed for these cyber operations. Even blogs with minor followings were reviewed to ensure no claim went unchecked.  [Murdoch's World, pg. 67]

                   I agree. I have long noted that it was the professional trolls who were extremely aggressive to others and more or less created the heavy atmosphere as online culture.  The media that we filter our view of the world through has a lot to answer for.  Regular folk who are not easily swayed or interested in pop culture tend to be much more humane and down to earth imo.

                Is it better that someone who has left the matrix, assists others in the best escape route, or better that someone within the matrix asserts that the illusions within it are capable of offering an escape route?

                Socrates asserts, once a man knows good, he will choose to do no other thing.  For he has realised the harmonic form of creation, is proportionate to his own resonant soul and it's cultivation, he finds eudaimonia  The more thoroughly we cultivate ourselves, the greater complexity with which we may observe and comprehend the forms of nature and the metaphysical, including other men, in whom we find an aspect of God reflected and the smoother the surface (spiritual geometry), the greater the clarity of reflection.

              OK.  Fair enough.  I do not know enough about it to disagree with you.  Thank you for clarifying.

               It's actually kind of weird. Have you ever read the Satanic Bible? The first half is basically "fuck religion and God is fake and immoral because [list of reasons]" (very atheist), but the 2nd half is nothing but instructions for magic rituals. It could be a con to get people to accept and worship Satan unknowingly, or he could have just been onto something with his emphasis on needing dogma and rituals to successfully emulate other religions - he was a carny after all so he grew up understanding the importance of having a "flair for the dramatic".

                No, I have never read it.  Maybe I should check it out just to see.  I have read the Bible, the Quran, and others, so I may as well add this one to my list.

                It is kind of scary to think that a carny created a religion.  LOL.

              I believe special forces in particular and likely all armed forces and alphabet agency personnel are highly mind controlled, whether they are aware of it or not, so I'm not really expecting help from there.  If they are controlled, Aquino would have had a huge hand in developing the mechanisms used.  There may be some patriots in the system who understand the program and are able to thwart it somehow--I fervently hope so.

                Well, they are descendants of Ramesses hence the B- bloodgroup. The etymological meaning of the term "gitano", therefore, was originally "Egyptian". ... Romanis in Spain evolved from "egiptano" in the same way that the English word "Gypsy" evolved from the term "Egyptian" to refer to Romanis.

               How does Plato's morality stack up against Christanity morality? I think you might be underestimating the amount of value Christians place upon community... As well as underestimating the amount that Lucferians want to tear down what you truly enjoy in life. Joy is sustainable, and is necessarily productive. Lust, envy and other sadomasochistic and violent forms of deriving pleasure are destructive and cannot be sustained in the long term without destruction beyond repair of many individuals. Either can be exploited for profit, but high-risk, high-reward strategies are favored in a climate of revolving door politics.

                That is incorrect, in relationship to hierarchy, there has always been an esoteric and exoteric version of Christianity, in which men are not equal in their interpretation.

                Understanding comparative theology is the advantage of The Luciferians and knowing the origin of these forms of knowledge, again is advantageous, in our relationship to the world and realisation of our position within it.

                Leaving Plato's cave, could be seen as entering the Kingdom of Heaven...
               </p>
               <p>
                Lust, envy etc are outside of knowing ourselves.  These are symptoms of the world and The Kingdom Of Within within us, places us in the category not of the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                If we are not agents of heaven, then indeed we are agents for the world.  We absorb the light, or reflect it, or project it.

                 Speak for yoyrself... You can not be an agent of heaven, but I have, through the power of Christ's sacrifice, reclaimed my place there. Be in the world, but not of the world. Good luck getting out of Plato's Closet.

                  Outside Pegasus Museum It says "Kids" and 616

                 <p>
                  Kids are baby goats. 616 is discussed below
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Did you all figure out how to turn the cross into a hyperdimensional saturn cube yet?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You know, like in the last card of the Illuminati Game speaks of?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It has to do with 666, not 616 like outside pegasus museum.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  666 is generally believed to have been the original Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible. In 2005, however, a fragment of papyrus 115 was revealed, containing the earliest known version of that part of the Book of Revelation discussing the Number of the Beast. It gave the number as 616, suggesting that this may have been the original
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/616_(number)">
                   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/616_(number)
                  </a>
                  616 reduces to 13 = 4 ( Whereas 666 reduces to 18 = 9 which is the number judgement It's opposite 999 also reduces to = 27 = 9 which is the number of judgement
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As above, so below. 666 relates to the Star of David
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The narwhal lives in the platonic form of water, the only form below the cosmos (order).
                 </p>

                   I have heard a little about 616 and pondered greatly upon the lines whch you have laid out... Still not sure where your thinking is, do you consider 666 or 616 to be the true MoB?

                    616 is the number of the beast because it reduces to 4 (base dimensional time)

                   <p>
                    666 reduces to 18 then to 9
999 reduces to 27 then to 9
As Above, So Below

                    Doesn't that happen to be one of the Illuminati Playing Cards?

                    I actually included this book, or at least some important chapters of it, revolving around the holy grail in this video here:

                    So, back we go to the card game. Until we look at the card, the wave function doesn't collapse into particles. Let's keep that in mind.

                    Oh boy, remember when we discovered that shit? What a trip. It's like maybe God was making a big piece of art, you know... Like the world is a stage and we are all the players? As Bacon said, knowledge is power which holds up the seven pillars of wisdom.

                    That quote is written all over the place in Latin... It refers to God, as Sophia, wisdom.

                   <p>
                    Since we have discovered 616 is in fact the number of the beast, let's take a look at the number 666 and see what all the fuss is about....
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    666 is related to hyperdimensional space. Metatron's cube (Saturn's Cube) The Black Box Of Time.

                   <p>
                    It's the atomic element of carbon.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you are good, Satan turns your carbon into diamond? Right...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Saturn Cult? Hold on a moment... Isn't that referenced in the final card of The Illuminati Game?

                  You see, you are playing a dominance game,  whereas I am elucidating the truth, perhaps you have failed to realise the mystery of Christ stands in autonomy and agape.

                   I am not attempting a dominance game. You, deceiver, have conflated the terms autonomy and agape by neglecting the Body of Christ. I am a part of that body. There are great mysteries to be sought and deciphered, but Christ and his unconditional love has been revealed. Tell me about what autonomy means to you... I understand it many ways.

              This guy is pure evil. He does believe in what he preaches and in the sexual trauma mind control of little children. He is kept on because he is a master at mind control and has the goods on everyone they have no choice.

              Pure evil. He needs to repent before it is too late if it is not already.

            Common denominators he shows up: Franklin Savings conspiracy; Diana "Curio" Napolis outing &amp; meltdown; Svali Illuminati.

            He is likely the role model for Kevin Spacey in The Men Who Stare at Goats, turning the New Age direction of The First Earth Battalion &amp; DIA General Stubblebine towards black magic thinking now encoded as the DOD mission statement Full Spectrum Domination.

            Granted he looks like Grandpa Munster &amp; his wife Lilly Munster, the Diana Napolis (former social worker investigating SRA until mind meltdown) incident showed what he is capable of &amp; amazing the legions posting disinfo about her &amp; "Satanic Panic" which became a meme discrediting claims of SRA via "false memory syndrome".

              There are issues any time stories are based on "recovered memories" as the most hyped books by so-called "Monarch sex slaves" which seem designed to make people incredulous. Svali did not capitalize on her extensive revelations &amp; admits gray areas in her recall. Her accurate knowledge of MKULTRA techniques &amp; exposing real people such as her handler besides not making money off her story &amp; going into hiding sets her apart from others in the genre. She was vouched authentic to me by Helen Lacter PhD a San Diego therapist that is a leader in SRA/DID/MPD advocacy work &amp; worked with her &amp; Diana "Curio" Napolis before the latter was tracked down by Michael Aquino's thugs &amp; neutralized by his associates making her psychotic where she was previously a competent social worker in SRA issues.
             </p>
             <p>
              These types of stories are hard to prove/disprove either way, one can only go by apparent paper trails &amp; feasibility of claims, same for any Pizzagate theory. Some claims hold up better than others.

            That is Sammy Davis Jr. with LaVey and Aquino in the picture.  It was believed that Davis sported red fingernail polish on his pinky finger.  Some said it was a nod to the devil. Davis was a strange bird, so I tend to believe it.  Now seeing him with Aquino tells me he may have been up to even more macabre things.

              In April, Aquino wrote a four-page letter to the head of a children's advocates group in Southern California warning that "we do not intend to see a replay of what happened in Nazi Germany, when the reluctance of the Jews to challenge those who systematically and falsely accused Judaism of heinous crimes-including the sexual abuse and ritual murder of Christian children- led to violence against them."

              On Aug. 12, 1987, the Adams-Thompsons were shopping at the PX at the Presidio. Suddenly the girl ran to Larry Adams-Thompson and clutched his leg. He looked up and saw a man whom he knew as Lt Col. Michael Aquino.

             <em>
              "Yes, that's Mikey," the 3-year-old told Adams-Thompson. After being taken outside, the girl added, "he's a bad man and I'm afraid." As they were leaving the parking lot, the Adams-Thompsons saw Aquino's wife, Lilith. Larry asked the child if she knew the woman.
