<p>And on the front of their &quot;art&quot; gallery window is a huge portrait of POTUS with a bloodied nose and his throat being slashed with the words &quot;FUCK TRUMP&quot; under it. The image is quite disturbing to say the least! </p>
<p>This was to advertise their whole exhibition entitled &quot;F*uck Trump&quot; and had many artists displaying their hate for Mr. Trump. Why is this relevant to PG? Well I don\'t need to explain the connection between &quot;art&quot; and PG and the night was also raising money, where were these donations going? Planned Parenthood!!

<p>I feel the &quot;artists&quot; that displayed their works may provide some extra leads as we know mostly sickos and pedos are against Trump and his plan to end their wicked ways. </p>
<p>There are a few artists listed in the article but I don\'t want to post their direct links on here as if they see traffic from here they start to cover their tracks. I just looked on the gallery\'s IG and there is one piece of &quot;art&quot; there that shows a group of men sitting around a table with human heads in bowls and on plates and the caption reads &quot;Family dinners are really fun&quot;....</p>

            thanks for sharing, this is some messed up shit for sure.  unfortunately though his post will have to be removed due to the title's lack of relevance to pizzagate (Rule 3).
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             All titles must adequately describe post content and

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            in addition, if you would like to repost this topic, you will need to establish a direct link between the artist and/or the art gallery and pizzagate as defined in Rule 1.

            thanks for understanding.  we appreciate your contributions to this community.

             Oh it's horrible. The one that really gave me the chills was the bloodied body being carried off in to the forest by whatever the fuck that creature is!! I had to get off because that shit was getting disturbing to say the least!

              That's enough information for me. I'm not opening this sick, twisted link. These people must be stopped. I see more and more people opening their eyes to what is going on and I pray this leads to ending this madness.

               Yea there is some sick "art" on one of the IG, very dark.. I had to close it as it was making me feel very uneasy as it has a very dark theme to it, quite sick really! And certainly seeing more and more people waking up to this sort of thing, the people behind it all are making such fools of themselves that its making people question everything, which is hilarious!! The more they try to destroy Trump and people doing the right thing the more they are waking people up, it's awesome!

              You mentioned organs hanging out of the body.  Reminders of organ harvesting.  Sick. Sick. Sick.   We used to have decent art now it's taking a turn towards Ugly and Disgustingly Bazaar.
