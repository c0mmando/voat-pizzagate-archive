            You are right and this is an important part of the trafficking lines. They want to be surrounded by criminals and low level perps to keep up the numbers of the fake investigations and patsy convictions as they are doing in Racine. Coloboma is definitely part of it. They use Facebook and other sources to find them, and they may also be looking for specific blood lines and blood types. They have started using more sophisticated spying software for more powerful searching tools through social media, and have infiltrated the healthcare system so they can gain access to this personal information.
           </p>
           <p>
            They can do anything they want in Racine. They can transport children, organs, drugs, or guns without any scrutiny through the International Airport, the harbor or the Interstate. The area is fully controlled by corrupt corporations and foundations, secret societies, gangs including MS-13 (it is also a Sanctuary City), and the mafia. There is a reason Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Scott Walker are so powerful and it is because of what they are covering up in Racine and Wisconsin - a main root of the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>

            DC is business. Racine is personal. The real agenda and party is in Racine, Wisconsin.

            Look at the details here about the Racine International Airport, fully controlled by private interests with its own customs port of entry.
           </p>
           <p>
            John H. Batten Airport also known as Batten International Airport, is a public use airport located 2 miles (3 km; 2 nmi) northwest of the central business district of Racine, a city in Racine County, Wisconsin, United States, North America. It is privately owned by the Racine Commercial Airport Corporation. During World War II (ca 1941-1945), the newly established airport was used as a flight and ground school for the Army. Students were housed at Racine College on the south side of Racine. Ground school instruction was given at Horlick High School and the actual flight training took place at the airport. Today, the airport is used primarily by local aviation enthusiasts and by the corporate jets of large local companies such as S.C. Johnson &amp; Son and Twin Disc, Inc. Racine Wisconsin’s John H. Batten Airport is located on over 450 acres of land and provides services to corporate, business and private aircraft twenty-four hours a day, seven days each week. The general-aviation terminal is complete with a U.S. Customs Port of Entry, pilot and passenger lounges, a flight planning facility equipped with computerized weather data and a conference room with audio/video services available to customers while at the airport. Batten International Airport is the largest privately-owned, public-use, reliever airport in the United States.

            The Blake House is an important landmark, and as you see here, many groups are involved in preserving it that have ties to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. After Lucius Blake’s death in 1890 the Blake family continued to own and occupy the house until 1926 when it was sold and became a boarding house.  In 1952 the Beth Israel Sinai congregation bought the property which had been converted to five apartments.  By late 1976 the Congregation’s parking problems and the deteriorated condition of the building had led them to consider demolition of the house. Blake House Restoration, Inc., a separate non-profit corporation, was formed by the coalition of sponsoring organizations:  Preservation-Racine, the Junior League of Racine, Racine County Historical Society, and Racine Urban Aesthetics.  A significant grant from the Johnson Wax Fund in 1978 funded total restoration of the rear porch.  Gifts from the Racine County Historical Society and other contributors provided vintage lighting fixtures and hardware.  Low interest loans from the City of Racine’s Architectural Conservation Loan Fund financed custom storm windows and screens in 1978 and installation of a new roof in 1979.  Army Reserve members remove the non-original front porch and Boy Scouts assisted in cleaning and landscaping work.
           </p>
           <p>
            After learning the carpenter trade from his father, Levi, Lucius too was a contractor and builder until 1842. He then began manufacturing fanning mills, a machine used for separating grain. His business grew to the largest in the world, with an agency located in Hungary. Because of the success of this enterprise, he was able to invest in real estate and was the largest land-holder in Racine at that time. He became head of the largest woolen mill in the West, the Racine Woolen company, and was the director and incorporator of many companies. Lucius was one of the first trustees of Racine County and served as postmaster, city councilman, and president of the council. He was a delegate to the Republican convention and represented his city in the State legislature. Lucius was the first president and organizer of the Old Settlers Society in Racine.

             Found this about Ryan.  His growing up poor story is not so. From the la times. And yet Ryan, 42, was born into one of the most prominent families in Janesville, Wis., the son of a successful attorney and the grandson of the top federal prosecutor for the western region of the state. Ryan grew up in a big Colonial house on a wooded lot, and his extended clan includes investment managers, corporate executives and owners of major construction companies.  SO, When his father died, he received survivor's benefits which paid for his college.  And he is in favor of cutting social security and medicare.  GOD I hate him.  Anyway his father in law was named Boder I believe but could not find much on him. Still looking.  But they were a family of Democrats, though his wife's grandfather started an Independent Party to back the run of George Wallace!

            Politicians are opportunists and narcissists. So let's not worry, they are all looking to see how they can save their own asses.
Deals will be cut, snitches all around. If nothing has happened in 6 months we know it's  all delay tactic bullshit. It's amazing to think how many kids are crying their guts out every night while we sit and wait for those who were supposed to protect and enforce to finally protect and enforce.  But this time is different right?
           </p>
           <p>
            I truly understand those old westerns when people got a posse together.  Thousands of kids are being raped and eaten while we watch Jeff sessions go after pot smokers.  God forbidIf it was your kid how long would you wait?
           </p>
           <p>
            When the Iraq war was in full swing every 6months bush would say we're doing to do a troop pull down or partial withdrawal. When that 6mth came there was always a convienient attack or delay for another 6months. Obama claimed he pulled troops out celebrated himself, but in actuality he did the opposite.
           </p>

            These people are using military delay and distract tactics why they cover their asses. Something has got to fucking change.
His whole thing is disgusting. Our grandkids will look at us in shame while Emperor Bill Clinton the IV rapes them.

            I agree with this comment: "Paul Ryan is in bed with those involved". In fact:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              No matter which so-called "Congressional Investigation" is underway, I believe those are only meant to protect the wrongdoer child rapists, traffickers, conspirators, etc. These so-called investigations are only for #MSM theater.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The ONLY people we can trust are #WeThePeople to ensure these scumbags are prosecuted and removed from society.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I support any calls-to-action that include REFORMING the Judiciary to make these animals pay for what they've done to our society. For example, using our currently available "Common Law" system (all state &lt;and federal&gt; courts can be used as a so-called common law court of record).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I fully support any LEOs on these threads that are doing the right thing and helping to rid our society of these monsters - Sheriffs, prosecutors, etc.

              I don't expect LEOs to identify themselves. Why would you expect them to do so? My only point was that I support LEOs that are actually helping - and, yes, I do realize that some are corrupt or don't care about child trafficking.

            Paul Ryan is in bed with those involved. His district is a main root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The most recent cover-up organization they started is called The Fight to End Exploitation which is tied to the corrupt area churches, corporations, foundations and non-profits that are deeply entrenched in trafficking and corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine has a fully controlled international airport, harbor and interstate, and is a Sanctuary City and playground for the elite that engage in trafficking, organ harvesting and transplants, blood transfusions, abuse, torture, blackmail, bribery, extortion, embezzlement, evasion, bid rigging, fraud, election rigging, vote rigging, racketeering and other criminal activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Scott Walker and others are corrupt Boy Scouts tied to the mafia and secret societies, funded by corrupt corporate interests, who serve as front men to cover up the real evil agenda behind the curtains linked to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is one of 13 main Bellwether districts with deep ties to corruption in both the RNC (McCain, Graham, Ryan, Romney, etc.) and DNC (Clinton, Schumer, Weiner, etc.), where the Clintons and others began several NWO initiatives such as Sustainable Development, Community Policing, Educational Reform, and control over the global food and water supply.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shine the light on Paul Ryan's district of Racine, Wisconsin and we will expose the real truth to the world and their real agenda to control and enslave the globe.

              There are many people who are very afraid of Racine, Wisconsin being exposed. They have no problem murdering people, or down voting known truths.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is a weak link to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption that will expose the real elite involved up through the Pilgrims Society to the Council of 13.
