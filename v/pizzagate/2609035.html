<p><a href="http://jpninfo.com/12837">http://jpninfo.com/12837</a> Japanese Idol Culture has a dark side involving sexual harrassment. Since idols start young, I would not be surprised if some of the victims are children.</p>
<p><a href="http://goboiano.com/sex-and-yakuza-the-dark-side-of-the-j-pop-idol-industry/">http://goboiano.com/sex-and-yakuza-the-dark-side-of-the-j-pop-idol-industry/</a> Yakuza are heavily involved in &quot;Idol Culture&quot;. The girls are as young as 12. &quot;Manufactured Lives&quot; (the idols have ZERO control over their own lives and their wages are shit). Same problems of progression as Hollywood. Been a thing since the 70\'s.</p>

CP was only made illegal around 2015. General culture of obsession with young girls.</p>

Current Prime Minister is a fan of these sort of Idol groups. It is my suspiscion that the dark side of Japanese Work Culture combined with the dark side of Idol Culture are to blame for the declining birth rates in Japan. </p>

<p>From personal experience, Chapter 3 of the video game Danganronpa: Ultra Despair Girls is a commentary about Idol Culutre and Pedowood. The chief antagonist of said chapter is a child actress named Kotoko Usumi who was the victim of repeated severe sexual abuse. </p>
<p>Danganronpa is normally a Black Comedy. However, this game is dead fucking serious when it comes to the subject of child abuse and the psychologically destructive impact it has on children, especially in this chapter. I suspect that Mr. Kodaka (Danganronpa\'s author) knows about pedowood and may have been trying to use this game to red pill people about it.</p>
<p>-General Observations: I\'ve noted that the following elements of culture can be directly linked to pedophilia via being &quot;pedophile enablers&quot;. Goes with the &quot;pizzagate is a global problem&quot; theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Arranged Marriage. The logical conclusion to arranged marriage is tolerance of Child Marriage (note that children NEVER get a say on who their &quot;husband&quot; is). The two are often strongly correlated. Socities with arranged marriage tend to have lower age of consent laws (the correct age of consent is actually 18 since one is not truly an adult until the nervous system fully matures, thus 18 is the most scientifically correct age of consent). Therefore to fully fight pedophilia, arranged marriage needs to be banned on a global level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General cultural misogynistic attitudes regarding women, especially the idea that women = property. This logically leads to...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural views that the victims of rape are dirty instead of the right opinion to have ie &quot;only the rapist is dirty&quot;. This includes barbaric activity such as punishing the victim instead of the rapist. Includes the view that &quot;rape can be morally justified&quot;.</p>

<p>Far Left socities. This is the kind of stuff that tries to normalize pedophilia and other depravities.</p>

            LMAO hmm why would they biologically be able to rear children so long before theyre mentally able to understand sex.  fucking complete idiot labeling dozens of US states' electorates and lawmakers pedophiles.

             General cultural misogynistic attitudes regarding women, especially the idea that women = property. This logically leads to...
Cultural views that the victims of rape are dirty instead of the right opinion to have ie "only the rapist is dirty". This includes barbaric activity such as punishing the victim instead of the rapist. Includes the view that "rape can be morally justified".

            no, women = property would logically PERMIT rape you moron.  the stigmatization of rape victims is to prevent them by signaling that theres no reason a decent woman should even be in a position to be raped (i.e. alone with strange men).  I like how you judge and think youre wiser than thousands of years of accumulated history, fucking loser.

            Interesting thread darkknight. Does this predate WWII, or is this recent history? And I wonder how the rise of this cultural phenomenon lines up with Japan being a partner in our intelligence gathering operations. I.e. how much of this is deep state driven?

             Behold donkey defending rape again. Everytime he opens his mouth, he shows what a morally vile, evil, degenerate sub human pile of shit he really is, thus torpedoing his own credibility and ability for people to trust him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Claims he's so smart yet doesn't know that absolute truth about human biology regarding the last system to fully develop. Then again his views have always matched the enlightenment of a retarded troglydite.

              Donkey is part of a group that is not here for good. We've documented it numerous times. The thing is with these retards...they don't understand the concept of a "foil". While some are turned off by their vitriol and foulness, many of us simply grow stronger, more resilient, more committed, and the light keeps shining in the darkness and the darkness can't overcome it. :-) Donkey can cry and gnash his teeth forever, as far as I'm concerned. He is impotent.
