            Some discussion about the subject:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This is a series of private conversations, with absolutely no publice relevance. I think calls has been intercepted by some kind of private investigator to collect information for a divorce. Should not be here.
It seems it is an intercept of Vanna Marchi and her daughter, former television-seller and now under investigation for fraud charges. I recognize them ony based on their voices and accents, though the conversation topics give me no more clues.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Wikileaks does get alot of useless stuff sent to them, for example
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_purported_HIV_medical_status_results,_2008">
             Steve Jobs medical records
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Due to the contradictory dates, possible evidence of forgery, strong motivations for fabrication, and few motivations for a legitimate revelation, the images should not be taken at face value.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Edit: Not saying that people shouldn't try to figure out what they are about, but not all things on Wikileaks are relevant/true, though Wikileaks wiki seems to point out if there's some reason to suspect if they are real or not.

            She says her ex rang her asking, "Why are you ringing this psychiatrist, Dr Kumar? "
She says, 'I'm not calling him; he's calling me.'
He then said, 'Why are you telling him that I have ben sick for 12 years.'
'I said you are not well. It's a long time I'm worried.'
She says that in the convo he said, 'Why won't you let me see the children?'
Her response, 'It's not that I won't let you see them.  It's been decided by Social Services.  It's not about our decisions any more; it's what they decide.'
He didn't sound convinced.
I told him to do as they say.
He spoke to one of the children but the other was asleep.
Do what they tell you; go to the appointment.
Before going to appeal, things need to be done.
I had a conversation with the brother of Simon. It seems to me that there was a secret wall that opened at the parents' home.  He is convinced that Simon is mentally unwell.
There is the necessity for the family to collaborate with the psychiatrist.
Don't worry. Just be careful when (they) return he hasn't done something stupid.
Where are you going to stay?
I don't know.
Then the main speaker talks about what the lawyer said about 'curing' him with therapy by a psychiatrist.
She says the lawyer said legally you can't divorce someone who is incapacitated, so she has to wait.
They're talking about his access to the children and financial matters which can't be resolved until the husband recovers. He needs another six months therapy.

           <p>
            also on a side note: Podesta is an italian quite famous name if iam not wrong, i quote : "In the past, the Podesta was a high official in Italian republics of the medieval or early modern period." - there is a Guido Podestà which was president of the Milano region, from the same party of S. Berlusconi...wonder if they are somehow related..i will maybe try to dig more into this later and if i find something interesting will edit it in a proper comment...i believe its not because /pol or Reddit closed the link that its necessarily a dead end...still this file name bug me..

            yep ,hard to tell right, i read the whole thing too...dont really know what to think of it...when some of them speak of one of the girl "the blond one"..its not seems that they speak of their daughter or relatives...i saw also in comment that someone said that its related to this scam scandal, but i didnt noticed the perfect explanation of this link..also seems according to the audio that there is at least one men involved, Simon, who is him ?...maybe i will need to re-look at it...

            thanks. IF its really about them , good also to note thats its not only 2 random women, they was like some sort of TV stars when they have been accused to run the scam...
           </p>
           <p>
            Iam not italian so i use Google translating, also found a just new article about them (jan2017) if i understand it well, they have been suggested for participating in some TV show ("Celeb's Island" or something) ,but the show editor and director of the media compagny (the son of Berlusconi itself,ancient president of italy who ,him have been involved in some scandal of teens prostitution) decided otherwise, that they should not allow them to participate in it regarding to the past scam scandal they was involved in. could be not much important but i wanted to share for infos just in case...

            I remember this when it came out. A man listened to them for hours and translated, he said it was boring chit chat, and that unless they were talking in code, it was nothing.

             Yeah that's what it appears they are saying. And it was dumped prior to podesta I think, so it just makes you wonder why it's titled this. Very strange... but you're probably right it looks like pretty much nothing. Maybe some sort of pedo claims are why they are divorcing but I don't think it's brought up so the only suspect thing is the recording names... well hmm.

              I don't know why they named it that either. People theorized a few reasons but no one came up with a strong argument for the weird name. It sounded like one of the woman's husband was in big trouble and some thought maybe he raped a minor, but (IIRC) the women never directly said what her husband was in trouble for. Whatever it was, he was depressed and laying low somewhere.

              If there is code, we need more people to listen and translate. Unfortunately, doesn't seem to be too many Italian PGers around here.
