<p>The <em>three part expose\'</em> on <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> released on Wednesday by <strong>Julie K. Brown</strong> in the <strong><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">Miami Herald</a></strong> seems to corroborate and substantiate a few things that some of us have known and understood about our <strong>President Donald J. Trump</strong> for quite some time now <strong>AND</strong> gives us some very <em>clear and succinct</em>
  <strong><em>revelations about an ORCHESTRATED ATTACK ON AMERICA\'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE VERY CLEAR PIZZAGATE CONNECTIONS.</em></strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Miami Herald</strong> broke Wednesday with a huge 3 part series that outlines how the President\'s pick for <strong>Secretary of Labor Jim Acosta</strong> was the lead prosecutor that negotiated the <strong>sweetheart deal</strong> that <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> received as a plea for his <strong>sex crimes against children</strong>. Anyone with any amount of common sense cannot argue that this appointment happens to look very much like an obligation or <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1679409">thelema favor</a> that acolytes must bestow on others as a matter of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The damage that happened in this case is unconscionable,” said Bradley Edwards said about Acosta\'s of the hook negotiating with Epstein himself, a former state prosecutor who represents some of Epstein’s victims. “How in the world, do you, the U.S. attorney, engage in a negotiation with a criminal defendant, basically allowing that criminal defendant to write up the agreement?”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is something more revealing hidden in this expose that I\'ve written about before and that <strong>it was JEFFREY EPSTEIN\'S MONEY</strong>, along with the <strong>SANDLER CLAN</strong>, that I have written about here:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1738976">Handkerchief Email Revisited: The Sandler\'s, Saturday Night Live, and Chabad Lubavitch </a></p>
<p>...and here:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1794021"> The Sandler Foundation, D.Sussman, Pizzagate and the Death of Aaron Dover</a></p>
<p>...that ORCHESTRATED <strong>THE 2008 HOUSING MARKET CRASH.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Herald learned that, as part of the plea deal, Epstein provided what the government called “valuable consideration” for unspecified information he supplied to federal investigators. While the documents obtained by the Herald don’t detail what the information was, <strong>Epstein’s sex crime case happened just as the country’s subprime mortgage market collapsed, ushering in the 2008 global financial crisis.</strong></p>
<p>Records show that Epstein was a key federal witness in the criminal prosecution of two prominent executives with Bear Stearns, the global investment brokerage that failed in 2008, who were accused of corporate securities fraud. <strong>Epstein was one of the largest investors in the hedge fund managed by the executives</strong>, who were later acquitted. It is not known what role, if any, the case played in Epstein’s plea negotiations.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So here we have <strong>TWO</strong> very <strong>OBVIOUS</strong> and <strong>key</strong> examples of an avenue of attack on our financial institutions that lead back to the <strong>Clintons.</strong> It was the second attempt at <strong>softening and destroying certain very valued institutions in the financial market of America</strong> that effect each and every one of us. which is on par as damaging as the attack on America on 9/11.</p>
<p>Once again, all roads lead back to the <strong>BUSH/CLINTON CARTEL.</strong> trying to <em>destabilize</em> <strong>AMERICA!!!</strong></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>One could <em>only</em> (only those with a truly logical conspiratorial mind, mind you, <strong>pssst no MAGAS, Qtards or Qunts allowed</strong>) conclude that the <strong>Labor Department</strong> pick was a <strong>favor</strong> in lieu of that extraneous <strong>&quot;valuable consideration&quot;</strong> that <strong>Epstein</strong> had on everyone from <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> to <strong>Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States</strong> in their <strong>RABID</strong> attempt to install the <strong>New World Order</strong> and <strong>Israel\'s Third Temple to the God Ba\'al or Lucifer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trump is just another step in the deception</strong> so you Qtards better get your heads straight and really get in the game.</p>

            What's this Thelema favor shit? Thelema is related to Crowlean occultism, specifically. How does that relate?

             They all cover for each other because of their Crowleyite belief system and they're all in the club together you stupid stupid fuck

             This is the very last place I can say what I want when I want and NOT get censored so I'm going to use this to my advantage before the stupid assholes at this fucking place start censoring and banning based on fucking words I'M ALLOWED TO SAY... Most of you people are WAY beyond retarded and those of you that get off on this sick fucking satanic shit of a world and like to tease and cajole with your brand of sociopathic hate just know that I KNOW your entire fucking day is MISERABLE and that little bit of relief you get from your miserable self-loathing fucking life coming here to deny reality on the regular is just a tiny tiny fix that you WILL NEVER GET because that is your curse. You are about as stinky and pathetic as that Robert Robertson that used to harass people here with your shit filled underwear and your rotting out teeth about to open another ramen noodle for dinner smelling ass....

               You're killing your own credibility talking to me like that just because I asked about the Thelema shit. I didn't see anything in your long-winded piece that had anything to do with it, so I was inquiring.

            epstein is pizzagate he is an elite banker who operated his own island supplying minors to politicians and celebrities he has absolutely escaped prosecution and knows where all the bodies are buried he is a repeat predatory pedophile of the highest order and has to be involved in luciferian rituals as there is a temple on his island the media have ignored his story and nobody wants to talk about trumps involvement because we all think trump is going to save us its hard to reveal the truth without pissing off trump supporters unfortunately but you cannot suppress the truth they're all in it together

            That's pretty well known to be a trillion dollar banking bust.  Neither are bankers.  This was a huge and wide spread issue with mortgage bs and FDIC.  Neither of which are in the control of Epstein or Trump.

             Epstein was working for bear stearns options trading ..
the 2008 crash was a set up...theye build up.risk and coverage of risk in the age of easy credit ..it was a controlled demolition..
Just before the US treasury put the breaksnon easy credit ...they drove the price of oil up....
This created the defualts..ot at least starter for the crash ...
One has to understand the majority of thr stock market is held by govt composite funds...its an open secret ..

              I know it was a setup but It wasn't just bankers it was regulators turning a blind eye.  Everything economical is strategy from decades prior.  They played a role, I have zero doubt about that, but there's checks and balances that also played a role and ultimately it wasn't just a single investment firm it was most of them.  Remember they sold to others that bought them.  The movie Margin Call comes to mind.

              It doesn't make sense Bear Sterns would be solely responsible and knowingly do it because they're the ones that didn't milk FDIC and survive.  I still think JPMC is the king of America.  They have the world banking interests in America, they have the trillions circulating yearly.  They're the big bank that inherited Bear Sterns short positions on silver and did what they wanted for 10 years before giving lawmen a patsy.

              We could argue with these fuckin dolts the rest of our lives they're simply just trained to be idiots. I've never really expected much intellectual debate in this place and I never really got it from the many threads I have produced here anyway. It seems all most people have is just time for a few line blurbs here anyway. It seems as though a good 95% of the population really has no clue whats going on in their environment and even those that do have that mixed up with a bunch of kooky crazy bullshit. We are all seriously very very fucked. People are going to get mangled, blown up, tortured and destroyed in this next war in ALL manner of way because of the ignorance that has been allowed to propagate in this world. The programming is so intense and at such a scale we LITERALLY ELECTED a GROWN BABY MAN into office and we are arguing about who the fuck is worse when there's PLENTY of information CONDEMNING the both of them to fucking eternity.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is ONLY ONE EXPLANATION and it is the programming we have endured from the MK-ULTRA experiments that grew into an ALL ENCOMPASSING BRAINWASHING PROGRAM and IT IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

              Issue is it mentions nothing on Rothschilds.
             </p>
             <p>
              Deusnexus.wordpress.com was removed but at least talked about their role in the past 250 years on the world and playing their hand into controlling the Illuminati.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Illuminati was only 250 years old but explained Switzerland's rise after the Knights Templar 'disappeared'.  Why Switzerland was exempt from the world wars.  Why Switzerland is where the Jesuits have their kids educated.  Why Switzerland was exempt from banking audits and laws for so long.  Why Switzerland is home to the guards of the Vatican.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of this supposedly arose from Rome not falling but as people evolved and education became more available they broke their systems into more and more fragments and societies.  Illuminati being the last head to front up the American Revolution, the Freemasons, American Civil War, FBI and WWI, KGB and CIA and WW2, UN and Israel.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then you can ultimately tie together the Georgia Guidestones developed just before the CIA's Senior Executive Service (to reshape society) drafted when the stones were constructed and SES deployed the next year.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Georgia Guide stones, according to the wiki, were planned around the time the 3rd Fatima was read by the pope but not revealed because it was supposedly Albert Pikes scripture of WW3.  When you read the Albert Pike letter to Mazzini in 1871 it's easy to believe this was used to write the fatima's and script the world wars.
             </p>
             <p>
              Freemasons official site allmasons.com links to this site famousmasons.com/mason/?name=Albert-Pike&amp;i=772 and the list on there show the authors of the Declaration of Independence, creator of the FDIC and Albert Pike all joined the masons before being who they became decades later.

              The Georgia Guide stones are huge, and must have cost millions to make in the 70's.  They're in the middle of redneck country but have security cameras all over.  It's not a "private funder" but an organization that made and maintains them and supposedly they're being taken down.

              1871 was a big year, happened to be the year after the first tax to "repay the cost of the war".  A loan supposedly taken by Salmon Chase, Treasurer of the Union, from Rothschilds world bank.  Same world bank that a few decades later gave JP Morgan Chase the American interests branch to run.  Same bank given the Bear Sterns shorts position on silver after it collapsed in 2008, which they shorted and then bought millions of ounces since.

              Qresearch said Chase had 10 years impunity to short silver, while buying eventually to become the largest shareholder in the world, this board said it was up in October and guess what popps up in the news weeks later

              Either way.  I get there could be multiple NWO's but I don't know Russian.  I've read "putin bans rothschilds from russia" and returned to the gold standard.  I've read Putin is an orphan and was in the KGB and undid a lot of what Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton did.  Supposedly both Boris and Bill were NWO, which doesn't make sense for Putin to also be NWO and undo all that work.  Also doesn't make sense for North Korea to somewhat declare/want peace with Trump and Putin after splitting the Koreas from the first NWO war.

              It's hard, for me, to not picture Putin ridding Russia of the NWO and Trump trying to do the same.

               Questioning faulty logic isn't trolling.   Compiling info is great, but in this thread there is a complete failure to make logical conclusions from that info.

               If a cabal of pedos had serious dirt on Trump, he never would have been allowed to win the office.   They would have used it to destroy him a long time ago, probably close to the election so that no other candidate could have challenged Hillary.
              </p>
              <p>
               One cabinet pick vs having Hillary as POTUS - which do you think is more swamp-friendly?   People aren't using logic well enough here.

            your tiresome "not all Jews tho" bullshit is severely discrediting.
           </p>
           <p>
            the evidence is overwhelming that the identifiable group we call Jews, whatever their origins, are an extremely ethnocentric and destructive people from top to bottom.
           </p>
           <p>
            this fact and the independent existence of a 'Satanic elite cabal' of them are not mutually exclusive.
           </p>
           <p>
            indeed, the most logical conclusion would be that it is fortunate that (as you claim) the cabal chooses to "hide among Jews", for we can justifiably deport (vertically) the entire lot of them and kill two yids with one stone.
           </p>
           <p>
            precisely as we did in earlier centuries when the wider community covered up instances of satanic ritual child sacrifice they've memed into "blood libel."
           </p>
           <p>
            instead you go full-retard with the "hitler was a gay Rothschild baby" and portray the "Holocaust" as a real event, awakening the programmed sympathy for muh poor everyday Jews who dindu nuffin:

            also BS that Chabad is some fringe sect:

             https://i.imgsafe.org/1b/1b1199d4b4.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            non-Chabad, Sephardic Jewish supremacism is often mainstream: 800,000 Israelis attended their largest funeral ever for chief rabbi Yosef, who just like Schneerson said e.g. non-Jews are born to serve Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            the subject of your post here is a great example: not all Jews will be shysters, but the BIGGEST shysters will ALWAYS be Jews, as long as this 0.2% of humanity unfortunately exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            of course there's Mossad-blackmailer/child trafficker working with the biggest players of '08 crash.
           </p>
           <p>
            the mortgage bubble itself was from the Jewish insistence on extending credit to niggers, who only eventually moved into suburbs in the first place due to 1960s Jewish rabble-rousing.
           </p>
           <p>
            the last housing crisis was all Jews too, from 'junk bond king' Michael Milken's firm, which was also hugely pizzagate-related.
           </p>
           <p>
            it's just WHAT THEY DO.

              Jesus' human lineage is through the tribe of Judah. His paternal lineage is God the Father. He is the promised Savior and sacrificial Lamb of God. He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords. The first Church established by the Apostles and followers of Jesus the Christ were Hebrew descendants of Abraham. All Hebrews who rejected Christ, are not in the Body of Christ and do not have Eternal Life. God gave the goyim a chance to hear the Gospel and repent, AND MANY DID. They are grafted into the Body of Christ. The promise of redemption was first to the Hebrews, and then to the GENTILES.

             It Takes A Spillage...Of Blood... To Awaken PizzaGate - Pt 3

             A Black and White Handkerchief
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This series on Pizzagate has so far given short-shrift to the infamous “handkerchief”  email from Susan Sandler, daughter of a wealthy Jewish banker, to his paid lackey John Podesta. Since there’s still puzzlement among many visitors to reddit, 4chan, VOAT and other posting sites about that message, we’re doing the decryption.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the late summer of 2014, retired banker Herb Sandler was plotting how to recruit Swiss biotech billionaire Hanjoerg Wyss to become a donor to the Center for American Progress. (CAP), Podesta’s nonprofit legal arm. Sandler invited Wyss to visit his villa at Martha’s Vineyard without informing him that John Podesta would just happen to be there.
           </p>
           <p>
            The players among the Martha’s Vineyard set include:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Herb Sandler, owner of the Golden West subprime lender that caused Wachovia Bank’s failure in 2008 and its merger into Wells Fargo with a $25 billion federal bailout.
             </p>
            </li>

            The first reference from Wikileaks collection of Podesta emails is an August 8 invitation from Sandler to Wyss for the upcoming Labor Day holiday:  I will be at Martha's Vineyard, arriving August 23, departing September 2. My daughter, Susan, her husband Steve and a family friend will be with me. Will you be at the Vineyard at any time during that period, and, if so, would you like to get together?

            John Podesta is the unnamed “family friend”.
           </p>
           <p>
            On August 11 a response came from Debbie, who emails photos of her lovely and quite normal grandchildren. This elderly lady who could be a staffer for Wyss is obviously not clued into the pedophile parlance “grandchildren and children” refers not to family progeny but to one’s stable of adult and child partners for group sex. Hans later replied that he was available on the 24th and 25th. He came for the party held on the 26th.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the day after, August 27, Rob Mnookin emailed: Thank You Dear Herb, A short note to say how much Dale and I enjoyed last night. What a stimulating evening, thanks no doubt to the Sandler rules and the fantastic company. What a pleasure to see Susan again, and meet Steve, Mary and John, and Hans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: “Sandler rules” and “stimulating company”, possibly referring to sex toys in a touchy-feely game of blindfold domination. The next get-together was a bit rougher under the Podesta rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            On September 1, the day before Sandler’s departure, the ex-banker, daughter Susan and John Podesta hired a realtor named Kate to drive them to inspect rental properties. They visited a large rental home “at the end of the road” on Kuffie Point, which juts into Lake Tashmoo, along with considering other houses located by a park, facing the yacht club and at Stonewall Beach, all with minimal neighbors and out of hearing range of public places. Why seek out such isolated places?
           </p>
           <p>
            At around 4 p.m., the realtor dropped the trio off at the “Field house”, probably one of the larger rentals on Field Club Drive. The guest list for the end-of-summer party is not mentioned. On happy ending is that ever since the morning-after email exchange, savvy Kate was suddenly able to open her own interiors business instead of flogging rentals.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Kate. Tuesday, September 02, 2014 10:04 AM To: Sandler, Susan Cc: Sandler, Herbert  Subject: You left something at the Field house Susan &amp; Herb I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island. Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it. I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house. Safe travels to all Kate
           </p>
           <p>
            Question: How really difficult is it to find pillows in a sparely decorated vacation rental?
Susan immediately emails John Podesta, adding the extra code word “pizza”: Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you're busy, so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it. Susaner
           </p>
           <p>
            Why the big fuss over a handkerchief? How can a handkerchief be pizza-related? Why is the handkerchief on the kitchen island counter if the party-goers were slicing pizza on it? Are napkins or paper towels not included in a luxury resort home? And as one visitor to VOT put it: Who still uses a handkerchief in this day and age?
           </p>
           <p>
            The answers come from the same code used at Comet Pizza back in Chevy Chase. The handkerchief worn in a back pocket of jeans or shorts originated in the gay movement of the 1970s to identify one’s preferences in sexual roles, and soon got kinkier with the rising popularity of bondage, domination, sadomachism, golden showers (yellow) and coprophilia (brown).

             Domino’s pan pizza was not on the dinner menu. The main course was an underage girl delivered to the party. Drugged into semi-consciousness, she was put on the kitchen island, and probably taped down by the arms so as not to fall to the floor. Then the slapping and flogging with the Podesta rules, followed by oral sex and penetration, topped off by ejaculating on her, which accounts for the next morning’s sticky mess or “map”.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the guest departed in the early morning, the passed-out girl was left as is on the butcher block. Podesta tiptoes out, hails Uber and leaves behind his little sex slave for someone else to deal with. Kate returns and after an initial shock, is peeved that a naked girl covered with semen and red welts was left behind like a bag of garbage. If this discovery is reported by the housekeepers, then that means a pile of hush money for the local police.
            </p>
            <p>
             Susan forwards the message. John Podesta, the presidential adviser and boss of the most politically correct lobby on gay issues and women’s rights, answers curtly, “It’s mine”. No doubt he’d treat a pet dog better than a homeless girl. So what then happened must have been a big IOU of appreciation from Susan when she phones Kate to tell the girl to wash up and dress, and to put her on a plane back to Washington DC, where one of the female staffers from Comet Pizza will pick her up at Dulles Airport. His conscience cleared, Podesta’s back to human rights advocacy and lobbying for clients.

             On Christmas Eve 2014, a package is delivered to Herbert Sandler, who is a Jew who celebrates Hannukah earlier in the month. I was sent by John Podesta. Now try to pick up the odd elements in the thank-you note:

I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them. Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.

             OK, for the benefit of the slow pokes, the first sentence states “when changing strategies that have been long in place”, indicating a break in the accustomed game plan, the game being dominoes. “Pasta” is a code word for underage boy. “Sauce” is about group sex. The gift of cheese is therefore an insider joke, since "cheese" is a code word for preteen girls. Return of “my children and grandchildren” is a pun, since in code it also can mean his team of adult and child partners for group sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doubting Toms still don’t believe? Then what does his PS mean? “Do you think I’ll do better playing dominoes on cheese than on pasta?” If you can tell me how anyone can play dominoes on top of a bowl pasta or a plate of cheese, I’ll buy you a Domino’s pan pizza with extra anchovies, because it really stinks. Remember this inhumanely diabolical discussion was being held on Christmas Eve. If that's not blasphemy, what is?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It was just about a year ago that Jeffrey Epstein, the reclusive financier, was being charged with soliciting prostitutes in Palm Beach, Fla. He may now have another image problem on his hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             BusinessWeek reports that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Islands-based money-management firm, Financial Trust Company, is listed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a stakeholder in Bear Stearns‘s High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund, which became much easier to refer to in recent weeks as “Bear Stearns’ collapsing hedge fund.”

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jeffrey Epstein, an intensely private money manager with billionaire clients, has been caught up in a highly public scandal involving massages with teenage girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, Mr. Epstein’s name is back in the public eye, this time in connection with a debacle on Wall Street. The New York Post reported Monday that he was the “Major Investor No. 1″ described in a recently unsealed indictment as one of the three largest investors in two Bear Stearns hedge funds that collapsed. A spokesman for Mr. Epstein confirmed to the Post that he was the investor, who wasn’t identified in the indictment but was said to have had $57 million tied up in the funds shortly before they imploded early last summer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Major Investor No. 1 plays a big role in the indictment, which charges Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, two former hedge fund managers at Bear, with securities fraud and other crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The indictment said that in April 2007, the investor — whom we now know to be Mr. Epstein — told Mr. Cioffi he was thinking about pulling his money out of the fund. The funds had a bruising February and both funds lost money in March of that year.

             Pool Party Emails
            </strong>
            are a little obscure and confusing so I am going to take the time to run down what those
            <strong>
             WIKILEAKS
            </strong>
            emails were about and later try to tie them into what ever discussion might arise. This will help us get a better understanding of who the SANDLERS were in relation to The Clintons, Trump, and the PERIPHERY of ACTORS that some of you seem to think are out there ON YOUR SIDE LOL.

             A Senator running a gay escort service out of his D.C. townhouse!
            </p>
            <p>
             "Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank admitted to a two-year relationship with a male hooker, Steve Gobie, who ran a prostitution service out of Frank's apartment, after the Washington Times reported the affair, during a press conference on Aug. 25, 1989. The scandal nearly undid his career, but the Democratic congressman maintained that he had no knowledge that his home was being used as a brothel and kicked Gobie out once he learned what the escort had been doing there.

             Do you not think Trump uses a team of people to help make his picks for such positions?   I would think any pizza-related tips/suggestions for that pick came somewhere from that team rather than believe Trump is being blackmailed.

             What's so wrong with the very idea is that Trump would have been destroyed a long time ago by whatever it is you think they have on him - Hillary was the chosen one.
