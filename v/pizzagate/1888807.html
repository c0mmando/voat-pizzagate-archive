<p>&quot;The Rehoboth Beach home was torn down months after Brock sold it, amid much community opposition, so the buyer could divide the parcel and build two homes. It remains a vacant lot.&quot;</p>
<p>After reading it several times, the last part caught by attention.....as if it might be a clue into the &quot;blackmailing&quot; of David Brock by his former, former partner.</p>
<p>I then searched on that and found this article linking the beach house to Madeline McCann:</p>

February 2012: As London Metro Police link Maddie’s disappearance to the USA.
Note: this occurred 6 years after Brock took up with Alefantis and 5 years after Maddie disappeared.
Brock sold the Rehoboth Beach home to a MacLean, VA, realty, for well more than 1 million dollar, and which immediately tore it down without replacing it with other structures. This had to be Maddie’s home away from home with a lot of little bodies under the floors.

            Not a shill, Brock &amp; Alefantis are creepy AF...but...this type of real estate move isn't that unusual. I spend a lot of time on the south jersey shore and Delaware (Dewey beach near rehoboth)...million dollar houses are everywhere and regularly sold and torn down along the coastline. Typically they'll either stay vacant for a bit before new construction or new construction begins asap. Developers have been going nuts in that region for about 15yrs...million dollar homes get demolished and eventually a 5 million dollar compound goes up...now if that lot remains vacant for years...then you look at the developer who bought it. Either having money problems...OR maybe you're onto something if they are connected to the swamp.

             Right? Like who is this realty company, and do they buy properties to permanently wipe evidence? What's the deal with this, it seems like there's a possible link to the swamp. The CIA, Maclean, VA/census-free city, MK Ultra'd swamp.

That one (synt) is geared more to Podesta, &amp; Hillary it seems, and I was able to have a dialogue with the makers 1 time.  If you have seizures or blinking or flashing bothers you , you may not want to look. Actually they've been just as helpful as wikileaks.  We have done quite few threads on them. This is one

            Maclean VA realty company? That's CIA-land. Maclean is a census free place so no one can track the number of MK Ultra'd mother fuckers running around. Did the CIA actually buy the home and tear it down? This is a great find if we end up connecting any dots...it could tie US Gov to Maddie McCann.
