            The statistics are too easy for skeptics to attack. The 8 million figure (and other similar figures) are based on reports, i.e. number of reports of missing children made each year in the U.S. and so on. These statistics don't explain how many children are never found, or how many children have been missing for X amount of time that are still not found, etc. Then you can find different sources giving different statistics on how many children are found, and though the numbers usually don't add up (and especially since there are multiple organizations all keeping separate statistics), for the general public they're not going to notice these finer issues and will instead just grab the first source that tells them that the vast majority of the reports are resolved with the children being safely returned home.
           </p>
           <p>
            A much more important focus point is that it is nearly impossible to get the truly important data, i.e. being able to look up how many children have been missing for X amount of time, currently never found. This information isn't available, and that it's not available is rather concerning in itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few weeks ago I did attempt to find this information, and instead what I found was several sources all with conflicting claims/information/numbers, along with estimations that were downright alarming.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/01/800000_missing_kids_really.html">
             http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/01/800000_missing_kids_really.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a 1997 study estimated that only 5 percent of nonfamily abductions (in which a nonfamily member detains a child using force for more than an hour) get reported to police.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What in the actual fuck?
           </p>
           <p>
            In this source:
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/KeyFacts">
             http://www.missingkids.com/KeyFacts
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is claimed that
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             841 children have been successfully recovered as a result of the AMBER Alert program
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            as of 2015. That is less than 900 children over the course of more than a decade.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet this source:
            <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missing-children-idUSBRE83P14020120426">
             http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missing-children-idUSBRE83P14020120426
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            claims that
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             More than 99 percent of children reported missing in America in recent years have come home alive
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And just so on and so forth the longer I searched. Nothing adds up right.
           </p>
           <p>
            So rather than using statistics that are easy to pick apart depending on which of the many conflicting reports/sources that people use, it is far more disconcerting that there
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            so many conflicting reports/sources in which the numbers are not adding up.
           </p>
           <p>
            At best it's a case of severe negligence over a very serious matter, and at worst it is a case of deliberate smoke and mirrors.

            Mod's say "These are NOT the children We are Looking For"
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would we want to ignore the real missing children and only chase "GHOSTS" on pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            8 million children will go missing this year 2 million children will be victims of commercial sexual exploitation

           <p>
            People this is at the core of 'pizzagate', they say its about the children, but the MODS here say "NOT THESE CHILDREN"
           </p>
           <p>
            What are the children that are inclusive to pizzagate? Whom?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems that pizzagate wants to victim to be found, only ghosts to be chased, this 8 million is real, and locating one would BUST the pizzagate wide open with proof.
