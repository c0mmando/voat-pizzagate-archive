<p>Letter On Clergy Sex Abuse And The Abuse of Power</p>
<p>By Archbishop Lucas</p>
<p>August 25-26, 2018</p>
<p>Dear Brothers and Sisters Christ,</p>
<p>News in recent weeks has shown that a number of bishops and priests, over many years, have been personally responsible for the sins and crimes of sexual abuse of minors and the abuse of power. Many have been hurt and shamed by this abuse. This hurt and shame are enduring because they took place where people should have been safe and respected. My shame is deepened by the knowledge that so many in positions of responsibility and trust ignored the cries of the victims and turned away when those who are so dear to the Lord needed their protection and care.</p>
<p>Several days ago, I met with a representative group of our archdiocesan priests. We shared experiences of the pain and anger of our parishioners. We spoke of our own desire for proper accountability and for healing in the Church. Like so many of you, my brother priests are hurt and demoralized by what we have heard. Please let me encourage us all to turn to Christ and beg his companionship in these days. I am committing to fast and pray each Thursday, for mercy and healing for the Church, and I have invited our priests to join me.</p>
<p>In addition, the priests have encouraged me in my commitment to insist with the other bishops of this country that there be structures put in place for judging allegations of misconduct on the part of bishops. All must be able to have confidence that there are transparent and effective ways for bishops to be held accountable for their actions.</p>
<p>Here in the Archdiocese of Omaha, we remain committed to the protection of children, young people, and vulnerable adults. We remain committed to healing for victims of past abuse. In cooperation with members of law enforcement, we remain committed to responding deliberately and professionally to any claims of abuse. Anyone concerned about the actions of clergy or any Church worker should contact our Manager of Victim Outreach and Prevention, Mary Beth Hanus, at 402-827-3798 or toll-free at 1-888-808-9055.</p>
<p>Be assured of my prayers for all of you in the days ahead and of my gratitude for the privilege of serving as your archbishop.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours in Christ,</p>
<p>Most Reverend George J. Lucas</p>
<p>Archbishop of Omaha</p>
<p>This letter is Pizzagate related because it mentions Men in Power in the Catholic Church and their sexual abuse of Our Children. </p>
<p>I found it refreshing that the Abp. of Omaha, a place that we have researched as being compromised and of all places where the Franklin Scandal took place.  I am hoping somehow this Abp. is Sincere and will make a difference.  It takes Courage to Speak Out Now.</p>',

            I sort of think there should be push towards ending the celibacy requirements of catholic priests. If the current pope can come out against "discrimination" or abomination, maybe a movement ending celibacy could end the attraction of pedophile predators. Idk, is this a movement others have tried? It's interesting that JFK was hated by many for being catholic. He was scum in so many deviant ways, but his religion wasn't what got him killed. How about a "social media" movement ending celibacy in the catholic church? They hide behind it and they use it.

             Celibacy is a really really stupid idea. Sex is in human nature, and regarding it as a bad thing causes all kinds of problems. People need to get married and be faithful to their spouses, priests shouldn't try to be celibate. The first two people created were husband and wife, and God commanded us to be fruitful and multiply. Not to pretend we're God.

             Are you thinking married priests will be less prone to degeneracy? The church used to have married priests. They ended up trying to pass on their positions to their kids, and trying to amass wealth for their heirs from charitable contributions. Also, as vicars of Christ, who did not marry but gave himself completely, they can't be an ideal stand in if they have a family.

              I'm not saying it would end degeneracy, but I don't think celibacy helps either. You can't only think of the big fish. The small ones can be are attracted for degenerate reasons. Are you telling me pedophile priests are devout Catholics? Women and marriage tame moral men. This is for the purpose of having good and competent children to pass on their genetics and values. Men protect and provide in so many ways. How does promising a degenerate person a pass from a traditional relationship and family not attract degenerates from flocking and abusing just be they can and get away with it?

               Obviously, it doesn't. The primary reason for ordained celibacy is to follow the example of Jesus, as I understand it. But it isn't a doctrine of the Church, merely a norm. It's actually something that can be changed.

              Perhaps a reexamination of the Bible would answer this question. No man comes to the Father except through Christ, not except through a priest standing in for Christ.

             Hi there!  The RCC has refused to grant the priests celibacy before.  They have been pressured by the flock and to no avail.  I think it is a great idea, but knowing the pope he will come up with the wonderful idea of granting marriage to all of them which would bring up the problem with the gay priests.  Hah.  Can you imagine married gay priests in the Church.  LOL.

              I actually can imagine married gay priests, they have married lesbians in the Lutheran / Episcopalian / Methodist etc. denominations if I'm not mistaken. That would never be permitted in the Baptist church. Those guys have to hide it.

                My mom grew up Catholic. That Billy Joel song "Only The Good Die Young" is her anthem. She very recently converted to Judaism in her 2nd marriage. I can't get her to talk about what she went through other than "it's all for looks and show." My dad is Protestant. My mom has so much hatred and pain  towards the Catholic church, but she won't give specifics. I wasn't raised religious. Anyway, I know it's so much easier said than done and I know how the Roman Catholic  Church is heading/the possibilities (much like Judaism lol) , but how about trying a social media movement to spin it? A coworker of mine has very sick parents. They're Irish Catholic. Her parents renewed their vows and their priest spoke of evils plaguing the religion during the ceremony and speaking to him one on one. He said they're are few good leaders out there and to watch out.

                 I know a couple and she is Catholic and he is Jewish.  They are the nicest people ever.  He practices his faith to a certain degree but is not Orthodox in any way.  She goes along with him to these events.  She celebrates Christmas with all the trimmings and they exchange gifts I believe to keep things running smooth.  It's called give and take.  I believe there are many of these people just as in other faiths.  I don't think there are that many stringent and so many Holy Rollers and Orthodox left.  But what scares me is that along with people stopping to go to Church is that they have stopped believing in God.  People need to know they can pray without going to Church.  How we get people to do this that is the question.  Yes, there has to be some way that we can keep those that are outraged and to Keep the Faith.

                  Like I said, I wasn't raised religious. However, when you learn of these powerful people literally worshipping lucifer, it makes you think and it makes you believe. I live in downstate NY. You are shamed for being religious here. Religious of any kind, but especially Christian. I have no idea how to change that. If people can't believe or don't want to believe what the most evil do to children and babies, I'm at a loss when it comes to getting them to believe in God. It's just not intellectual enough, right?

                   You make a really good point there.  If people are too dumb believe in God when the Satanic Elites believe in the devil, well, that's says it all. There are pockets of the country where religion plays a big part, very Christian, or very far left will be no religion.  When it comes to religion people are stalwart and stubborn.  They don't notice either how evil the world has become.  So evil within the last 20 years even.  All they care about is the next new phone.

                    Not sure it has become more evil, but that new phone makes that information more accessible and that is an inconvenience that distracts from their bubble and the joy of their their new commodity. "VeryOffended, I'm old and I'm happy watching this. I don't need the stress of what you're telling me." This is a direct quote from my dad. How can I argue with that?

                     This is the Justice Dept.  arresting MS 13  and may be the start of a RICO case.  Things may be popping.  I have lived in a fog, like many others  till now and now I want nothing but reality My parents are 90.  I will not start preaching to them about their going to Church at this point.  It will shatter their whole world.  They hardly ever go anymore.  Actually their priest was very nice and told them if it is so hard for them to come they should watch TV Mass.  But of course they still send in their envelope.  Good God they need their money don't they, these darn priests.

                      I think you may have given me a start. Did you know that somehow? Lol. 
On Long Island (or in Long Island bc I've caught a lot of flack for that out of state) MS 13 is truly a huge unspoken problem despite what the president says and where he speaks here. I live in a safe area, but there are places you just don't go. Central Islip, Brentwood, Bay Shore, Wyandach, parts of Deer Park, Hicksville, parts of Amityville, Mastic Beach. The list can go on.

                       Yeah, well Mendota Cal is about 90% Hispanic and mostly Salvadoran which is where MS 13 come from.  They are in the Myrtle Beach area as well.   Their numbers are grossly misrepresented.

            This is very good news. More and more good bishops are speaking out, but it sure does take courage. Arbp. Vigano has reportedly activated a "dead man's switch" which will automatically release all the files he has on the Vatican and the Pope in case of his sudden death. He is currently a fugitive from Rome and his whereabouts are unknown. Michael Voris of Church Militant said they can confirm that Arbp Vigano lives in legitimate fear of his life.

             “In these times, it seems like the Great Accuser has been unchained and is attacking bishops. True, we are all sinners, we bishops. He tries to uncover the sins, so they are visible in order to scandalize the people. The Great Accuser, as he himself says to God in the first chapter of the Book of Job, ‘roams the earth looking for someone to accuse’ A bishop’s strength against the Great Accuser is prayer, that of Jesus and his own, and the humility of being chosen and remaining close to the people of God, without seeking an aristocratic life that removes this unction. Let us pray, today, for our bishops: for me, for those who are here, and for all the bishops throughout the world.”

            Just one question: I'm a lifelong Catholic, fairly well versed in Catholic teaching and culture, and I've never heard the term, "The Great Accuser".  This guy has the most surreal phraseology and the most backward morality I've ever seen. He twists the words of Jesus and the Bible into unrecognizable notions and turns God into a bastardized, low, smirking, oily character who endorses every word and action of the Holy Francis. I can't wait till he's gone, and we can fumigate the Church of him and his cronies.

             I cannot believe I am shocked.  I have thought that nothing he says could still shock me.  I agree with your entire description of this venomous pervert.  He is a Narcissist and we know what other group are Narcissists.  He is scouring the earth for Vigano.  If he is found dead we know where to look.   Here is a prayer I had forgotten.  It is a recommended prayer by exorcists and very good for Victims and those that have demons.  You should also read the end for it has an interesting piece about how the prayer was changed and by whom.

             httpswww.traditioninaction.org/religious/b009rpMichael.htm   The Prayer to St Michael the Archangel     It was written by Pope Leo XIII for a special reason.

             I am going to say this everyday now.   I tried to help the person Brandon and sent him many links and much information regarding his SRA and the demons.  It took me 7 hours to finish it all.  My laptop screen kept turning white and things kept disappearing.  Over and over.  I never had such a problem.  I believe the devil was at work.

               I have said mine 2 days now and will not stop.  I have the Rosary but no holy water. I don't even know how to get any, anymore.  It's been so long.  I don't trust any priest I know.  I am afraid it will be blessed by a pedo priest!    I have even been checking out vintage scapulars.  But my Virgin Mary statue stands at the front door.  The devil lays under her feet.  Next to her is an umbrella stand with pointy umbrellas.  She will take care of him if he darkens this door. LOL.

              Bravo, Carmencita! I'm printing this and carrying it with me till I memorize it. That and Hail Holy Queen. If only congregations addressed by shameful priests/bishops would chant this prayer over and above their sermons each time till the message carries. Somewhat like singing "we will overcome".

               Yes!  If I were a Victim (which I thank God I'm not) I would recite this every hour of the day.  What moves me is that Pope Leo was at a dangerous crossroads just as we are now and that's why he came up with that prayer.  I will keep posting it in the comments in appropriate posts.  This is good for Catholics, Christians, Protestants, whatever faith really that believes in the devil.  That is the problem, people have been led to believe his is not around.  But he is, that is why our people have fallen just like before the fall of Rome.  This is frightening, where our country is today.  This must be turned around.  I will say the prayer before going to bed.  I have a Blessed Virgin statue and she stands atop satan.  As she should be.

              Sedevacantism is the position, held by some traditionalist Catholics,[1][2] that the present occupier of the Holy See is not truly pope due to the mainstream church's espousal of the heresy of modernism and that, for lack of a valid pope, the See has been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII in 1958.

             This was my question.  That is something he did not mention.  I commend him for speaking out, many have been ostracized and attacked for doing so by the Vatican. Yes, all this is making me SMH too.

                 I hope that something comes of all of the letters that were signed.  There were over 37K women that signed a letter to the pope and over 10K of men so far. I am hearing a lot of things but nothing happens.  Except the pope having his spies go after Vigano.  Poor Vigano now has a dead man's switch for his documents to be released.  I am praying for him today and night.

                   I agree.  HennyPenny and I both thought tents and Masses in the park would be a good start.  Parks for the summer and heated tents for the winter.  The Hispanic community has to be forced to speak out.  Those poor people I think give a bundle to the church.  Creatures of habit.  Like the rest.

             that is akin to reporting a Scientologist to someone within Scientology, they'll ignore it, and help them cover it up. I'd report to the cops, never ask questions to the church itself.

             Hmm.  You make a good point.  I think I would call police and maybe then contact a church in this diocese? He says he will cooperate and wants to change things for seminarians.  But at this point there must be some we can trust.  It's hard to know who to trust.  Vigano is a good guy and a few that stood up for him. Sigh.  This is frustrating.
