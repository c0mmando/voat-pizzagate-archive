We have now discovered the taking of children from everywhere on the globe, and the few places we haven\'t found a direct connection to the removal of children we have found other connections to the syndicate. Other than awareness and tough talk, what are we expecting to accomplish? How many of us have arms and have used them? Of those how many are prepared to draw them against their government? In case we haven\'t realized already the criminals we\'re discussing here are not JUST the ones with all the money, they also the ones in control of most of the militaries, all the banks, electricity, oil, water, information, etc in the world. We have to be able to say that at least temporarily were ready to go back in time in terms of service and capabilities in order to correct this, and on top of that we have to accept not everyone affected will follow suit. Then, on top of all of that we have to have a plan, on not just how to handle the people and areas that are willing to change, but how to prevent this from happening again. I hope no one is dumb enough to think that comet ping pong getting shut down, or even best case Clinton Foundation getting shut down, and even top tier go to prison, that it will change a damn thing. These people are the biggest players we know of in a plot that is larger than anything we\'ve ever imagined. I think everyone involved needs to honestly think about how big or small they are in the entire world, how big or small those they\'re trying to expose are, which has the most to lose and how far that person is likely to go to prevent that loss from taking place. If anyone is thinking that they\'re going to open everyone\'s eyes and then walk away, they\'re mistaken. Honestly if you have something to lose, and think the ten seconds of recognition, or hundred upvotes you may get, are going to suffice.... Well make sure someone actually realizes you\'re a martyr. The one person who had the greatest effect on this whole project can\'t even get a consensus on his status, and he had government protection.</p>
