            The pope is running interference.  He is in charge of an organization that has to bring in the big bucks to pay for the abuse and also make up the loss in contributions from people leaving the Church.  People are on to the fact that the Church is not serious about fixing the problem.  They put this guy in charge because he is a good BSer.  I am no longer a practicing Catholic for years now.  I was hoping for a breath of fresh air from Francis, but now I realize after much research how deeply involved the Vatican and many Archdiocese in the US are involved in the Trafficking and Organ Harvesting.  It is disgusting and vile, at best.

            I do not believe that the Pope wants to fix this problem.   He runs around the world lecturing people with a point of view not too far from Nancy Pelosi's.

            She made it clear that Pope Francis wants to fix the problem, but has also criticized him for being too forgiving with the abusers.

           <p>
            I thought this part was interesting though:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Collins said "the last straw" was when she discovered that the Curia had been ignoring a specific request by the pope, on the commission's recommendation, that all correspondence to the Vatican from abuse victims should receive a response.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the Church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors," she said."
