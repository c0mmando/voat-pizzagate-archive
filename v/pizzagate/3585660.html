<p>Pastor Robert J. “Bob” Coy, founder of Florida’s biggest megachurch, is accused of molesting a 4-year-old-girl.</p>
<p>Coy, the founder and former Senior Pastor of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, sexually abused at least one girl for over a decade, starting when the victim was only 4-years-old.</p>
<p>The victim told police that Pastor Coy sexually abused her for years. According to reports Pastor Coy forced the girl to perform orals sex, would regularly “finger and fondle her” genitals, and would regularly engage the child in “dirty talk.”</p>
<p>In 2015, a California woman called Coral Springs police when she learned of the alleged longtime abuse of her daughter by Coy while he was at Calvary. According to the police report, the woman’s daughter, then in her teens, confirmed the account to police.</p>
<p>Coy, the victim told police, forced her to perform oral sex, inappropriately touched her and had her touch his penis. The abuse stopped when she hit her teen years, she said.</p>
<p>Calvary Chapel is one of the largest and fastest growing churches in the United States. However, the church has been plagued with allegations of protecting pedophiles and sexually abusing children. The Miami New Times reports:</p>
<p>The revelations come at a sensitive moment for Calvary’s national network of about 1,800 churches, which have been riven by legal infighting and dogged by claims that bad pastors have been allowed to run amok. In fact, at least eight pastors,  staff members and volunteers in Calvary Chapel’s network around the United States have been charged with abusing children since 2010. In one case, victims claimed the church knowingly moved a pedophile to another city without warning parents.</p>

            I once visited Calvary with my former wife and at the time, 3 year old daughter. When we walked in, we were greeted by a woman who was attempting to quickly usher us into the main room and wanted to take our daughter and simply tell us what room she could be located in after service. We both looked at each other like that was one of the strangest receptions we ever received at a "place of worship". We made it clear that we would walk to the room with her, inspect the room and meet those watching the children before even thinking of leaving her alone. The woman adamantly refused and said this was against church policy. My wife said maybe, I took a stand, said no and told the woman that we would not be returning and that others would hear this story from us for years to come. My instinct told me something was very very wrong, and it feels surreal to see this here so many years later. I knew something was wrong there, but i didn't know it was this.. THANK YOU GOD FOR WARNING US

             Wow, great recount and it really is like God's work putting this here and exposing that church. You must feel a sense of relief knowing you dodged a very serious bullet regarding your daughter. More parents need to here your story along with this recent arrest and expose Calvary. Just sick bastards. No different really from Catholic churches. Not saying all Catholics are bad but look at the record and imagine all the unreported cases as well

              Bingo. You are correct. He’s got friends in high places that are just as sick and evil as he is. You can bet he’s providing them imo. It’s what they do. This girl is recanting and forgiving. You can bet she’s not the only one and that’s why others have been kept quiet  as well.

            This is from a few years ago, but, still good to point it out.  Most megachurches aren't teaching the Bible and the message of Jesus anyway, and then they are a cover for very nefarious things.  Bob Coy had the Fort Lauderdale police on his side.  Very sad situation.

             So...is she saying he did these things but she forgives him? Or is she recanting all charges? Two different things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally I don't feel that a charge like that gets to be "forgiven". Just like murder is murder, child abuse is still child abuse, regardless of how the child feels about it. That's why we have things like stat rape laws. 😠

              Possible threats or she needs serious psychiatric help. I can’t even imagine the damage that was done to her mind. In my other comment I mention he had ties to George Bush &amp; Netanyahu. Possibly she was with them too? Idk but anyone this perverted would do something that evil. I agree no forgiveness.

               Yes, I stress over that forgiveness thing regarding my own children and the perpetrators Sadly not ONE damn court or human rights, (certainly not the Hague) did anything. What they did was then harass me and blacklist me. Yup, no forgiveness, not in my heart at the moment for these kind of sick evil scum.

                I’m not a bit surprised. They come out and give their fake speeches for injustice but when it’s for real time they are not to be found. We also know all these Big Shot Orgs named for protecting Our Children well, have had leaders arrested for defiling them.

                For 2020 I wish you peace and love ❤️ and that you find some justice. If you never find the justice you seek and wish for, then I hope you will find love and peace will suffice. You will be in my prayers. 🙏

              Not that bad. Bush connections should be looked into. May lead to something. Also he and his wife filed for divorce Broward County. Possible Steve Israel as well?
