<p><strong>This is not &quot;big news&quot; but I felt I should post it</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 2012 Rolling Stone reported on the design of a No Age T-shirt, a band performing at Comet in November,</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/frXLz/dd3d6f66dc309c9d77da7c687488de9f555b6d3f.jpg">with this disturbing photo</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>I\'m not accusing anyone associated with Comet Ping Pong and Pizza of child sexual abuse.  </p>
<h3>I am pointing out another indirect hint of pro-sexual abuse of children tied to CPP&amp;P restaurant.</h3>
<p>In this case it is the name of a <a href="http://archive.is/xQb2g">band being hosted by Comet in November 2017:  <strong>No Age.</strong></a>  While searching images I saw their T-shirt in <a href="http://archive.is/frXLz">Rolling Stone</a> on a girl who <a href="https://archive.is/frXLz/dd3d6f66dc309c9d77da7c687488de9f555b6d3f.jpg">appeared to be a minor dressed in a basically micro-mini skirt on a swing.</a> </p>
<p>Which led me to the journalist, Colleen Nika.  Assuming she had no involvement with the image chosen, following a hunch I looked into some of her other work. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<hr />
<h2>Colleen Nika cover stories on child actors for Dazed magazine attempt to normalize pedophilia</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com"><strong>Dazed</strong></a> is a British youth magazine formerly called Dazed and Confused.  By the way it is associated with infamous photographer Terry Richardson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>NSFW:</strong>  <a href="http://archive.is/b9z5F">Dazed employs and promotes Terry Richardson</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you\'re not familiar with him:  <strong>NSFW:</strong> <a href="http://archive.is/EKEgn">Richardson is an alleged sex abuser of young models; takes creepy pizza photos</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, two cover stories for Dazed by Colleen Nika that I came across include <strong>passing references that call to mind, promote, condone, or normalize the depraved sexualization of children,</strong> and I think are worth noting.</p>
<p>At the least, Colleen Nika appears to be involved in promoting the sexualization of minors for the Cabal puppeteers behind much of media.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://archive.is/Aq88i">Winter 2016</a> cover story on 12-year-old actress Millie Bobby Brown, who was in Netflix\'s &quot;Stranger Things,&quot; Colleen Nika began by implying the actress\'s character\'s <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4409/36541371441_9296443a73_o.gif">torture-induced telekinetic stare</a> was <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/35842760284_7bee8f98c5_o.png">&quot;sultry.&quot;</a>  And <a href="http://archive.is/pjB2q">the paragraph didn\'t get better from there.</a>  </p>
<p>It is inappropriate to characterize this girl\'s performance in this way, no one sees it that way except pedophiles.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="http://archive.is/2JueE">two-cover issue,</a> in the <a href="http://archive.is/TRwqT">other cover story about 13-year-old &quot;Stranger Things&quot; actor Finn Wolfhard,</a> Colleen Nika double punches the reader with the title and the first sentence. </p>
<p>The title &quot;Finn Wolfhard: Sci-Fi \'It-boy\'&quot; references an objectifying term originally coined for <strong>a young person of consenting age</strong> in <a href="http://archive.is/bicZg">elite society who is nonchalent about their sex appeal.</a>  </p>
<p>The first sentence, “I got out of the car and I just heard men – like, full-grown men – screaming, ‘Finn, Finn, Finn!’”  <strong>sets the tone of the article: normalization of pedophilia.</strong></p>
<p>About halfway down, she states the young actor will be portraying a character in the film &quot;It.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who approves imagery and words in magazines that appeal to child sexual abusers and normalize pedophilia?  <a href="http://archive.is/MeAZl">Chron.com</a> describes tasks often assigned by magazine editors\' titles.  <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4370/35869556813_7cb2548633_o.png">Excerpt</a></p>
<p>How do we get the public aware of the tentacles of this media monster that panders to child sexual abuse?  </p>
<p>We have to continue as we have been to make people aware of the attempted &quot;normalization&quot; of pedophilia, which TPTP are trying to achieve, in their pursuit of a total breakdown of protection for children from becoming sexual objects to predators, with their sadistic message that there is no age too young for sex with an older person or for sexuality in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>Illuminati weakening of society through sexualization of children -- a large 2013 study of children and teens found that casual sex is linked to suicidal thoughts</h2>
<p>This Ohio State University study followed 10,000 children and teens from age 12 to 18 (grades 7 - 12) until they were ages 18 to 26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Casual sex can cause depression and can even lead to thoughts of suicide, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Dr Sara Sandberg-Thoma, of Ohio State University and lead author of the study, said: \'Several studies have found a link between poor mental health and casual sex...There\'s always been a question about which one is the cause and which is the effect.\'</p>
<p>\'This study provides evidence that poor mental health can lead to casual sex, but also that casual sex leads to additional declines in mental health...The link...was found to be the same for both men and women </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/Hg9pV">http://archive.is/Hg9pV</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among adults young and old, it is known sex can cause feelings of sadness, anxiety, regret, restlessness, and irritability in many men and women, of some duration, but especially casual sex according to Michael Krychman, MD who theorizes <strong>hormonal shifts could be to blame:</strong> <a href="http://archive.is/s4Dzo">http://archive.is/s4Dzo</a>.  So the OSU study\'s findings are not surprising concerning the <strong>youth</strong> of America!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article in the preceeding paragraph mentions hormones could be to blame.</p>
<p>This led me to five interesting articles on hormonal system and life disruption caused by CSA, physical abuse during childhood, and casual sex.  I\'m not a scientist nor doctor so I can\'t judge the science behind them but they make compelling reading. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.)   I\'m guessing one reason the Cabal wants youngsters to be &quot;sexually active&quot; is due to girls\' minds becoming clouded by the drug oxytocin, described in this article but in terms of consenting adult women.  It brought to mind the <strong>&quot;temporarily missing teens&quot; in Virginia;</strong> I have wondered whether MS-13 pimps or others seduce girls, lure them away, then sex traffic them or use them as drug couriers, then return them, and repeat? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What does oxytocin do?&quot;</p>
<p>When applied to casual sex, oxytocin can create a sense of attachment to someone we [women] <strong>don\'t really know that well.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does it create a <strong>greater sense of attachment,</strong> it also enhances the <strong>trust circuits</strong> in our brains. Brizendine writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These hormones activate the brain circuits for nurturing behavior while <strong>switching off the caution and aversion circuits.</strong> In other words, when high levels of oxytocin and dopamine are circulating, <strong>your judgment is toast.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/Rhhup">http://archive.is/Rhhup</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.)  This article <a href="http://archive.is/9XxJK">http://archive.is/9XxJK</a> reports, &quot;it appears that oxytocin is not released with traumatic sexual encounters.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.)  This article discusses a 23-year study of CSA survivors, girls who at the start of the study in 1987 ranged in age from 6 to 16: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The cortisol levels (of some study participants) wound up looking like Vietnam vets,” says study co-author Dr. Frank Putnam, professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Medical Center. “That tells us they are in a chronic state of stress, and never feel safe.”</p>
<p>During the last assessment, when study participants were in their 20s, their cortisol levels remained lower than the control group, on average. “That tells us their stress response system is burned out,” says Putman</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/MTz4f">http://archive.is/MTz4f</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.)  I\'m it sure how this ties in:</p>
<p>Another study found girls ages 8 - 11 who had been (physically) abused had average baseline oxytocin levels three times higher than non-abused girls.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Surprisingly, girls who had experienced physical abuse didn’t show a cortisol [fight or flight] response to stress at all.  Instead, they have a spike of oxytocin during stress.”</p>
<p>Among the abused boys and children without abuse experience, the stress elicited the expected cortisol rush and no oxytocin response.</p>
<p><strong>“...release of oxytocin in a stressful or threatening situation or in the context of an inappropriate sexual partner or peer may lead to trouble for these girls,”</strong> Pollak says. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/ouczS">http://archive.is/ouczS</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.)   Another article (this study was done on mice), titled &quot;\'Love hormone\' is two-faced: Oxytocin strengthens bad memories and can increase fear and anxiety&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oxytocin appears to be the reason stressful social situations, perhaps being bullied at school or tormented by a boss, reverberate long past the event and can trigger fear and anxiety in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170819215055/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130722123206.htm">https://web.archive.org/web/20170819215055/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130722123206.htm</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Basically the Cabal in its aim for overall societal vulnerability uses the media to promote:  minors &quot;choosing to be sexually active,&quot; CSA, casual sex, and other non-loving sexual encounters.  But fortunately people are waking up and seeing through their desperate drivel.</p>
<p>As for the hormonal disruptions, knowledge is power, positive thinking goes a long way but isn\'t enough -- in my humble opinion there\'s no doubt the future holds remedies for these maladies.</p>',

           How do we get the public aware of the tentacles of this media monster that panders to child sexual abuse?
          </p>
          <p>
           We have to continue as we have been to make people aware of the attempted "normalization" of pedophilia, which TPTP are trying to achieve, in their pursuit of a total breakdown of protection for children from becoming sexual objects to predators, with their sadistic message that there is no age too young for sex with an older person or for sexuality in general.

           Illuminati weakening of society through sexualization of children -- a large 2013 study of children and teens found that casual sex is linked to suicidal thoughts

           This Ohio State University study followed 10,000 children and teens from age 12 to 18 (grades 7 - 12) until they were ages 18 to 26:

            Dr Sara Sandberg-Thoma, of Ohio State University and lead author of the study, said: 'Several studies have found a link between poor mental health and casual sex...There's always been a question about which one is the cause and which is the effect.'

           Among adults young and old, it is known sex can cause feelings of sadness, anxiety, regret, restlessness, and irritability in many men and women, of some duration, but especially casual sex according to Michael Krychman, MD who theorizes
           <strong>

          <p>
           This led me to five interesting articles on hormonal system and life disruption caused by CSA, physical abuse during childhood, and casual sex.  I'm not a scientist nor doctor so I can't judge the science behind them but they make compelling reading.

           1.)   I'm guessing one reason the Cabal wants youngsters to be "sexually active" is due to girls' minds becoming clouded by the drug oxytocin, described in this article but in terms of consenting adult women.  It brought to mind the
           <strong>
            "temporarily missing teens" in Virginia;
           </strong>
           I have wondered whether MS-13 pimps or others seduce girls, lure them away, then sex traffic them or use them as drug couriers, then return them, and repeat?

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "What does oxytocin do?"
           </p>
           <p>
            When applied to casual sex, oxytocin can create a sense of attachment to someone we [women]
            <strong>
             don't really know that well.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only does it create a
            <strong>
             greater sense of attachment,
            </strong>
            it also enhances the
            <strong>
             trust circuits
            </strong>
            in our brains. Brizendine writes:

              switching off the caution and aversion circuits.

             In other words, when high levels of oxytocin and dopamine are circulating,

           </p>
           <p>
            During the last assessment, when study participants were in their 20s, their cortisol levels remained lower than the control group, on average. “That tells us their stress response system is burned out,” says Putman

          </p>
          <p>
           Another study found girls ages 8 - 11 who had been (physically) abused had average baseline oxytocin levels three times higher than non-abused girls.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "Surprisingly, girls who had experienced physical abuse didn’t show a cortisol [fight or flight] response to stress at all.  Instead, they have a spike of oxytocin during stress.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the abused boys and children without abuse experience, the stress elicited the expected cortisol rush and no oxytocin response.

            <strong>
             “...release of oxytocin in a stressful or threatening situation or in the context of an inappropriate sexual partner or peer may lead to trouble for these girls,”

           Basically the Cabal in its aim for overall societal vulnerability uses the media to promote:  minors "choosing to be sexually active," CSA, casual sex, and other non-loving sexual encounters.  But fortunately people are waking up and seeing through their desperate drivel.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for the hormonal disruptions, knowledge is power, positive thinking goes a long way but isn't enough -- in my humble opinion there's no doubt the future holds remedies for these maladies.

            there is no question in my mind that the deep state know what they are doing in terms of child/adult psychology. it was developed in east germany with the Stasi, they know their stuff. however, i do think these article excerpts fail to acknowledge the role of blame, condemnation and guilt as i know this was most of what was damaging to me as a teenager. i mean really, nobody sat me down and talked with me about the consequences of early sexual activity. (i was also in love) and also, i would just like to point out about the above post, that having sexual feelings at that age is completely normal - everyone i knew did! (o;

            and as for the pic of the girl on the swing, i think the t-shirt is trying to promote the idea of all ages shows. that's a huge issue for early teens. and as for the skirt being "micro-mini," that's pretty much how girls dress, i know when i wasn't in school i sure did and so did my friends. girls basically dress for each other for the most part. i actually think she looks cute, but i'm not a pedo so ....

            Sounds like encouraging early expression of sexuality not only causes stress on mental health but can result in a pathway towards increased susceptibility to ending up with 'battered wife syndrome'.

            It's a way to control people and make them want to be (or addicted to) being controlled.
