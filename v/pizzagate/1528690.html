           I'm mostly deciphering the  lyrics of The Apes. One song mentions "We walk with our night shoes on" over and over. Could be symbolic but here are some images of night shoe lights. Maybe someone will come across them in other research;

            Okay, this is just speculation and I'm sorry I can't find the reference for it, BUT:
           </p>
           <p>
            At one point I viewed the images on J.A. Instagram and I then followed the people who left comments to their Instagram pages (and beyond) and it goes without saying that there were loads of creepy pictures. I went WAY down the rabbit hole for days, until my Soul nearly died. I was wrecked.
           </p>
           <p>
            One picture stood out regarding SHOES and is has been in my mind for weeks.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was just a picture of someone wearing basic cheap shoes or sneakers (nothing special), but they shoes were covered with clear plastic (disposable) "booties" and tied around the ankle.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a dumb looking image, certainly had no value as pic, other than the symbolism. It was on Instagram for sure, just can't remember where! So sorry.
           </p>
           <p>
            In light of all of the pictures, I took it to mean that somehow the shoes had to be protected from something, but what?
           </p>
           <p>
            BLOOD -- like blood on a floor perhaps.
           </p>
           <p>
            And suddenly, the connection between RED SHOES and those plastic covered regular shoes made sense!
           </p>
           <p>
            The RED SHOES are shoes soaked with blood from victims on the floor of a place where such of these things is done and the plastic covered shoes depicted in the pic on a creep's page, was a symbol of the same thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as the "art" images of kid's wearing red shoes and other pictures we've seen of the adult men wearing the red shows, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            BLOOD.
           </p>
           <p>
            The RED shoes are symbols of BLOODY shoes as well as the plastic covered shoes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is another sick inside joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: This was not THE picture, but it was a picture similar to this that was on Instagram. The picture had NO context, yet tons of weird comments that had nothing to do with shoes or a need for shoe protectors. The actual pic on Instagram sort of had a draw-string at the ankle and the plastic extended above the draw strong.

            Yes you are right. Obama will be living two doors over. I think also that some underground place also goes near there as well. Maybe someone that has been working on those maps will let us know. What gets me is that He and Michelle were still paying off their college loans when elected. Now he will be paying 22K per month for rent. Something is rotten in Denmark &amp; DC.
