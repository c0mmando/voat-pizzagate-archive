           <p>
            Also one last comment on Thailand. Thai people are based as fuck. 
My very first inkling that there was some research to be done on the Jews came from a group of Thai people. I'll explain.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was in Koh Phangan in 2007 and one night i was walking home to my little beach hut i was living in. I was living fairly modestly at the time and as i was walking home i decide to stop for some food. I picked the nicest looking restaurant as i was willing to treat myself to a nice meal in what looked like an nice establishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            So i go in and the place is deserted. The waiter comes over and takes my order. I get served, i eat, i pay and i leave. As soon as i walked out into the street the group of Thai people sitting on the steps outside their home/business (cant quite remember) called me over. They said to me "you shouldn't eat in there". I said why? They said without a moment hesitation that they are Jews and went on to explain why i should support Thai people instead of those parasites. I don't think they used the word parasites but that was definitely the point they got across to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember thinking oh my God. Up until this point these Thai people seemed like the nicest most genuinely loving people i ever had the privilege of meeting. It made me wonder. I didn't dismiss them much to my delight looking back. I trusted my instinct and so my journey of discovery began. 9-11 was the next big wake up call for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I build high rise building for a living and although at that time in 2001 i was still studying and like most i didn't question anything. By 2008 i had lots of experience but still hadn't given 911 a second thought until a friend introduced me to a doco on the subject. Thats when everything really clicked into place for me and i took my investigations to the next level.
           </p>
           <p>
            While we serve our master the Thai people openly hate them and call them out. Based as fuck.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact i wonder who decided to tarnish them with the idea that the whole country is a cesspit, rampant with the sexual abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its our job to be careful who's propaganda we propagate. So many westerners spread the Jewish version of Thailand. They are very aware of the hatred of them in Thailand but they don't care. They are still brazing as fuck. Even more brazing than in the west because they can still hide in the west.
           </p>
           <p>
            they can't hide in Thailand so they don't bother.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thai people are far more based than most pathetic westerners.

            So here is another person calling out Craig Sawyer for being a child trafficker. He just happened to be at the Thai cave rescue.. This is starting to sound like it was a planned trafficking operation but Mother Nature stepped in and said, nope not today!!

            Elon Musk seems to have gone off his rocker. First there was that feud with his father, then his tweeting about some supposed private buyback scheme that wasn't true, now this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some journalists took the time to track down the common-law partner of Vernon Unsworth.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's 40.

            She's one of those Asian women who doesn't seem to age at a normal rate, and she really does look like a twenty-something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, they met 7 years ago when he was 56 and she was 33.
           </p>
           <p>
            No child bride, just Elon Musk looking at a photo and going off on a Twitter rant . . .

            lol, I've just read Musk's message to the journalist.  He's obviously been told something by someone who knows the pedo. Good on Musk.  I hear that Musk these days spends his time high on drugs.

             Yea I feel someone with as much to lose as Musk wouldn't make such a bold claim unless he had some solid evidence to back it. Will be interesting to watch unfold.. (grabs popcorn)

            Did you know that it has been reported that the children heard dogs barking, chickens and many people in the caves when they were being rescued? The caves are obviously used for criminal activity. Musk however, is part of the scientific fraud and green energy scam. Tesla is state apparatus as is google, amazon, facebook, apple etc...Spook companies. Musk might be a case of one in that 'field" recognizing a fellow perv fraud. Who knows.

             Oo no I haven't heard that.. Can you provide a link or source to where you heard this? I'll have a search and see what I can find. Quite bizzare if it's true as I felt this whole "cave rescue" was suss to start with. I mean Chris Sawyer was there and Fiona Barnett has confirmed him as CIA

Straight up forget the rest of the banter...this is easy to prove and if it is true throw him in a fucking volcano and be done with it. Is he suing Elon? Clue #2 that things might be rotten in Denmark or I suppose Thailand here. Get on it hivemind!!

             He never said Unsworth is married to a 12 year old.  He said he came to Thailand for a 12 year old child bride.  That was 30-40 years ago.

              Yes you are right I should have said WAS he married to a 12 yo or not sorry. Believe me I am almost voting for EM here as I hope that someone wouldnt make up such horrific shit about another person to save face. If it is true bring on the evidence Voat. The sad thing is it seems that Thailand seems to protect these monsters so finding the evidence of such deeds may be tough...BUT you are rich Elon get it man!!

            Why is this so difficult to confirm? Are the indie journalists doing any work at all? They can't track down whether this guy married a 12-year-old?

            Seems hard to believe they can't.

                   I think Musk has snapped. He's been doing other crazy stuff lately, like that thing where he tweeted about having investors to take the company private, and it turned out to be completely untrue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   BTW, if you look at a picture of Unsworth's partner in the Daily Mail article, it truly is phenomenal. She looks twenty years younger than her age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I've seen other Asian women who are like this. Even one 55 year old who looked like she was in her 30s.

BuzzFeed talked to other divers and they refuted Musk's wild claims.

              Vernon Unsworth was hailed as a magician for being able to pinpoint exactly the Wild Boars' location in the massive cave system. Either that was an extraordinary skill combined with heroic zeal to save the boys, or perhaps he knew exactly where they were because of other reasons. Perhaps he was privy to a previous plan involving the boys and the cave---a plan that went wrong and necessitated the boys' rescue?

              <p>
               Perhaps you are just speculating with zero evidence?  Perhaps your speculation seems at odds with the facts?   (One boy didn't go and explained to his parents what the plan was?  Nothing indicated Unsworth knew the boys.)  Perhaps routinely smearing people as pedophiles with zero-to-little evidence is shameful?  Perhaps this instinct should be strongly held in check when it involves someone who just helped rescue 13 lives?

            The Thai Cave rescue was a psyop and Elon Musk is a project. The controversy is artificial. Does this argument between Musk and the diver seem odd and contrived? Does it ever. He has no reason to keep it going.

              The answer is very complex I think. With all of these major hoaxes there's usually an economic benefit e.g. with the Chilean miners. Some of the participants make a lot of money. Thailand got a lot of publicity out of the event and I would imagine tourism (of all kinds) will be on the up.
             </p>

              But a bigger part of it is the drive to dominate our thinking and indeed our news-cycle. These events can be thought of as 'carriers' and they can be with all sorts of themes. Paedophilia is one of the themes in this case but then so too are mind-altering substances (in this case, ketamine.)  or globalism (the international team of 'rescuers'.) They also tend to make their hoaxes/events/actors/psyops interlocking - hence Elon Mush and the Thai Cave, Sandy Hook and the Superbowl, The McCanns and Pizzagate etc.Also many of the themes being carried are occult, but I'm going to leave that for a submission I'm making.

Google central banks buying stocks, find where they admit they are buying Apple, Amazon, Google, Tesla etc. Virtually all the worlds central banks are owned by different combinations of the same group of families including Rothschild, Warburg, Rockefeller and Morgan.

              Actually, its because Musk is behaving erratically like this while there problems at Tesla.  Musk invented this pedo story because this guy crticized Musk for be a distraction from the real rescue efforts.   This guy helped save those kids.

            64-year-old British national Simon Jeremy Merington Briscore was arrested at his house in Chiang Mai's Mueang district, after two 16-year-old boys filed complaints with police that the Briton failed to honour his promise to pay them Bt500 each for sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police also found a substantial amount of pornography of underage boys on his computer.

           <p>
            There are many more cases presented.  A a small article about the children and the perverted pedophiles that seek them.

             So seems Vernon is suing Musk for defamation and using high profile attorney L. Lin Wood
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, Unsworth's attorney, L. Lin Wood, said that Musk's accusations are nothing more than "vindictive and vicious" lies. "After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth," Wood said.

              I think Musk is a smart guy.  Let's see what he has up his sleeve.  He must have more than what has been shown.  Let's see what lies ahead..........this should prove very interesting.

               Yes, very interesting.. Will be good to see what evidence Musk has, as if he's being sued he'll have to have something if his claims are legit.

                Musk launched and scuttled payloads for the USA.  He may have been compromised at some point, but I believe he got a pass and is working for the White Hats.
               </p>
               <p>
                Ever notice how NONE of the MSM ever quote anything from

                 /v/pizzagate
                </a>
                ?  As best as I can tell, we are the only quasi-"peer-reviewed", endruing source of information on this subject.  Yet no one from MSM wants anyone to see the information exchanged here.  Random thought.

                  I don't think it's because we are such and obscure, arcane corner of the internet talking about the fringe of the fringe.  We wouldn't be under siege from the shills and bots if that were the case.  My guess is that we are so over the target, that the pizza-friendly entities are too scared to even risk directing a reader in the direction of

              NOPE.  I never said that Everyone who goes there is a sex tourist.  What I am saying and what the article says is that there are A LOT of them that go there for that. NO ONE said Everyone in America is a pedophile either.  Do NOT Ever say that I made such a statement.  I NEVER did.

               That is implication of the logic of your argument.   My point is your article is irrelevant about who this man is.  If you only look at an article about crack smokers, does that small subset say anything about the larger whole? No, it tells us about crack smokers.  Can we say this guy smokes crack because these other people do.
              </p>

            As a middle age man that is not sexually attracted to kids(fucking sad that clarification even has to be made).. I can't ever imagine going to Thailand because of the kid fucker negativity attached to it.  So if someone goes there, you just assume they go to fuck lady boys and children.. Literally the only unique thing about the place.

             Sorry but you people are well out of date on the subject Thailand is NOT a place for child abusers and hasn't been for the last 20 years or so. Philippines, Cambodia YES, Thailand NO. Thailand has a huge middle class population these days and is considered a middle income country. There are adult hookers men and women and transvestite, and in popular destinations it is more obvious than in other countries. Though most of the sex workers are from the poorer North East region and many are from other countries like Myanmar. Nobody starves in Thailand so they are only doing it to make easy cash and possibly even hit the jackpot. The majority of customers are rich Thais not Westerners.  I know one lucky muscled up rent boy (guy) who just got given a SLK 350 by a rich Bangkok Thai male customer, so it ain't all bad. Some men have female customers as well and there are clubs like FIN which cater for women with men on rent.

             Which is terrible unfair on such a beautiful country. 
Thai people are very conservative and the sex industry isn't much different than Amsterdams Red light district. 
It is in small districts. Thai people are shy sexually.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its one of the most beautiful countries with some of the most beautiful people in the world. The land of smiles. 
The sex industry started during the Vietnam war when American army based itself in Thailand.

            <p>
             I have no idea why Thailand is defined by its sex industry. I always hear people who've never been there talk about old men with kids but the reality is noting like that in my experience. 
I've been there 3 times.
            </p>

             The very best thing about travelling Thailand is how loose western women travellers are. They put out like horny monsters because they know men can get sex whenever they want.

              You have no idea why they're defined by the sex industry... when laws against trafficking and child rape are only enforced by the government when there's a public scandal and they need to shed some crocodile tears.

               So America should be defined as a satanic child torturing and raping nation because a few at the highest levels of power are raping and trafficking children?
The American people or Nation don't deserve that to define them same as the amazing Thai people and their nation don't deserve the stigma attached to them. 
Pardon me for affording Thailand and the Thai people the same respect I afford America and Americans.

               I lived there for 6 years. They hate Jews and hate blacks and you silly dumb cunts who haven't been outside your fucking hillbilly towns think you know something. Kids getting buggered next door to you. Don't you have enough to worry about without attacking thailand cause you heard a story once.

             I find the sex tourism distasteful but I know a few people who lived there or visited there and they say the people are friendly and the food is exceptionally good and cheap.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a single male though yeah I would be careful going there alone, partly due to fear of accusations and partly because if/when I were offered sex with children I'm concerned I'd be too tempted to kill the pimps in ... 'unethical and imaginative ways'.

              I you for real? You think it is so common that you walk down the street and are offered children? You guys gotta get out more. The pervs are from the west by the way.

               Yeah I was thinking since I'd look like a tourist (assuming I am not a busty black tranny as I say here) I would be more likely to be approached... you know probably not as long as I asked my friends who live there or have lived there where to go. Some of my friends were in the navy on leave for a weekend so I may not have the best data points, my missionary friends don't see that much I don't think.

              Westerners think that Thailand is all hookers and trannies when it's mostly one city. That's like thinking all of the US is like Vegas.

              So if you're a single Western guy in Thailand, even if it's just to visit, people will approach you to have sex with children?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thailand has some decent looking historical stuff and food that might be worth checking out but that would make me uncomfortable.

               I don't know about sex with children. But adult prostitution is everywhere all over the world. Anywhere that there are tourists there are going to be prostitutes, how open it is will just be a function of what the locals and the authorities will tolerate. In Las Vegas, the girls are discrete until you get into a hotel room because otherwise they get banned from the casino or arrested. In Barcelona, where the right to sell your body is protected by the Spanish constitution, there are trashy girls who will proposition you right on the street, including mentioning specific sex acts explicitly--the "classier" prostitutes stay in the brothels. I've never been Thailand but I would there are prostitutes all over, but that they will mostly leave you alone if you look uninterested, and I'd bet there are certainly "nicer" areas that keep the girls from propositioning people on the streets.

                Prostitution is anywhere where there are women who are poor.  Women who can get a decent paying job that keeps a roof over their head and food on the table do not turn to prostitution.

                 I agree with your sentiment, but historically, it was more women who didn’t have a man around that had to turn to prostitution—it was a job that could support children without having to be away from those children for very long.

               Duerte is Filipino and I thought it was drugs and Muslims that got him elected... though the Philippines also have similar sex tourism so much so the Koreans joke about most of the Filipino kids being half Korean.

               A former neighbor of mine went to live in Thailand and married a Thai woman.  He said you are propositioned all the time.  Although with him it was just by adult prostitutes.  Knew another person who went to Bangkok on business and was asked if he wanted a boy or girl.  So yes it happens.

               It probably depends on where you go and what you look like (eg sleezy dirtbag), but I have had several extended work trips in Thailand and never once been approached for anything.

               Well I haven't been there ... from my experience in other third world countries I'd think in certain places as the "rich tourist" i'd be approached is all. Probably not in the villages in the mountains hopefully.

               I'd love to make a gore porn movie where some retired navy seals pretend to be pedo tourists and then butcher all the pimps.

                U can start the process..via the US treasury..
Reduce the US debt ..and they will fund u for the rest of ur life...u get to charge corrupt people all payable to the US treasury..
U will have no just retired navy seals working for u ..but the whole of the US military machine..
Why? 
The system ie debt system becomes ur debtor
Google : surety rights
We all have this power of surety ..we r just programmed to lend it to the debt machine

                 I have been to South East Asia a few times. There is poverty.  Old white farts who are nothings in their white homelands are treated like gods over there.  They walk into a bar, and all the local girls approach them, telling them how handsome they are. Poor, young girls latch on to old white men three times their age for their money. Then they take the young women back home, only to find that the women treat them terribly, take their money and send it all back to their families, and then leave them.

                 There are also lots of old white men who go there to fuck little boys. It's a pedo's paradise. All the pedos know one another and pass around the little kids.

                 You can't even bring a woman back to your hotel room without hotel staff checking her ID. They are checking to see if she is underage or a ladyboy. they will tell you.

                 Its far more strict and controlled than the rumors.

            Horrible how they are trying to go after someone who helped rescue children from a cave. Perhaps, he does have issues, but that is no need to go after him after he tried to rescue the Thai Kids. If Vernon Unsworth has issues he does need to see a psychologist and the same should apply to Elon Musk.

             So because he "rescued" some kids it's totally ok if he rapes kids? Did you really mean to write that? If so, you have issues!

             If Unsworth has the type of issues that Tesla is accusing him of, well then, no amount of psychology will help.  Once a pedophile always a pedophile.  I agree that there should at least be some serious investigating this case.  Those boys were sent to the Monks to decompress after their ordeal.  From the frying pan into the fire, imo.

              Yeah, poor kids. I think you are right about the once a pedophile always a pedophile. Some pedophiles had abusive environments, had sexually degenerate parents, and a bad micro-environment in general.

              I think the best thing to do with these people is basically to shut down child porn, hardcore porn, and pedophila online. That would be what I would suggest. They also need to be on constant probation and treated like a child, because they act in erratic manners and can't be fully controlled.

               They cannot control themselves, refuse to believe they have no right to rape Our Children.  The only solution is that they be locked up and kept away from children.  Locking up Our Children is not the solution as they would have us do.  You see it is the children that are enticing them, or so they say and believe.  They are a sick lot.

                I agree with you.  I am against the death penalty but, for whatever reason (that goes against my Christian belief that only God can judge) I really think there's no rehabilitation possible for paedophiles. They are very, very sneaky. They are masters of manipulation. They don't change (recidivism rates are HIGH amongst this group). . They destroy lives. That is why I believe in the death penalty for paedophiles.
               </p>
               <p>
                What is concerning is that there is now a HUGE industry, riding on the back of the LGBQTI stupid movement, telling the world that having sex with children is 'loving' them; that man-boy love is reciprocal; that paedophiles have been wrongly vilified; that most paedos would never actually rape a child (which is BS because given half a chance they would); that we are repressing the sexuality of children.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe this is manufactured and it is their NWO agenda. It's an attempt to defile and pervert our children: to strip them of their innocence (their innocence places them closer to God).  When they've debauched our children, our children will grow up damaged. It will take a very, very strong soul to survive that kind of conditioning, and he/she will have to stand apart from the crowd and be prepared to be vilified, ostracized and alienated.

                 I could not have said it any better.  I agree with everything you have said.  They want the stupid sheep to believe that the children actually want their love, yes.  It is not love, it is perverted sex. They actually hate children.  We should come up with a pedo child hate symbol.  This Is War.

                  You're right--its actually child hate. It's stripping them of their God-given potentials as human beings, destroying their rights. Children CANNOT give consent to what they don't understand or comprehend.

                   They are pushing their hatred for what was done to them, on to the children.  The rage and hate they have for what they have become I believe can only be satisfied by hurting someone else.  They are completely jealous of the lives those children have.  Totally different from theirs.  It's really quite disgusting.  Sad and sick.
