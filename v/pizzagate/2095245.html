Doerphen sounds like a drug. Dom? Wtf? Right? <a href="https://ibb.co/eODTRk">https://ibb.co/eODTRk</a>. But no..not wtf? Bc it&apos;s pretty obvious so far this is about child porn not bathing suits but somehow they are getting away with it...not hidden, I wanna show. This is on the Light Net. I hope people reply ...not just one person...This doesn&apos;t seem like an error in grammar..young sexy bikini girl.&lt;br&gt;

            go have a look at their popular SEARCHS, my brother sent me a photo of the Vermont port and it has the swirl logo water mark(their logo), so I had to know where the pic came from...so he told me from google and that it was a stock photo from dreamstime.com when I started looking into the photographers, it rubbed me the wrong way and I felt like there was something else behind this company too...

            hope you have a moment to edit formatting soon. i'm almost afraid to click all those links. also, why search CIA and Whole Foods, just curious, what's your theories here?

             Lost power last night before finishing. It sucks the format is an issue for people cause it was hard to put up. There has to be an easieeasier way. It's only screenshots hosted by imgbb so don't be afraid to click on my links. But yeah, he'll yeah, I wasn't gonna open those either. 
Ok wfoods, its for two markets. 460 brick and mortar stores in the country and online. I had read whole foods acquired by Amazon owned by cia...so I looked at the whole kids foundation that started in 2011, no that's not right it was the whole kids club, that started in 2011. Where it's an online thing too, an app, get kids involved  so 2011 biggest online child sex/porn ring busted that year. So thats when youd think people might reorganize. The whole kids foundation/kids club images were creepy, in a pedophile way. I posted about it but I only got one comment. The creepiest part of whole kids foundation is that they say GROWING HEALTHY KIDS in lieu  of saying RAISING and they use images like dirt to imagine kids. As STOCK.  Other than that, I know absolutely nothing. Don't be afraid of clicking it's all screen shots.

              interesting, WF has always been suspect to me but mostly for reasons of classism. the price markups are truly unjustifiable and exist to keep "certain people" away from chemical-free food. felt strange about the Amazon purchase too. they already have their big brothery Amazon Echoes in the front of the stores apparently.

            Tip: If you're not already aware, to force a new line(same effect as &lt;br/&gt;) in your post, you need to add in an extra blank line(as if you were about to begin a new paragraph)
           </p>
           <p>
            Line A
           </p>
           <p>
            Line B (in the text box where I wrote this comment, there is one whole blank line between this one and "Line A")
