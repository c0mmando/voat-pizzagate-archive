            Add forum to your searches too, some post in those alt.forums I subbed to those for true crime, it came straight to my email, but you can access "Bug chaser" forums. Pick up some lingo that's available publicly. Sometimes even trip on someone you're totally shocked that's there. Once researching someone a friend found it on page 6 of results. I make sure I look hard at at least 10 pages of a search. I used the forum method to learn how the heck to detox from medications. There's a forum for everything, and I'd bet they used some site's forums thinking then, anonymously.
