<p>Released by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Embassy in Korea reported to its government in 2007 that &quot;Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park\'s body and soul during her formative years.&quot; It also called Choi Tae-min a &quot;Korean Rasputin.&quot;</p>
<p>A new rumor recently erupted that Park\'s possible relation to Yongsaenggyo was behind the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April 2014. The country\'s worst maritime disaster left over 300 passengers, mostly middle school students, dead or missing. The Park government was criticized for its bungled efforts to save the people.</p>
<p>The de-facto owner of the ferry was Yoo Byung-eun, also a cult leader who was believed to have connections with Chung Yoon-hoi, ex-husband of Choi Soon-sil.</p>
<p>Rumors circulated that the people on the ferry were sacrificed in line with the cult\'s creed and that Park was deliberately negligent in saving the passengers.</p>

<p>After her father died, Park left the presidential residence and ran a children’s foundation set up by her mother. She turned its control over to her sister in 1990 after some employees protested at what they called Choi’s interference. In her 2007 autobiography, Park said she resigned because she could not let the foundation be tarnished by “groundless allegations.”</p>
<p>Seven years later, Park entered politics by joining the party now known as Saenuri, and was elected a lawmaker in 1998 in the city of Daegu, near where her father was born.</p>
<p>During an unsuccessful campaign for president in 2007, Park said at a debate she was thankful to Choi Tae-min for helping her during “difficult” times. She also told panelists that Choi Soon-sil did not embezzle funds from the children’s foundation Park had headed, responding to allegations aired in local media at the time. Choi once ran a kindergarten affiliated with the foundation.</p>',

            As much as I utterly despise libtards from the bottom of my heart, I think it's time to unite with the anti-Trump people, and get this entire government in front of the firing squad where it belongs. These are ALL criminal satanist freemason trash that need bullets in their heads. I'm very inspired by the story in Korea, and we must do the same here. EVERY SINGLE ONE of these pigs, demoncrat or republitard, needs a bullet in its head.

            Let's not forget Clinton connections here....
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton knows President Park Geun-Hye pretty well. They met whenever Hillary visited Seoul as secretary of state or Ms. Park went to Washington. They have no doubt talked about what they would do about North Korea.

            Which maybe expains why Tony Rodham was able to facilitate a lucrative speech offer for Bill Clinton in North Korea...
           </p>
           <p>
            A Clinton Foundation official pushed Hillary Clinton's State Department to approve a request for Bill Clinton to speak at a North Korean industrial complex
           </p>
           <p>
            In March 2012, the former president received an invitation to speak at the Gaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, where dozens of South Korean companies took advantage of the lower wages permitted north of the demilitarized zone by shifting parts of their operation there.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Human Rights Watch, the labor laws governing work at the Gaesong campus "fall well short of international standards."

            Maybe they also talked about Haiti...
           </p>
           <p>
            South Korean companies and Haiti
           </p>
           <p>
            "Reports reveal that tens of millions in taxpayer dollars were used to build a clothing factory in Haiti for a company that has donated to the Clinton Foundation and whose owner invested in Cheryl Mills’ private consulting company."
           </p>
           <p>
            By 2012, Sae-A Trading Company, a South Korean clothing manufacture, had become the flagship tenant in a much-celebrated Haitian industrial park. Both Bill and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the factory’s ribbon-cutting ceremony.
           </p>
           <p>
            An ABC News investigation shows that after opening its factory in Haiti, Sae-A donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The chairman of Sae-A, Woong-Ki Kim, also invested in a startup company, BlackIvy Group, owned by Hillary Clinton’s former chief of staff Cheryl Mills.
