I’ve abstained from posting on social media, and from revealing my intentions in real life to those I interact with on a daily basis. I’ve shared some of what I’ve been working on with a select few researchers, one of whom is a moderator here, <a href="https://voat.co/user/Honeybee_">@Honeybee_</a>. She can vouch that I am not LARPing.</p>
<p>The reason for my posting today and the breaking of my vow of silence is because I believe that there may be a potential red team scenario playing out in front of us. For those who don\'t know what a red team is, the below quotes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">from Wikipedia</a>) provide an adequate definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A red team or the Red Team is an independent group that challenges an organization to improve its effectiveness. It is particularly effective in organizations with strong cultures and fixed ways of approaching problems. The United States intelligence community (military and civilian) has red teams that explore alternative futures and write articles as if they were foreign world leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In wargaming, the opposing force (or OPFOR) in a simulated military conflict may be referred to as a red cell (a very narrow form of Red Teaming) and may also engage in red team activity. The key theme is that the aggressor is composed of various threat actors, equipment and techniques that are at least partially unknown by the defenders. The red cell challenges the operations planning by playing the role of a thinking enemy. In United States war-gaming simulations, the U.S. force is always the Blue Team and the opposing force is always the Red Team. When applied to intelligence work, red-teaming is sometimes called alternative analysis.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the highest levels of the Swamp (deep state/Illuminati/etc) have undoubtedly been exploring alternate timelines in hopes of discovering the most effective method for regaining control over an increasingly agitated and non-compliant populace.</p>
<p>I don’t deal in predictions, only probabilities. If nothing comes of all this alien/Pleiadian/disclosure hype, I’ll continue forward just as I have been. But if this is indeed a red team plan unfolding in front us, we may be looking at an attempt by the shadow government to regain their grip on the power and influence they’ve been rapidly losing over the last 18 months. The conventional strongholds of global control are taking on water, and one thing is clear—they won’t go down without a fight. They will do anything to keep pedogate from seeing the full light of day, which is why this possible attempt to hijack the narrative has me so concerned.</p>
<p>What pushed me over the edge was [this tweet from John Podesta]((https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/917869274387173376) a few days ago. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/13/obama-aide-john-podesta-says-biggest-failure-was-not-securing-the-disclosure-of-ufo-files/?utm_term=.4f3369a68e10">Podesta’s stance on alien disclosure</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/10/12/blink-182-tom-delonge-john-podesta-ufos-wikileaks-hillary-clinton-campaign/91939392/">his relationship with Tom Delonge</a> has been common knowledge for some time now. What convinced me that it was time to release this information publicly though was Delonge’s promotion of the <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1615320648490268&amp;id=161055970583417&amp;_rdr">To The Stars Academy</a>, along with Podesta’s <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/917869274387173376">extremely visible support of the organization</a>. Combined with the email primers (posted below) I have been disseminating to my team over the course of the last month, these are at the very least coincidences worth taking note of. Some would call them synchronicities.</p>
<p>Delonge also recently <a href="https://worldtruth.tv/blink-182-singer-tom-delonge-exposes-pedophile-ring-leading-to-arrests/">helped take down a pedophile ring</a>, so he has “street cred” at this point when claiming to be working with the “good guys”.</p>
<p>On the same day that the Huffington Post announced <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59dc1230e4b0b48cd8e0a5c7/amp">Delonge’s intention to disclose the existence of aliens</a>, David Wilcock happened to release a <a href="https://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1220-vegas-meta-analysis">four-part meta-analysis of the Las Vegas massacre</a> that seamlessly ties together Delonge’s announcement, the mass shooting itself, the recent exposure of Hollywood’s filth, and the coming alien disclosure to humanity. You can’t make this stuff up. Slightly strange that such an in-depth and lengthy article was ready to be posted so close to the time that Delonge’s announcement came out. It almost seems coordinated.</p>
<p>Wilcock postulates that Hollywood\'s currently crumbling credibility may be an act of the a group of &quot;off-world entities&quot; known as \'The Resistance\' or \'Blue Avians\'. While I am always ecstatic to see human suffering alleviated, this feels almost too convenient, all things considered.</p>
<p>On Wilcock’s show, ‘Cosmic Disclosure’, the narrative pitched is that our planet is being protected by a group of alien entities known as the &quot;Blue Avians”. These entities are resisting the “Cabal” (Wilcock’s term for the shadow government/Illuminati/etc). According to Wilcock, when these entities finally intervene publicly there will be mass arrests, justice will be served, and a new golden age of humanity will be ushered in.</p>
<p>Hollywood\'s entire purpose is to tell stories by acting them out via movies and television. Could this be the grandest production of them all? Offer up an extremely visible slice of Americana as a sacrificial lamb, in hopes that the more egregious atrocities of the ruling elite will be ignored? I\'ll be convinced when Hollywood AND the rulers of this world are exposed for their crimes against humanity. Color me skeptical until I see state actors in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Wilcock’s primary source is Corey Goode, who claims to be a former astronaut in the secret space program. Delonge is working with US government insiders who claim to have worked with the secret space program. After all, To The Stars Academy’s stated goal is to use the entertainment industry to provide “soft disclosure” to the masses, before eventually dropping the major bombshells publicly.</p>
<p>Lastly, Wilcock’s four-part article asserts that the Cabal botched the Las Vegas massacre so badly that the Blue Avians may be forced to intervene. In layman’s terms, the Blue Avians may be forced to reveal themselves to humanity and step in to make arrests, serve justice, and usher in a new golden age of humanity.</p>

            Wilcock's is a disinfo larper trying to convince humanity we have "space aliens" in our midst. I saw him on History Channel yesterday lying his ass off about the Holy Grail. He knows what it is but he played the game along with the rest of the charlatans.

             This needs massive simplification, with the OP's thesis stated clearly in one sentence. It needs to state how it's directly related (a deepstate psyop to deflect pedo exposure) and focus on quoting and linking the stuff that supports that thesis.

            I agree with a lot of your analysis. I just want to add that there are multiple globalist groups behind the scenes. Some overlap, some work together, some tolerate each other, some actively fight each other. Heck, there are often multiple competing camps within a single intelligence agency that may change allegiance or makeup depending on the goal.

            An interesting exercise is to search for the term 'UFO' on
            <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/ngo-list-foundations-and-think-tanks-worldwide">
             this page

            to see who's involved with UFO research and disclosure among the global elites.

            and nice to see you post about this.  /upvote

           <hr/>
           <p>
            I have been a researcher in about 15-16 years now. And in that time i have watch a lot about UFO. (seen a few strange thing) I also have been watching Cosmic Discloser. And i have to say.. It all correlates to the same things that we are seeing right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cabal is losing control and that will lead to more of this attacks to try to sway the outcome, so they can take control.
I would love to see us do this without other beings help.  We need to grow up as a species..
           </p>
           <p>
            .. but at the same time we need the arrest to start happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            More attempts will follow from the Cabal.. they won´t give up.

            Can anyone make me feel less skeptical about Wilcocks and goode? I'm not too familiar with that field... But everytime I try to listen to them... They say something that makes uncomfortable with them... Like- i can't even think of a specific example. they just give me sketch vibes... AND I KNOW  that we have so much technology suppressed... I know there is a secret space program... but I dunno. Somewhere along the line something got embedded in me that Makes me not trust these guys.

            Does anyone have some info/examples/videos/Something that would make me feel better about these guys?  They sketch me out.... But I also Feel Like I'm probably wrong to feel that way.. Again- based on nothing specific.  I understand that if they are legit- they obviously have a staggering uphill Battle. It's a lot easier to convince someone that sandy hook was a hoax- then convincing someone that technology of such caliber has been kept secret for so long...

            <strong>
             I say that as someone who basically doesn't know where to begin when diving into that realm... I could be looking in the completely wrong spot.

               It was on mainstream television. History channel or something like that. Him and some other dude pretending to chase down the mystery of the Holy Grail. Since it was on mainstream tv I doubt its on the internet yet unless its old.

               I didn't watch it all. I was reading and watching at the same time. I tried to leave it on just to see what all they would say but I couldn't stand it for long.

            Agree that there are people playing with different scenarios atm and I saw that Podesta tweet and the Wilcock's publication.  However, just the fact that Podesta posted a 'stay tuned..' tweet and then the following day there was nothing says to me that the guy has the mind of a child.  So, I'm not concerned about him - he's going down.  Also, the Wilcock's stuff comes across as utter nonsense.  So, if they are going down that particular route re aliens, they might be surprised by the lack of reaction from a sceptical and inceasingly jaded public.

             I suggest you check out Tom DeLong's Instagram page and look at the incredible amount of support he has from numerous agencies including the CIA, the NSA and NASA. Don't dare sell Podesta short. He is not who you think he is, but a high level player who may be the most powerful person in all of Washington DC.
