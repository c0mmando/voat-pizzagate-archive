<p>Further east you can see an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Tunnel">underground freight track from 1905</a> which crosses under 3rd Ave. under a different Pegasus Coffee Bar, continuing west where it passes beneath a <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/fboq0qpzd/Screenshot_2017-08-22-13-11-24.png">shirt store</a> that for the decades prior had been a <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/z4wde0hy1/Screenshot_2017-08-22-12-51-45.png">sketchy donut shop</a>known as a hangout for boy prostitutes to provide lunchtime service for lawyers and businessmen (according to them), including the famous case of a long-known pedophile judge who ended up <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/lc8msl8g9/Screenshot_2017-09-08-12-14-01.png">committing suicide</a>. <a href="http://crosscut.com/2014/03/seattle-donut-shop-runaways-part-two-knute-berger/">Article on shop</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The underground tours were started by local historian Bill Speidel, whose writings focus on the seedy aspects of the city\'s history and its economic significance. He named Austrian immigrant <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Furth">Jacob Furth</a> (d. 1914) as the most important person in the city\'s history. </li>
<li>
<p>Furth was known to have an extremely close business relationship to a legendary madame called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Graham_(Seattle_madame)">Lou Graham</a>, from Germany. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few years later mayor Hiram Gill would build, for his enrichment, supposedly <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Apartments">the world\'s largest brothel</a> with 500 rooms. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seattle\'s Weird Founding Elite</strong></p>
<p>The “first economic father” is said to be <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Yesler">Henry Yesler</a>, owner of the first sawmill.  
</p>
<p>Yesler was a known “spiritualist” -- the Romantic-era occult movement that emphasized “free love”, feminism, and utopian socialism. His wife even had lesbian lovers, and when she died he married his cousin six decades younger.  One relevant journal of the era, published by Moses Harman, was called <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_the_Lightbearer">Lucifer the Lightbearer</a>.</em></p>
<p>In 1879 Yesler was followed as mayor of Seattle by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Gatzert">Bailey Gatzert</a>, who had married the sister of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabacher_Brothers">Seattle’s biggest wholesalers:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Schwabachers, including Schwabachers-by-marriage Gatzert and Eckstein, were heavily involved in Seattle society, non-profit work, and in the establishment of Reform Judaism in Seattle.[17] <strong>Along with Schwabacher protégé Jacob Furth, Bailey Gatzert played a key role in assuring the city a water supply in the 1880s.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another history site <a href="http://www.historylink.org/File/87">says:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of Furth\'s first business ventures in Seattle was to rescue from bankruptcy the privately owned firm that operated the Spring Hill Water system, <strong>which supplied water to city hoses, spigots, and fire hydrants.  Furth recruited his banking colleague Bailey Gatzert (1829-1893) and John Leary, founder of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, to bail out Spring Hill.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be the water system that allowed the entire downtown to burn to the ground in 1889, a long-predicted event given that it was all wood. </p>
<p>These men, who variously served in positions like city councilman and were members of the Masons and Odd Fellows, <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/a98b8pekp/Screenshot_2017-09-08-13-37-07.png">also founded the Rainier Club.</a></p>
<p>By 1889 with the population swelling, it is conceivable that they burned downtown on purpose (it happened 6/6/1889 and there were no deaths reported) knowing the only acceptable solution would be to in effect make a tunnel network by raising the street level several metres and paving over it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Seattle Children\'s Home (mentioned above re: judge Robart) had been founded by Gatzert’s and Schwabacher’s wives as the Seattle Relief Society, the Relief Society itself being one the oldest women\'s group in the country and which was established the same day (and in the same room) that the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith received his first three Masonic degrees.  The Relief Society was organized by Smith as essentially a women\'s Masonic order.

<p>The Odd Fellows have their own women\'s group, <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/i3b96ibk9/Screenshot_20170824-135758.png">Rebekah\'s Children\'s Services</a> and their <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/lcpocyznt/Screenshot_2017-09-08-16-45-18.png">building</a> is near a great number of suspicious locales, but it has apparently long been leased to an African-American Masonic lodge which has let it fall into disrepair.  The neighborhood deserves acknowledgement, however: </p>

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “One of Furth's first business ventures in Seattle was to rescue from bankruptcy the privately owned firm that operated the Spring Hill Water system,
            <strong>
             which supplied water to city hoses, spigots, and fire hydrants.  Furth recruited his banking colleague Bailey Gatzert (1829-1893) and John Leary, founder of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, to bail out Spring Hill.”
            </strong>
           </p>

           That would be the water system that allowed the entire downtown to burn to the ground in 1889, a long-predicted event given that it was all wood.
          </p>
          <p>
           These men, who variously served in positions like city councilman and were members of the Masons and Odd Fellows,
           <a href="https://s26.postimg.org/a98b8pekp/Screenshot_2017-09-08-13-37-07.png">
            also founded the Rainier Club.
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           By 1889 with the population swelling, it is conceivable that they burned downtown on purpose (it happened 6/6/1889 and there were no deaths reported) knowing the only acceptable solution would be to in effect make a tunnel network by raising the street level several metres and paving over it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Meanwhile, the Seattle Children's Home (mentioned above re: judge Robart) had been founded by Gatzert’s and Schwabacher’s wives as the Seattle Relief Society, the Relief Society itself being one the oldest women's group in the country and which was established the same day (and in the same room) that the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith received his first three Masonic degrees.  The Relief Society was organized by Smith as essentially a women's Masonic order.

            Great post.  The pegasus connections and hussein visits further emphasis their hiding in plain sight.  I posted a related topic on tunnels a while back that had some excellent comment contributions if you want to scan it over and see if any more dots connect.
