            Morally, to an extent. So is erotica since women love reading rape fantasy, but are you going to say you have the right to shut that down too? I draw the line at what hurts people. I don't have the right to tell people what they may or may not draw and quite frankly, neither do you. These children need our help, not this bastardization of justice which in turns hurts people more than it helps them. I know you have good intentions so then apply them! We can help these kids by exposing who is really hurting others. They have to be stopped. Sadly, we have to be the ones to do it because no one else will.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: oh and... women love rape fantasy erotica generally, does this mean they want to be raped for real? Restrictions artwork is considered just downright devious, it is no different here. Don't try to justify censorship like that.

            I think the non stop harrassment just pissed spez off. Calling him a pedo was more of an accusation to express redditor's anger towards him for having deleted the pizzagate thread, and thus, aiding the people who may be guilty of the crimes everyone in pizzagate suspected those people of. Everyone was very angry and with justification, all those man(and woman) hours put into investigating and compiling their information. Spez already didn't like t_d and the pizzagate was getting outside attention when he'd already been harrassed internally by others to somehow reduce t_d's impact on the rest of reddit. When you consider how liberal he and most of the others are, of course they're going to have animosity towards t_d, and pizzagate is just too far of a stretch for liberals who can't redpill. So, in his mind it legitimately was a conspiracy witch hunt with no foundation and he didn't want the powers that be come down on him and the rest of reddit. Do I think he willingly "aided and abetted" the pizzagate offenders? No, I think he really just believes it is a witch hunt. And we all know how liberals are considerate of those with a disability, gotta protect their feelings and give them support. NYT and many others have openly stated its not a crime, its a mental illness. Libs gobble it up and don't question it. Yes its obvious in that screen shot you posted that there are people who are abusing the system as there are anywhere, but even some who are deeply against pedo say its a very scary thing to begin persecuting people for their thoughts and not actions. And isn't it better to offer the opportunity to support group vs nothing, it might save a child... ugh. As far as the cannibalism... I got nothing. It is a flag and I'd like to see what's in there but I have no hacking abilities what so ever. I'm more of a fly on the wall who reads and tries to offer connections when I see them. I don't agree with what Reddit did. I think pizzagate should be restored, not because I would use reddit anymore but because it was easily searchable and there are many people who are waking up. I'm sure none of this is new or hasn't been said before.

            There's so many things that I don't understand about this question that I feel you should prolly ask your Doctor or some other Medical professional because they'll be more familiar with diagnosing the weaponized autism that you've posted here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sexual abuse isn't funny and Pedophiles shouldn't pedo, agreed?
           </p>
           <p>
            So imagine, if you have the mental capacity to do so, a situation where YOU were attracted to children and lacked the testicular fortitude to kys.
           </p>
           <p>
            What do you do?
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll quickly see why people have a knee jerk reaction to this kinda shit, right? If you're having trouble understanding, please find an adult to hold your hand or wtf ever you need to do to adult right. if you're unduly stressing yourself during this mental exercise just take a minute and cool yer jets but we're gonna follow this logic train to it's destination, k?
           </p>
           <p>
            So back to the issue of your (hypotherical) pedo feelings. Do you tell your doctor? Your parents? Siblings? Pretty sure you've told some kids some pretty creepy shit by this point but havent actually attempted anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            now imagine how fucked up you'd feel, knowing youre a fucking monster. Well you'll either become the Red Dragon of your local commmunity do some horrific shit or you'll seek help, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wrong. you'd bottle that shit in and hopefully find your own way to a jail cell, but I wouldn't count on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What concerns me is the amount of question marks you used and why you're worried about people talking about shit instead of, you know, actual physical pederasty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would you even lurk there?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you still support a shitty website with your patronage?
           </p>

              We already know reddit is shit and knowing how pedos think and talk helps us uncover their attempts to hide in plain sight. Admittedly I shouldn't have gotten so worked up with the ad hominem attacks but this pedo shit tends to bring out the knee jerk reactions outta people, myself included.

              Mine was a comment on why one was removed and the other wasn't and had nothing to do with normalizing bad morals. Your comment was about the morals. So I agree with yours and stand by mine.  And you and those who up voted yours as a put down of mine are a bunch of faggots.  :-).

            No seriously I find that fucked up as well, but their argument is not totally absurd. Those pedos there don't harm anyone and they do not break the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Defamation, sharing of personal information, witch hunting and calling for violence are legal matter. So they have very good reason to ban,
especially when it's not 100% certain, that pizzagate is true.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can understand, that such a huge institution don't want to be connected with this kind of alledged witchhunt
           </p>
           <p>
            Would voat be as big as reddit, they would do the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying that all of this is cool and right but denying, that there is any logical reasoning behind that descision and that reddit CEO must be a pedophile him self because of this is utter nonesense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also iirc voat has those pedo subs as well, so the only difference is, that voat doesn't kick us and that is like said, only because the additional traffic &gt; risk of geting sued. Nobody would seriously consider to sue small voat. Reddit, other story.

             The subreddit is by invite only. Alcoholics Anonymous accepts anyone that is seeking help. You don't have to cross your fingers and toes in hopes that you'll get invited to an AA meeting...you just walk in.

             If it is self help for people who are trying to reform, fair enough.  BUT
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspect it is just a place for them to hook up with other degenerates or encourage or encite more violations against minors.
            </p>
            <p>
             That in it's self is surely breaking the law?

             If you draw no parallels with pizzagate does the other sub still sound fair?

               Given the description they wrote and the fact it was private. I am happy to draw the baseless conclusion they where up to no good. Looks like it has been removed now.

                  Pedophilia is a mental illness and child molesting is a crime. Someone with a mental illness who suppreses their attraction and secludes himself from society is note worthy and that is exactly what that sub is about suppressing that mental illness.  Also its the name of the sub

            Prophet Mohammad married an eight year old and Germany now has child marriages thanks to Islamophobia-phobia and political correctness. I thought muslims were worse than jews at this shit.

             Actually in some hadiths, most notably the hadith of Ayesha herself, she stated that she was married at 5, and he didn't consummate the marriage until she was 8. Still that is pretty damning. Also, I happen to have been an anthropology major for 3 of my 5 years in college, but some surmise that the Virgin Mary was around 14. I mean shoot, my grandmother who is 96 years old right now got married at 15 in the middle of a potato field before my grandfather joined up to go to WW2. The betrothed of Jews at that point in time was a bit like the pon farr on Star Trek. They were agreed to be wed at a later date but wouldn't get married any time soon, much like the engagement period many people still practice today. I know my engagement period was 8 months, and I had been dating my now husband for a year and a half when we got married.

            Then how can you possibly take time to get angry at literally drawings over the real matter at hand? I can draw literally anything and you or anyone could see anything in it. That's how it usually works anyway. Really the immorality is from the eyes of the beholder. At which point I would take time to reiterate the First Amendment because well... if I didn't we'd lost rights to everything all starting here. You see, the erosion of our livelihood has to start somewhere. I know it's got you bothered but that's the idea, find something that makes people angry and those people at the top start destroying our rights from there. It only ever upsets me because people want to federally regulate drawings instead of catch the actual rapists and molestors... I can't compute it. I can't. It won't add up for me.

            And pictures of you fucking my mom are too but it isn't real. I don't dwell in fantasy. I dwell in reality. Stop getting your feelings hurt and try and care about a human being for a change. It's sick to think you'd tack a drawing with a human, or do you care that little?

            While you guys are doing the puking and shitting, I'll just politely conclude that Reddit's CEO has a guilty conscience about something. Can't imagine what that something is, maybe pizza-related...?

            I want to projectile vomit all over Reddit's CEO's face. I hope we get to see the day these sickos go down!
