            The simple answer is the circumstantial evidence is not any where close to overwhelming and not only you have not proven that children are being abused, you have no proven that there any crimes whatsoever connected to the Podesta email leak.
           </p>
           <p>
            The claim that code was used in the Podesta emails to cover up for wrongdoing is an unproven assertion for which there is no evidence.  That is one unproven claim.  There's a second claim that the wrongdoing involves pedophilia.  There are mutliple other claims that are then bult on top of this, child trafficking, murder, cannibalism.  These mountains of claims rest on foundation that is tissue thin and they fall apart with the slightest rational poke.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was labeled as fake because it relied on fake evidence like this

            It relies on the previous fake story that Marina Abramovic is some occult figure as opposed to a provocative performance artist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please show how you can connect the Podesta emails to a single crime without dubious speculation or fake evidence.

                I would disagree that Shamanism is occult (correctly or incorrectly).  I think it's more New Agey, but I could see that others would definitely classify it this way.  So you do have a point.   I guess I mainly think of occultism to be equal to Satanism or dark spirituality.  I still not agree that is an occult figure, but as an artist who is interested in ritual and the occult.   That is an important distinction that people have tried to erase. For example, Martin Scorsese is an artist interested in and influenced Catholicism, but he is an artist, not a Cardinal.

               <p>
                But on some level, she's like an anthropologist, she is a visitor on a trip*, an outsider.  In terms of her "practicing" shamanism, I read that more like the article than that headline--that she went there to study shamanism, not that she practices it all the time.  Probably with her other explorations she picked up what she liked and what she could use in her art.  She also spent like a year with Australian Aborigines and went to a Tibetan monastery.  She has been attracted to rituals/spirituality almost her whole career, ritual and performance having some connection.  Her family tradition is of belief and nonbelief.  She has an uncle who is an Orthodox Christian Saint, but her parents were Communists who didn't believe.  One of her main goals when she take this trips is she is looking for artistic inspiration.
               </p>
               <p>
                She has described herself as a Tibetan Buddhist and meditation seems to be a very big part of her art, where she has to endure the performance for long periods of time and be very focused and it seems to be a big part of the artistic method she is teaching.

My grandmother was Orthodox too, and even though my father and mother were communists, I was very connected to the spiritual elements of Orthodox faith. I became a Tibetan Buddhist myself.

They all deal with our impatience to really quiet our mind and be in the present moment. They all have this same goal but different ways of achieving it. Even the lying in bed: it's incredible how many people could not close their eyes and how tense they become. Because you're quiet, you've got headphones on, and all that you're left with is your crazy mind. That's a huge enemy.

                *By the way, there was movie made about her trip to Brazil.  Apparently her first psychedelic trip was horrible, but the second one went better.

             I am not a LE or FBI so your request is entirely unreasonable. However, the fact that you are here night and day for 10 months proves that you think its real.

              You just claimed you have overwhelming evidence.  You just compared it to a case with genuine live witnesses and documented evidence.   You claimed that you know that children are being abused.   So it's not unreasonable to ask you these questions
             </p>
             <p>
              So what led you to conclude that the Podesta emails are connected to ongoing sexual abuse?

              I think Pizzagaters are real, just like 911 Truthers are real.   I don't believe in directed energy weapons and hologram planes.   Nobody on the forum has ever been right a out my motivations.

            This is a storm of thought in foreign language, dont get harsh with my spelling.

            Biggest secret and the reason why secret societies exist, is that you can gete healthier and even stop aging by using childrens blood. When you torture these victims, you get that blood highly adrenalized / dmt'd, because stress reactions and the fact you are realising your own death does wonders to ones pineal cone. The blood of tortured kid is the elixir of life / drug that changes you as a person.
           </p>
           <p>
            In todays world, this is the ONLY remaining cause that would get us lazy sheeps MAD AS FUCKING BEARS ON FIRE!
           </p>
           <p>
            We are a racist race, because they make us envy each other. And capitalism did that. Whole continents of people are suffering horribly every day. Hundreds of millions a year are let to die because of machinated poverty.
           </p>
           <p>
            We as a society are allowing that to happen. In general, we dont care about each other. Thats the reason this is been happening for so long. We dont see the truth that everyone in this planet is equal, and really think all the sufferings happening around the world. Millions of kids dying in "hunger and diseases" every year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is the only "insane sane reason" and the key why world is made to roll like this. 70% of all wheat we produce is fed to slaughter, so food cant be the reason. I think we could manage to get water to all around arfica if we really wanted?
           </p>

            They will admit pedophilia because elite will be in private "jail" just few months or year as usual.
           </p>
           <p>
            If only population and even some of us here could clearly see the real reason why the elite lives so damn long.

            I think people can easily believe there are Pedophiles and child porn out there although snuff films have always been questioned
           </p>
           <p>
            you can even get them to believe its a booming business and much money made off it
           </p>
           <p>
            The ritual part is where people will turn off
           </p>
           <p>
            it's so horrible, the mind will turn off and say that can't be true, that can't be happening
           </p>
           <p>
            tie that it will the people doing it, people we vote in, people we admire, people we pay money to see and hear, well that just can't be true, that's just too crazy
           </p>
           <p>
            Add in lizards, ET's , secret sects. shift changing. and we all belong in institutes
           </p>
           <p>
            ESTORICshade had good point... There is a difference between knowing how to think and being told what to think.
           </p>
           <p>
            people don't realize how Mockingbird has brainwashed them, they think they are free thinkers
           </p>
           <p>
            also, we have no solid proof, all we have is circumstantial evidence
           </p>
           <p>
            with all these crime and law shows, people want it so laid out for them, goes back to what ESTORICshade said
           </p>
           <p>
            These "Lizards of Oz"  good one carmancita, count on the fact that's it's so crazy who would believe it, add in Mokingbird, it's an uphill battle to get people to believe
           </p>

            I can see why the Mods don't want certain things on the main page....Alopix summed it up,   insane schizophrenic rambling about the devil and shit

           <p>
            only those who have dug in will understand how this pertains, but newcomers will see it and say "oh these people are nuts"
           </p>
           <p>
            maybe what we need to do is lay out what we have so that a 3rd grader can understand, or whatever grader
           </p>
           <p>
            keep it simple, The dumbing down of our citizens has been the Lizards greatest coup

            I would say it's partly because of the name. It's easy for people to hear it and be like "Yea that's stupid."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the classic reason, people don't want to think that normal-seeming people torture and murder children sometimes just for the hell of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I try to explain the problem to people in a way that's difficult to deny, asking why they feel human beings aren't capable of such evil. Most people come around if they're allowed to come to conclusions more on their own. Not bombarded by flashy hashtags and an idea that's kind of limited to one group of asshole pedophiles. People need to understand too that it's everywhere. Not just in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I'm a survivor. Don't think I'm just being a dick.

             the name is stupid until you see the Katy Perry videos and the pizza theme kid pajamas, and then you realize, shit, this really is everywhere.  Like pizza, it is ubiquitous.

              I would respectfully submit that pizzagate was chosen as the name of the movement because A) Cheese Pizza was a well-established term prior to the Wikileaks dumps. B) Pizza sure appeared pretty frequently in said dumps. C) It's kinda catchy.
             </p>
             <p>
              As someone who was here from the beginning, I hate the spliiting hairs of pedogate/pizzage verbage...if people can't grasp the meaning of pizzagate, then it means that we aren't conveying it properly.  Further, pizzagate objectively scared the fuck out of the elites...why change the name at their request?

              Yes but to be willing to look for that, you have to at least kind of acknowledge that widespread pedophilia is a thing. I feel like most people see pizzagate and they think it's ALL made up. Even the pedophilia.

              Seems like there has to first be a knowledge of the evil people are capable of. Without that, I can see how normal people think were nuts.

               Just out of curiosity, why not a meme/series of memes that simple shows all the weird uses of pizza - in songs, in pics, on clothes, in interviews/comments, celebrity stuff. Like that one website (sorry, name escapes me at the moment) that shows all the one-eye stuff every month. After a while it's impossible to not see something weird is going on.

               yes. its one of those things easy to dismiss. Like Clinton Body Count, and during the election I saw so many Lock Her Up lawn signs that I finally looked into it.

            I wanted to post my comment here as well, but after posting it in your other posting, it will not let me.  Maybe it will now within this comment:  It is Fake News, because it is about the Elite, the  real people behind the Curtain of Pizzagate.  They are the Lizards of Oz.

              Ha.  I have been keeping that though for quite some time.  I envision them as in the movie the ones hiding and pulling the biggest lie over on the American People.  Lizards, because they are ugly and slimy and then the Reptilian Angle.  That is when it popped into my head.

            Nobody normal or semi-normal wants to think about pedophilia. Look at how long it took to get the truth out about the Roman Catholic Church. 
"The ordinary response to atrocities is to banish them from consciousness. Certain violations of the social compact are too terrible to utter aloud: this is the meaning of the word unspeakable." Judith Lewis Herman, author of Trauma and Recovery
