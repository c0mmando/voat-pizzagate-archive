<p>Under the premise that pizzagate is largely an effort to gain control of people in power through the leverage of child rape, I decided to look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Preparatory_School">notable Seattle Prep alumni</a> to see what might be found. Low and behold, there is a link to a questionable firing of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McKay_(attorney)">US Attorney John McKay</a> by the Bush Administration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McKay was appointed United States Attorney by President George W. Bush in October 2001. He had received a positive evaluation seven months before he was dismissed. Among his noteworthy achievements the successful prosecution of terrorist Ahmed Ressam. Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey gave McKay the additional responsibility of overseeing a pilot program for a computer system (called Law Enforcement Information Exchange) for his success he earned the United States Navy\'s highest civilian honor.[1]</p>
<p>The Seattle Times noted in February 2007, &quot;One of the most persistent rumors in Seattle legal circles is that the Justice Department forced McKay, a Republican, to resign to appease Washington State Republicans angry over the 2004 governor\'s race. Some believe McKay\'s dismissal was retribution for his failure to convene a federal grand jury to investigate allegations of voter fraud in the race.&quot;[2] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was McKay a victim of pedophiles at Seattle Prep -- and that history used as leverage to get him to stand down on voter fraud investigation?</p>
<p>We need more digging here!</p>

            The Jesuits with Wisconsin ties
Eight of those named had served in Wisconsin. They are:
Burton J. Fraser, who was ordained in 1935 and died in 1971. He had served at Marquette University. He is the subject of a single allegation dating to the 1950s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Arthur O. Verdieck, who was ordained in 1950 and died in 1980. A single allegation emerged after his death. He had served at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien and Marquette University High School in Milwaukee.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Campbell, who was ordained in 1950 and died in 2009. He was accused of abusing at least a dozen minors from the 1960s to the 1980s while serving in St. Louis, according to news accounts. He was restricted from contact with minors in 1985 and removed from ministry in 1987. He had served at Marquette University High School earlier in his career.
           </p>
           <p>
            Francis M. Landwermeyer, who was ordained in 1966, left the priesthood in 2011 and died earlier this year. His abuses are alleged to have occurred in the 1960s and '70s. He served at Marquette University.
           </p>
           <p>
            George M. Pieper, who was ordained in 1948 and died in 1998. The alleged abuses occurred in the 1970s. He had worked at Campion High School in Prairie du Chien.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas E. Connolly, who was accused of abusing a minor in an unspecified year. He had worked at the Menominee County Court House in Keshena from 1965-'66.
           </p>
           <p>
            Francis X. Nawn, who was sued by several people who said he abused them 
between 1962 and 1988 while serving at missions in Alaska, according to news accounts. He died in 1992. He had worked at Campion Prep in Prairie du Chien from 1945-'48 and 1955-'56, and at Marquette High 1956-'61.
           </p>
           <p>
            Charles A. Saalfeld, who was accused in 2009 of abusing a minor between 1974 and '78. He worked at St. Joseph's Church in Madison from 1956-'57 and died in 1978.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dec. 17 release by the Midwest Province is expected to include additional Wisconsin names.
The West Province also includes
 Donald McGuire, a former Chicago priest who served at the University of San Francisco. McGuire was accused of molesting several boys, including some in Wisconsin, for decades beginning in the 1960s. He was convicted on several state and federal counts in 2006. He was defrocked a year later and died in 2017 while serving a 25-year prison sentence.
McGuire is among at least three abusers who had been supervised by former Marquette president the Rev. Robert Wild when he led the Chicago Province from 1985 to 1991.

            J. Peter Sartain wiki     James Peter Sartain (born June 6, 1952), better known as J. Peter Sartain, is an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He is the fifth and current Archbishop of Seattle, serving since 2010.[1] He previously served as Bishop of Little Rock (2000–06) and Bishop of Joliet (2006–10).[2]
           </p>
           <p>
            He was in Little Rock while Clinton was Pres.  and in Joliet during this
           </p>
           <p>

             http://www.snapnetwork.org/questions_surface_in_joliet_diocese
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Reported missing the morning he was to meet with authorities investigating allegations that he molested a boy, the Rev. Alejandro Flores was found sprawled amid toppled pews at St. Mary's Carmelite Church in Joliet.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an apparent attempt to take his life, Flores had plunged 20 feet from the choir loft, where investigators found an empty bottle of Johnny Walker Black Label scotch. They also discovered in his bedroom a suicide note he had written to one of the two brothers he was accused of molesting, according to police records.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Dear son … Forgive me. I love you more than you know," Flores wrote in Spanish to the older boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days earlier, the mother of the boys had called the Diocese of Joliet to complain about the newly ordained priest's relationship with her younger son. The next morning, diocese officials promptly removed Flores from any contact with children and notified authorities, who later charged him with molesting the boy. Bishop J. Peter Sartain also publicly apologized to the child's family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although it appears the diocese may have responded swiftly in early 2010, the handling of the matter continues to draw criticism. And the scrutiny has followed Sartain to Seattle, where he was installed last winter as archbishop. Critics argue warning signs were ignored or missed while Flores was a seminary student — a five-year period that mostly occurred under Sartain's watch.
           </p>
           <p>
            One priest who had supervised Flores was so frustrated that the seminarian was ordained despite repeated warnings that he wrote to Sartain asking why his complaints fell on deaf ears.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flores, 38, is serving a four-year prison term for criminal sexual assault. He declined interview requests. Supporters say he maintains his innocence despite a guilty plea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flores was assigned to St. Mary Parish of West Chicago, where some parishioners said they are still outraged. One of them, Jennifer Wiesner, is a former St. Mary school board member.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flores' contact with the boys grew so close during the next two years that several parishioners said they voiced their concerns to Conway, who was St. Mary's pastor, as well as to Masters and Flores himself. Parishioners Eduardo Fuentes and his wife, Luzma, of West Chicago, said Flores had the boys call him "Papa" and gave the oldest one expensive electronics, clothes and even a bike.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They were together everywhere, all the time, to the extent that people were openly talking about it," Luzma Fuentes said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masters, now the diocese's vocation director, and Conway, now pastor at a Downers Grove church, declined comment. But in a Sept. 14, 2010, letter to Sartain, Conway complained that his repeated concerns were ignored and that his opinion on Flores was never sought before the seminarian was ordained.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             his repeated concerns were ignored
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's unclear whether Masters told Sartain of these concerns. Sartain allowed Flores' ordination three months after the pornography evaluation was ordered. Prosecutors said their efforts to learn the evaluation results were blocked.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is so much more in this long article.  Please Read.  This gives us  clear picture of why Sartain has been repeatdly kicked upstairs to High Level positions in the Catholic Church.  The covering up of sexual abuse.

            So far, a school I attended had at least 7 pedo priests employed over the years and 2 were reported for abusing minors during my enrollment...

            And this seems to be around the time of the US Attorneys Scandal in the Bush WhiteHouse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yup.  This was smack dab in the middle of the US Attorney's Scandal.  McKay wrote an article about this is 2017
           </p>
           <h1>
            The Bush administration fired me from the Justice Department over politics
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As one of the nine US attorneys fired for political reasons in 2006 and 2007, I was an unwilling participant in what was, until now, the biggest scandal to shake the Justice Department since the "Saturday Night Massacre" firings during Watergate more than 40 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             The US attorneys episode, which clouded President George W. Bush’s second term, revealed just how explosive it can be to violate norms that insulate criminal investigation and prosecution from politics. Eventually, almost everyone who took part in the decision — and then attempted to cover it up — lost their jobs and reputations. Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems to have forgotten those lessons in firing Comey.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those who may have forgotten, or are too young to remember, the scandal began when the Bush administration unexpectedly asked for the resignations of nine US attorneys in 2006, a move that erupted into scandal in early 2007. The custom had long been that US attorneys, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, submit their resignations only when a new president takes office. That norm exists so administrations aren’t tempted to punish and reward federal attorneys for politically motivated work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ideologues in the Bush administration were unhappy with that tradition, and targeted attorneys for various decisions that, in their view, had hurt Republicans. They also hoped to take advantage of a loophole in the Patriot Act that allowed the attorney general, rather than the president, to appoint interim US attorneys, thereby bypassing Senate confirmation.
