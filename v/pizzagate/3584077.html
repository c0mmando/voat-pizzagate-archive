            Although I am certain that satan is indeed behind all ritual abuse whether it stems from pagan religions or from actual satanist cults. What is clear is that what is done in these rituals is well-described as "satanic." Thanks for bringing more scrutiny to CPP.

            Too broad a brush guys. Nothing wrong with shamans good ones , bad ones and in between like the human condition....when you lump everything into pizzagate you lose a lot of your viewers.Also when you use the terms so popular here referring to black people..Jews etc. Almost like it is happening on purpose.

              @Think-
             </a>
             and am going to repeat a comment I made above, which if you

              actually read
             </a>
             the
             <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@whitedeer9217/pt-2-the-pizzagate-evidence-of-ritual-abuse-hidden-in-plain-sight">
              steemit posts
             </a>
             and retained the fact that I clearly delineated between non-abusive shamanic practice and ritual abuse, wouldn't be necessary.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the original posts I tried to be as clear as possible that not all shamanistic traditions are abusive, but that ritual abuse as a practice - no matter what aesthetic it wears - is a shamanistic practice by definition. I argue that all of the defining characteristics of shamanism are always present in ritualized abuse. I would also say that without some variety shamanism humanity might be incapable of (positive or negative) somatic spiritual experiences, but that's a different discussion. There's a very big difference between a "shaman" created by an accidental near death experience and one created by ritual abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition, I tried to show that the very people that were initially involved in or looked into as part of pizzagate were describing themselves as shamanistic on their own terms, making the connection even more clear and relevant to this sub. The reason it's important to understand this is - as Think so aptly summarized in the OP - if we are only looking for Satanic, Cabalistic or Masonic symbols, we are not only missing the point, we are missing literal ritual abuse in plain sight.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other reason it's important is because I see shill narratives literally ALL OVER indie/alternative media and social media try to frame the origin of ritual abuse within specific religions, periods of history, etc. By putting on blinders in which you only see ritual abuse in a specific context of one religion, it is much easier to hide real ritual abuse in the open and it prevents any understanding of the mechanics of the practice.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Lastly: The steemit posts do not put "everything" into pizzagate, as I stated above. The fact that you're commenting in the pizzagate sub telling people not to focus on pizzagate is absurd. If we were having this discussion on the
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              r/conspiracy
             </a>
             subreddit that would be a different story. Why come here if you don't want to investigate the topics and people relating to pizzagate? What's your agenda, really?

             From my research of cases of ritual violence in Britain I can tell you that it is very usefu to have a broader approach, and not only focus on Satanism / Luciferianism.

             Yeah that list of shamanic characteristics/elements literally applies to all ritual abuse, whether we're talking Haitian Voodoo or African stuff or Belgian aristocracy like Dutroux, or Kabbala or Masonry or whatever, it ALWAYS uses these elements. Some may be more emphasized than others, and some forms are going to be more "ceremonialized" than others.

              In Celtic / Druidic cultures red haired women and children were thought to be the most naturally inclined towards mysticism and psychic abilities. I've also heard they have giant or nephilim DNA in the more biblical beliefs. And everyones heard the gingers have no souls slur. Not Off the Wall at all.

              If I were to  guess it has to do with something that genetic attribute 'contains', be it in the blood or of the spirit, they like that flavor.

              About Ria Pratt Kim Noble
             </p>
             <p>
              Ria has DID and is one of Kim Noble's personalities. From the age of 14 years old Ria has spent 20 years in and out of hospital until she made contact with Dr Valerie Sinason and Dr Rob Hale at the Tavistock and Portman Clinics. 10 years ago she began therapy and was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (formally multiple personality disorder). D.I.D is a creative way to cope with unbearable pain. The main personality splits into several parts each having an amnesic barrier between them. It is a conventional disorder but Ria has had extensive tests over 2 years by leading psychology professor at UCL, John Morton , who has established there is no memory between the personalities and that she represents the British gold standard over genuine Dissociation. With no formal art training, Ria and 12 of her personalities (alters) became interested in painting in 2004 after spending a short time with an art therapist. These 12 artists each have their own distinctive style, colour and themes, ranging from solitary desert scenes, to sea scenes to abstracts, collages and paintings with traumatic content. Many are unaware that they share a body with other artists. Ria's works takes you into the nightmare world of child abuse, depicted through the childs eyes, hence the bright colours. Many people can't face the truth of abuse and turn away, the use of very bright colours also makes the painting noticeable making the viewer look and see what happens, it is hard to miss. The patchy, ghost like figures floating above are depicting dissociation. When the pain gets too much the child looks down on themselves, believing that it isn't happening to them and watching from above. Trauma can cause out of body experience, dissociation. The works of other alters can be seen under Kim Noble, Bonny Noble, Golden Dawn, Judy Ash, Patricia King, and M.J.

               Yes you are right, that is likely someone with the same name, accidentally left in when I copy pasted even though on my notes it was
               <s>
                -struckthrough-
               </s>
               . Notable only in that the entity had the same name (Dawn too) and I believe age as Kim of the UK, and Comet. Will edit that out. Thank you!

            Good article. But as someone who is married to a Shamen/Witchy type and I as a former Zen priest, I'd say not just RA is Shamanistic in nature, all Religion is. Every single one is derived from Shamanism, since Shamanism is simply humans making sense of the World. A need or thirst for knowledge about ourselves and the Universe. I've studied Shingon Buddhism for over two decades, Japanese Esoteric Buddhism. It's the Japanese equivalent of Tibetan Buddhism, so is extremely connected to Shamanism, albeit more civilised than the Vajrayana of the Tibetans. But my point being, all Religion not just 'cults' are simple evolutions of Shamanism.

             Derived from Shamanism, arguably yes. In the original posts I tried to be as clear as possible that not all shamanistic traditions are abusive, but that ritual abuse as a practice - no matter what aesthetic it wears - is a shamanistic practice by definition. I argue that all of the defining characteristics of shamanism are
             <em>
              always
             </em>
             present in ritualized abuse. I would also say that without some variety shamanism humanity might be incapable of (positive or negative) somatic spiritual experiences, but that's a different discussion. There's a very big difference between a "shaman" created by an accidental near death experience and one created by ritual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, I tried to show that the very people that were initially involved in or looked into as part of pizzagate were describing themselves as shamanistic on their own terms, making the connection even more clear and relevant to this sub. The reason it's important to understand this is - as Think so aptly summarized in the OP - if we are only looking for Satanic, Cabalistic or Masonic symbols, we are not only missing the point, we are missing literal ritual abuse in plain sight.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other reason it's important is because I see shill narratives literally ALL OVER indie/alternative media and social media try to frame the origin of ritual abuse within specific religions, periods of history, etc. By putting on blinders in which you only see ritual abuse in a specific context of one religion, it is much easier to hide real ritual abuse in the open and it prevents any understanding of the mechanics of the practice.

             I wouldn't define the three major religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as being shamanistic, would you? I always associated shamanism with nature worship. 🤔
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a minor point in this forum. Any person in any religious group can be an abuser, but as you were a practitioner I'm interested in hearing how you defined yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
             An internet definition of shaman "a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of good and evil spirits, especially among some peoples of
             <em>
              northern Asia and North America
             </em>
             . Typically such people enter a trance state during a ritual, and practice divination and healing."

              The Abrahamic religions still are derived from Shamanism. They acknowledge a spirit world consisting of the unseen, demons, angels, watchers and so on. Any attempt to understand the World and its machinations is Shamanic in nature. Praying to God is Shamanic. God is unseen and three acknowledge its existence. Christianity's 'dark night of the soul' is typical of death and rebirth, like the Muslim fana. These are Shamanic moments. The ecstasy of Christ is the same, trance like moments of clarity. Sufi Islam's especially esoteric and occult in nature.

               I agree about Sufi to an extent but it is an offshoot of Islam from my understanding and not representative of the mainstream. You could also argue that certain offshoots of Judaism and Christianity (the kabbalah is Jewish mysticism, is it not?)
              </p>
              <p>
               And certain sects of Christianity are more mystical than others, Catholicism and Mormonism for example. But I think even then I am pushing the definition in ways that doesn't really fit. I still have to disagree on a few key points. One is the lack of nature focus, the other is that, in most forms of Christianity at least, entering any altered state or trance is strictly forbidden and shamanism involves this heavily. To claim that shamanism is simply an acknowledgement of the spiritual in general is to pervert the meaning of the word from its widely accepted definition. All who share a belief in spirits are not shamans.

               I think this is an interesting topic, but not PG relevant I don't suppose. 🙃

             Yes, and it has a dark left hand path. Also, lots of cases of sexual abuse of children in monasteries.

              I think the whole priests/monks/whatever abusing kids is just a result of isolating a bunch of men (or women) and preventing them from having a sexual outlet. It's just a dumb, dumb, dumb idea. And it pisses me off because it's so obvious.
