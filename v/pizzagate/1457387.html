            I agree that's what I have been trying to do.  Everything goes by so fast on social media that we need to figure out who is good at what.  I am not a great researcher but am good and organizing and compiling whats out there.

            I don't, emotions are perfectly reasonable here. I would like to stress the importance of persistence and unity. If you feel you need a new twist on your effort in what has become a battle, fight your own way. Everyone has their own way, but do it under the banner that we all recognize.

            The pedophilia is just part of what is going on, but then again I don't see anyone shaming just pedophilia. That's because this isn't about that. We're not some petty movement as much as everyone who oppose us like to think.
           </p>

            I am convinced I can walk past hundreds of people and nobody would know what was on my mind lately, and I don't blame them. I was late to the party myself. It only means the thing has to blow up yet, which is what everyone is working on in their own way. Be it mouth to mouth, reddit, blogs, social media, memes, or (judicial) intervention. This is a time that people will later know as there being a "before" and "after", and we can only hope for the sake of the people that they choose to be on the right side. Against child abuse, coverups and corruption.
