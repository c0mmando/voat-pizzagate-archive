              Historically, take a look at what happens if someone who's in too deep, tries to overtly speak out about the corruption at play... it doesn't end well when a single person speaks out alone... things are a bit different this time around, though.

              Well, if I may be so blunt, staying silent is exactly what allowed them to survive to fight another day - yes, some are complicit to a degree of enjoying the depravity; they'll burn for that, no doubt... but many others have indeed been trying to get it out, without getting themselves killed(suicided) or having their way of life(career, family, friends) destroyed through blackmail and etc.

                I really don't know exactly what the answer is other than to incarcerate them and isolate them from 'the community', to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Some cases may call for medication, others not, I'm not fully aware of the nature of this phenomenon, personally, to give a proper suggestion.

                 If you check out all those who received Freedom Medal from O bama,  they have been in business long time and many have been friends as long as they have been in buisness
                </p>
                <p>
                 Take Tom Hanks
                </p>
                <p>
                 How many movies has he done with Spielberg?
                </p>
                <p>
                 How many awards has he won so far?
                </p>
                <p>
                 What parts and what movies has he been given
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why?   Money draw?   Nothing is just handed out in Hollywood
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those award shows are rewards for those in the know
                </p>
                <p>
                 If I get a few hours free this weekend, will take a group,  maybe Streep and DeNiro  and those who are friends, works with etc
                </p>
                <p>
                 They been in business for a long time

             I almost want to share this on FB because I see so many people begging for babysitting from people they've met once or twice. I'm not sure if it's the appropriate environment but at this point discomfort shouldn't be our priority it should protecting children from this shit

              Yeah. I get there too.  Take a long break. Go to a pet store and play with puppies. Watch a comedy. Go outside in nature. Give some love back to you.  Take a long bath and wash the pain away.  Moral Courage is tough. Stay you.

             Have you seen Chickenhawk? It also reveals the mindset of these kinds of sex offenders. Very instructive:
