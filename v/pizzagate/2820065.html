             Plaza Health Network cited repeatedly for nursing home violations

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Plaza Health Network, the embattled nursing home chain that six months ago agreed to pay $21.5 million to settle federal civil charges that it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid, has habitually violated state and federal healthcare regulations by providing inadequate, and at times negligent, care to residents at its facilities
            </p>
            <p>
             FloridaBulldog.org reviewed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) records since 2012 and found 191 documented deficiencies at nonprofit Plaza Health’s seven nursing homes in Miami-Dade County. During the same time period, Plaza Health was hit with $24,820 in state and federal penalties for violations at three of its nursing homes in North Miami, North Miami Beach and the Overtown neighborhood of Miami.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Ronald Lowy, a Miami attorney who is Plaza Health’s board chairman
             </strong>
             , said the deficiencies are not outside the norm...
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Founded in 1954 as the Hebrew Homes for the Aged
             </strong>
             , Plaza Health Network was sued in Miami federal court in 2012 by whistleblower Steven Beaujon, the company’s ex-chief financial officer. The case triggered a Justice Department probe of Beaujon’s claim that for 10 years Plaza Health had paid kickbacks to physicians who referred it patients, allowing the company to submit $130 million in false claims for physical therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beaujon alleged that prominent Miami Beach developer
             <strong>
              Russell Galbut
             </strong>
             , who served as Plaza Health’s chairman from the mid-1990s until November 2014, knew about the scheme and encouraged the practice.

             New whistleblowers sue Plaza Health Network saying insiders milked nursing home chain

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For the second time in four years, Miami Beach builder Russell Galbut and a nursing-home chain his family cofounded have been accused of illegal misconduct by a whistleblowing former executive.
            </p>
            <p>
             In separate complaints filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, the couple accuse Galbut, Plaza and it’s current board chairman, attorney Ronald Lowy, of milking non-profit Plaza Health to benefit themselves at the expense of the their elderly residents.
            </p>
            <p>
             This time the accuser is William Zubkoff, ex-CEO of Aventura-based Plaza Health Network.

             What price “justice?” Russell Galbut strikes again! (And again, and again, and again…)

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On April 5, 2016, the Florida Bulldog (again!) reported that William Zubkoff, the former CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of Plaza Health Network, and his wife Joyce Galbut [formerly married to Russell Galbut’s cousin], the former CNO (Chief Nursing Officer), each filed a lawsuit against Russell Galbut, Ronald Lowy, Plaza Health Network, et al.  In nearly identical complaints, Zubkoff and Galbut allege Russell Galbut and Ronald Lowy have been “milking non-profit Plaza Health to benefit themselves at the expense of the their elderly residents” and ‘improperly and illegally’ diverting funds from Plaza Health while presiding over ‘dramatic cuts affecting the quality of nursing care and using not for profit finances for private interests.'”
            </p>
            <p>
             Furthermore, the Florida Bulldog article reported, “Zubkoff and Joyce Galbut claim they fought to put a stop to the abuses and even notified federal authorities about what was happening. They also say they rejected Galbut and Lowy’s offers of ‘multi-year, 6-figure consulting agreements’ in exchange for their silence. Both said they were fired within weeks of rejecting those offers.”

             In January 1991,
             <strong>
              the Escobar brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death
             </strong>
             . But six years later, the Florida Supreme Court overturned the conviction, holding that the siblings hadn't received a fair trial.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, 11 years after the verdict was thrown out, the Escobars remain in jail. No jury has been impaneled to hear their case. The charges haven't been dropped. This seems to violate the brothers' right to a speedy trial and raises questions about how criminal justice is enforced in Miami-Dade, says

             Dolphin Tower builder had ties to reputed mobsters
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Eight years after completing Dolphin Tower, its builder, George Wuagneux, went to prison for racketeering and a host of other federal crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Formally, at least, the Sage Corp. chief executive was found guilty with 15 others of embezzling at least $2 million from the Laborers International Union of North America.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the charges against Wuagneux -- including two counts of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- likely also stemmed from his ties to reputed Tampa organized crime boss Santo Trafficante Jr. and Anthony “Big Tuna” Accardo -- once Al Capone’s bodyguard and the alleged leader of Chicago’s mafia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both men were indicted with Wuagneux, though Accardo was acquitted and Trafficante was never tried because of ill health.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then and now, Wuagneux stuck out from a group that included union leaders and alleged mobsters from Chicago, New York, Miami and Fort Lauderdale....
            </p>
            <p>
             ....In 1983, in Arizona, Wuagneux was convicted of trafficking in stolen property and tampering with public records, state records show. There, he was sentenced to more than four years in prison, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wuagneux was released from the Arizona sentence in December 1988, department records show. It is unclear if the state and federal sentences were served concurrently.
            </p>
            <p>
             A decade after his release, Wuagneux re-invented himself, in Las Vegas, and began building.
            </p>
            <p>
             He formed Biltmore Vacation Resorts Inc., a timeshare company, in 1998. At the same time, he acquired a design firm and a publicly held shell corporation called Cyber Information Inc.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also folded in Sage Design Builders Inc., a contractor led by his brother, Ed. Attempts to reach Ed Wuagneux, now 74, were unsuccessful. Cyber, traded over the counter, gave Wuagneux a platform to raise capital. He owned nearly two-thirds of Biltmore’s stock.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though Biltmore lost money -- it had “incurred significant losses” with an accumulated deficit of more than $1.9 million, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in July 2000 shows -- it had vast ambition.
            </p>
            <p>
             It planned to develop a pair of timeshare projects -- the 264-unit Biltmore Vacation Village on 20 acres in Bullhead City, Ariz., and St. Tropez Vacation Resort, in Las Vegas -- at a cost of $203 million.It could not be determined whether either project reached fruition. Biltmore’s telephone number has been disconnected, and numbers for each of the resorts go unanswered.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             Wuagneux died in February 2002, at age 68, in Broward County, records show. By then, his convictions and organized crime associations were long behind him.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Louis Ostrer, a former insurance broker reputedly tied to organized crime, was sentenced Monday to 20 years in jail and fined $70,000 for evading $6.8 million in federal income taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Federal prosecutors said that between 1965 and 1975, Ostrer created dummy corporations and manipulated bank accounts in New York and Florida to conceal the sources of his income and the $6.8 million from the Internal Revenue Service.
            </p>
            <p>
             The embezzlment charge stemmed from Ostrer's taking slightly more than $2 million from the pension and welfare fund of Teamsters Local 918 in Brooklyn and investing only $770,000 in insurance, keeping the remainder for himself.

             : Not long after Norman relocated to Chicago, he was arrested and jailed for raping a 10 year old boy. Whilst in jail for this offence, he established a new pederast ring dubbed the Delta Project (it has been speculated that the FBI recognised 'boy lover' symbol may have originated with the Delta Project, as the Greek letter Delta is a triangle). Norman was allowed to use the Cook County Jail's printing facilities to create and distribute the Delta Project's newsletter, Hermes (characters from Greek mythology seems to be a recurring theme among paedo-sodomites).

             himself, Gacy allegedly raped and murdered 33 boys and young men and buried them under the floorboards of his home. Whilst Gacy, a violent, sadistic pederast was undoubtedly responsible for some of the murders, it is highly unlikely that he committed all of the murders attributed to him. Whilst he confessed to being a mass murderer, he had very little knowledge of the crimes to which he confessed.

            <p>
             <strong>
              So what manner of associates did John Wayne Gacy have? He was a very well connected guy. He served as a Lighting Commissioner and as a Democratic Party Precinct Captain.
             </strong>
             He claimed to have been an aide to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and was known to be on friendly terms with Illinois Attorney General William Scott. He also claimed that local columnist Mike Royko and local TV anchorman Walter Jacobson were good friends of his. He was an enthusiastic member of the Jaycees who would gain new recruits via hosting parties with pornographic movies and sex orgies. He claimed to have done work for the Chicago outfit and to have been a cousin of mobster

              Tony 'Big Tuna' Accardo
             </strong>
             . And of course, he famously had his photo taken with then FLOTUS Rosalynn Carter. In the photo, Gacy is wearing a Secret Service 'S' lapel pin, indicating that he held a high level security clearance. Another hint of his political connections was provided by one of his prosecutors, who observed that, "Two items on (Gacy's) Chicago Police reports were blacked out, indicating they were FBI matters."
             <strong>
              He also reportedly lived within a 2 mile radius of Hillary Clinton and John &amp; Tony Podesta.

            The Rico case of 1986 involved LIUNA  -  Clinton Connection
           </p>
           <pre><code>The media found the debate between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio entertaining, although Lazio was criticized for being too aggressive. But he never brought up the most potentially damaging charge of all—Mrs. Clinton’s relationship with a top labor leader once considered linked to the mob.

Arthur Coia, president of the Laborers’ International Union (LIUNA), was described by organized crime investigators in the Justice Department as being a mob puppet. Coia was a frequent guest at the White House, traveled with President Clinton on Air Force One several times, and they exchanged gifts. The Justice Department in 1995 had drafted a racketeering lawsuit against him, but after Hillary Clinton spoke to a LIUNA convention, a decision was made to allow the union to hire its own lawyer to root out corruption. Coia stayed in his position and continued to raise huge sums for the Democrats. He was chairman of a 1996 fund-raising event that produced more than $12 million for the party.

The Reader’s Digest published a detailed article by Eugene H. Methvin on White House ties to Coia, entitled, “The Clintons and the Union Boss.” The White House refused to answer questions from Reader’s Digest about the president’s knowledge of LIUNA’s Mafia connections or the Justice Department’s investigations and negotiations of the union’s fate. It’s time for Hillary to be asked similar questions.

Ultimately, Coia was forced to retire, with his pension intact, after it was discovered he had engaged in mail fraud and had cheated local and state authorities out of $100,000. He pleaded guilty to criminal tax fraud. Nevertheless, Coia’s influence continues to be felt. He played a key role in getting John Sweeney of the Service Employees International Union elected as AFL-CIO president in 1995. “No unelected union president was more decisive in Sweeney’s election than Arthur Coia…” noted Robert Fitch, writing in The Nation, a pro-union magazine. In return, Sweeney made Coia head of the AFL-CIO’s organizing department. In his own book, America Needs a Raise, Sweeney mentions Coia’s role in AFL-CIO organizing campaigns but not his alleged criminal ties.

Officials of LIUNA were among those indicted on charges of bribery, bid-rigging or other racketeering schemes on September 7th.

The 57-count indictment was issued by the local Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau against 38 union bosses, contractors and reputed mobsters, including the reported head of the Luchese crime family. It’s time for the media to probe this corrupt union’s political ties.

              Another happening during Hugh Rodham's time.   There were many more connections I believe to him that we have missed.  Many don't realize how deep his and their connections with the mob/Chicago Outfit went.  Deep.  And with the crooked unions, especially in Chicago.  It started in Chicago and that is how she and Bill got their endorsements many years later.

            A well known Horseman in the Chicago Area was Silas Jayne.  He was owner of many stables and was also convicted of rape at the age of 17 and also spent time in jail for his bil's murder.  He was linked to a brutal murder only after his death.  They Schuessler boys and their friend made national news for the horrid sexual abuse.  This was during the time HRC was living in Park Ridge.  I have not connected them yet, but I can't believe she never went riding during that time.  She was quite a tomboy.

           </p>
           <p>
            Silas Carter Jayne[1] (July 3, 1907 – July 13, 1987)[2] was a Chicago-based stable owner who was implicated in multiple notorious crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was convicted of rape as a teenager for which he served a year in reformatory, and convicted in 1973 for conspiracy to murder George Jayne, his maternal half-brother.[3] He served seven years imprisonment. After his death, Silas Jayne was linked to one of the most notorious crimes in the city's history, the 1955 Peterson–Schuessler murder of three young boys. Jayne is also suspected of having been involved in the 1956 murder of the two Grimes sisters, and in the 1977 disappearance of heiress Helen Brach.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the age of 17, Jayne was convicted of rape and served one year in a state reformatory.[4]
           </p>
           <p>
            At the age of 17, Jayne was convicted of rape and served one year in a state reformatory.[4]
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1950s, Jayne and his two brothers worked at the Green Tree Stables in the village of Norridge, and at the Elston Riding Academy in Chicago. They had found success in horse trading and, by the 1930s, they had secured ownership of a ranch near Woodstock, Illinois. They transported feral horses from the Western United States to the rail yards at Woodstock. (Btw, distance from Pk Ridge to Norridge is 5.4 mi)
           </p>
           <p>
            Jayne, who was ineligible for the military draft due to his rape conviction, traded in horse meat during World War II. He used his profits to enter the horse show business, and his stable was patronized by the Chicago elite. He sold virtually worthless horses to prosperous men with daughters in their early teenage years, claiming that the horses were of the top quality needed if the daughters were to become champion riders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jayne was a heavy drinker with an overbearing and rough-spoken manner. Parents nevertheless allowed their daughters to spend extended periods of time at his stables unchaperoned. Jayne boasted to his associates of having molested many of these underage girls. When fathers complained about the poor quality of horses they had bought from him, he would tell them that their daughters had become notorious among his employees for their promiscuity. Though the accusation may have been groundless, scandal-wary fathers rarely pressed the point.[5]
           </p>
           <p>
            It was suspected that allegations against Jayne were not investigated because he had friendly relations with police officers. He was not part of the Chicago Outfit, but his Idle Hour Stables (8600 West Higgins Road, Park Ridge, Illinois)[2] were patronized by "Mad Sam" DeStefano and other prominent gangsters. It was said that the gangsters "played cowboy" there, riding around on horses and firing guns into the air.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            So now we see that Jayne owned a Stable in Park Ridge.  Not far from HRC.  Also connections to Sam DeStafano very big in the Chgo. Mafia.
           </p>
           <p>
            On October 18, 1955, the naked bodies of three young boys, John Schuessler, aged 13, his brother Anton Jr., aged 11, and their friend Robert Peterson, aged 14, were found in a ditch in the Robinson Woods Forest Preserve on the northwest side of Chicago. When found, they had been missing for two days.
           </p>
           <p>
            The boys had traveled from Jefferson Park to downtown Chicago to see Walt Disney Productions' The African Lion at the Loop Theater, 165 North State Street,[8] on the afternoon of October 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nearly forty years later, ATF agents investigating the February 17, 1977, disappearance of Brach's candy heiress Helen Brach were told by informants that Kenneth Hansen (one of Jayne's employees) had boasted of committing the murders and had threatened others that they would "end up like the Peterson boy." A second informant had told the FBI of Hansen's boasts in the 1970s, but apparently no action was taken.
           </p>
           <p>
            It emerged that Hansen, who was 22 years old at the time, had met Peterson and the Schuesslers while they were hitchhiking after having last been seen by a classmate at the Monte Cristo Bowling Alley on 3326 West Montrose, about eight miles from the Loop theater. Hansen lured them into the Idle Hour stables under the pretext of showing them horses. When Peterson discovered Hansen sexually abusing the Schuessler brothers, Hansen had attacked all three and killed them. Jayne had been enraged at Hansen when he discovered what he had done. However, realizing the murders on his property had the potential to ruin him, Jayne concealed the crime. The bodies were put in a station wagon, and disposed of. The original forensic investigators in the case believed that marks on the bodies had been caused by the floor mats of a Packard station wagon that had been owned by both Hansen and Jayne in 1955.[9][10] The barn in which the murders allegedly occurred burned down on May 15, 1956, in a suspected arson.[11]
           </p>
           <p>
            Neighbors had reported to the police that they had heard screams from the stables on the day the boys disappeared, but the leads were not followed up, despite the stable's proximity to the site where the bodies were found. According to a detective who worked on the case, Kenneth Hansen had preyed on hundreds of boys before his 1995 arrest and conviction for the murders. Hansen's conviction was overturned five years later on the grounds that the jury should not have heard prejudicial testimony regarding his frequent cruising the streets in search of boys to prey upon, whom he termed "chicken". Found guilty at a 2002 retrial with a subsequent affirmation of the verdict in a 2004 appeal, Hansen was sentenced to life imprisonment. He died at Pontiac Correctional Center on September 12, 2007.[5][12][13][14]
           </p>
           <p>
            Jayne is suspected to have been behind the disappearance of Ann Miller, 21, Patricia Blough, 19, and Renee Bruhl, 20, who were last seen July 2, 1966 in Indiana Dunes State Park, after leaving their purses and car keys on the beach and boarding a boat similar to one owned by one of his stable workers. Blough and Miller boarded their horses at Silas Jayne's brother, George Jayne's, Tri-Color Farms riding stables[2] on 1200 West Algonquin Road (now a Harper College parking lot near Palatine, Illinois),[15] and may have been witnesses to the planting of the car bomb that killed 22-year-old Cheryl Lynn Rude there on June 14, 1965, as she attempted to move his Cadillac.[16] Following the incident, George rigged a device, consisting of the car key attached to a wooden pole, which enabled him to switch the ignition of vehicles while standing outside the passenger-side door.[17]
           </p>
           <p>
            Silas Jayne contracted multiple hit teams, often simultaneously, in his many attempts to have George murdered.[2] In 1965, men hired by Silas backed out of a murder plot and alerted George, who convinced them to report Silas to the police. A sheriff's detective, posing as a prospective hitman, recorded Silas as he contracted for George's murder. Silas used the code phrase "It's time to buy a horse." He was then arrested for conspiracy to commit murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silas was acquitted at his 1966 trial after the state's main witness claimed sudden amnesia, stating under oath, "I can`t even remember what I had for breakfast this morning, I'm sick."
           </p>
           <p>
            Following this acquittal, George's office was burglarized. Around this time, Silas allegedly told one of George's employees: "Your boss will be out of business soon because I gave the IRS boys all the dope on him".[2] George was subsequently indicted for income tax fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            After numerous failed attempts, George Jayne was murdered on October 28, 1970. He was shot in the heart through his basement window in Inverness, Illinois while playing bridge with family on his son, George Jr.'s, sixteenth birthday.[2]
           </p>
           <p>
            Silas Jayne, represented by attorney F. Lee Bailey at his trial,[18] was convicted in 1973 of conspiracy to murder George Jayne. He was sentenced to 6 – 20 years in prison and was released in 1979, having served just under seven years in the Vienna Correctional Center in southern Illinois.[19]
           </p>
           <p>
            Silas was tried and acquitted of arson in 1980, after he allegedly had a former cellmate start a fire in a stable where men he had a grudge against kept their horses. Thirty-three horses perished in the fire.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Silas successfully claimed self-defense in gunning down Frank Michelle Jr. who, on January 19, 1969, at George's behest, was attempting to replace the battery of a malfunctioning tracking device on Silas' car. Michelle was shot nine times, and with three different weapons: an M1 carbine and .22- and .38-caliber pistols. Silas reportedly boasted of crushing the man's testicles, using vise-grip pliers.[20]

             Helen Brach - Candy Heiress Murder
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Brach">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Brach
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Helen Voorhees Brach (born November 10, 1911 – disappeared February 17, 1977) was an American multimillionaire widow whose wealth had come from marrying into the E. J. Brach &amp; Sons Candy Company fortune; she endowed the Helen V. Brach Foundation to promote animal welfare in 1974.[1] Brach disappeared on February 17, 1977 and was declared legally dead in May 1984. An investigation into the case uncovered serious criminal activity associated with Chicago stable owners including Silas Jayne and Richard Bailey. More than a decade later Bailey was charged with, but not convicted of, conspiring to murder Brach; he eventually received a long sentence after being convicted of defrauding her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Helen Brach was born on November 10, 1911 on a small farm in Unionport, Ohio. Helen married her high school sweetheart in 1928; the couple had divorced by the time she was 21. Brach found work at a country club in Palm Beach, where she met and married millionaire, Frank Brach. The couple built a home in Fisher Island, Florida, shortly afterwards. The couple purchased another home in Glenview, Illinois closer to their Chicago factories. Helen and Frank spent most of their time in south Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             After a routine medical check-up at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Brach left for the return journey by air to her north suburban Chicago mansion on February 17, 1977. A gift shop assistant near the clinic insisted that Brach had said, "I'm in a hurry, my houseman is waiting." This is the last sighting of Brach by an independent witness.
            </p>
            <p>
             The crew on the commercial airliner on which she was supposed to return did not report seeing her on the flight. Her houseman/chauffeur, Jack Matlick, said that he collected her at O'Hare Airport, further asserting that Brach spent four days without making a call before she was dropped off at O'Hare for a flight to Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             Matlick was the focus of police attention during the investigation. Matlick always claimed to be innocent and angrily denied to reporters that he knew what happened to Brach, but a former federal agent who worked on the case said after Matlick's death that he was indeed responsible.[2][3] Brach's brother was of the opinion that Matlick had been responsible for the murder of his sister without any involvement from Bailey or horse racing racketeers.[4][5][6][7] On February 14, 2011, Matlick died in a Pennsylvania nursing home at the age of 79.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Brach was declared dead in 1984.[8] No one was ever convicted in Brach's disappearance, although Bailey was sentenced to 30 years in prison for defrauding her.[9][10]
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a case[11] filed in the United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit, Bailey, the owner of Bailey Stables and Country Club Stables targeted wealthy middle-aged or older women with little knowledge of the horse business who had recently been widowed or divorced. In 1975, Bailey's brother, Paul, sold her three horses for $98,000; unknown to Brach, Bailey also participated in the sale, and the horses were worth less than $20,000. Brach also bought a group of expensive brood mares. Early in 1977, Bailey arranged an extensive showing for Brach, hoping to persuade her to invest $150,000 in more horses. An appraiser Brach hired recommended she invest nothing in training one of her original three purchases, contrary to the $50,000 estimate of the trainer recommended by Bailey.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1989 the investigation was reopened and turned up evidence of criminal activity by associates of Bailey such as SILAS JAYNE,  Bailey was charged with conspiring with several others (named but not charged) to kill Brach, however some (including her brother) questioned if Bailey had in fact been guilty of this.[4] Bailey was not convicted of Brach's murder but sentenced to life imprisonment for defrauding the candy empire heiress; the judge made it clear that the sentence reflected evidence that Bailey was involved in a conspiracy to murder her.[9] On March 21, 2005, in a tersely worded two-paragraph opinion, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Bailey's request for a new sentencing hearing for the fraud charges to take into account new evidence suggesting his innocence of the murder conspiracy, saying that the "new evidence does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is actually innocent of conspiring to murder Helen Brach and soliciting her murder."[12]
            </p>
            <p>
             Brach's parents and husband are interred in Unionport, Ohio, near her birthplace of Hopedale. The marble monument includes an empty tomb with her name on it. In addition, two of Helen's dogs, Candy and Sugar, are buried there as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was talk from what I remember from years ago, that some thought she may have been ground up in a huge machine they used to grind food for her large dogs.  As crazy as that sounds, to me it is totally possible.  I also feel her brother and the mob played a large part in her death along with SILAS JAYNE.

             Summer Horse Camp at Park Pacifica Stables is not at all worth the time nor the money.  For $450 per week, kids draw with markers, chalk, do some crafts,  a hike, and ride the horses for less than a 1/2 hour a day. It is not clear whether adults are close by throughout the duration of the camp; it appears that 10 children were supervised by a non-personable 14 year old and a sweet 17 year old without the adults in charge present. The teens try really hard to do their best. After parents drop off the children, the director/owner goes out to surf the during the day. The young counselors seemed stressed; they might know about horses, but definitely are not knowledgable about the management of young children. There is a lot of potential for a great summer camp program at this lovely location, however fully relevant and effective curriculum is not emphasized, supervision is lax, and the disciplinary measures are not at all appropriate. For example, my 6 year old was given a time out during lunch for allegedly interrupting the 14 yr old counselor. When she raised her hand and asked if she could get her lunch, the counselor said no. I was surprised to see that the lunch was not eaten that day and not at all surprised when she did not want to go to the last day of camp (that she had been looking forward to for months) after this and other demeaning, punishing experiences dished out by the punitive 14 yo counselor. A parent observed a young child punished (by the 14yo), told to sit in the corner after he calmly declined to participate a game of Simon Says. There are effective and respectful ways to manage young children; it would improve the program  to encorporate some of this knowledge in the training of the staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I requested by email a few times to schedule a meeting, the owner was resistant and refused to have a meeting with us in person. When I got her on the phone after the camp week was over, she complained that I was the 4th parent to call. (hmm, 4 out of 10 families complained!?) She would only meet by phone; I could not present the issues, as she talked over me and clearly did not hear any of the concerns, but presented fabricated responses, which led me to great disappointment in the loss of her integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I saw some of the other families from the camp and horse lover type folks in town later in the summer and asked what they thought about the stables and the camp, they had similar experiences as we did.

            <p>
             Robert Michael Schneider (/ˈʃnaɪdər/; born October 31, 1963) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and director. A stand-up comic and veteran of the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live, he went on to a career in feature films, including starring roles in the comedy films Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, The Hot Chick, The Benchwarmers, and Grown Ups.
            </p>
            <p>
             Schneider was born in San Francisco, California, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Pacifica. His parents are Pilar (née Monroe), a former kindergarten teacher and ex-school board president, and Marvin Schneider, a real estate broker.[2] His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic.[3] Schneider's maternal grandmother was a Filipina who met and married his grandfather, a white American army private, while he was stationed in the Philippines.[4][5] His mixed background is a common theme in his comedy acts. His older brother, John, is a producer. Schneider graduated from Terra Nova High School in 1982 and then attended San Francisco State University.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013, Schneider switched political parties from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party, explaining: "The state of California is a mess, and the super majority of Democrats is not working. I've been a lifelong Democrat and I have to switch over because it no longer serves the people of this great state."
