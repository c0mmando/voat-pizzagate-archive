<p>Title: Terminus</p>
<p>Written by Mark O\'Rowe
Directed by Tom Story</p>
<p>A grotesque and brutal feast of language, Terminus is a supernatural vision from Irish playwright Mark O’Rowe (Crestfall), featuring a serial killer with an angelic voice, a demon in love, and a startling web of connections stretching above the Dublin sky line.</p>
<p>About</p>
<p>Some description</p>
<p>A is a teacher attempting to rescue her former pupil from a back-street abortion. B is a young woman who falls from a construction crane and in love with a demon made of worms. C is a homicidal sociopath who sells his soul to the Devil for an angelic voice heard only by his victims. A grotesque and brutal feast of language, Terminus is a supernatural vision from Irish playwright Mark O’Rowe (Crestfall). Dark, unrelenting, and gorgeously wrought, O’Rowe’s dizzying language illuminates the quietest fears and most intimate desires of its three characters in interlocking monologues.</p>
