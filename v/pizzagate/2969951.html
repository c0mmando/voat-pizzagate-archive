<p>-Pitchford talks at length about porn that he enjoys watching, including &quot;camgirl&quot; pornography, in which a host exposes themself to a live feed and takes requests and financial tips from consumers. Pitchford explained that he was &quot;a consumer of this content.&quot; He confirmed that he copied a specific video &quot;to this memory stick&quot; to, as he describes it, &quot;work out the method&quot; of how a camgirl host faked the act of female ejaculation. (Be warned: he describes how the video looks in particularly graphic detail.)</p>
<p>&quot;I realized, this is not a sex worker,&quot; Pitchford said on the show. &quot;This is a fucking magician.&quot; Pitchford, for those unaware, has a vested interest in the field of magicians and owns the magic-focused Genii Magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;This was before I learned I should probably have password-protected memory sticks,&quot; Pitchford says, before admitting that he had indeed left a USB flash drive at a Medieval Times Dinner and Tournament restaurant. &quot;Some kid, an employee of Medieval Times, discovered this memory stick, took it home... and discovered secrets of my company and future games in development, and also discovered the pornography. It was \'barely legal\' porn. This girl\'s handle was \'Only 18.\'&quot; The USB flash drive was returned to Gearbox, Pitchford says, in exchange for &quot;swag&quot; and video games.</p>',

           -Pitchford talks at length about porn that he enjoys watching, including "camgirl" pornography, in which a host exposes themself to a live feed and takes requests and financial tips from consumers.

He confirmed that he copied a specific video "to this memory stick" to, as he describes it, "work out the method" of how a camgirl host faked the act of female ejaculation. (Be warned: he describes how the video looks in particularly graphic detail.)
