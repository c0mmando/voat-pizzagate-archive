I will share the piece I shared with a Voat\'r from Spain earlier today.  I think our 2 most important next steps are to archive and then work with the next properly elected US administration and let our system work the way it was intended to work.  Hopefully, Jeff Session\'s DOJ will properly investigate this mess.  Here is what I said:</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts and believe me when I tell you that most American\'s are sick of the criminality in governments worldwide as well. Most of the truth seeker\'s here on VOAT simply want to see a return to the rule of law in our democracy. Sadly, it appears that Voat has been overrun by shills. I am going to share a piece here about who is spreading the whole "fake news" and Russia meme. At this point in America I think it\'s important we adhere to our Democratic principles and give the properly elected next Administration the ability to finish the investigations that so many worked hard on here on Voat and Reddit. Per the FBI Anon the leaks were from good members of our government who were not in a position to prosecute. Please tell our friends in Spain and Europe that President elect Trump will be inaugurated on 20 January 2017. It\'s important that ALL begin to refer to Donald as PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP. After President elect Trump takes office all of us here in America will call on our congress critters to investigate the "knowns" in Pizzagate which I see as follows:</p>
<p>Clinton Foundation is entirely corrupt global "pay to play" operation. If Bill and Hillary turn evidence we will leave it to the proper authorities to do the follow up work. We on Voat and Reddit will demand a proper investigation and hopefully, accept the the findings. It won\'t be swept under the carpet.</p>
<p>Anthony Weiner sexted a teenage girl in another state. To my knowledge this violates many statutes in both NY and NC therefore it becomes "intrastate" and a Federal crime (I\'m not a lawyer). Those concerned on Voat should write their Congress critter\'s to demand Weiner be investigated and if he turns evidence let\'s see what he turns. We should accept what is investigated and it appears that Weiner should see jail time as anyone else who did this (where I live anyways) would be imprisoned.</p>
<p>Tony Podesta owned and displayed nude photograph\'s of teenage girls in his suburban VA home. This is indeed child pornography (yes it\'s rather tame but it is kiddie porn). Once again to my knowledge this is illegal and should be investigated. Statutes of limitation should NOT be adhered to here (once again I am not an attorney). There is a politburo approved WAPO article which discusses this as fact and it should be investigated thoroughly. Tony Podesta should see jail time because once again anyone I know here in Virginia would see jail time for this.</p>
<p>What\'s important now is a proper transition of administration. Shill\'s on here should take note that all former military and current law enforcement to my knowledge back President ELECT Trump and we take our oaths very seriously.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who did a lot of good work here. God bless. The forces of light and logos appear to be winning right now. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-10/hard-core-clinton-fanatic-manufactured-viral-fake-news-msnbc-used-discredit-wikileak</p>',

            Afaik, what Podesta has in his home is considered "artwork" and not child porn. Many of those works are actually paintings, not photographs (not that it makes it any better imo, but I don't think that would be a valid legal reason to prosecute him).
