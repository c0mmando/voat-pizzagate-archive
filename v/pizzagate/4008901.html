<p>This was discovered yesterday when <a href="https://archive.ph/xpgZi">a ton of old Jeffrey Epstein websites were found</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120707063212/http://www.jeffreyepsteinfoundation.com/apps/photos/">https://web.archive.org/web/20120707063212/http://www.jeffreyepsteinfoundation.com/apps/photos/</a></p>
<p>On the Epstein Foundations website, near the bottom of the page, you can see 3 squares with pictures on the &quot;Newest Members&quot; section. The first picture is Epstein himself, so one could imagine that the people next to him are really early members. Someone did an image search for the pictures in the middle and the left. But could only find the middle one.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/undefined">The middle picture is of a man named &quot;Rik Deitsch&quot;</a>. He is the Chairman and CEO of the <strong>Broward County</strong> based company Nutra Pharma.</p>
<p>He sells <a href="https://imgur.com/Tr4kWRx">Cobra Venom based medicine</a> for various ills.</p>
<p>Had a grant by the government:</p>

<p>It\'s not in compliance with the FDA:</p>

<p>And had some legal problems:</p>

<p>While searching for him, someone found another weird thing. <strong>His daughter Samantha Deitsch was a survivor from the Parkland shooting</strong>.</p>
<p>After the shooting, they travelled to Israel to have a vacation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the shooting was in february</p>
<p>the vacation took time in march or april, so either a month or two months after the shooting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only that, but the sons of Rik Deistch, Matt and Ryan Deistch, were also involved in the aftermath. Ryan Deistch was a survivor and Matt Deischt decided to visit the Deistch family the same day as the shooting.</p>
<p>They later went to create AMarchForOurLives and <a href="http://www.neveragainmsd.us/">Never Again MSD</a>, which was also co-founded by Cameron Kasky.</p>
<p>And while browsing Rik Deistch twitter, searching for mentions of the Epstein Foundation this really strange comment about a school shooting drill was discovered:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ryan_Deitsch/status/953097444627279875">https://twitter.com/Ryan_Deitsch/status/953097444627279875</a></p>

            Before I jump into this, have such a bad attitude today, tired of being censored, tired of people who claim they soo interested, dont click damn link. This is especially noticeable when video is 3 mins long &amp; click link 1 min after I post it, so apologize for sounding like a dick out of the gate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, I have been censored on this numerous times, and found by accident looking into the El Paso shooting, David Hogg and the Parkland Gang, but never gets seen. Maybe here someone can archive here at PG on my behalf, too lazy too at this point. Archived elsewhere though.

            This whole Parkland bs was a false flag, and having a museum at the fucking Standard Hotel doesnt help, especially when not advertised to the general public like whole Stoneman Douglas facade was &amp; still is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here you go folks, I present to you Parkland Memorial at Standard Hotel.

            Fred Gutenberg is a douche-nozzle PoS too, never tells anyone his brother was a victim of 911. Wonder why that is? Seems pretty important. Conveniently around for next false flag it seems.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cant blame Brett Kavanaugh for not wanting to shake his slimy fucking hand either especially tweeting he would do anything to stop him from SCOTUS appointment. Reaching, no pun intended, but makes me wonder what was on his hand to be in such to rush to shake it in first place.

                 Ted is connected to US Rep
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  She said she emphasized the importance of two critical issues, beach renourishment and the expansion of Port Everglades, both of which Deutch cited Wednesday in his announcement that he'd be running next year for the new congressional district, most of which lies in
                  <strong>
                   Broward.
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Toothaker said she would also be a campaign co-chairwoman for Deutch and help "both on policy issues and from a general campaign perspective."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  She'd expressed interest in running when most people in South Florida politics expected the candidate would be U.S.
                  <strong>
                   Rep. Lois Frankel, who lives in West Palm Beach.
                  </strong>
                  "Everybody was somewhat surprised, myself included, when I saw Ted's announcement," Toothaker said. She said she called him after his announcement late Wednesday and he suggested they meet for breakfast. "It's a fast moving world," she said.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Frankel and Deutch had to choose who would run where because the Florida Supreme Court ruled in July that the Republicans who controlled the drawing of new district lines after the 2000 Census violated the state Constitution.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The final ruling from the court this week changed the boundaries of the districts that
                  <strong>
                   Deutch and Frankel
                  </strong>
                  currently represent.

                 <p>
                  Reba Sherrill of Palm Beach wants to represent Florida in Congress.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Republican candidate for the District 21 seat presently held by Democrat Lois Frankel aid she supports term limits and calls for health care plans to include dental and eye coverage.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pretty standard campaign stances for Republican candidates. Then, there are Sherrill’s more atypical beliefs.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Sherrill also believes that “pedivores” — or pedophile cannibals — eat babies to get high.
                  </strong>
                  And that children as young as six are taught about having sex with animals.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “There are so many things that are actually being taught to our children in the school system, I would categorize it as pure evil,” she said on a YouTube video. “They start educating children in kindergarten about bestiality, anal sex and all these different things that children should not be exposed to.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whoa, that’s out there, yes, but Sherrill is not alone among congressional candidates in some of her more eyebrow-raising beliefs.

            Deitsch is a surname.It is also a Jewish term for people from Benelux. It is the first EU, possible?  Classmate David Hogg seems to have disappeared after researchers found out the FBI connection, and the fact he went to HS in California and was too old to be in school.

            Here is another tl;dr for those who don't have the time to absorb the Kasy-Silsby infographics:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rick Dietsch's son co-founded the advocacy group "Never Again MSD" with fellow Parkland "survivor" Cameron Kasky whose father Jeff was involved with the scandal ridden "One World Adoption" that adopted children without any documentation and he is also a founding member of the
             <em>
              Florida Adoption Council
             </em>
             . The Florida Adoption Council connects the Kasky's to
             <a href="https://ibb.co/6nNFC7N">
              infamous child trafficker Laura Silsby (who is in turn connected to James Alefantis)
             </a>
             through the equally shady Heart to Heart Adoptions which sports a pedophile logo and is a member of the
             <em>
              Florida Adoption Council
             </em>
             .
             <a href="https://ibb.co/4WBM0hH">
              Andy and Melissa Moore essentially stole a child named Ja'Meka
             </a>
             through Heart to Heart Adoptions even though her father still had custody rights, and
             <a href="https://ibb.co/Styvpvs">
              Andy Moore was a manager at PersonalShopper.com, where Laura Silsby was CEO
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              This means that Jeffrey Epstein, James Alefantis, and Laura Silsby all connect through the same mass shooting event
             </strong>

                Thank you for all this digging. I remember years ago, when pizzagate was first breaking, that there was a review of Heart to Heart adoptions that said something very close to "beware. what you don't know will hurt you". Unfortunately I cannot find this review now.
