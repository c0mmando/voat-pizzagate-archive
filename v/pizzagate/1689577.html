            With the way they turned up the BS Russia crap they must know it is happening and are getting scared, just look at Pelosi, she cannot shut up and is all over TV asking for Session to resign.
            <br/>
            This News Conf. was a Strong Move, showing them that it won't work and that Sessions will continue on, make no mistake, this was meant to be a message to them!

               See the other comments in this same post or others for more information. It is complicated that is certain, but if you look into just a few cases, you will see the pattern of criminal corruption and cover ups. They all link together and to the same people. Look into the pay to play racketeering and illegal campaign contributions in Racine, the RICO case, the Dennis Troha case from Kenosha, and the connections from Racine to the Clintons, and to hotspots of trafficking including Chicago which is easily accessible through the harbor, and links with Pennsylvania, DC, Arizona, Haiti, Denver and other areas all connected to the same patterns.

               Why would the home district of the 2nd or 3rd most powerful politician in America be so corrupt? There is much more to this story, and there was a reason Loretta Lynch put a stop to the investigations. They are much too hot.

                I was quizzing the Racine guy about him, Files is from Melrose Park (mob and cia area) and Podesta (Italian) is from a neighborhood right by there, and right above these two neighborhoods is Racine. I am Fbook friends w/ Wim Daankbar and others who are in touch w/ Files since he got out of prison, I communicate w/ other JFK "players" and witnesses. Sorry if this is confusing, but anyway Files doesn't directly fit in although it seems like everything is connected and since it's CIA it probably is.

               Researched some of this a long time ago in relation to Daley and Blagojevich, and never dug too far into JFK, NASA and Operation Paperclip but am aware of some of the connections through past research and willing to explore again further.

               Everything has started to resurface and connect through Pizzagate. This is what they have been afraid of for a long time where people begin to link together the bigger picture. Everyone knows about Chicago corruption, to the point where it is widely accepted, however no one knows about Racine which is the secret playground and test lab just north of Chicago. What is going on there is truly shocking, and when you start to see what is connected, it all begins to make more sense. Agenda 2030 really is the key agenda at the moment, and that connects to every aspect of our lives across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
               This puzzle is too big to start from the top or focus on global connections which are too difficult to prosecute from the U.S., so we must start from what is known and climb the ladder. If the feds investigate properly, they would have to be absolutely corrupt, complicit or incompetent not to figure this out. Loretta Lynch proved that to be true with the DOJ. Now that Trump and Sessions are in, this will either prove them to be real or fake. Every other case can be tied off and compartmentalized. Racine will show everyone the way to connect this to their own community and how these crime syndicates operate both in the dark and out in the open.

                Omg. I have a VERY open mind, but could you please for the love of God, post some links or direct info? I see your comments all over the place and I dont know what to think. I see legit info, but then later on you start with the whole fucking Racine shit again. Like I said, I'm open to all kinds of info but at this point I haven't been able to dig up anything significant (maybe I'm not doing it right?) except for the fact that quite a few big names come from there and it used to be, or still is, I dk, a big shipping port, which is relevant. But if you want people to take you seriously you have to give us more REAL info, or leads, or something. There are literally like 826473920204747 different avenues to look into when it comes to all this. I mean seriously, WHAT is your M.O.?? Are you genuine? Are you disinfo? Are you a combination? Are you just like...fucking legitimately obsessed with Racine, WI? Every single one of your comments is about fucking WI. Your NAME is Wisconsin is Corrupt, ffs. Seriously. Wtf are you??

                 It is true and it is genuine. This is not a joke or a distraction. Here is more of the story and how it evolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Victims and witnesses to extreme levels of criminal corruption in Wisconsin began wondering how it was even possible for prominent figures to get away with crime after crime after crime without any oversight or accountability, while openly bragging and threatening anyone who raised questions or concerns. They figured that the District Attorney or Sheriff would step in, investigate and hold them accountable, but that never happened, and the District Attorney of Racine became involved in his own criminal activity and cover up with other officials. He was too compromised so the power groups had him resign, after he had covered up many cases of criminal corruption. They wanted to avoid more of a spotlight on Racine while they tampered records, destroyed evidence and continued their criminal activities. The new DA of Racine is also corrupt and incompetent, and all other authorities at local and state levels are closely connected, and either involved or complicit to it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The corruption links through the prison systems and juvenile detention systems that are full of abuse, rigged insider deals, and cover ups. It is a tightly controlled prison industry that rigs contracts for lawmakers involved and their networks, similar to all of the groups that are involved in helping families and children. There were some civil cases including a RICO case that was settled through fraud, threats and intimidation that would have exposed a small portion of the criminal activities in Racine. The FBI and DOJ had more than enough information to convene a grand jury and begin indictments, but Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled the investigations into Racine along with the Clinton investigations. Racine and the Clintons are closely connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lynch was completely corrupt, but it appeared that all of the top layers including Comey, McCabe, Kadzik and others were also involved. It seemed impossible that the entire system would turn their backs on what was obvious abuse and criminal corruption. Then Pizzagate happened, and more dots started to connect back to Racine. Voltaire said find out who you cannot criticize and you will find out who rules you. That is Racine, and they do not like any criticism. They are willing to go to any lengths to silence and stop any investigations. There are some of the most powerful people in the country and the world who are linked to this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It may sound strange but Racine is the key to showing how Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption are all linked together. It is a much different route than what the rest of the crowd is going after, and while people can get excited about low level busts and the prospects of the Awan brothers, that is not going to solve the huge complex network of corruption. Those are distractions. Racine is no distraction. It is an epicenter of criminal corruption, and ties to Chicago and the heart of Pizzagate and those involved. The harbor plays a large role in this and Racine has a long history of crime, corruption and trafficking as well as mafia ties and secret societies. The ties alone to the Clintons should get everyone interested in investigating this further.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sustainability, community policing, social surveillance programs, Zika Virus, vaccination programs, and much more all link back to the beginnings in Racine, Wisconsin. That should raise a lot more eyebrows. These people involved are some of the smartest people in the world. They know exactly what they are doing. If you follow the leads you will find it is all true information with many, many connections to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is corrupt and there are tons of cases that can prove that. All Trump and Sessions need to do is investigate it and raid the city and the people connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Paul Ryan has been made aware of the criminal corruption in his own district but refuses to investigate. That should raise concerns. There is a reason he won't investigate. He is protecting the system. He is a globalist who is funded by the same groups that fund both sides of the establishment. The Wisconsin AG is in the same groups as the people involved, and secret and closed societies rule Wisconsin. It is a very racist and corrupt state, and is a system of modern slavery, racism and extreme abuse. The incarceration rates for minorities and the infant mortality rates are at extreme and disproportionate levels. It is also the dialysis capital of the world, with links to the mafia, gangs, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and organ trafficking. It is also closely connected to virus and vaccine programs, and a testing ground for sustainability, Agenda 2030, community policing, surveillance programs and other new world order initiatives. The abuse through the catholic church is known throughout Wisconsin, and the only possible American Pope is from nearby Milwaukee. Racine is also a Sanctuary City with an influx of undocumented immigrants and refugees. Everything is tightly controlled by the same groups and the secret societies that have infiltrated all levels of government, business and organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is all real. It is all true. it is all connected. This is not a distraction or disinformation in any way. George Webb doesn't care about justice. Robert Steele doesn't care about justice. David Seaman is an opportunist. This is none of those. The entire world is at stake, and Pizzagate is the closest anyone has come to showing the world the real truth. This may be the last chance. Racine alone is a huge case with many connections and is very difficult to outline here in comments in a way that makes sense to everyone, but just like Pizzagate it is all absolutely shocking. The difference is that Racine's corruption is brazen, sloppy, and easily provable if only the FBI would do their job and raid the city and those who are connected. It would then begin linking to every single aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker have all been working against Trump. If Trump and Sessions realize what they are really up against and have any real intentions to drain the swamp and fight the global corruption cabal, they need to start by draining the swamp in Paul, Reince and Scott's backyard.

                  I didn't read your whole wall of text because when someone asked you for references, evidence, or even reasoning for reaching the conclusion you have reached, you told the same story. People can decide for themselves what to make of your claims, but I don't believe your Racine lead helps pizzagate in the way you say it does. It's hsrd to tell if you have no evidence to back your claims because you speculated or are intentionally misleading. I for one will treat your obsession with Racine as a distraction.

                   Racine is criminally corrupt. The amount of evidence is overwhelming and not easily summarized. There is case after case that can prove the pattern of corruption, racketeering and collusion. See what happened with the former mayor and district attorney who refused to investigate anything. Look into the recent RICO case and Talking Racine videos, look up old Racine Exposed and News the Journal Times Can't Use, and the Pattern or Practice documentary. Then look at the high profile pedo cases. From there see who was involved in pay to play racketeering both in Racine and with the Clintons. Look up who owns the Zika Virus patent, learn about Agenda 2030, and how both sustainable development and community policing began in Racine linked with the Clintons. Look at the Knights of Pythias wikipedia page, who the members are and where they held their only parade in history. Look into the Indian burial mounds in Racine, and look into the corruption and abuse going on within the prison and youth detention programs. Look at the history of the mafia and cases such as Dennis Troha, and notice the unusual number of pizza places in Racine. See how close the harbor is to Chicago, see how Racine is a sanctuary city filled with gangs and undocumented immigrants. Learn about Racine being the dialysis capital of the world with one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country. Once you have figured this all out, ask yourself why are Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker three of the most powerful Republicans in the nation.

                   That should get you started, and if you think all of that is a distraction and can't figure out how this ties to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, no amount of links or witness testimony would be enough for you. This is not a simple case, and some information cannot be presented here due to gang stalking and death threats. You need to be a critical thinker and realize how real and dangerous this is.

                 Cracked me up, I know how you feel. It's like what Churchill said about Russia in 1939. "It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma." All this cloak and dagger stuff ... drives me nuts :)  I don't know who this guy is :)  I've done some research too, haven't really found anything.

                 Pizza places served as fronts for trafficking and laundering. That is why Racine is full of them. The area was a hideout and vacation spot for the mafia.

                 130 Days of videos and counting. Watched all of them and do not believe he can be trusted. He keeps shifting his story, contradicting himself, saying he doesn't want anyone to go to prison, has subtle inside references and obscure statements about some of the people involved, and has now created the new set of foreign boogeymen.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are trying to distract and redirect the path of the investigation, and that is why Racine is important. It is not their intended path, and is not a moving target.

                  Yeah I noticed a lot of the pizza places there were Italian so I figured Mafia. There is a disproportional amount there. People here are divided about Webb, I don't want to say what I feel. But seriously, Racine is the bullseye more than DC and many other places? Looks like Rockefeller has the Zika vaccine patent.

                   That is correct. Wisconsin is a front for the entire system much like some pizza places serve as a front for trafficking, laundering, and criminal corruption. Racine is not the bullseye. Racine is the easiest domino to knock over. It is a weak link to the entire network. It is also the area where Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are from, and once you figure out how Racine is connected to the Zika virus, vaccine programs, water (the new oil), sustainability (Agenda 2030), the mafia, the Clintons, pizza and pedo crimes, satanic abuse, prison abuse, church abuse, and many, many secret and closed societies, you will begin to understand how these boy scouts became so powerful and what they are really covering up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   DC is a known hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Chicago is a known hub. Pennsylvania, Arizona, Haiti, and others as well. No one suspected Racine. It is shocking and alarming. There have always been some who know the real truth - that doesn't matter and at this point, no one even cares about the corruption in DC, Chicago, and other areas. It is an accepted practice.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They are not afraid the truth. They are afraid of Common Global Knowledge of the truth, and a common understanding of how everything is connected and how it connects to them and their own community. Racine is the case study that would open people's eyes in a way that Chicago and DC won't. Wikileaks and the spirit cooking emails showed how powerful this is, and however difficult is was to prove anything with those emails, the result was undeniable. People were disgusted, and it helped propel Trump to victory.

                   They need to control the Internet as soon as possible to keep that from happening so they can continue moving forward with their plans, undeterred by the masses. At first George Webb seemed possibly legit. As time grew, more and more red flags emerged. He is not in danger, and his proof of life videos were a bit of a stretch. The biggest question is why are there so few views on his videos. Wouldn't nearly all levels of law enforcement be interested in watching those, yet only a few hundred or few thousand seem to be watching. That is suspicious. His stories keep shifting and avoiding real accountability. When one theory and direction does not catch hold, he moves on to another. The latest with the Awan brothers is the most suspicious, and his calls for Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy to fix the situation are absurd. They are both compromised and not going to do anything except string the people along while they protect each other and those who fund them. Even Rand Paul has been compromised. Cynthia McKinney and Sibel Edmonds both seem more believable than most of the whistleblowers, and there are few others involved who can be trusted. We all know what happened with the Franklin cover up, and the same thing is happening again unless we take a different path to change the history of the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   While everyone else runs around in circles arguing about David Seaman, Infowars, George Webb and how to solve Pizzagate while nothing happens except some low level busts, nothing has changed about Racine or the system of corruption and abuse. Racine is absolutely corrupt without question, the FBI already knows it, and it is connected to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
