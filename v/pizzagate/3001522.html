              Fairfield is where the Richest NYC hang, even if they do not own a place there. Such a short drive from Manhattan Island. Sleepy Hollow is an actual place where people lost their heads,  In 1779, Frederick Philipse III, a Loyalist, was attained for treason, The manor was confiscated and sold at public auction, split between 287 buyers. The largest tract of land (about 750 acres ) was at the Upper Mills; it passed to numerous owners until 1951, when it was acquired by Sleepy Hollow Restorations. Thanks to the philanthropy of John D. Rockefeller Jr., about 20 acres were restored as today's historic site.

            CAFO is discussed in this article:
            <a href="https://adoptionland.org/1022/christians-alliance-for-orphan-q-a/">
             https://adoptionland.org/1022/christians-alliance-for-orphan-q-a/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CAFO for the last several years has been undergoing a transformation in which
             <strong>
              intercountry adoption (ICA), which had been emphasized early in the movement
             </strong>
             , receives less attention, while other kinds of interventions and ministries receive greater attention. In addition, many Christians active in the spheres in which CAFO operates have become more informed about the complexities involved in adoption and “orphan” care, and more vocal in questioning the prior simplistic narratives.     Some in leadership, such as Jedd Medefind, are open to dialogue.   The changes are evident looking back over the last four years.   These positive trends continue to gain momentum,
             <strong>
              although they still have a long way to go.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Many people—children, first families, adoptive families, communities, and the adoption system itself—have been harmed by the mistaken approaches to ICA advocated and implemented by the movement.  Those harms are ongoing, for adoption is not just a moment-in-time invention, but alters the lives and trajectories of lives permanently.
            </p>
            <p>
             From my perspective, the movement did not merely rhetorically over-emphasize international adoption, it actually undermined international adoption by advocating flawed practices.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              One odd thing about CAFO is how little information about illicit practices in international adoption is actually available at CAFO events.
             </em>
             So far as I can tell, there have been no planned sessions and little discussion about either the specifics of illicit practices, nor the current crises in Ethiopia, DRC Congo, Uganda, and (in the recent past) Guatemala, Cambodia, Nepal and Vietnam (for example) that are related to illicit practices.  CAFO claims to present the best information on international adoption and children’s rights, and yet you could attend all of CAFO with virtually no information or discussions of these issues.
            </p>

             <strong>
              The orphan industrial complex
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Aside from the usual paternalism of north-south relations, charities’ child rescue narratives constantly place children of the global south in the position of needing ‘saving’ by northern benefactors. From organisations like ‘Save the Children’ to a prominent orphan movement in evangelical churches (which has been likened by critics to both colonial civilizing missions and slavery), these child rescue narratives not only create cognitive dissonance between the protection of children at home and abroad. They fuel the orphan industrial complex that makes orphans commodified objects for intervention, from tourism to mission trips to intercountry adoption (ICA). Orphans are now effectively being ‘manufactured’ to meet the demand of child rescuers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been conducting research with children for two decades in Uganda. Since the orphan industrial complex set its sights on the country in 2009, the number of orphanages has increased five-fold, as have ICAs. Approximately 95 percent of the 800+ orphanages now operating in Uganda are foreign-funded, yet only about 30 of them are licensed. It is furthermore estimated that 85 percent of the children in Uganda’s burgeoning childcare institutions have living and locatable relatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             This situation is not unique to Uganda. It is part of a broader pattern in the developing world that we see whenever orphanhood becomes commodified.

             Yes, I remember that.

             I used to say that half-jokingly, when Podesta got whipped on his Twitter by woke people, but I'm really convinced that he has masochistic traits, too.

              Self flagellation is taught in history books as an uncommon thing that some monks practiced. Who knows with these weirdos. Opus Dei has also been rumored to be a militant/assassin arm of the Vatican. Knights of Malta take the oath to defend the church. I have only met one K of M, and he was nuts. Definitely two personalities in the same day, but I did not think much of it at the time.

             My wife has been running three miles every morning with her best friend that she met in Catholic grammar school. She’s involved in a lot of activities. I like golf. We like to travel together. Honestly, most of our activities in the last 10 years have been focused around the Order of Malta and working down in Honduras. Now, we’re very much involved in Legatus and in working with the bishop in our community.

             During the 1980s, Father Jones, after graduating from Dartmouth College, went on to** serve as a special assistant and speechwriter in President Ronald Reagan’s administration. In 1988, Father Jones also served as a coalition director for President George H.W. Bush’s successful presidential campaign.**

             Then discerning a call to the priesthood, Father Jones entered the seminary and was ordained a priest in 1992. He has served as a parish parochial vicar and as an adjunct professor of religious studies at Fairfield University. From 1995 to 2000, Father Jones served as secretary to the late Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport before the bishop went on to become the cardinal-archbishop of New York.

            Douglas Perlitz, 39, was arrested in September after a federal grand jury indicted him on 10 counts related to the abuse of nine boys over a period of 10 years. Last week, a superseding indictment brought an additional nine counts against Perlitz, and alleges he abused a total of 18 boys. Perlitz founded and operated a home and school for needy children in Haiti, known as Project Pierre Toussaint, which has since closed. He is accused of enticing the boys with promises of food and shelter and with gifts such as cell phones and cash, in exchange for sexual acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the new indictment in federal district court in Connecticut, Perlitz provided money and told one of the boys that he would not be kicked out of the school even if he failed his classes. He allegedly offered another boy and his family money and other benefits, and in another case, gave a television, shoes, clothes and meals to another boy, all in exchange for sexual acts and their silence. Those who did not cooperate with Perlitz were denied benefits, the indictment states. Perlitz was arrested in September at his home in Colorado, but he had lived for years in Haiti, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The Haiti Fund Inc., the nonprofit fundraising arm of his project, was incorporated in Connecticut, where Perlitz had attended Fairfield University.
           </p>
           <p>
            If convicted, Perlitz would face a maximum of 30 years in prison and fine of $2.5 million, according to the Justice Department.

                Oh,I agree and  I believe that to Be True.  But they do have control in certain areas.  I too believe that the pope is higher on the ladder than they are as well.  The pope controls Malta.  He pushed Raymond Burke of St. Louis Mo. out a while back which shocked many and appointed his own man.  Someone more in line with his thinking.

                Maybe there is not, but some conservatives are fake ones too.  I had to step away but I am going to continue looking.  It just seems they run just about everything.
