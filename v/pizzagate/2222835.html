            Santa Barbara from the police to the governor is one of the most corrupt and abusive counties in the USA .
You can’t even get an attorney to represent you because they know if you have your case tried in SB that they are screwed before they enter the courtroom. Montecito with Oprah and the others falls under that county. Of course they said he never reported anything. Look at who donates to their cities... the Gates names are plastered everywhere... check it out! O’Reilly lives there and many many other famous and wealthy folks. Baldwins and Dennis Miller... the list is endless. Only to be out done by the Beverly Hills Police. Paid for and owned by the El Ites!
He’s lucky they didn’t off him! Nastiest bunch of entitled pieces of crap on the planet pay for the privacy to do their evil. Look up some of the large foundations there and even the hospital. The list of donors is quite revealing. Lived for over 40 years next door to that place. It reeks of evil.

            It is obvious that Corey F. has been sexually abused. He also shows signs of having been MKUltra mind  controled.
           </p>
           <p>
            My support of Corey stops at giving $$ to him. No one who supports HillPedo and her Criminal Cabal gets my $$.

            Why are we all taking the word of the Santa Barbara Police as more truthful than a victims??
           </p>
           <p>
            Has no one been paying attention to the organized nature of pedophilia worldwide?   It always involves the Police wherever it happens,  and the prosecutors and the judges and the lawyers and the clergy.   It's a power and control thing.  Like the Manor Lords and their peasants.  The Lords used to call the cops a fancy name, ....Knights.  This made them feel better than the other, more common servants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Telling the truth is a conditional thing, it's in the job description never to make the department look bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cops never Rat!

             Corey does have plausible deniability on this matter I agree that his claim could be legitimate that the LAPD did not record that segment.

             The abused will always give info first on the abuser that is least threatening. To test the water. If the authorities believe Corey, they question Grissom, Grissom denies but doesn't fuss to much, Corey will name others. The first abuser to start making things difficult, you will see Corey start backing off. Unless, Corey has security physically &amp; mentally the biggest Pedo to abuse him may never be revealed by Corey himself.

             A 10 MILLION dollar project about his life and a bit part actor trying to give Feldman a handy? I don't mean to be insensitive and minimalize real abuses but that's my point much more went on and he is STILL unwilling to name any real players, and so remains complicit.

            <p>
             He lied to Oz and the American people once again, right to our fuckin' faces.

            Corey Feldman Names Names: Accuses Former Co-Star Of Molesting Him
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman fingers John Grissom:
           </p>
           <p>
            Prior to the singer's revelation on the talk show, Feldman wrote about the alleged pedophile in his 2014 autobiography, "Coreyography: A Memoir," identifying Grissom by a false name, Ron Crimson, as advised by his lawyers at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, Grissom, who has been suspected by some on social media for several weeks, addressed speculation that he was Feldman's predator.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Grissom's comment section on YouTube he denied Feldman's accusations and wrote to one site user, "I said its not me I'm sick and tired of saying that when no one listens. So goddamnit I'm not repeating it anymore.﻿"
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman warned Hollywood pedophiles issuing a message, "Now is your time. Be a man for the first time and come forward yourself. Turn yourself in. Let it be known...If you do not we’re coming for you."
           </p>
           <p>
            The 46 year old told Dr. Oz he informed the Santa Barbara Police Department in 1993 the names of attackers in Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kelly Hoover, Public Information Officer for Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office told Fox News, "We are aware of the statements that Mr. Feldman is making regarding an investigation in 1993. Our records do not indicate that he named any suspects. If he has any information regarding a crime or crimes that occurred, we encourage him to contact our office or his local law enforcement agency."
           </p>
           <p>
            Feldman instead called the Los Angeles Police Department while on Dr. Oz with the intention of naming alleged pedophiles in Hollywood.  The call was not allowed to be recorded for confidentiality reasons, however, the actor claimed he would cooperate with any investigations going forward.
