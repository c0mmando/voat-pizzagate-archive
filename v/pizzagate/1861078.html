            I hope so, but I am hoping that some will not think they have the right to decide who must die.  Some older people are good at heart but believe there is good in people and just can't accept it. It is not my decision to decide to kill someone unless they have killed.  It will be our job to make sure that the news gets out.

            Yeah, but two of the younger group do not and will not believe all the things I have tried to tell them about Obama and the Clintons.  I have not even let loose all of the most heinous crimes.  They say Oh, they did some good things and are not perfect, but we cannot believe either one of them could do such things.  If that is true I will never see this group face the truth in my life time.

             I have a completely brainwashed person in my day to day. He cannot accept that there is any wrongdoing by any authority in the Church or Dem party. Yesterday he just said that Comey was the most principled law enforcer we've ever had and that this is the best government the world has ever had. I brought up McCabe's political conflict of interest and he changed the subject to say that Trump takes money from Russia and the email leaks were fake news. (the cognitive dissonance is stunning). Fortunately he is retired but I'm afraid to say too much or he will actually have a meltdown and end up with a real heart attack.  It makes me want to cry because I see this complete entrenchment on both political sides and there is so much available evidence to show that the parties are a fallacy for a larger sinister agenda. I'm beginning to think that this person might be have been compromised at some point in his career and is afraid of the truth coming out.

              I think the problem within parties is the same problem as in religions.  When people have spend their life voting (for whomever) and donating and giving money to the Church or whatever place of worship it is hard to admit that they have been duped.  They feel stupid.  I am a more apt to excuse the older people than I do the younger ones.  The older ones have more invested and get most of their news from the MSM.  Younger people have more access to the internet and talking to friends as well, but they still choose to not see the forest through the trees.  Plus, they are in a hurry to let you know that since they went to college, they know better.  By the way, have you seen the newly elected President of South Korea?  Another Clone from the CIA MK Ultra Pod People Creators.  I saw him and it scared the heck out of me.  We now have Trudeau, Macron and the new one (don't know his name yet.). The Soros created Pod Clones are walking the earth.

              Some of the convert Jews were vehemently against the Talmud and were staunch Catholics. Torquemada is one of my favourite Dominicans. Nearly all my favourite holy men were Dominicans actually. He was also the confessor to Isabel of Spain, one of my favourite women ever. St Teresa of Avila was either the daughter or grand daughter of conversos on her fathers side (maybe mother too I don't know) and she was unbelievably holy.

              St Paul is another Jew who rejected them for Christ.

             <p>
              Canon law states the only qualifications for becoming pope are thus: male, Catholic.

             you can't graduate from the seminary if you aren't willing to be perverted. I don't have a source but I knew a guy who quit seminary at the very end when he was expected to "perform" and refused, he became a flight attendant instead.

              I believe you. I know a few men who left the seminary... one at the time of the changes. My husband knows people who have stories about the bishops and cardinals involved in the destruction of the church after Vatican II..... we can't post sources either because we also know of men who were disappeared by their dioceses. There's an asylum not too far from us notorious for having priests who refused the changes, Protestantism introduced into the church and faggotry, who were kept drugged until they died.

            I could tell my parents about all of this and they would never believe it or they will find excuses galore.  I think that all of the religions have been around for so long that people just can't believe that they have wasted their time on something that could be so evil.  They will have to admit they were duped for centuries.  It may take a long time for this to sink in.  Unfortunately.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             AT LEAST 231 children at a famous Catholic boys’ choir in Germany were victims of physical abuse, a lawyer commissioned to investigate the scandal said today.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Domspatzen, a 1,000-year-old choir in Regensburg, Bavaria, was dragged into the massive sexual abuse scandal plaguing the Catholic Church in 2010, when allegations of assaults that took place several decades ago went public.
            </p>
            <p>
             The choir was run by Pope Benedict’s elder brother, Georg Ratzinger, from 1964 to 1994 when most of the claimed abuses took place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ratzinger has said that the alleged sexual abuse was “never discussed” in the time that he ran the choir attached to the boarding school.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawyer Ulrich Weber, who had been commissioned by the diocese to look into the cases, said at a press conference today that his research, which included 70 interviews with victims, uncovered abuse that took place from 1945 to the early 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I have here 231 reports of physical abuse,” he said, announcing a figure far higher than had previously been assumed.
            </p>
            <p>
             These ranged from sexual assault to rape, severe beatings and food deprivation, said Weber....
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You've just got to wonder how many didn't bother to come forward. I don't understand why anyone still wants anything to do with this Church, the abuse is just out of control.

              Benedict was the author of a canonical document which effectively silenced victims

             I hate Ratzinger with a passion.  I am German and he is a shameful embarrassment that has been raping and I believe has murdered children himself.  But, this has gone on in other religions as well.  If there are people that think their religion is not involved, they are sadly mistaken.  I do say though, that the Roman Catholic Religion leads the pack.

               A thousand years ago at least, at it's very inception when they divorced themselves entirely from the original Christian church, in 1054, and became a worldly empire. It's been downhill ever since.

               This is true, but they all have been taken over.  Many will be shocked to know that there are a large number in every religion, and some that are famous respected leaders that have been loved for decades.  The RCC has been infiltrated by Nazis, Satanists and Jesuits.

               The current Pope is not legitimate. He is there because of threats made against the Vatican by Banks and Obamas administration. The Catholic Church hasn't been about multicultural communism till the current and he needs to be removed or the Church will die by pedophiles and marxists.

                Agreed with a lot of that. Older popes were still satanists though.
