In Connection to Katsiantonis who was arrested almost 2 weeks ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katsiantonis has connections to the Children\'s Charity, The Smile Of A Child.  The President of “The Smile of the Child”, Costas Yannopoulos and the Head of International Cooperation of the Greek organization, Ambassador Marc Van den Reeck, were invited to present the actions of “The Smile of the Child” to the Board of Directors of the World Hellenic Inter-Parliamentary Association taking place in Athens in the framework of an official visit of the delegation to Greece.</p>
<p>The parliamentarians of Greek descent, headed by President Thomas Katsiantonis, State Representative of New Hampshire, USA showed particular interest in the direct work of the Organization, 52.200 children and their families having been supported in the first semester of 2016 alone through nationwide actions on a 24/7 basis and 365 days/year.  The World Hellenic Inter-Parliamentary Association is a non partisan political association which was founded in August 1996, the same year that “The Smile of the Child” was also founded.</p>
<p>Katsiantonis seems to also have an interest in the growing of human organs.  Katsiantonis voted in favor of ridding an old police station in Manchester, New Hampshire, in order to allow some companies to move into the area, which were allowed and operated by Entrepreneur Dean Kamen in order to initiate Research efforts into growing human organs and tissue, right where the old Police station used to be.   The operation costed an estimated $300 Million and this is done in Manchester on an “industrial scale.”</p>
<p>Katsiantonis can be found at least 3 times associating with the Clintons on Greece’s issues, as well as US – Greece relations in order to “strengthen” the bond between the two nations economically and diplomatically.  The visit to the US and particularly in the state of New Hampshire, where MP centrists stood at Union v. Larisa attended along with Marios Georgiadis (MP with the Center Union Party A ‘Athens), following an official invitation of Raymond Buckley, President of the Democratic Party I.P S.A., at the event on the field hockey verizon Wireless Arena, which saw the start of the election campaign of the candidates of the Democratic Party with the keynotes of candidates US Presidents Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>At the same table attended and Tom Katsiantonis – active MP in New Hampshire and President PADEE representing the Greeks abroad, Jeanne Shaheen – US Senator, Chris Pappas – Director of State Hillary Clinton and responsible economic Democratic Party , Esther Booras – active MP in New Hampshire, D ‘Allesandro – Senator of New Hampshire, Chris Spyrou – President Hellenic American Union, former chairman of the Democratic Party of New Hampshire, in which there was an exchange of views and information on developments in Greece.   As you can see, Katsiantonis has very deep ties in politics, charity work for children, and the owner of two pizza parlors.</p>
