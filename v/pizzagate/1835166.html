She has advanced foreign policy interests across a broad range of issues including democratization and human rights, trade and investment liberalization, counter-terrorism and immigration. She served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Service s from 2002-2005 and as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo from 2000-2002.

<p>*Secretary of State John Kerry appointed former career diplomat Janice Jacobs as the government agency’s &quot;transparency coordinator&quot; who will be responsible for improving its document preservation and transparency systems.</p>
<p>*Jacobs, who most recently worked as Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs before retiring last year, appears to have donated the maximum $2,700 to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in June, according to records from the Federal Election Commission. Jacobs will be tasked with ensuring that the department responds more efficiently to FOIA requests and improving the agency’s document preservation and production.</p>
<p>*Kerry labeled Jacobs, who once served as the U.S. Ambassador to Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, &quot;exactly the right person for this job.&quot;</p>

<p>Q: Does the Department of State do anything if a child is abducted from Japan to the United States?</p>
<p>DAS Bond: While we would work with domestic agencies to assist a left behind parent in Japan, we are not aware of any cases where a child has been abducted from Japan to the United States. Japan’s accession to the Hague Abduction Convention would provide a legal basis for cooperation in resolving cases of children abducted to the U.S. from Japan.</p>

<p>She presses for foreign adoptions - Cuts in foreign adoptions causing anxiety in USA</p>
<p>Not so long ago, the Markoffs\' adoption of Phan might not have been as complicated. But today, international adoptions are increasingly complex for Americans, a trend that is reducing the number of foreign children entering the United States and leading more prospective parents to look into adopting from U.S. foster care. (Because fuck the people from your country nukka! You need some diversity!)</p>
<p>At the same time, several nations that have sent many orphans to the USA — namely China, Russia and South Korea — have begun encouraging more domestic adoptions, and limiting foreign ones, as their economies improve. As a result, a historic shift in foreign adoptions is underway.</p>
<p>Last year, China, Russia, South Korea and Guatemala — the big four in providing candidates for adoption here — accounted for 70% of the 19,292 children who entered the USA for adoption. Three years ago, those nations accounted for 79% of the 22,728 kids who came here for adoption.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two African nations, Ethiopia and Liberia, are emerging as popular countries to a dopt from, although the number of children they send here remains relatively small. (ALL HUGE PEDO SPOTS)</p>
<p>ALL BASED AROUND THE HAGUE ADOPTION CONVENTION</p>
<p>About 129,000 of the estimated 510,000 children in foster care across the USA were eligible for adoption in 2006, according to the most recent federal data. About 50,000 were adopted that year, compared with 20,679 foreigners adopted by Americans. Children are placed in foster care because of neglect or abuse. The average age is 8; one-third are 3 or younger.</p>
<p>They ALL have ties to &quot;Winrock International&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.winrock.org/">https://www.winrock.org/</a></p>
<p>Winrock International is a recognized leader in U.S. and international development with a focus on social, agricultural and environmental issues. Inspired by its namesake Winthrop Rockefeller, Winrock combines scientific and technical expertise with entrepreneurial innovation to deliver market-based solutions that improve lives around the world. Winrock’s mission is to empower the disadvantaged, increase economic opportunity and sustain natural resources across the globe.</p>

           Meanwhile, two African nations, Ethiopia and Liberia, are emerging as popular countries to a dopt from, although the number of children they send here remains relatively small. (ALL HUGE PEDO SPOTS)

           About 129,000 of the estimated 510,000 children in foster care across the USA were eligible for adoption in 2006, according to the most recent federal data. About 50,000 were adopted that year, compared with 20,679 foreigners adopted by Americans. Children are placed in foster care because of neglect or abuse. The average age is 8; one-third are 3 or younger.
