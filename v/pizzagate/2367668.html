            I think TG is keeping his opinion under that pre-semifag haircut of his so that he has a job opportunity to prosecute their asses locked in.  He can't lead up prosecution for the State or especially refer for prosecution anyone if he comes off as heavily opinionated.

            John Podesta is a fascinating man, no less. How do you get to be the most senior adviser to successive Democrat leaders, Bill Clinton, Barak Obama and of course Hilary Clinton for President and not know how to pull the ropes. What do you actually have to do to get to a position like that. What do you see. What do you know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exactly.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing that strikes me in the Wikileaks emails, is the guy is never fazed and rarely raises questions. In many cases it’s like he’s dumping Hilary in it, not averting, just being malleable to outer forces.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s no way you can have that demeanour to not just daily politics and machinations but all the atrocities in the world and not be fazed. That’s why what they do is real. It’s the enth degree. It preps them for the ‘real’ world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides the fact he is a Jesuit, had parents who adopted 25 children and works closely with his brother Tony, to cover all corners of the world, literally. He’s a 70 yr old senior bureaucrat who wears a hoodie on weekends outside or work, to look teenager-y and stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that the identikits of Maddie McCanns abductors looked so much like Tony and John Podesta, the link with Clement Freud and the fact that the Washington sourced detective who represented the McCanns was a few weeks ago found brutally murdered in a sea of blood is a red flag, hey.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you start looking through Tony Podesta’s Facebook contacts, you’ll find heaps of Podestas, many in Italy and Brazil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s Tony Podesta, of Augusta, Italy.
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=623418971003925&amp;set=pb.100000074825567.-2207520000.1517399495.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">
             https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=623418971003925&amp;set=pb.100000074825567.-2207520000.1517399495.&amp;type=3&amp;theater
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He loves Ducati’s, heavy metal, DJ-ing and studied art. That’s all cool, whatevs. When I was reading through all the comments though, he makes a reference back to The Tony Podesta we know, saying “hey brother , and then a wink emoji.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me that’s about genetics, shared genetics between the Podesta’s, through the Podesta orphanage in Guatamala and beyond. I’d say Alex Podesta, bunny rabbit boy is also one of the 25.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s another photo of Tony on his FB page.
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=602410423104780&amp;set=a.369931723019319.93760.100000074825567&amp;type=3&amp;theater">
             https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=602410423104780&amp;set=a.369931723019319.93760.100000074825567&amp;type=3&amp;theater
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I just wanted to get this up, see if it resonated.
           </p>
           <p>
            My feeling is that Tamara Luzzatto runs a book club with 25 people in the circle. I would say these 25 are the adopted 'brothers and sisters 'of John and Tony Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            More to come, just wanted to make some comment on my first real post on this site. Hope it helps.

             To answer your question, it seems John Podesta was entrusted with a treasure trove of blackmail by close Clinton associates.
            </p>
            <p>
             How many things has John Podesta gotten away with so far? Don't you think all these 'victories' of his fuel his feelings of invincibility?
            </p>
            <p>
             There is obviously a deep state government in the background. If I've learned ANYTHING about these people, it's that they govern with blackmail. Podesta was entrusted with the blackmail. It's obvious now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of the problem is many of the people in government have been in it for decades; senators, governors, FBI etc. I don't care who you are, chances are that they got blackmail on these folks, one way or another. They play dirty, have people EVERYWHERE, and seemingly unlimited funds from drug and human trafficking. They suck you in with one little thing, and then that one thing hangs over your head FOREVER.

              Yes its all about blackmail, but John Podesta was higher up than any of the Presidents he served. He 'reported' to those who invested, and kept things 'moving' behind the scenes. Many of these people foreign actors and governments. Far harder position than being a mouthpiece President where everything's written for you, you don't really need to think, just turn up.
Like the emails from Lynn de Rothschild being lobbed into Hilary campaign cabal giving her two cents every so often about what Hilary should be talking about. And then she did. But when Johnny boy blamed the Russians, Lynn gave him a serve on Twitter and his walls came tumbling down.

               Yeah, noticed how he got publicly scolded when Hillary lost; by Lynne de Rothschild. It was framed as tossing him under the bus for the loss, but he was higher up on the food chain than Hillary. When justice comes, the masses will be shouting twice as loud for Hillary, but the kingmaker behind the throne is the one that the Luciferian ‘gods’ are blaming for their failed plan.

              Yes he does have way more skeletons, my wordy, need weeks to write it down. I got enticed by a report yesterday about the book club email from Grand Tam talking about the circle of 25, so wanted to explore that more. Have you seen how alike John Podesta and Augusta,Italy Podesta look.

             Gowdy is an actor on the NWO stage drama team. The bankers intentionally pit the Republicans and Democrats against one another and hope the sheep follow. The two parties get to squabble over who gets to steal the most taxpayer dollars and this is incentive for the actors to keep the drama going. At the end of the day this is why the racket does not get busted up. They fight each other over the proceeds of the big theft and then band together to protect the bigger game.

             This is well known by the truly red pilled and its why this sub is now losing even more people since they drug the Q psyop into this sub. People are sick of this government cheerleading squad that has blistered the truth movement.

             Probably true. They can’t ignore it anymore, so we will likely see more politicians dipping their toes in the truth waters sooner or later, because when they do, they look like heroes. Don’t put yer faith in th government tho. Their just tools and maybe we can convince em t o do their job if there’s enough of us.

            Trey Gowdy, like all other politicians, is a traitor. He pretends to fight them. Wagging his finger and name calling is all he has ever been good for. Not a word from Gowdy about how the IRS is owned by owners of the worlds central banks, the British Crown and the Vatican. You would think he would know we might want these details. All politicians are  political actors and part of the fiction of US government. Gowdy can go to hell.

             He knows, but couldn't be bothered to say what he knows, get it out to the public, or go through the evidence at all. It just isn't important enough, right? His casual statements are supposed to represent him fighting the good fight. As always, you have all been had. This is why the Satanist always own you, they are smarter. It is true. most are useless eaters. Elite over sheeple any day of the week. But fuck both of them.

              I don't think they are smarter...just have more power over us and can prevent us from spreading the truth.  I think that they are stupid, but they think they are bright and can get away with anything.
