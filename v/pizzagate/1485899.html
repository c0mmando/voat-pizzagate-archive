            I would agree with this.  There seems to be abundance of shill shaming.  Your theory could definitely have merits that instead of just posting questionable and race-baiting leads, part of their strategy is to frequently tag someone as a shill to stifle members. I think that, while it's good to be skeptical, we have to have find balance between calling out someone as a shill vs. keeping an open mind.

            Here is the key. If someone is accused of being a shill, or if they call someone a shill, look at their history.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Creating an account and posting some outlandish claim/lunatic sounding theory, without documentation = shill (helps "fake news" and "lunatic fringe" narrative)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Creating an account to regurgitate old, unsubstantiated posts = shill (wasting time, to slide legit posts off front page)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Creating doubt in the mods without ANY evidence = shill (although sometimes they are just being confused since they do not understand the importance of documenting claims). Remember, we are NOT fake news.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Including incendiary, violence-provoking language or bigotry/hatred is likely a shill (fits MSM narrative of "racist haters"). Unfortunately, some of these people are not technically shills, but those types of posts are not welcome on this platform as we are in a fight against the MSM and must be welcoming to the new arrivals that join our fight each day.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Inconsistency: Being overly cautious to a possible lead and then making exaggerated claims = shill.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Calling others shills, downplaying findings, going off topic = shill. This is done to instill division, remove enthusiastic pursuit, or create distraction.
Using the above filters makes most shillery pretty obvious.

             Each of your warnings relies on finding fault with a posters
             <em>
              rhetoric
             </em>
             , not with their
             <em>
              logic
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             There are important differences.  Logical and evidentiary consistency is what is being looked for and is what is most important,  not necessarily rhetorical consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
             IE - 'posting some outlandish claim' -- is an appeal to rhetoric.  Simply posting something 'outlandish' does not a priori make it untrue. ALL of pedophilic activity is outlandish by its very horrific nature.  It is outlandish...but  in the case of pizzagate it also happens to be true.  Something outlandish can also be true.
            </p>
            <p>
             IE - Incendiary language is not necessarily always useful or pleasant, but it does not a priori rule out a person's information from BEING LOGICALLY TRUE.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, logical consistency is the plumline.  Not necessarily rhetorical consistency.

              Just to be clear, in the bullets:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               <p>
                First bullet involves logic. A claim lacking support is not a logical argument. While it may even be true, we are looking for support/evidence to move it forward. Otherwise, it is a disconnected theory until someone documents the connection.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Bullet 2 is actually a documented technique of CTR...reposting old information that lacks substantiation. They do this many times each day.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Bullet 3 is also a logical flaw. If you are to accuse a MOD of being a shill, then provide evidence. Otherwise, you give us no reason to listen.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Bullet 5 is all about logic. Someone who jumps from being highly cautious and questioning what looks to be legitimate information and then is seen to post bold claims with zero support is not behaving consistently. It is a common trait for the CTR shills that hang around beyond the normal wall-text post to slide the front page.

              Someone can make an "outlandish claim"...but they need to bring support to it. If they state it as a finding/claim, that is very different than if they say it is a theory. The filters I use to find CTR tend to be pretty good. A look at history helps sort out whether someone is just so pissed that they cannot control themselves or if it is CTR deliberately trying to infiltrate our posts with vitriol to fit their narrative. The censorship (or calls to tone it down) of violent calls or bigotry has more to do with the ongoing fight with the MSM, but it also relates to new arrivals. We should be focused on driving the evidence with support to nail these sick people. The more we focus on that, the better. The rhetoric comes into play since there is a PR aspect (MSM and welcoming those new to the research).

            Are we gonna have to add "NO CALLING OUT SHILLS OR POSTING ABOUT SHILLS OUTSIDE THE LIST OF SUSPECTED SHILLS" to the rules?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is getting really ridiculous. We have the "List of suspected shills" post pinned on the sidebar for a reason. Post your shill accusations and evidence THERE.

            Good call. We are getting better at catching them quickly. I love when they call out the Mods. The question: Show me evidence that they (the Mods) are not on our side. The push back from the mods is to provide substantiation for claims to keep things moving forward. They have also been good at trying to maintain the tone because there is a PR issue we are fighting against the MSM. There is no place for hatred or bigotry in this forum. We are all upset, and the target should be the monsters hurting kids and not a particular group. People should be convicted for their sick crimes and not because of where they were born.

            Yes. A look at my history shows I am not a shill, but I'm regularly accused. It is usually easy to spot a real CTR shill by looking at their history and patterns or posts/comments. The first tell is when something that does not seem major or substantiated flies up the board, especially if it has the kind of fake and hostile news the MSM wants. If a look at history shows they just joined and this is a repeat of an old post, that is a classic CTR shill. I have become pretty good at spotting them, and they are extremely active.

            Could U tell us how many baby's you get to rape? I'm sure the CTR isn't paying your kind in CASH, I think pedo's like you work for toddler raping.

            Millenial_Falcon's first post here was community shaming and he's done a lot of concern trolling since then too. He has stickied his post telling everyone "nothing to see here" about Andrew Kline despite not proving his point. Maybe it was Veritas that filed the papers. But where is the evidence for that? Maybe it also could have been DOJ Andrew Kline. I don't know. But I don't like someone telling us to ignore one, when no proof is offered.

             He is not a shill. There is a lot of history to the Saudi posts. If you look at them, and I have, CTR was generating new accounts and reposting the exact same Saudi posts, with no new information and zero support, over and over. Do a search on Arab, look at these posts, and you will see the pattern...new account, posts a wall of text, usually filled with racist language. They will not provide any support for it. No one is saying there is NOT a Saudi connection. We are just saying, if you make a claim that there is, provide evidence.

            All the shill accounts are being way too obvious now though, they'll come up with another diversion and we'll have to counter it, just remember to check any evidence presented and don't accept an all caps title as truth.

            I got called a shill today because I'm realistic and/or play devil's advocate and hold truth and common sense to a higher standard with important matters. I do it with every controversial subject that I defend (pizzagate, Michael Jackson, my religion).

            Ask yourself why you are not allowed to freely discuss the Saudi connection. Ask why mods have removed any discussion of it, or will swarm you with "shill" when you offer reasonable comments. Ask why they have made a stickie calling it "disinfo."

             SAUDI ARABIA AND THE INTERNATIONAL SEX SLAVE TRADE
            </p>
            <p>
             Saudi Arabia has long been involved in purchasing sex slaves. Up until recently, most of these slaves were purchased in Africa. With the advent of oil wealth the Saudi princes have been able to extend their slave purchases throughout the world. This has enabled the Saudi princes to become more selective and specialized in their tastes for slaves. The Saud family continue to be the prime purchasers on the international slave trade and are known as high end buyers. The Saudi Arabian Government continues to refuse to sign the United Nations treaties on slavery or other human rights issues because they do not want to be subject to their provisions. They will not sign extradition treaties even with Washington. They constantly declare they are free of slavery but will not allow international scrutiny. We will deal with the kidnaping of US male and female children by Saudi princes and their associates in this issue. We will substantiate the pattern of abuse using documented occurrence where the princes and their associates have been caught.

              is CTR shill. They are changing their ways. They waited 20 minutes after creating the account before posting the standard Saudi rant with zero support or link to our investigation. See how easy it is to spot them.

Recently, they thought picking a name we might like (maybe slamming chelsea?) would make us look at them differently. THe CTR trolls are actually incredibly stupid. You would have to be to support the disgusting maggots with whom they side.

            That is exactly what they're doing. It's an old cointel technique to cause distrust and fragmentation.

            I believe there is already a tread here to call out shills, I'm sorry I can't find it right now but I just read it the other day. I agree with you 100%, I'm starting to get the feeling that most of the people who cry shill right off the bat with asking any questions first, is likely a shill. Also, any comments that are full of profanity, slander, bigotry, racism, etc, etc is likely a shill and should be downvoated and completely ignored, meaning 100% no contact. Its their job to distract people from investigating and following leads by whatever means necessary, and if they can get you pissed off, they win. 100% no contact makes their efforts 100% useless.

             If you see the quick calls of someone as a shill, look at the history. In some cases, the person has tried to infect this forum repeatedly, and it is known by many.

            Or are pizzagate researchers accusing shills of being shills?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's very hard sometimes to tell who is on Team Sanity and fighting for the children and who isn''t.
           </p>
           <p>
            We do have very good shills here -- although they do seem to only be here at certain
            <em>
             hours
            </em>
            of the day -- who will pretend to be for the cause of exposing pizzagate, but who will mix in some misinformation or disinformation alongside good information.
           </p>
           <p>
            A person needs to check comment histories for patterns...those provide a strong clue.  You should also look at things like how long a person has been on voat (although that is not always revealing, sometimes it is)...and whether or not the comments a person makes are helping to keep a discussion on track, or taking it in a direction of confusion and fog.  Stay wary ...even of mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            Use the trivium (logical reasoning) as much as possible and watch for logical fallacies.  And pray for divine help if you are a praying person!
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of traps have been set.  Be on your guard.  Review the procedures of CTR posted in this subverse.  That will awaken you to the techniques that they use.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the best.

             Also, the shills come to each others' aid. Within minutes sometimes. Keep track of these names that will come to their defense. I've noticed a definite pattern. I noticed this logical fallacy problem too and thought I would post something about the trivium: 17 votes, 4 of those were downvotes. I think that the voaters think it's too nerdy, or something. Perhaps we try to simply point out fallacies, one by one. Regards. Keep exposing the shillfactor.

               Yeah, it seems they have another account to spoof/parody Phobos_Mothership called something like "Phobos_Mentorship." If they're trying to trick people with that other name, it means the original is legit.

            Anyone who is coming out and saying OMG THIS IS 100% BULLSHIT right away is suspicious. Anyone who is giving clear and well thought out responses that offer room for discussion, is likely not a shill. If something seems fake, calmly and evenhandedly provide reasoning for why you think so. I think as long as WE all stick to thinking clearly and providing solid reasoning when we have disagreements, it should be clear who is a shill and who isn't.

             There are a lot of different people here right now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's assume that the majority are pure researchers, trying all they can to remove their own personal political/religious/etc bias and absorb/research/share info trying to connect the dots. Then there are anti-liberals, with an agenda, that see this as an opportunity to smear democrats. Then there are anti-semitics, that see this as an opportunity to smear Jews. Then there are white supremecists that see this as an opportunity to smear all non-whites. Then there are the chaotics, that just want to watch the world burn. Then there are some mentally ill people, that don't really have a grasp on reality. Then there are conspiracy theory bandwagoners, that are here just because it's a popular conspiracy theory. Then there are shills, here to cause internal fighting, and give false clues/leads to lead people on a wild goose chase. Then there are people with religious agendas. Then there are people with anti-LGBT agendas. Then there are people that truly do not believe, and are here just trying to debunk everything, even if evidence holds some weight.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are a lot of people, each with their own agenda, and no one really knows who is who. It gets confusing, frustrating, interesting, and many many more adjectives. I keep coming back because I feel like there's something here, and as long as we can maintain our sanity, and fight for the real truth, we will eventually find a lead that breaks through to something real concrete. Keep going!

              Very few people on this platform fit the stereotypes. The vast majority seem very reasonable. Some are both outraged and without a filter or with biased views, but their number is pretty small. I have written extensively about shill tactics in my comments to help people navigate.

              Thanks for pointing this out. As someone who's been nonstop researching for the past two weeks, it's very hard to make an impact when I'm still only at 15 upvoats. Please make an effort to upvote those who are spending time and making valuable contributions--I know it's easy to forget when jumping around from link to link.

               Flashy wording seems to "sell" here. Could sadly leave compelling but innocuously worded evidence behind.

             I mostly agree (I first started to pay attention to Andrew Kline when I noticed all the THIS HAS BEEN DEBUNKED ALREADY posts), except that this forum also hosts a far more dangerous type of shill, the kind that presents calm arguments that might seem reasoned but actually hide logical flaws and dangerously bad advice. These posts are then upvoted by bots so that it looks like the community agrees with the suggested path of action.
            </p>
            <p>
             The latter type of shills must be expensive. We're definitely on the real track, but we could use a place with non-shill moderators.

             The NYT hit piece on Pizzagate was CTR, that our investigation is a witch-hunt, that Clinton is a witch, and that CPP was HQ for witches. Stupid fucking shit.

             We all agreed ( at one time ) that FBIanon was key to all, that he was 100% correct, but now in the past 24 hours  the MODS are saying that FBIanon was a shill and that the saying that "UK &amp; SAUDI" are involved in child sex slavery is anti-semitic.

               is a shill. When you see something confusing, dig into the poster's history. It usually clarifies the questions.

             That gets tough with so many people attacking those with good intentions.  I know we should know better but it does become discouraging and raise questions of doubt from op's. It's hard to believe this is going on a place that is supposed to be a safe haven for researchers,  but this is clearly not that place

              It's not always easy staying the course of truth even when you get attacked, but that must become our responsibility as researchers. There's always going to be someone who points the finger for simply presenting an idea, but as long as we develop this movement with logic, appropriateness, open-mindedness, and discernment as major pillars of our mentality, we can quickly root out the rot. I really believe the majority of us are smart enough to distinguish healthy speculation from baseless lies.

            What I have noticed is that any new account that posts a submission is attacked as being a shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who have been here and have high points are just called 'known shills'
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a time they only attacked people who didn't support Trump, I think that was to make it appear that PIZZAGATE was a 'pro trump' investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now they seem to want to control the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note they have always prevented us from talking about Andrew Kline, a banned topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now they ( See mod sticky at top of new ) tell us that SAUDI &amp; KLINE are not PEDO's,...
           </p>
           <p>
            It's obvious folks that CTR/CF are the owners of this sub.

            It's honestly some next level undercover shit that should probably be documented,  but not at the expense of taking away from the actual goal at hand.  But there might be a little something in following the leads of the shill accusers

             Normal way to destroy, and remember these are mostly bots that are trained on keywords.

             You can just ignore them, but the real problem is the MODS are in support of the SHILL-BOT narrative.

            i've noticed, its almost like no one trusts anyone...
           </p>
           <p>
            i hate to " language police "  or " Tone police "  but with the next psy op no doubt coming we need to downvoat anything
that could be interpreted by MSM as hate speech or ' call to action '
           </p>
           <p>
            i believe that theory to be correct about there's going to be a target on muslims, obviously tying the islam faith to child brides etc
i don't know how we can even hope to head this off, other than to have our people watch for suspicious activity...
           </p>
           <p>
            i am not opposed to legitimate research of Saudi influence, but  PLEASE let the facts speak for themselves...
we don't need to be dramatic when talking about our findings.
           </p>
           <p>
            save the drama for youtube...

             ) was the exact theory I posted today. The pattern is evident, with Loretta Lynch yesterday and the constant barrage by CTR to get us onto the Saudi thread...with zero evidence to link to our investigation.

            FACT-PROVEN: 31 days ago /reddit shutdown pizzagate, on that day king-kong-mod ( real life CTR ) created this sub
           </p>
           <p>
            This sub is an orchestrated limited hangout to destroy the pizzagate investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note carefully that these shills who slide and destroy all OP's are always backed up by the MOD's who later mark the OP as "debunked' well after 100's of good people have posted evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this post is a shit-post by a shill, but the real enemy here is the OWNERS of CTR and the MOD who created this subverse

              Can you just paste it in here as a response? I want to see it as I only care about exposure of the truth. The Mods have a tough job as there are active CTR shills trying to spread disinfo, so they want anything that is a claim to show support for the claim.
