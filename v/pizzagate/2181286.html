One of the employees said that they saw him multiple times come in with different babies and many times with a woman or another adult. This story personally affected me because I\'ve been going to this particular Chick Fil A since I was a kid. My mom would take my brother and I here all the time when I was in High School and I had a good friend who became one of my coworkers work here for years. Last time I ate there was half a year I ago when my best friend and I stopped to get a sandwich and fries. I have been in both the restaurant many times, and in that bathroom, where this sick motherfucker raped babies in. I literally feel sick. Everytime now that I drive past there and see that restaurant I\'m going to be reminded of that monster now. How horrifically sad and unbelievable... This man has destroyed many infants lives and is a sick demon. </p>
<p>Well it turns out the Daycare he worked for was unlicensed, being run from an apartment. The employee said he would show up with a woman and other adults all the time. I have a feeling OPD is not telling the full story. This was a pedophile front. They haven\'t released how many different babies but the employee said it was different ones. This story sickens me to the core. This fucking Chick-Fil A now makes me want to vomit as it\'s close to my house and I pass by it all the time. This was a pedophile Daycare that was supplies babies to be raped. So sickening to the core... </p>

            I totally understand your distress, but unless we can find some kind of reason why this relates to Pizzagate, I think the mods are going to delete your post again.

            Chick-Fil-A donates generously to anti-child-abuse charities. Unlicensed daycare is a concern, but it's kind of hard to relate it to elite pedophilia. This kid's mom trusted the wrong people, and that seems to be the extent of the story.

            Why was topic erased? was a reason given by a MOD?
Today I experienced total and complete CENSORSHIP here by ML ; this Platform is compromised!
