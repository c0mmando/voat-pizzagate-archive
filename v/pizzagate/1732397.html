            Was Michael Jackson an MK Ultra who broke his programming and had to be eliminated? When he was just a child his song had lyrics '...... A B C .....as easy as One Two Three.....' This is a reference to Gematria, Kabalah. The guy who wrote the lyrics was an initiate of Kabalah - Jackson was already in the clutches of the monster. I remember world going bonkers over Michael's bizarre behaviour - all consistent with MK Ultra. He was used to procure children - Peter Pan was his alter ego. In the end he came out of it (as many MK Ultras do) and he had to be silenced.

            I have studied the Michael Jackson allegations for over four years. I have supported their cause to be heard. This case is exactly what pedogate is about. It is about someone who used his power, wealth, influence and fame to groom, abuse and discard his victims like they  a stick of gum that had lost it's flavor. Don't know if he was a victim of sexual abuse himself, he may well of been. However my emphasis is not on him but on the many victims who have been called liars, harassed by fanatical fans and who have been told to be quiet. This case embodies what the perpetrators use as a weapon and that weapon is Cognitive Dissonance.  This theory states that people have a difficult time reconciling with the fact that a man or woman could be loving, caring and charitable to children but also be able to rape and abuse these same children. However these two diametrically opposed  qualities can exist in one person and we need to understand and educate ourselves and others on cognitive dissonance. Because when you have a man that has admitted to sharing his private quarters and bed with child after child. Who has now been accused seven times by seven different accusers.... all at different times. Has paid off three of these accusers. Had one accuser accurately describe the underside of his genitals. Had "photography" books depicting nude children which were edited by pedophiles. Took several boys on tour with him for months at a time and shared a suite and bed for 100 ' s of nights. Has a new female accuser who has love letters and checks written to her totaling over 900,000 and this is just a sampling of information.  If we cannot support these men/woman who have come forward with this mountain of evidence than we are failing. I will hopefully be at the March 25th March On Washington and part of the reason why I will be there is for the victims of Michael Jackson who have had their lives stolen to continue the illusion of a pop star.

             “The documents exposed Jackson as a manipulative, drug-and-sex-crazed predator who used blood, gore, sexually explicit images of animal sacrifice and perverse adult sex acts to bend children to his will,” a source told the website. “He also had disgusting and downright shocking images of child torture, adult and child nudity, female bondage and sadomasochism.”

              Do you get the impression though that he was one of the MKUltra victims, horrifically abused as a child in order to fragment his psyche and make him controllable in later life? I'm sure mega stars like Jackson can get into all sorts of places and get themselves invited to meetings with all sorts of people that would be too risky if not impossible for your average CIA operative. Just switch his personality to the one that expresses the horrors he endured as a child, bring him some kids, catch it all on camera, and when  you show him what he did he'll be re-traumatised and evermore compliant - you know he'll never tell anyone about the things he's had to do on behalf of the US government.

              It was very clear to me that MJ wasn't at all like these other sick fucks, he was a complete mess, it was like his whole body was constantly being crushed and crippled under some unbearably heavy load. Sociopaths don't get messed up like that, because they just do not give a shit, their consciences are clear no matter what despicable crimes they commit. That's why people often find it hard to believe when they discover some smiling, friendly and charismatic person is actually a sadistic child molestor, because they never gave the slightest hint that they were burdened with a terrible secret, or that they harboured even a whiff of guilt - because they didn't! But MJ was obviously massively fucked up. And it's no coincidence that several of these 'mega stars' have made allusions to some shadowy group of people that control them - I'm thinking Prince off the top of my head but I'm sure there are others.

               In lght of what I know now, I question whether MJ's Neverland was in fact a hub for child trafficking like Comet Ping Pong with all the codes, underground tunnels etc.

            I really think Michael Jackson was abused as a child and spent his "adult" life trying to help kids in his own broken way. He's an MKUltra, but not an abuser.

            You raise some good points.  Please note that t IN NO WAY condone, endorse, or excuse the horrific acts that Michael Jackson, the black Jew entertainer, perpetrated upon his victims.  However, perhaps I can shed some light on some of this from a survivor's perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The funny thing about Michael Jackson was that he in-a-way stole children too. It seemed like he wanted the eight year olds he befriended to like him more than their parents by taking them on extravagant shopping sprees and fancy trips." -- Yes, he selfishly "stole" these children as though possessions for him to use/"own" as he saw fit.  He was grooming the children, and their crappy parents were greedy sickos who no doubt liked the cash, gifts, etc. and didn't care enough about their own offspring to protect them from that predator.  (Nobody can convince me that the parents didn't know this wasn't appropriate; nobody is that stupid.  That they were in "denial" [because they didn't want to see] is also possible.) It has been discussed on this forum several times that there is a certain group that doesn't love/care for their own offspring as normal people do.
           </p>
           <p>
            "There is barely an excuse for Michael to act out and complain that he didn't have a childhood. His siblings turned out fine and they didn't act like weirdos." -- Absolutely, there is NO excuse for his actions.  Period.  As for his siblings, study narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), and you will learn that parents can treat their own offspring in starkly different ways.  Michael was likely the "scapegoat child," the child who couldn't do anything right and got into "trouble" more often because of it.  Usually the more sensitive child is targeted for "special" abuse and is designated the scapegoat.  Usually once the parent(s) choose a scapegoat, the rest of the family (other siblings, extended family) join in to abuse the child.  Many times the parent overtly encourages the golden child(ren) to abuse the scapegoat.  I haven't studied the Jackson family specifically so don't know who the "golden child(ren)" was/were. (There can be more than one, and the roles can also change).. As the term suggests, golden children "can do no wrong."  This scapegoat child-golden child dichotomy is the epitome of black-white simplistic thinking that a certain group is known for.
           </p>
           <p>
            "All I've heard him talk about was that his father beat him with a belt a lot and insulted his nose."  -- Beatings with a belt can be quite severe, especially if the buckle is used or the belt has been modified (e.g., nails/spikes and/or holes in it).  Even a "plain" belt or strap can cause severe injuries under certain circumstances (pressure exerted, number of "licks," part of body hit, how much and what type of clothing worn by victim, etc.).  In addition, victims of severe child abuse rarely convey the frequency and severity of their abuse to others.  This dark reality is something they somehow must learn to live with, and frequently they are so "shut down" they aren't in touch with the details of their painful memories and/or feelings to convey them anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dysfunctional families are expert at keeping secrets, and while some info has trickled out, we may never know how dark and sick the Jackson Family really is.

              No.  There are PLENTY of black Jews, e.g. O.J. Simpson and every other black actor.

              Being Jewish is about GENES, not the religion of Judaism.
