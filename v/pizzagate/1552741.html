<p>You get a much better context for pizzagate if you look at more of the cases that have come before. </p>
<p>The most important IMHO is &quot;The Finders&quot; \'87 case. If you read anything, it should be THIS.

<p>This document that shows the CIA covering up international child sex trafficking, ritual abuse <a href="https://i.sli.mg/wiTwoZ.pngPNG">https://i.sli.mg/wiTwoZ.pngPNG</a> and mind control all in one place. It describes &quot;international money transfer&quot; <a href="https://i.sli.mg/fCFRgh.pngPNG">https://i.sli.mg/fCFRgh.pngPNG</a> including to China and the UK. This instance goes some way to showing us a glimpse as to what the trafficking and abuse going on behind CPP really looks like, and how it operates. Another thread posted today mentioned that 80% of the CPP neighborhood are CIA agents. That makes so much more sense when viewed in context of &quot;The Finders&quot; and the fact that it was specifically the CIA which appeared to be connected to the operation when they made it an &quot;internal matter.&quot; - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lBIDWR.pngPNG">https://i.sli.mg/lBIDWR.pngPNG</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1548634">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1548634</a></p>
<p>The records from &quot;The Finders&quot; documents show the CIA protecting a ritualistic, abuse syndicate that literally practiced &quot;blood rituals.&quot; Podesta has strong \'spook\' ties. So this context is important in bridging the CIA, and the podesta/alefantis &quot;satanic&quot; ritual abuse.</p>
<p>NYtimes article confirming this event happened, <a href="http://archive.is/j2LRi">http://archive.is/j2LRi</a></p>
<p>It will be really interesting if CPP &amp; surrounding area really IS infested with CIA for this reason.</p>

Aquino should not be considered the only perpetrator, he is one example of the US military\'s involvement with these programs that bridges the ritual abuse aspect of things with black ops on children of the programming variety. </p>
<p>Dutroux is important because of the huge amount of verified (+ wikileaks verified) documentation on it.

            George Webber's YouTube channel educated me about CIA Brownstoning: videoing key people in increasingly worse sexual situations for later blackmail and control.  George says that since sexual mores have been relaxed they have to use younger and younger victims.  But I have to ask myself, what is worse than baby raping?  It has to be murder and cannibalism.

             CVLT PANDA:
            </strong>
            Maybe it is just hipsters being hipsters, but I am also intrigued by the cultish nature of the Alefantis group and his repeated references to accepting all people, making everyone comfortable.  Alefantis is really a chameleon operative; he is great at making people with fringe desires feel okay with themselves, so that they trust him.  Because of his apparent openness and loyalty, he attracts the deviant hipsters.  This video  shows one of the hipster wannabe satanic groups on a forest outing
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/53724413">
             CVLT Panda Video vol 7
            </a>
            .  Notice they are chanting the song from the tv show
            <em>
             Friends
            </em>
            at 3:50.  Apart from the creepy music, I feel they are satanic because of other signs and symbols, including the inclusion of goat lithographs at 2:08 in this video:
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/50897683">
             ++CVLT++
            </a>
            .
            <br/>
            So my working thesis is that JA is a CIA operative using his people skills to assemble a kind of lost boys cult that will assist him in his endeavors without constraint of moral concerns.  It may not be, probably is not, these exact people in the video, but rather it is veteran wait staff, abused children of CIA agent families(long story here) and victims of childhood abuse who flock to him.
            <br/>
            This is alleged and not trying to throw the people appearing in the videos, linked from CPP Friends page under the bus, but they depict the kind of loyalty that an operative cultivates (pun serendipitous).

            Good God, is there anything redeemable about the CIA? At some point, someone actually thought "We should f**k kids and worship the devil. That will really improve our ability to spy".

            Thank you.  Criminals like Dutroux are sent out to do the dirty work for elites, and intelligence organizations.
Allen Dulles/CIA MKULTRA are part of the foundation as shown in their Finder's Cult: &gt; "The Finders" and the fact that it was specifically the CIA which appeared to be connected to the operation when they made it an "internal matter." -
