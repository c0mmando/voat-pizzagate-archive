<p>The most important IMHO is &quot;The Finders&quot; \'87 case. If you read anything, it should be THIS.

It describes &quot;international money transfer&quot; <a href="https://i.sli.mg/fCFRgh.pngPNG">https://i.sli.mg/fCFRgh.pngPNG</a> including to China and the UK. This instance goes some way to showing us a glimpse as to what the trafficking and abuse going on behind CPP really looks like, and how it operates. Another thread posted today mentioned that 80% of the CPP neighborhood are CIA agents. That makes so much more sense when viewed in context of &quot;The Finders&quot; and the fact that it was specifically the CIA which appeared to be connected to the operation when they made it an &quot;internal matter.&quot; - <a href="https://i.sli.mg/lBIDWR.pngPNG">https://i.sli.mg/lBIDWR.pngPNG</a></p>

<p>The records from &quot;The Finders&quot; documents show the CIA protecting a ritualistic, abuse syndicate that literally practiced &quot;blood rituals.&quot; Podesta has strong \'spook\' ties. So this context is important in bridging the CIA, and the podesta/alefantis &quot;satanic&quot; ritual abuse.</p>

Aquino should not be considered the only perpetrator, he is one example of the US military\'s involvement with these programs that bridges the ritual abuse aspect of things with black ops on children of the programming variety. </p>
<p>Dutroux is important because of the huge amount of verified (+ wikileaks verified) documentation on it.

<p>Once again, this is verified by a story in the NYTimes back when they actually reported news. <a href="http://archive.is/mTEz3">http://archive.is/mTEz3</a></p>
<p>Hampstead is important because the children (I think the younger boy) was counseled at Tavistock Clinic. 
<a href="https://crimesofempire.com/2015/03/11/hampstead-leaked-medical-reports-end-all-doubt-about-sexual-abuse-claims/">https://crimesofempire.com/2015/03/11/hampstead-leaked-medical-reports-end-all-doubt-about-sexual-abuse-claims/</a></p>
<p>These cases taken together, start to build a larger picture with which to look at CPP, Podesta and Alefantis. You get an idea of how significant those CIA ties (ha Georgetown John, really?) are.. Hope this post helps someone in researching further. </p>
<p>These are by no means the only cases that should be looked at but I thought they were important to add into consideration when people are bringing up Franklin over and over again without any other cases with it.</p>',

           Hampstead is important because the children (I think the younger boy) was counseled at Tavistock Clinic.

           These cases taken together, start to build a larger picture with which to look at CPP, Podesta and Alefantis. You get an idea of how significant those CIA ties (ha Georgetown John, really?) are.. Hope this post helps someone in researching further.

           These are by no means the only cases that should be looked at but I thought they were important to add into consideration when people are bringing up Franklin over and over again without any other cases with it.

            George Webber's YouTube channel educated me about CIA Brownstoning: videoing key people in increasingly worse sexual situations for later blackmail and control.  George says that since sexual mores have been relaxed they have to use younger and younger victims.  But I have to ask myself, what is worse than baby raping?  It has to be murder and cannibalism.

            <strong>
             CVLT PANDA:
            </strong>
            Maybe it is just hipsters being hipsters, but I am also intrigued by the cultish nature of the Alefantis group and his repeated references to accepting all people, making everyone comfortable.  Alefantis is really a chameleon operative; he is great at making people with fringe desires feel okay with themselves, so that they trust him.  Because of his apparent openness and loyalty, he attracts the deviant hipsters.  This video  shows one of the hipster wannabe satanic groups on a forest outing
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/53724413">
             CVLT Panda Video vol 7
            </a>
            .  Notice they are chanting the song from the tv show
            <em>
             Friends
            </em>
            at 3:50.  Apart from the creepy music, I feel they are satanic because of other signs and symbols, including the inclusion of goat lithographs at 2:08 in this video:
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/50897683">
             ++CVLT++
            </a>
            .
            <br/>
            So my working thesis is that JA is a CIA operative using his people skills to assemble a kind of lost boys cult that will assist him in his endeavors without constraint of moral concerns.  It may not be, probably is not, these exact people in the video, but rather it is veteran wait staff, abused children of CIA agent families(long story here) and victims of childhood abuse who flock to him.
            <br/>
            This is alleged and not trying to throw the people appearing in the videos, linked from CPP Friends page under the bus, but they depict the kind of loyalty that an operative cultivates (pun serendipitous).

            Good God, is there anything redeemable about the CIA? At some point, someone actually thought "We should f**k kids and worship the devil. That will really improve our ability to spy".
