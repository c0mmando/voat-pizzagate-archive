              Haha no need to be so emotional buddy. I personally think the Don is a hero. But that link shows a fact: an endorsement by the founder of PizzaRanch. Nothing less, nothing more. Stay open-minded. You never know. If it was Clinton, the link would surely have made it to the OP. So it is only fair to include it in this topic. That is all.

               Not emotional just passionate, the children need us. And you really didn't add anything, the GOP candidate ALWAYS hits the "Pizza Ranch Circuit" every election cycle. You have to look deeper than that. If you can find any other additional connections I would love to hear them. I dont expect you to though, not anymore  to Trump at least. I looked into this quite a bit and I have made many connections but the only the one of Trump is him going to a Pizza Ranch on the campaign trail which is the default for GOP candidates. If he was previously affiliated with the GOP party you may have more of a case to make but he has never been in politics before, so again really no connection there. I am pretty unbiased and there are quite a few GOP party members in the OP, hell the post is about a convicted Republican pedophile, hes the founder of Pizza Ranch. So yea... if you have something to add i'm always open and up for debate but this just seems like a shill/troll post, I did find the link about Trumps visit when I was making up the post and dove in as far as I could but there were no other connections to Trump that I could find at least. therefor that link was omitted from the OP. The reason being as I stated before he has never been a GOP member before so there is no previous ties to Pizza Ranch, or the Pizza Ranch Circuit other than the default scheduled visit to the Pizza Ranch Circuit that every GOP candidate does during their campaign trail.

            This is northwest Iowa where many Dutch immigrants settled and farmed, so last names with Van.... are very common in that area.  There are over 100 Pizza Ranch franchise locations throughout several midwest states.

             I gotta tell ya I tried to look up Sioux Falls on the national sex offenders website and there were so many return results it could not display them. Yea.....I would really recommend going on there or the Iowa sex offender database and searching from your address so you know who is around you.

            Everythings a coincidence right? lol The reason its not a coincidence is because they don't even show the damn thing, and the wife completely ignores the question like it was never asked, very odd. Except its not odd at all when you understand the reference they are making has nothing to do with food.

            The most obvious but most hidden message would be at 0:40 secs "oo cactus bread, do we have a photo of that?" - the video then continues and the wife ignores the question but I did find a picture of this cactus bread from their facebook page and its one of the identified pedo symbols.

            Check out their commercial. Triangles (Pyramid) then children, then more children, then the first adult seen in the commercial can be seen wiping her mouth that has red sauce all over it depcting(blood). Nice.

            What year did Vander Esch become involved with Pizza Ranch? If he's a "co-founder", does that mean he co-founded the first Pizza Ranch in 1981 or did he purchase some franchises later on?

             Original co founder as in he opened the first Pizza Ranch in 1981. After his pedophile arrest and conviction they tried to wipe his name from the company records but he is still listed everywhere and co-founder. 
- Vander Esch's guilty plea covers three boys he molested. Now authorities think there was a long line of other victims dating back 19 years, which is almost to the start of his Pizza Ranch chain. The prosecutor has heard from 15 other employees who say they were abused by Vander Esch. The Sioux County Attorney couldn't prosecute those cases because they were beyond the three-year statute of limitations.

              I would be inclined to believe that it was an isolated pervert and not part of a culture. But if the guy was molesting the teenage boys that he employed at Pizza Ranch and he still is allowed to own Pizza Ranch restaurants, then that is hard to explain.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can safely say that when I was a teenage boy, and I'd say the same things about my friends at the time, if this guy started stroking our dicks to get a sperm sample, his pervert career would have been short lived. His life would have been short lived. What is up with Iowa that this guy could operate this dick milking scheme for so long and no one came forward except a parent?

               Yea pretty insane shit.... he molested 15 boys over the course of 19 years apparently probably starting when he opened the first Pizza Ranch in 1981) he was only arrested for it in 2001 and because of the statute of limitations they were only able to try him for the molestation of 3 of the 15 boys. So he got 10 years for molesting 3 boys but after 6 years a judge vacated his sentence so he got out of jail early and does not even have to register as a sex offender. The judge retired not too long after that.

            I just got home from eating at a pizza ranch. It's their grand opening here in Sterling, IL. I guess they are expanding their territory.
It has a seperate area probably for private meetings etc. And it has a big room with video games and other games for the kiddies.

             Great find! They seem to have a ton of ties to kids, churches, adoptions and orphan support groups.
