<p><strong>Alleged Franklin Scandal predator Harold W. Andersen hired</strong></p>
<p>In 1988 the <strong>Franklin Scandal</strong> broke and <strong>Omaha World-Herald publisher Harold W. Andersen</strong> was named as <a href="http://archive.is/bFFZx"><strong>highly involved.</strong></a>  Paul <strong>Bonacci reported him two years prior.</strong></p>
<p>He was cleared by the grand jury, and in 1993 <strong>Gupta hired Andersen on the Board of Directors to ABI (later infoUSA) !!</strong> And <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4231/35418398395_d2aa83aa40_o.png">kept him there for 12 years!!</a> <a href="http://archive.is/u7cSZ">Source (page 3)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1998 Gupta &quot;renamed the company infoUSA...[and] built [it] into a <strong>&quot;data-collection industry titan.&quot;</strong> (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <strong>1999</strong> InfoUSA acquired <strong>Donnelley Marketing,</strong> a <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4233/35260207042_b58be08762_o.png">leading database and marketing company</a> formerly part of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.  (A side note:  DM acquired from <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4238/35285847611_4326c5fec8_o.png">a company with control over money transfers!</a> )</p>
<p>In this <a href="http://archive.is/fd5Aq">article</a> a folksy story is told of the origins of Donnelley Marketing.  They <strong>leave out the &quot;Illuminati&quot; aspects:</strong> </p>
<p>The company\'s founder, Reuben Hamilton Donnelley, had both <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4236/34577323294_e6ffec02f0_o.png">a brother</a> and <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4236/35379685236_c719f265a9_o.png">a nephew</a> who were members of <strong>Skull and Bones</strong> at Yale University, an ultra-Illuminati secret society that only admits <strong>15 people per year.</strong>  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TSsEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=Thomas+Elliott+Donnelley+%2B+Skull+and+Bones+%2B+1889&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a9MWyFWkXN&amp;sig=jdRcLkKQmJwpY-6L5WiG7eiI90A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiers_ApcvUAhWJMj4KHYsgC8IQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Source</a> <a href="http://archive.is/Avt2I">Source</a> </p>
<p>Reuben himself was President of the Chicago Stock Exchange.  <a href="http://archive.is/fbhtL">Source</a>  Both brothers\' companies printed <a href="http://archive.is/zxLTs">phone books.</a>  It seems very important to the Illuminati to <strong>collect data on the American populace, and the world.</strong></p>
<p>(Side note -- <strong>a 1929 Arkancide?:</strong>   Reuben H. Donnelley of Illinois sounds like he was <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4251/35029704550_3b56445248_o.png">a good man</a> who died at only 64 because <strong>he fell seriously ill while on a hunting trip in Arkansas!</strong>)</p>
<p>Anyway, is Donnelley Marketing, are all of them in &quot;big data,&quot; CIA?</p>
<p>While DM was mostly known for printing coupons, in the town of Nevada, Iowa, a <strong>half hour from Des Moines where boys including Johnny Gosch were abducted,</strong> Donnelley also built &quot;sophisticated relational databases&quot; that &quot;in a way....<a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4222/35376108786_f762cf31bb_o.png">laid the foundation for the Facebook business</a> model.&quot;  <a href="http://archive.is/VRPdQ">Source</a>  Many consider Facebook to be IC.  Here Donnelley Marketing pops up in 1976 in Hamburg, Germany <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4240/35249099862_ce1251ed0a_o.png">handing out flyers</a> at a massive citizen protest.  <a href="http://archive.is/qAEnw">Source</a>  That was probably completely legitimate, but what else did the company do in that country? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In 2002 infoUSA hired <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> as a consultant (see next section.)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pizza reference to data industry?</strong></p>
<p>While researching I came across this <strong>coincidental(?) pizza reference</strong> tied to human/company databases:</p>
<p>In 2008 American Express Travel Services applied for a patent for a software program to prevent redundant mailings.  Companies\' data would be matched through databases such as Donnelley, D&amp;B, or Acxiom.  Example customers were all <strong>pizza companies:</strong>  Pizza Giant, <strong>Pizza Systems, Pizza Mansion,</strong> and Astro Pizza.  </p>
<p>Innocent joke by the software developers AmEx hired, <strong>or deeply sinister and tying &quot;big data&quot; somehow to Pizza-Pedogate?</strong>  I don\'t know.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="http://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US20080208735.pdf"><strong>PDF</strong> link to the application.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/K4qMA">American Express is ruled by <strong>Warren Buffett</strong></a> of <strong>Omaha;</strong> he is their major shareholder.  John De Camp named Buffett in the <a href="http://archive.is/ewx9N">Foreword</a> of his book <em>The Franklin Cover-up.</em>   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I noticed Dun &amp; Bradstreet <a href="http://archive.is/ICCDF">owned <strong>IMS Health,</strong> and <strong>Nielson</strong></a> which measures people\'s reactions to television programs.  It\'s enough to make you dizzy.  Has D&amp;B been CIA all along?  You decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2007 infoUSA hired <strong>Nancy Pelosi\'s son Paul Jr.,</strong> a Georgetown Law grad for $180,000/year as a VP although he did not report to work in Omaha.  <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4249/34617625373_b5c3563654_o.png">Instead, he had use of the <strong>planes!</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person familiar with the arrangement says Gupta treats Pelosi as a &quot;trophy&quot; and has the Speaker\'s son <strong>accompany him at high profile meetings around the country.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/CD2V5">http://archive.is/CD2V5</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Was he hired as a trophy or <strong>another word that starts with tr?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2008 InfoUSA changed its name to infoGROUP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Clinton\'s and Vinod Gupta/infoUSA/infoGROUP of Omaha</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Gupta is &quot;a close ally of both Clintons,&quot;[30] and a &quot;major Democratic fundraiser&quot;[43] and &quot;rainmaker.&quot;[44] He &quot;has a long history of giving and raising campaign money for the Clintons, and gave $1 million for the 2000 Millennium Celebration, a New Year\'s Party thrown by the Clintons.&quot;[45] Gupta later &quot;hired Bill Clinton as a consultant . . . one of two continuing business relationships [Clinton] has had since leaving office . . . worth $3.3 million,&quot;[30] through infoGroup, the company formerly &quot;owned by Vinod Gupta, <strong>a billionaire</strong>. . .contributed $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.&quot;[46]</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bill Clinton received use of PLANES plus $3.3 million from infoUSA from 2002-2008</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Bill Clinton fired from InfoGROUP job, effective today&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Today - September 30, 2008 - is Bill Clinton\'s last day on the job at InfoGROUP...After the company discovered the millions of dollars of corporate waste lost to the Clintons, his contract is not expected to be renewed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 2001 to 2005, Vinod Gupta, his family and friends, as well as certain Company directors, former President Clinton and his family, and other prominent individuals made improper, personal <strong>use of the Company’s private jets...</strong></p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This stood out:  after Clinton joined in 2002 <strong>the company acquired seven more planes.  Why?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From <strong>2003 — 2007 infoGROUP acquired partial interests in seven private aircraft.</strong></p>
<p>examined the usage of the private planes from 1998 — 2007. Exact information about the approximately <strong>1,820 flights</strong> infoGROUP paid for on private jets during this period was <strong>not available.</strong></p>

           It seems very important to the Illuminati to
           <strong>
            collect data on the American populace, and the world.

           While DM was mostly known for printing coupons, in the town of Nevada, Iowa, a

            half hour from Des Moines where boys including Johnny Gosch were abducted,
           </strong>
           Donnelley also built "sophisticated relational databases" that "in a way....

           While researching I came across this
           <strong>
            coincidental(?) pizza reference
           </strong>
           tied to human/company databases:
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2008 American Express Travel Services applied for a patent for a software program to prevent redundant mailings.  Companies' data would be matched through databases such as Donnelley, D&amp;B, or Acxiom.  Example customers were all
           <strong>
            pizza companies:
           </strong>
           Pizza Giant,
           <strong>
            Pizza Systems, Pizza Mansion,
           </strong>
           and Astro Pizza.
          </p>
          <p>
           Innocent joke by the software developers AmEx hired,
           <strong>
            or deeply sinister and tying "big data" somehow to Pizza-Pedogate?

            This is very good work and potentially a very fruitful avenue of research. It may be a bit too abstract for most to follow into the overt evidence. But it's through these paths we will find the required proof of their crimes.

            Yes, I've speculated for a while now that "big data" isn't the wondrous and helpful tech advance they've been advertising. More likely, it's the offspring of work being done for years on a system of tiered data access to protect the holy states' corruption and hold on power and to integrate available data for relatively benign use.

            You may recall the involvement of the Yale Child Study Center in the lives or purported lives of the Lanzas. Post SH psy-op the center has also been very focused on screening children in the 5-6 year old range for psych issues. Of course, any such mandated gov access to American children would put a damper on home schooling.

            In Boston, a few companies touting "big data" issued carefully worded statements about how it was used to crunch the vast flow of social media to help law enforcement find their pats...(eh ehm)...man.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of Sandy Hook may become more clear at some future time and I suspect it involves justifying the heretofore inability to have broad access to our 5-6 year old children .

            You do awfully good work for not being well versed. Am I to understand that Gupta and the Clintons  had a falling  out? Is there any connection to sex? Bill Clinton and Ron Burkle had a falling out along with that fundraiser in California who made a video about it, name escapes me. Burkle was another Jeffrey Epstein who played with under age girls and the photo of Rachel Chandler and Bill Clinton was supposed to have been on one of Burkle's jets, not Epstein. Face it, the Clinton's are g.r.i.f.t.e.r.s. (my autospell is a tyrant) who embezzled what they needed when it was not outright given to them. The three of them have never worked an honest day in their lives.

            Interesting that you bring up Harold Andersen's connection to this. From what I've been able to gather, Andersen was a CIA asset as part of Operation Mockingbird, used to control the Omaha World-Herald.
            <a href="http://www.haroldandersen.com/wp/about/">
             He was
            </a>
            , among other things, a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
            <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/62794246/">
             from 1972-1975
            </a>
            , connected to the CIA through the Franklin scandal, and later (in the 21st century) a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
