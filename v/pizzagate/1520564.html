            I did some research into this incident and people involved. It looks as if this is very possible a CIA operation gone bad. Several witnesses state the child is Obama's but Ms. Carey had made statements about feeling stalked by Obama or her house being monitored electronically (whose isn't at this point even thou it is not constitutional) Agent Caris has some bogus front company in Samford, Ct. where Adam Lanza (alleged Newtown shooter) father shooter lived. The statement provided was "a hotbed CIA mind control operations" additionally this was linked to a scientific journal entry on neuroscience results from President Obama's Mind Control experiments in 2013. So anymore questions this insanity is still going on and there are some sick creeps walking around and even worse they are in power and smile at us and tell us we are the crazy ones!!!What a joke! If someone can help me link the article I would appreciate it. The journal it is listed in is actually named Torture:asian.    So I guess Obama does like torture at least on American citizens, or maybe for youngsters in traing for the CIA.

            whatdoesitmean.com is a REAL fake news, disinformation website (one of the first on the Internet) -- Please alter your post to reflect this. It's only going to make this sub look bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorcha Faal, the pen name used by the website, is well known by conspiracy culture veterans as bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many times its content is re-published on other disinformation websites, or by people who are unaware of that it's disinfo. If you see an article elsewhere that always starts with "report circulating in the Kremlin today", there's a very strong chance it originated at whatdoesitmean.com. It's wildest claims are never sourced (because they were made up from thin air).
           </p>
           <p>
            Go read more of the articles on whatdoesitmean.com and see for yourself.

             actually, Sorcha Faal / WhatDoesItmean broke the Seth Rich murder story with involvement of Obama, Kerry State Dept, etc.

            <p>
             I find it a bit odd, if only mildly "X Files", when they cite current events relative to the story. As if they actually DO have access to Russian intelligence / "SRA reports", as they claim. Interesting tho.

            Hmm from the footage of this incident, it does not look at all like a woman made a wrong turn and oops ended up in a restricted area to be gunned down by secret service - it looks like a car chase. The car is surrounded by agents pointing guns, with police cars behind her car, and she swerves the car around to escape and speeds off, only to turn around again and flee the other way as another cop car intercepts her. Something other than random woman makes a wrong turn was going on there for sure. There was a reason she was trying to escape. If you had genuinely made a wrong turn to find yourself surrounded by SS, you'd just explain yourself and co-operate, surely?

             Here is a link
            </a>
            on the story from a less... I'll just say it- cuckoo source.
I agree this is a good place to dig! There is nothing about a love child and such here- not to rule that out! But it ponders why what seemed to be a simple traffic mistake ended the way it did. It's all super fishy, and just sad.

            Eric Francis sounds like a shady character, but not a CIA operative. Plus, if the baby's name is Erica Francis, it is quite a coincidence that the unrelated CIA operative would o be named Eric Francis. The whatdoesitmean article is a bit sketchy too. Will need more facts before following this path.

             whatdoesitmean.com is a WELL-KNOWN disinformation website that's been around for over a decade. It's literally 'fake news'. I'm part of this community and don't want it made to look bad by people brand new to conspiracy research. The stories are never sourced to back up what the article is claiming because it was made up, whole cloth. Just go read some of the other articles there.

            She was shot outside the Capitol, not the White House. She had tried to drive through a barricade at the White House and then the Secret Service chased her through downtown DC for several minutes before she ended up at the Capitol and was shot by Capitol Police (not the Secret Service). This ridiculous whatdoesitmean.com site can't even get those basic facts right, let alone all the other tinfoil hat nonsense about love children and CIA whatnot.

              Among other things, I didn't like the idea of people getting harassment and death threats based on supposed code words from 4chan weirdos, and I also didn't like the idea of people being threatened for expressing themselves through difficult and challenging artworks, like the paintings Biljana Djurdjevic made to express the harrowing experiences of being a young person having her life torn apart by the Balkan war.
             </p>

              So many people who post on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              mix up being queer or trans or being an avant garde artist with being a child molester deserving of death, and they do so not by pointing to actual advocacy of pedophilia or finding actual examples of explicitly sexual artwork involving children (which are things I would certainly not be in favor of), but by making vague statements about things looking "weird" or indefinably "creepy", as though art is just cheerful decorations or something. There's a real undercurrent of heavy handed censorship there, when art that just looks "weird" is enough to get you accused of being part of a child sex trafficking ring.

               I wonder sometimes- do you paid shills actually think you are on the right side of this when it comes to raping small children?  That we are all evil because Trump said something racist, and therefore you will prop up these supremely evil guys who traffic children and do awful things to them?  Many of you people have to realize at some point that who you are working for is not the good guys.  If you are into this shit then fuck you, but I'll bet most of you are actually not that political.  I would suggest to all you shills who are earning a little bit of money while you think you are helping the great Democrat Cause....  They are using you to protect themselves from really awful stuff that you would never consider doing yourself.

                I have often wondered that myself. Are these shills just single mom's and broke college students who have no idea what they are doing? Are they typically brainwashed dumb Americans? Are they perverts? What kind of people would want to shut down inquiries into child abuse? I don't think most commenters say the abuse or trafficking is 100% known fact. I believe commenters just want someone impartial to get to the bottom of this. Why would anyone object to this?

               In other words you are here because you are either one of the elites trying to bury this story, or paid by them.  I'm sure you would like to fill your house with paintings by Biljana Djurdjevic and sculptures of Jeff Dahmer's corpses, because you feel so passionate about the art.    Maybe you'd like an underground viewing chamber for your more 'complicated' art.   I'm wondering if you have accidently left your handkerchief with a pizza-related map on it at the vacation house?   Remember, when you were wondering if you it was better to play dominoes on cheese rather than pasta?   Maybe you were driving pasta around Washington DC, but the weather was too bad so you couldn't deliver it.  So John Podesta had to babysit the pasta, while the intended recipient had to settle for three-month old pasta.   Or maybe you run the hot dog stand in Hawaii, that these millionaire elites are so fond of.   Could it be that you one of the people invited out to the farm where the entertainment was the three small children?  You know the ones.

                See, this is what I'm talking about. I explicitly said that I would not favor pictures of child molestation and you said I posted in favor of it. And I don't know what painting specifically you're referring to but "bastinado" doesn't mean sexual molestation or anything else sexual.

                  Well that's kind of part of my point, I think it's valuable to have room for people who are weird and experimental as long as they aren't harming anyone (and yes of course I would include both child molestation and child porn as things that harm people). I have yet to see pizzagate present a single artwork that is both explicitly sexual and has children in it. The only examples anyone comes up with are ones where you have to believe a bunch of code words made up by some 4chan anon in order to "get" what the picture supposedly "really" depicts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, I described people as queer or trans, I did not say gays or trannys.

                   I'm going to have to disagree with you. Paintings showing children in underwear with their buttocks showing red and their feet reddened, (Bastinado) with their hands tied behind their back IS showing children in an explicitly sexual situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Images from the house band at Comet Ping Pong with images of a young boy naked, tied to a table with blood on his buttocks is sexualizing children AND torture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Alefantis posting pics of children (the baby with it's mouth open in a big "O") and captioning it Hotard is pedophilia-ish. His image of the toddler boy at the beach appearing to grab the buttocks of the man in the speedo and the comments WAS sexualizing a child.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You can deny it all you want to, but it wasn't "weirdos" on 4chan finding that filth that makes it weird. The shame of that belongs to the people who POSTED it.

                 Alamo theatre bar and grill??? Legally, a child is nowhere until CP's or oig of CP's does a legit welfare check and location check of that child and every infant in child in photos, that Mr pizza POSTED on his own choice on public web. Would you like your child up on public web like that or your kids viewing all that non FAM friendly stuff at pizza or on the web?

                 Things are rated g, pg, r, x, xx for a reason. Playboy can't be bought by minors. Any regular citizen do that stuff, CP's would be bombarding their homes, asap.
