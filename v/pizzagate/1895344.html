<p>On the 8th of April this year <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/shooting-at-equinox-gym-leaves-1-dead-2-wounded-in-florida/">they had a shooting in one of their gyms</a>.

Maybe that isn\'t the real reason?! He won\'t tell us anymore …</p>
<p>In the bio of his model portfolio he described himself as </p>

<p>“God-fearing, outgoing, charismatic, versatile, ambitious, kind hearted, and has a youthful and loving sense of humor.

<p>I realized I was doing absolutely nothing but fighting online and adding to the divide so I decided to change that and help in a way I felt would add not subtract from the community... I\'m not a big protestor type of guy and felt I could be more productive by spending my free time mentoring underprivileged inner city kids! So I challenge my family and friends to do the same...

<p>So, he wanted to start something real, he wanted to commit himself to work with underpriviliged children and he is a god fearing person. Made me go &quot;hmmh&quot;. Maybe he cared too much about saving children?</p>',

            Look for key corporations or persons that partner with equinox. What dots do they connect? Who are key clientele? Key locations? I.e. Denver, Portland, D.C., Virginia, California, Arizona etc? Look for pyramid setups. A owns B, B owns C, and follow the string of company connections.

            Global wine sales.  note the buy/sell locations toward the bottom of the page. Read through to the bottom. Why are there so many links way down at the bottom of the page?  An obscure portal entry? Who knows? Just interesting to note. Why was this site returned on equinox search?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do web searches with player names (db jp dws hrc) and equinox. See what kind of results are out there?  Any links to reviews (local or worldwide) that might provide background info, leads, new avenues to explore?

              Gamergate is a term that I had heard but not reasearched. This site seemed to sell game tokens and my mind just formed the question. I don't propose any connection.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you for following my trail of thoughts. Sometimes I get almost trancelike in my search journey. I must keep going until my energy is for that particular search wanes and I can disengage.
             </p>
             <p>
              So thanks for reading and thinking critically and providing valid thoughts.

               Thanks to both of us. :) 
gamergate was about Anita Sarkeesians complaint about video games being sexist. This turned into a huge online fight between female and male gamers. Something like this. Bit I really feel that every gate is just an invention of professional spin doctors. It's all just divide et impera. If there is too much harmony we get distracted by online wars. This is how I feel about "debates" recently.

             thetruesize.com

            ehm, none of the above. Thanks for asking?!

            Kudos a well put-together submission.  It does sound worthy of investigating.  Hopefully, one of these investigations will be the key to unraveling everything.
