<blockquote>
<p>A human trafficking lawsuit identified as one of the first of its kind — filed by a victim against a hotel owner or operator — recently settled out of court, NPR reports.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in Massachusetts involves a woman who accused The Shangri-La Hotel in Seekonk, Massachusetts, its operator and its on-site manager of <strong>ignoring clear signs she was in distress.</strong></p>
<p>The case, identified by NPR as one of the first filed against a hotel operator under the <strong>Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003,</strong> could serve as a bellwether for <strong>dozens of other cases filed across the U.S.</strong> against small and major hotel brands for allegedly <strong>allowing or failing to stop human trafficking on their premises.</strong></p>
<p>While this Massachusetts case involves an obscure hotel in a New England city, Houston attorney Annie McAdams filed suit against many of the nation\'s top hotel brands under the same legal theory last year. </p>
<p>The federal <strong>Trafficking Victims Protection Act</strong> cited in the recently settled Massachusetts case, and in McAdams\' cases, <strong>allows plaintiffs to hold businesses and individuals accountable for profiting from enterprises tied to or engaged in human trafficking.</strong></p>
<p>McAdams filed most of her cases in Harris County in Houston last year while <strong>also suing Facebook and Backpage</strong> for helping traffickers facilitate business and criminal activity.</p>
<p>McAdams sees all of the recent filings against hotels as a watershed moment that will provide commercial real estate owners and operators with the clarity they need to ensure they do not willingly or knowingly enable traffickers and criminal activities.</p>
<p><strong>“These are not cases where maybe somebody was raped or sexually assaulted in a room and there was no way for the hotel or business to know about it,&quot;</strong> McAdams told Bisnow last year.</p>
<p><strong>“These are cases where there is undeniable evidence that these hotels facilitated this behavior and knew that it was going on</strong> — whether it was 40 people in one room throughout a two-day period or six girls who were recovered from one hotel in different rooms. We have a situation where a 14-year-old was moved freely from room to room. Situations where it was undeniable that there were signals something was going on.”</p>

             Pretty messed up, but the fact this case settled is a positive step. Lends weight to future suits against hotel operators who allow this sort of thing to take place on their premises.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just wish the case had actually gone to trial and been settled in the public record, instead of settling out of court in relative secret.
