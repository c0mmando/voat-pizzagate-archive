Two teams of scientists published studies on Sunday showing that blood from young mice reverses aging in old mice, rejuvenating their muscles and brains. As ghoulish as the research may sound, experts said that it could lead to treatments for disorders like Alzheimer’s disease and heart disease.</p>
<p>“I am extremely excited,” said Rudolph Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research. “These findings could be a game changer.”</p>
<p>The research builds on centuries of speculation that the blood of young people contains substances that might rejuvenate older adults.

Young Blood Renews Old Mice
By Jocelyn KaiserMay. 4, 2014 , 1:00 PM
Could the elixir of youth be as simple as a protein found in young blood? In recent years, researchers studying mice found that giving old animals blood from young ones can reverse some signs of aging, and last year one team identified a growth factor in the blood that they think is partly responsible for the antiaging effect on a specific tissue—the heart. Now, that group has shown this same factor can also rejuvenate muscle and the brain.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first demonstration of a rejuvenation factor&quot; that is naturally produced, declines with age, and reverses aging in multiple tissues, says Harvard University stem cell researcher Amy Wagers, who led efforts to isolate and study the protein. Independently, another team has found that simply injecting plasma from young mice into old mice can boost learning.

<p>Amy J. Wagers, Ph.D.Amy Wagers is the Forst Family Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology at Harvard University, Senior Investigator in the Section on Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology at the Joslin Diabetes Center, an HHMI Early Career Scientist, and a member of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Wagers received her Ph.D. in Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis from Northwestern University, and completed postdoctoral training in stem cell biology at Stanford University. Dr. Wagers’ research seeks to understand how changes in stem cell activity impact tissue homeostasis and repair throughout life. Work from her lab provides evidence for the existence of a conserved systemic regulatory axis that modulates tissue maintenance and regeneration across a wide variety of tissues that vary significantly in their intrinsic repair capacity, and her ongoing studies have begun to identify the molecules responsible for age-variant regulation of regenerative potential. Dr. Wagers has authored more than 100 primary research and review articles, and her work has been recognized by awards from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Beckman Foundation, WM Keck Foundation, and Glenn Foundation, and National Institutes of Health. In 2013, she received the New York Stem Cell Foundation’s Robertson Prize for outstanding achievement in translational stem cell research.</p>
<p>Research. Aging of multicellular organisms typically involves progressive decline in the body’s ability to maintain homeostatic cell replacement and to regenerate tissues and organs after injury. Precisely how aging causes deterioration of tissue function is poorly understood, but several lines of evidence, including preliminary data from my lab, suggest that loss or functional impairment of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells contributes directly to these age-dependent failures. Our data further indicate that the effects of aging on stem cell function arise in part from alterations in the aged environment that act to suppress stem cell activity in older animals and may be enhanced or reversed by factors that circulate naturally in the bloodstream. Thus, the primary goals of our ongoing work are to molecularly identify the critical blood-borne regulators that control tissue stem cell function throughout life, and to develop novel strategies to target these systemic pathways in order to delay or reverse the detrimental effects of aging on tissue maintenance and repair.</p>

            I know this very well, "short Eyes" never fare well. Let me tell you something about felons. Never once in my career did I have any issues with non-pedophiles. I treated everyone with respect and I was treated very fairly as well. Most people do not see a small woman as a threat. and I was decent to all.
I am going to post a new finding.
