<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Jones makes the common mistake of thinking that just because he believes something, it is automatically the unvarnished truth. There is a problem with his analysis.</p>
<p>First, Pizzagate started with the discovery of strange coded language in the Podesta emails released by Wikileaks. This coded language was first brought to the fore by some astute netizens on 4 chan. Without the Podesta emails and without the observations by 4 chan researchers, the topic of Pizzagate would not exist and this discussion would not be occurring. So if Alex is correct, TPTB deliberately leaked Podesta\'s emails containing encoded pedophile language to Wikileaks with the intent for this coded language being discovered in order to distract the public away from global elite pedophile networks? That is utterly ludicrous! The overwhelming majority of people on this board would know absolutely nothing about global pedophile networks if it wasn\'t for the initial discoveries in the Podesta emails that sparked the Pizzagate discussion in the first place. The same could be said for the vast majority of red-pilled Pedogaters out there.</p>
<p>Questions to Mr. Jones:<br />
If TPTB wanted to distract us away from the global elite pedophile networks, why would they do it by red- pilling the entire world about Pedogate?  Why would they provide the initial Pizzagate bread crumbs that lead everyone directly to the topic of their debauchery? 
It doesn\'t make any logical sense.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Jones\' logic, this is what TPTB are up to:
&quot;We don\'t want you looking at global elite pedophilia.  So here all the clues you need to wake you up to the fact that there is such a thing as global elite pedophilia.&quot; </p>
<p>Before Podesta emails, 99.99% of the population had a vague notion that yes there are probably some perverts in high places but then again there are perverts in all walks of life. Not many people, however had even the slightest inkling of how vast and pervasive the problem really is. Now many people have been red pilled on this issue by Pizzagate.</p>
<p>If TPTB really didn\'t want us looking at Pedogate, why in the Hell would they wake us all up by giving us all the clues found in Pizzagate? </p>
<p>Alex Jones\' flawed logic in a nutshell.</p>
<p>TPTB: &quot;Don\'t you dare look at this.&quot;</p>
<p>Public: &quot;Look at what? We don\'t have a clue about what we are not supposed to be looking at.&quot;</p>
<p>TPTB: &quot;Oh sorry about that. Here are a bunch of hacked emails that give you everything you need to know to get you started on what you must not look at.&quot;</p>
<p>Public: &quot; Oh okay thanks. We would never have known about global elite pedophilia without these clues you provided us. Thanks for pointing us in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>TPTB: &quot;Fools! Ha Ha Ha&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry Mr. Jones. This is extremely flawed logic. Better luck next time!</p>',

            It's the same as with Trump: actions speak louder than words.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Jones follows through on his promise to go after Podesta and the Clintons, and pushes as hard as only he can, then it makes sense, what he said.
If he goes silent or only places from time to time an article without putting Trumps feet to the fire to investigate Podesta, Silsby, Clinton, then he cannot be trusted.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Seaman today put out an amazing video (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BW4E5RVVE4">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BW4E5RVVE4
            </a>
            ).
So even if Jones does not want to cover Comet Ping Pong, he could support building pressure in demanding an investigation, by interviewing David Seaman, who then could present his argumentation like in that video.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO that would combine the forces.

            Jones has an impeccable 22 year track record of telling his audience over and over and over again that the world is run by demonic sychopaths who enjoy torturing and sexually abusing children, and because he makes one calculated legal move in 2017 to be able to continue to operate unimpeded by litigation, everyone goes into a tizzy.

             You have no proof it was a legal move. We have no proof he was sued or threatened with it. You believe Alefantis would willingly take part in a court case? I don't. You believe Alex would get sued for what he has said about James, which has frankly been nothing but protecting him and assuming he is innocent, a victim of fake stuff planted online by the government, as Alex has stated. Alex is pulling a psyop in order to spark fear in others who speak out against Jimmy comet and his hotard, we all have preferences lifestyle and public comments. Well fuck Alex jones, I say. If David Seaman hasn't been sued yet for calling this pedo ring every name in the book, publicly, daily, for the past three months, then believe me, no one is getting sued.
            </p>
            <p>
             Demand to see proof of legal action or threats before assuming it's what is behind Alex retraction/warning. Alex has lied before. I caught him in two lies just yesterday, minutes before he claimed "my whole life is about telling the truth". And he's only 44!

              I don't have proof the earth is flat either, but it's self evident to you, me, and anyone else with an I.Q. greater than room temperature. I agree it's very unlikely that Alefantis would sue, but I do believe as the 49th most powerful man in D.C., he could bluff well enough for Jones to get cold feet about seeing Infowars buried in litigation before ever even getting the chance to defend himself. Suggesting Jones fabricated the story of receiving a letter from Alefantis, the contents of which we are not privy to, is just silly.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's clear that you have not even figured why Alefantis would overtly or implicitly threaten to sue Jones. At this time, Jones is Alefantis's best or perhaps only point of leverage. What Jones said about JA and CPP was very minor compared to what DS and others have said, but Jones offers the greatest potential return on any threats, i.e., in the form of a retraction that can then be used to manipulate public opinion. Alefantis, the same man who is so well connected he can find airtime and a sympathetic ear in Megan Kelly, smelled an opportunity to sue Jones
              <strong>
               as a proxy
              </strong>
              for Seaman and everyone else.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jones is being crucified for you, me, DS, and everyone else attempting to put Podesta and Co. behind bars. And when you're handed a bag of lemons you make lemonade, so Jones parsed the language in his retraction so carefully that every single person besides Alefantis remains suspect, but I'm sure you'll want to ignore this truth because it doesn't fit your narrative about how Jones is some double agent.
             </p>
             <p>
              And remember something, you think it's impossible that Alefantis would actually sue or win in a court of law?? Of course this would be the same courts and the same judicial system that is so corrupt, satanic pedophiles have been running the asylum for decades and are even flaunting their invulnerability as we speak. You don't think Alefantis would find a sympathic judge to hear the case and rule in his favor while overruling the defense at every whim? Hell, the way things are stacked in D.C. right now, he'd probably be
              <em>
               lucky
              </em>
              enough to score a veritable
              <em>
               associate
              </em>
              to hear the trial. Jones knows all this. You're naive V___T, well intentioned, but naive.

                It's been a while, but I've seen or read all of the information you cite in that thread at some point in the past. If you and I were having a chat over coffee I'd be glad to be a friendly adversary and debate on a point by point basis, but this is the wrong venue for detailed and nuanced arguments. Some of the information is false, some of it is embellished, and some of it is even true. Jones has made colossal errors at times, but on the whole, because of him, millions of people now know the deep state is no friend. In fact, as Jones has said time and again, it wants to kill you and me one way or another, and steal our children to consume physically and spiritually. Jones is indeed no Jesus, but he knows Him, of this I am certain.

            The PTB never anticipated Podesta emails. However, once the ball started rolling, they managed to use CPP as ruse. On this point, Jones is absolutely correct, even if he's almost certainly wrong about Alefantis being innocent. The mainstream media managed to turn the entire narrative upside down and smash it to bits. There are millions of people who bought the PG is fake news story hook line and sinker. Surely you don't dispute that?

             This is all right and correct.
But there is that new video from David Seaman:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BW4E5RVVE4">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BW4E5RVVE4
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Calling for an investigation of Podesta and Alefantis, as public figure, is very clever, not a ruse.
Jones could interview Seaman without making Seamans opinions his own! Problem solved.

              You're assuming jones' goal to uncover the truth rather than that he is working for the deep state as controlled opposition meant to corral the free thinkers back to what the elite feel is safe - a limited hangout operation, if you will. Jones is CIA, which explains everything.

               Not convincing because Jones is responsible for successfully redpilling millions of people!
It does not make sense to awake the masses against the global elite's plan.
Without Jones no broad awareness of NWO, globalist plan, pedosatanic blackmail government, deep state, coming internet censorship to the USA, illegal spying, GMOs, vaccines.

                I'm not sure it's true that jones can be credited with all that, but have you ever looked into the definition of a limited hangout? They HAVE to put out mostly legit info that their target audience will be interested in. It's that little 5% of untruth that is the problem. And seriously, the well known facts he reiterates on his show do not excuse him for leading people astray. He is dangerous because he has successfully convinced many that he bows to truth above all. He's an agent of the deep state. He wouldn't be successful if he didn't give his audience anything to chomp on. I'm red piled af but I never found a need to get my info from jones. I can't stand his demon voice for more than one second. There are many truth tellers out there, but the ones with big million dollar studios, whose feeds never get fucked with as with other truthers, are people to stay away from - just like the young Turks. These people are sent into the alternative world to corral us, to steer us into safe areas, and away from anything that could actually challenge the elite. Case in point: Alex's warning to us to leave James Alefantis alone and be satisfied with letting jones take over, while he promises to focus on people who are dead or have already been busted. That's a limited hangout!

                 And I have seen you all over this place trashing him constantly, every chance you get. How do we know you aren't here to plant the seed? How do we know that TPTB aren't using this retraction as a way to make us distrust the #1 biggest patriot in alternative media through you and others? That's my problem right now. How can I know who to trust, if anyone?

                 That's your problem. You let feelings cloud your mind.

                 Show me where Jones has mislead people with his big topics and where he did not have redpilled people but herded them to the NWO, pedosatanic blackmail shadow government and the surveillance state.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's almost ridiculous to write that, because it was Jones work that these things came into public's awareness.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Without Infowars there would be no Young Turks, no Vice, Snopes and all the other globalist fake platforms. They were created to counter the growing redpilling about globalism and the NWO by Infowars.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also don't understand that hysteria, because Jones apologized to Alefantis. That's absurd. Let's see, what he will do instead and judge then.

                   I know that comment and had checked it myself. Jones has very plausibly explained where she came from and that she was working as art designer for them. Which is what she does today with her company.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There's no need to put energy in denouncing Infowars. Jones made a pledge to focus on Clinton foundation/Silsby/Epstein/child trafficking, based on things that are already proven. If he does not do so, he cannot be trusted - if he does, he's a hero.
