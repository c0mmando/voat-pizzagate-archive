            Great post.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also must remember that CT is the CIA's bedroom. Fairfield Hills in Sandy Hook (now closed) was used for MKUltra experiments, for just one example.

            Excellent post, OP. This must be one of the worst pedophile cover-ups in US history, alongside Presidio and the Catholic Church pedo priests.

            And ya have to remember, a kid doesn't have to be even slightly touched on the shoulder to be considered abused. Maybe the doctor filmed one or several kids at a time; that could account for the high number.

             All of this breaks my heart and destroys my view of the whole world!
No wonder people want to stay asleep!
I bet tons of people came forward and got absolutely no where!
I feel so bad for the victims!
I am praying that these are the days for justice to be served.
If not by men then by God letting their deeds be revealed in the daylight for everyone to plainly see!

              Even though it feels that we could never do enough, it does still feel like something favorable is happening. I don't know, like the Wheel of progress is turning in favor of the children. I'm still not 100% convinced of many of the theories and "facts" posed here, but something instinctively feels just so amiss. What we do, on this journey, is take comfort in the knowledge of each other.  Much love to you.

               Thanks so much.
I think there is just too much evidence to not believe the things going on under our noses.
Like the young girl who went to Haiti to investigate human trafficking and emails a friend saying she had evidence and then supposidly commited suicide.
Too many instances like that.
Seth Rich...Vince Foster.
I think it's all true...but what I'm not sure of is just who all is in on it.
It is comforting to be able to talk to others that care.
And I love reading about all the research that these computer whizzes dig into!
God has given us many promises of being with us always so that comforts me also!
Much love to you too!

                I concur. The instances seem do seem to complete the picture. I guess I'm just waiting for a hero to release some very telling evidence to finally make it imminently clear to all, that there are children that truly need all of us - all of the time.

            Putin clearly MENTIONS ELITE PEDOPHILE PARTIES in his statement last Christmas.   Worth a watch! at (2.10seconds)

            - I heard that Putin is encouraging his people to have bigger families by giving awards and support to them!  -  This is to counter the big families the muslims are having.

             No, this is because the Russian population was decimated by tow world wars, a civil war, Bolshevik coup and reign of terror, Soviet gulags,and abortions that used to be more or less forced--all in the space of 7- years and a loss of 80 million people.

             Putin is offering any family, even those with one child, a free farm, also free of taxes for life if they sell their food locally. GMOs are not permitted in Russia.

              I read it in connection with how the population in europe are declining and by contrast the muslim population is exploding.  So either way, it sounds like a good plan Putin has to help his people.

            My little bit of research indicates the bill was not just opposed by  the Catholic bishops, it was successfully blocked. The federal government cannot tell the states how to modify their respective tort laws which are based on English common law but it can set an example by modifying its own laws and should also encourage the states thru some kind of incentives. Or maybe just propose a uniform code for all states to follow inasmuch as human trafficking and  child pornography almost always entails interstate commerce which then broadens federal powers over the  states.

            The so called suicide of the lawyer was very depressing to read. The pedophiles do not hesitate to kill anybody who might expose them. Good post.

            Thank you for this post.  It's probably very important for those of us who are 'woke' to be scouring through the thousands of photos of these suspects across the country.  I think I'll start by looking at the places that I have lived throughout my life. Wish I could give you more than one upvote.
