<blockquote>
<p>I have a story to tell you. A story that causes my heart to pound and my blood pressure to rise as I type each and every word. <strong>A true story of a woman of great wealth and power, who rode on Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express” private jet on several occasions. She appears to be a German-born Israeli state intelligence operative based in London. An ex-model whose name appeared in the Panama Papers from the Mossack Fonseca leaks and who became embroiled in a FIFA corruption scandal with Sepp Blatter and his family.</strong> She is perhaps the closest example that you could possibly find to a real-life “Bond Girl.” Yet, she is almost completely unknown to the majority of us.</p>
<p>This lady has recently infiltrated the NHS through the UK Department of Health and Social Care with the help of Matt Hancock MP, and her presence signifies a major threat to the data security of every citizen of the United Kingdom. Every single piece of data about you, your health issues, your blood type, the model of the wireless pacemaker keeping you alive, every detail of every embarrassing medical problem in the hands of the Israeli state apparatus and potentially sold off to the highest bidder. ..</p>
<p>When I was first researching the Jeffrey Epstein case, I trawled through every piece of official documentation that was available. I knew what I was looking for and how very dangerous it was. I had begun attempting to identify state assets through their movements, actions, associations, and by good old fashioned detective work. I was interested in identifying any MI5 or MI6 agents, Israeli Mossad, CIA, or any other part of a nation states spying apparatus. It’s possibly one of the most dangerous hobbies on earth, spy hunting, and if I’m honest, I’m not even sure why I’m doing it. Regardless, Jeffrey Epstein’s sweetheart deal was probably what they would give to a foreign intelligence operative. Epstein was a perfect place to begin fishing for potential spooks....</p>
<p>As of 2019, Nicole Junkermann’s current business portfolio is very impressive. She’s often described as an ex-model, entrepreneur and investor, but Ms. Junkermann is much more than just what you see at first glance. Born in Dusseldorf, Germany on 27th April 1975, Nicole Junkermann studied Business Administration at the International University of Monaco, and then went onto study Management Development at the prestigious Harvard Business School in the United States. Amongst her many talents she is multilingual and can speak German, English, French, Italian, and Spanish. In 1998, after graduating from the University of Monaco, she co-founded “Winamax,” which was an early online gaming platform that existed before online gaming regulation became a priority for the authorities. Winamax was sold in 2001 and Junkermann would go on to invest in a recently created media rights company called “Infront Sports and Media AG,” where she would soon serve as the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>..In 2002, Junkermann acquired the rights for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany with her relatively new company Infront Sports and Media. The company was best known at this time for its president and chief executive, Philippe Blatter, the nephew of Sepp Blatter, the then president of FIFA. This overt nepotistic corruption left Junkermann’s Infront Sports and Media as the company to market the TV rights to major FIFA tournaments. It went on to acquire the rights to all of FIFA’s World Cups, and even though this deal was watered down in 2006, in 2011 FIFA again gave Infront permission to sell the TV rights, in the Asian markets, for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</p>
<p>During her time at Infront Sports and Media, Junkermann would be caught flying on Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express” on three occasions. The first flight recorded, on 22nd March 2002, she would share with Epstein, Sean Koo, and one other passenger, but it’s her second trip which really stands out. On Saturday 31st August 2002, Jeffrey Epstein and Nicole Junkermann would fly from Paris Le Bourget Airport to Birmingham Airport, in the UK, alone. They would return to Paris, via the same route, on Monday 2nd September 2002. For Jeffrey Epstein to fly without any of his normally present entourage is very unusual. So what was happening that weekend? I’ve done a lot of research on these dates, but as of yet, I do not have any answers....</p>
<p>Since her very first acquisitions which I’ve already referred to, Junkermann has invested in or purchased: Shanghai Really Sports, Ziggurat, Thousand-Child, Aloha, Jobbio, Emoticast, Elvie, Auctionata, Coindrum, Spoon Guru, Optiopay, Grabyo, Magnum Global Ventures, Songza, tausendkind, Revolut, Sentient Technologies, Here be Dragons, Soundtrack Your Brand, Groq, Catapult, Delivery Club, Relate IQ, DollarShaveClub, Bruhouse Brewery, Cage Warriors, Eagle Alpha, Gokixx, Rebuy.de, Travelbird, Healthtech Digital, OWKIN, Reporty Homeland Security, and Carbyne911. The latter four of these companies are of significant interest.</p>
<h1 id="md-the-israeli-intelligence-connection"><strong>The Israeli Intelligence Connection</strong></h1>
<p>... The ominously named “Reporty Homeland Security” was the first incarnation of what is now called “Carbyne911” and is referred to as simply “Carbyne.” Described as a “global leader in public safety technology,” Carbyne is a call handling platform app that allows you to, amongst other things, stream any ongoing emergency directly to the responding emergency services. ....They can pinpoint your location, even indoors, to within three feet, and they claim that they can even collect data from dropped calls.</p>
<p>One of the directors of Carbyne is Nicole Junkermann. The chairman of the board of directors is Ehud Barak....Another of Carbyne’s directors and board members is Brigadier Pinchas Buchris, the former Deputy Commander of an elite IDF operations unit and former Commander of the IDF 8200 Cyber Intelligence Unit. Amir Elichai is the Founder and CEO of Carbyne, he is also a former Israeli Army officer who served in various positions in the special elite forces and the intelligence corps. Alex Dizengof is Carbyne’s Co-Founder &amp; CTO. He’s described as a Software Architect and Algorithms Developer. Dizengof had previously developed machine learning algorithms for robots and mobile platforms, as well as cyber security software for the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office.</p>
<p>....Matt Hancock, Member of Parliament for West Suffolk and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in the UK, appointed Nicole Junkermann to the Healthtech Advisory Board. For the vast majority of people living in the United Kingdom, the NHS is an institution which we cherish and adore. Many of us will protect the National Health Service with our lives because that’s what it has done for us in our darkest days.</p>
<p>..The two members which are of note relating to this story are Nicole Junkermann and Parker Moss, the latter happening to be the Chief Business Officer at OWKIN, which is one of the many companies in Junkermann’s vast portfolio. OWKIN is an AI startup that uses machine learning to augment medical and biology research. On its own, the company would probably be a perfect fit for the future of the NHS, but because of its connection to Nicole Junkermann and Israeli intelligence, OWKIN should be seen as too much of a risk to the data protection for NHS users.</p>
<p>...I believe that the future unsealing of previously hidden evidence will confirm that Jeffrey Epstein had been working for multiple intelligence agencies. But he is most likely to have been recruited by the Israeli state. Junkermann has managed to avoid her connections with Epstein being out in the open, until now. But she is skilled at controlling her public profile. Nicole Junkermann has become more powerful over the past eight years, and I have seen negative information relating to her previous scandals being removed from the search results. Go check yourself. Type in Nicole Junkermann on Google search and go through all the articles which appear. They are overwhelmingly positive, or simply relate to one of her businesses, and this is very different to what you would have found only a few years ago. When I first started investigating Nicole Junkermann, there were many negative articles which have all but vanished. I’m not even sure that this story will survive.</p>
<p>So, I ask you all to share this and publish it on your blogs and websites, and to bring the name Nicole Junkermann into the public eye.</p>
<p>Also, if I disappear anytime soon, remember. It was probably the Mossad.</p>

            Someone suggested Junkermann is indeed, a man. You can see the Adams apple, I guess, and long fingers, but not obviously a man. Anyone find any children to debunk this?

            , I'm going to give this the "Unverified" flair for now. The source you've linked is not the originator of the story. At the very bottom in tiny print it states it was

             Okay, let's look into that platform a bit more..  I'm doing this because firstly, the 'unverified' flair gives the impression that the information in the article is incorrect or fabricated.. which it isn't, and secondly, I'm wondering why this information is being put out now.

              Yes, that's exactly me my point. We need to vet everything as well as we can, because I think they are throwing out a lot of chaff to keep toxic Epstein-juju from tainting them.

             <p>
              Do we have sources to corroborate the information other than your original link that aren't obviously MSM/globalist controlled? I will gladly removed the flair if we do.

             Note the name William Bohlke (a former pilot). On FB he's connected to Adam M Sahiro, a pilot, who runs in the same circles as Dan Nicolosi who works for Epsrein.  So I assume the others do as well.

             In 2014 the party was attended by well-known personalities from around the world, including Bradley Cooper, Lilly Allen, Naomi Campbell, Noel Gallagher, Mark Ruffalo and Cara Delevingne. Influential and successful businesspeople from around the globe also attended and included Brioni's creative director Brendan Mullane, entrepreneur Nicole Junkermann, and the French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault.
            </p>
            <p>
             The big surprise this year was musician and designer Pharrell Williams half hour set, which entertained those attending, while bringing focus to the festivities through his eloquent monologue about the importance of art and the Serpentine Galleries.

             I met a Professor from Cambridge, who stated that this "dodge dossier" was an edit of a thesis submitted by one of his students, I think for a PhD. He ran plagiarism checks on the dossier and it confirmed it was a close copy and paste job. And of course, used as the case for war, as the claim that Iraq could bomb the UK in 40 minutes.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Cleveland Clinic, considered one of the top medical facilities in the US, and Maccabi, one of Israel’s largest healthcare providers, set up an accelerator last year, eHealth Ventures, to promote Israeli digital health companies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through eHealth Ventures, Cleveland Clinic and Maccabi will jointly invest in Israeli start-ups in the digital health and health IT space.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tom Sudow, Director at Cleveland Clinic Innovations, explained, “Israel has got a number of excellent opportunities and we believe that that is where healthcare is going,” he said. “We are the only incubator awarded in Israel as totally dedicated to digital health.”

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Areas of interest will be electronic medical records, analysis of medical data, sensors and sensor technologies — to enable patient tracking — and gaming technologies to help with diagnosis or treatment of various diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We believe that over the next eight years we will make between 35 and 40 investments – focused only on Israeli companies, unless a company wants to move to Israel to join the incubator,” Sudow said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cleveland Clinic will give startups accepted into the incubator, based in Modiin Illit, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, the opportunity to understand and work with the US market and access to potential partners in China and Europe, with which the clinic has ties.
            </p>
            <p>
             .The clinic also scouts for technologies in Finland, Ireland and other European cities, as well as in China. None of these countries has “the volume we find in Israel,” Sudow said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cleveland Clinic also has a partnership with
             <strong>
              Hebrew University
             </strong>
             to develop nanotechnologies to treat cancer. The research project is in the process of raising funds, he said.

             Typical ridiculous disinfo for the stupid MAGA goyim like the Podestas personally kidnapping McCann. Our task isn't to prove the logistics of transporting a child.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is our task: even when Jewish sources admit that sex trafficking was a historically JEWISH business, they use the Muh Cabal excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Never forget that every time Jews were expelled en masse for a ritual child murder it was because the wider Jewish community covered for the perpetrators. The burden is not on the hosts to distinguish the guilty among them, it is theirs to self-police.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Jewish sex traffickers were prominent in major transit points from Europe to Latin America such as Berlin, London and Hamburg. In the latter, for example, of four hundred and two sex traffickers caught by police in 1912, two hundred and seventy-one were Jewish (Bristow 52–53).
              <strong>
               Although the facts speak for themselves, there was also a tendency to exaggerate the percentage of Jewish sex traffickers and Jewish prostitutes because it was easier to condemn an entire group, especially if they were Jews
