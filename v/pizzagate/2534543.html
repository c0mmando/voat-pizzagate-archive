            No, I implied nothing. Giving people 24 hours to edit their post with the help of the community isn't "leniency". It doesn't make it less subject to Rules 1 and 2 in the slightest. If anything, it makes it more subject, because it exposes the thread to criticism and downvotes.

            The thread in which you made the comment I linked above limiting the flair after telling mods it should have been immediately removed was an unsourced discussion post similar to this one, which you said the flair shouldn't apply to. Have I misunderstood what you wanted?

             At the basest level, posts MUST be research-related here.  The disconnect is these meta posts
             <em>
              speaking to the users of the subverse
             </em>
             without any effort to present any research at all.

             And this post, "Hey guise, this is a how-to on trannies."
            </p>
            <p>
             There's not even the chance of redemption of the post to meet guidelines, because the very basis of the post is nothing more than someone telling you what they had for breakfast, content-wise.  It's an opinion piece; an editorial.  Nothing of the proper substance here.
            </p>
            <p>
             While it's true that it opens the door for trolls and shills to take their thoughts to the front page with a post doomed to be removed in 24h, they have 24h+time till mod discovery to keep it here.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kevdude">
              @kevdude
             </a>
             , I think, given the recent rule discussion, that even these posts need 24h, since that's what the community wanted, and giving mods the power to subjectively decide on immediate removal on their own is bound to cause problems with moderation.  All it takes is for some shill group to catch onto this, and we have posts toeing that line until a mod slips up.
            </p>
            <p>
             IF the community has a problem with these posts filling up the place, or if the mods have issues and ask the community for help changing the rules to specifically allow for this, then that sounds about right.  It's my understanding that the most recent rule discussion did not include these kinds of posts, or the caveat that they'd be removed immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also don't think

             was trying to be facetious here, but instead used your words as his guideline on removal, since the rules, as written, don't mention immediate removal.  It's exactly what I would do in his position.  Including linking directly to your comment mentioning it.

            This is very important in the pizzagate investigation. Babies are born and their parents are told it didn’t survive. Meanwhile the nurses hand it off to a courier who brings it to a cult family that raise the child trans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in the ray chadler instagram casting photos, the kids looked trans. Probably trafficked via foster parents and turned trans.

            This is the agenda.

            There are a lot of reasons they promote transgenderism.  However, I wouldn't say that pedophilia is a ruse to hide TG.  I'd rather say TG is one of the methods to divide us, which helps to hide pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many reasons they may promote it.  Satanists promote all forms of deviancy.  The more deviancy exists, then the less bizarre any particular deviant appears including a child-lover.  Also, gender roles are the basis of happy and long-lasting marriages which preserve culture across generations - the culture they seek to destroy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ethical men have a brave and self-sacrificial instinct, to accept danger and personal loss in order to protect families and weaker elements of society.  People without a sense of gender role will be easier to cow into submission, or to corrupt with personal gain, making it safer for the cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are right about TG's being hateful.  I'm not sure if the root cause is the hormones though.  A TG person is in conflict with his own nature.  He hates himself.  He can be trained to redirect this self-hate at society, because he is led to believe his own self-hate is the fault of a society which doesn't accept him.  Those who lie to him and call him normal become his saviors.  His sense of self is dependent on having people in power who assist his denial of reality - he must ignore any facts or other issues that incriminate these enablers.

            It's all about Lucifer worship.  Lucifer is considered androgynous, having male and female aspects.  Look at the Baphomet, the official symbol of the church of Satan, a male goat with female breasts.  Sun worship and Moon worship are about worshiping the male/active and female/passive aspects of Lucifer the light bearer.  Hence androgyny represents worship of the fullness of Lucifer. Some of the ancient Pagan sex cults required sex with a tranny as part of the initiation rites for that reason.  So introducing children to transgenderism is an essential part of induction into the cult of Lucifer.  Just like Freemasonry, all occult is introduced degree by degree.  Elementary school has now been transformed into the Blue Lodge of initiation.  Protect your children.

             This ^ is a very logical explanation.  Androgyny prohibits love from occurring.  The opposite of evil.

                Yes.  I honestly think it's a matter of people not wanting to notice or remember.  If you don't know something horrible is in the works, it's not your responsibility to get up and do something about it.  Ignorance is bliss (temporarily).

"They want us to despair that paedophilia is rampant in mainstream society when it's not...i.e. to turn the general public against each other, while we are distracted from the industrial scale child abuse that they operate for the actual control system."

           <p>
            A) this is false, it is increasingly rampant, ask any social worker about waiting lists for pedo-specific services, and B) the complexities and unintended consequences of a conspiratorial ruse would take so much energy to create and contain, so much prospect that it doesnt work or work as intended, that there are much easier ways of maintaining control

            Transgenderism is a big problem, but so is pedophilia.  It's not one or the other.  Your downplaying of Joe Biden as just a weirdo and concluding that pedophilia is not rampant in mainstream society could be seen as a "reversal."  Eyes on you.

              Blacksmith I cry every fucking day plowing back through all this shit that is literally out in the fucking public every second of their god damn lives...AND NO ONE WANTS TO SAY ANYTHING IN PUBLIC....
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm hated/despised by limp dicks in my hometown because I only drink whiskey when I go to the bar, and I call out the CIA, MOSSAD, my hometown drug dealers/politicians, academia sodomites, and every other son of a bitch who wants to listen or doesn't want to listen...I'm beyond giving a fuck about ignorant, unintelligent Goyim opinion anymore...
             </p>
             <p>
              and yeah I got a unique bloodline...my mom's a Kike Slav (who doesn't even KNOW she's a Jewess...so fucking ignorant my mom's side of the family...) and my dad's a Texas-born, blue-eyed German with a touch of Native who scares everyone around him...people think R Lee Emery is a loud prick, I think he's soft...

             <p>
              Bill Hicks is the ONLY person who has EVER made sense to me...Carlin's a NY Irish mouth who ran with Brooklyn kikes...mildly amusing, but shit's weak...
             </p>
             <p>
              Bill Hicks was calling out the CIA and the Bushes in 1988 in fucking HOUSTON TEXAS for fucks sake...that's a fucking warrior of the light....his humor never caught on in America because everyone thought he was joking....HE WASN'T....1980 is when the CIA acquired ABSOLUTE CONTROL of the United States government...Reagan was a Hollywood product who brought in George Bush, James Baker, William Casey, Oliver North...fucking Christ people...

               OK - good enough of a mea culpa.  There has been an awful lot of kikeshilling lately and it's hard to tell the shills from unique.

              <p>
               Take a deep breath and realize what is about to come...there are about to be a whole lot of pedos outed.  It's starting just as I predicted a while ago.  Rolling up the operation from the bottom up.  Weaken the hydra before you chop it's head off.

               Life is short and appreciate the good things.  There is no one race or religion responsible for this.  Satan is responsible for this and bad people who let evil reside within them.

                 Easy on the Manischewitz.  LOL.  Hate to tell ya - all religions are complicit.  It sounds like you were raised in an anti-smeitic mindset and then found out later in life you were Jewish.  Cognitive dissonance at its finest.

                   You may want to consider the fact that you don't see Jews in trailer parks is because they are educated.  Just like Asian-Indians and Asians, their culture embraces education.  Educated populations commit less crimes and have a higher standard of living.  Blacks, Latinos don't embrace a culture of education.  Whites have been getting more and more corrupted by design - bring the white man down to the level of the others.

            Some of these guys think every woman in showbiz is a transgender it's ridiculous they show photos of every famous actress and claim she was really born a boy without any evidence to prove this. I do think Michelle Obama was born a boy the video of her dancing on the Ellen TV show clearly shows her penis and balls in her pants it's on YouTube it's obvious and other photos where you can see her male genitals bulge. The Obama Girls are adopted their real parents were the Nesbitts best friends of the Obamas in Chicago and Sasha &amp; Malia look exactly like the Nesbitts so that theory is provably true. But all the other claims about famous women in Hollywood really being men is absurd there is no evidence to prove it yet.

             Matt not only are females in Hollywood mostly trannies but so are then males, including the directors and execs. This goes for music, fashion, politics, radio, business, royalty, and the elite. And if they aren’t they make their kids go trans. I’m 100% positive this is real. And I have multiple first hand accounts of this. The evidence is in the biological structure of the person. CarisJames in the Comet photos is a boy dressed as a girl. Notice how Alefantis remarks that it is “HIS” money. And how Podesta looks odd in a suit and voice cracks a lot.

             it is demonstrable that JEWS openly promote transgenderism even within their own clergy and JEWS control the media empires that made cross-dressers hilarious/disgustingly deviant into an accepted nay PRIVILEGED lifestyle thru sheer inundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             you will clearly go to your grave not accepting that Jews thrive only by creating chaos and manipulation; this is why naïve women have no business in truth-seeking endeavors.

              Congrats, you've been requested to participate in a brief survey.
             </p>
             <p>
              2nd Request:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/auralsects">
               @auralsects
              </a>
              :
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Do you agree all pedophiles should be arrested?
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Do you believe all pedophiles, if found guilty, should be put to death or incarcerated for life in ADMAX/GTMO?
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Publicly renounce pedophiles.
             </p>
             <p>
              This should be easy for you.  You think you're smart.  Have at it.

            You have come to the right place.  I don't know if your view is correct, but always research is the best way to many times find the answer.  There def are many in Pedowood that are not what or whom they seem.  We already know about Catlyn Jenner but many are hiding.  Also many A+ Listers are parading their children around and proud as they can be to let them find their gender.    WHAT?  Look on your Birth Certificate.  This does call for looking into.  There is Chaz Bono as a start.  A very very sad story indeed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we know the RCC and Freemasonry are Evil, great place to start.
