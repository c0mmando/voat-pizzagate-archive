<p>This is such a heartbreaking case, and it\'s not difficult to see how this is related to PG. I\'m sorry that Victoria isn\'t going to get justice next month, and I\'m very curious as to what the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; are. I\'ll do my best to stay on top of this and keep it updated.</p>

            I just have to keep thinking good thoughts, but it is so hard after being on here everyday almost all day.  It is something we should all work on I guess.  Some days are better than others, but the best day will be when people Wake Up.  Yes you are right we are richer in love and empathy.  They have no love for each other, only fear.  Fear that they will be found out and fear that someone will become more powerful than they.  What a life.

            Upvoat for you and I Thank you for keeping us updated, although the news is sad for Victoria right now.  I hope this is not a runaround decision and that she will get her days in court and these disgusting vermin criminals  get theirs.  I could barely keep it together reading the details.  What makes people allow things like this to be done to their children.  I have no answer to this stuff anymore. Sick Sick and Sad is what that mother is. Life Imprisonment with no parole.  I would suggest another sentence, but that won't happen.
