            I've been looking at this also. The Domino's and pizza references. The date the murders occurred (began on 13th May), there was by all accounts a lot of blood concerning the death of the boy as well as fire. Not very far from Comet Ping Pong.
           </p>
           <p>
            The art circles. I suspect Alefantis would be mixed in there too.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess what is bugging me is why only demand $40,000. from a multimillionaire? If Savvas Savopoulos' personal assistant Jordan Wallace was in on it, he probably knew Savopoulos had much more money than that. Unless, the whole thing occurred for something besides money. Why kill them all if the money was delivered? I could see the motivation of eliminating witnesses, but why such violent, grisly deaths and why did they feel they had so much time to go that route after the night was already spent there?
           </p>
           <p>
            I've thought about an angle involving the boy being abused either in martial arts, karting or the pizza joint and the parents finding out and ready to snitch?

            , just a very puzzling case that fits the neighborhood and crowd.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was either a complete ransom fumble/panic, or it doesn't add up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was just happy to see someone else wondering about those murders and possible connection to anything, and this was the only thread came up in search. Thanks.
