             Something the guy in the video brought up from the 8min mark onwards. I'd be more interested in the cases with no accompanying photographs of the missing children but if they're making these claims then it would be prudent to make them back them up.

              Are these children who are still allegedly missing with the case unresolved?

               Still missing. It's worth keeping in mind too how these people put themselves into positions where they're always dealing with children. Jimmy Saville - given a tv show that made kids dreams comes through, that put him in direct contact with a good many of his victims. There's the owner of Besta Pizza sat in the DOJ at the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit. If the numbers are real then it's very strange that such high numbers of kids are missing in a state where one of the 3 offices of the NCMEC is located. The agency set up to 'protect' kids could very well be delivering them into the hands of these pedos .... tracking them down and getting to them before anyone else does so to speak. Speculation ... I know but given what I'm beginning to believe
               <em>
                very much
               </em>
               it wouldn't surprise me now in the least.
