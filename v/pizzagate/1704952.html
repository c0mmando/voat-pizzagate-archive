<p>An investigation into a shadowy world of shell companies and chains of influence stretching all over the globe has revealed that Democratic propaganda figure David Brock’s organization Shareblue appears to be a apparent front group being used by a number of Chinese, Middle Eastern, British, Israeli, Mexican and American special interests to spread anti-Trump and anti-democratic rhetoric both during the presidential election as well as in its aftermath.</p>

            Gentle Plea to the Community (not specific to this OP)
           </p>
           <p>
            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhateverhttps">
             v/pizzagatewhateverhttps
            </a>
            ://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code>1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.
