            Betsy Devos is the sister to Eric Prince. He started Blackwater in NC supposedly with Amway money. Don't think Amway could have financed an operation this big........it is a mercenary army that, I think, is designed to replace our military. Lots of connections here to shadow govt.....https://businessnc.com/war-is-halecategory/

             Another location close to Eric Prince's Blackwater was used very quietly to train terrorists from all over the world. NC again.....Charlotte NC is HQ for US banking.........also has dubious distinction of having more KKK members for a while than any other state. This link shows Amway fortune  could not possibly have financed Blackwater.https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_cia07.htm?fbclid=IwAR2IHG_-lIbh0K7pPR5vufUZWXc07lXV5nArR7OPYCglpRJ3v1loZbuEuJo

              3
             </em>
             of which are filmmakers. Travel buddy Nicholas is most famous for “Arbitrage”, starring the Chandler-linked Richard Gere and recently “Black-Eyed Susan” Sarandon.
            </p>
            <p>
             Daddy Jaracki co-founded the “Scholar Rescue Fund” in 2002, part of the “Institute of International Education”; its mission is relocating scholars in war-torn areas....Its governance board has some interesting people - Biden buddies and Chicago ties
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Back to Papa Jarecki. Not only did he found the first Youth Center in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) he owns two additional ISLANDS; both are pretty secluded...In addition to Hollywood guests, they also had alleged violent perv Mario Batali (article prior to allegations)
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you notice that Manhattan Residence he bought in 2000? It’s less than 3 miles from Epste!n’s townhouse.
            </p>
            <p>
             He and his wife also have The Gloria and Henry Jarecki Special Skills School in Cambodia...Again, no dedicated website, nothing asking for donations or talking about what they do... This is one humble motherfucker.

            Harbour Island aka Billionaire Island is the one to watch where elite families have their palatial estates, very private. Also, “Prince” Pavlos of Greece and his wife Marie Chantal of Greece are regulars there as her parents the Duty Free baron Robert Miller and wife “the last Incan Princess” Chantal Miller own it. Pavlos and MC were photographed on another island with Randy Andy close by. Arki Busson and friends on Harbour Island, India Hicks, the list goes on its a Luciferian nightmare.

             <p>
              This photograph of Robert Maxwell's daughter Ghislaine, pimp to Jeffrey Epstein, has been circulating on Twitter for some time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let me try to put it into perspective ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Just a little more than a month after that Save the Children photo was taken, Ghislaine, whose father owned Oxford United, was pictured with Chelsea FC chairman Ken Bates on Oct.19, 1985...
             </p>
             <p>
              **Bates made an early fortune in ready-mix concrete, a product that keeps reappearing in many of my threads. Bates associated with many idolised by the right-wing Monday Club.
             </p>
             <p>
              He attempted to purchase Tortola, an island less than 30 km from Epstein's Little St. James but failed.**

              Ken Bates was a close friend of David Mellor - ex-MP, chairman of the Government's Football Task Force and junior HO minister who 'forgot' he sat in on a meeting with Brittan and Geoffrey Dickens about
              <strong>

             <p>
              Ken Bates was the owner of300-acre Grange Farm, a business which for a while sponsored Bate's other business, Chelsea FC. It even featured on the sort of kit alleged to have been worn by Bate's mate David Mellor during his memorable steamy four-goal night.

             <p>
              By 1989, Bates' mate Colin Meredith Peters had been convicted under Operation Hedgerow for his part as ringleader in a horrific child abuse ring after a telecoms engineer discovered obscene abuse images.

             This was not Peters' first conviction, though. He first came to light in 1967 when it was reported that he had been arrested on charges of abusing two 10 year old boys on a boat in the bay of Naples whilst ferrying scugnizzi to society paedophiles on Ischia.
            </p>
            <p>
             After working for Customs &amp; Excise, Peters joined Hugh Mainprice in 1986 as a partner in the VAT firm Mainprice &amp; Co.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hugh's daughter Clare Mainprice, together with Stephen Fry, was a founder member of the Groucho Club involved in child sexual abuse.

             In June 1986, The People published claims that Harvey  Proctor MP had taken part in sex acts with young males in his London flat. In October, a sinister call was made to the paper to prevent further coverage, threatening to release incriminating pictures of Ghislaine Maxwell.

             Two of Matthew Harding's wife's best friends are the ex-wives of David Mellor and Glenn Hoddle. Her new husband Richard Gist works with sexually abused children. When they met he was an area manager for the NSPCC in Coventry.

              Ken Bates was a ruthless colonialist and showed contempt for the natives of BVI Tortola in his attempt to win a 199-year lease of the island,
             </strong>
             which would have left him stinking rich and given the islanders nothing. Luckily Bates met his better in Noel Lloyd, a local activist.

                 <strong>
                  Nickelodeon
                 </strong>

                 Evergirl is a broad based, aspirational lifestyle property that has been in development at Nickelodeon for the past three years. Nickelodeon will unveil this property in 2004 and aggressively promote the unique, positive “Evergirl” message to girls with TV advertising, promotional and merchandising campaigns. Playmates will introduce an innovative, customizable doll and accessory product line to coincide with and capitalize upon Nickelodeon’s promotional programs.

                 Seemed like Playmates also make content - youtube spin offs that look like the Elsagate stuff.

                   Okay I still felt like there was something with PLAYMATES TOYS and ALEX/ANDER CHOW YU CHUN.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So I checked out their website again and noticed they have a prominent BADGE : Kids Safe Seal .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Kids Safe Seal focusses on being the cyber security arm of childrens chat rooms, online games, learning portals, social media etc aimed at ages 0-5 5-10 10-16. Knowing how many predators use online kids games to access victims, and that Playmates Toys which was certified belonged to a suspected predator, this raised a red flag.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you look at the companies there are only a few that you will recognize, and an above average that use
                   <strong>
                    Panda
                   </strong>
                   and Egg in their name(both highly symbolic).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts.html">
                    https://www.kidsafeseal.com/certifiedproducts.html
                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Could be nothing, but this list seems to be a better lead than the toys, as these companies are already in our children's homes (computer/device).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Can someone dig ?

              Everything in this sentence looks like it connects to Project Blue Beam. The hub for experimental aircraft is in Oshkosh Wisconsin, formerly in Milwaukee, at the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_Aircraft_Association">
               Experimental Aircraft Association
              </a>
              . I don't know why exactly the majority of Majestic 12 is from Wisconsin but it must have to do with the effigy mounds and other ancient formations in the area, which could have been built to signal or communicate with the flying objects that ancient people in this area saw. Now it makes sense why the Podestas got their "big break" in Racine, because

               I know that some people openly use the name Rothschild along the North Shore and you guys will get a kick out of how I found out. It’s bc I was leaving Jewel (grocery) one day and was approached by some women outside who were there to draw attention to a cause... it’s been awhile but I think it was an AIDS charity. Anyways, I made some kinda comment about how the cure actually exists blah blah blah and you should’ve seen the look on the woman’s face bc I walk away with the brochure she’s given me only to see that her last name was Rothschild lol since we all know that they’re behind everything.

                  It was established, funded and administered by John Templeton starting in 1972. It is now co-funded by the Templeton philanthropies, and administered by the John Templeton Foundation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The prize was originally awarded to people working in the field of religion
                  <strong>
                   (Mother Teresa was the first winner)
                  </strong>

                 <p>
                  The monetary value of the prize is adjusted so that it exceeds that of the Nobel Prizes; Templeton felt, according to The Economist, that "spirituality was ignored" in the Nobel Prizes.[6] As of 2019, it is £1.1 million.[7]
                  <strong>
                   It has typically been presented by Prince Philip in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

                  Barton Mansion is also known to have been a popular rendezvous up spot for Satan worshipers. There are also claims that this home was built on top of ancient Native American burial grounds. Additionally, the home once served as an insane asylum and a prison. Today Barton Mansion serves as a law office.

                  Barton Mansion was built in 1859 on the site of an old Indian burial ground by Dr. Ben Barton. The bricks used to build the mansion were made from clay dug up from the burial grounds. He was warned not to do this by people in the area familiar with Indian customs, but he would not listen to them. Shortly after Dr. Barton and his wife moved into the mansion, their two young daughters died under mysterious circumstances. Locals claimed the deaths were caused by Dr. Barton’s desecration of the Indian cemetery.

                  Whether we want to believe in the spiritual potential/potency of places like Native American burial grounds, enchanted forests, Devils Gates, Bohemian Groves or - not, THEY DO. It is safe to say even the rumor or aura around around a haunted place is enough to draw a few Satanists to it. We can also paint them crazy, but these cults care and therefore know and keep track of their local paranormal/ritual sites better than we do. They know them in the dark. They know what irrigation tunnels pop out where. What security is like.

                 <p>
                  On a more practical and evil level, most of these "sites" are State or Federal Parks or Sanctuaries. Think Missing 411. I have heard that it is impossible to be convicted of a murder in a 'park' as it is in separate jurisdiction as the local town, and is near impossible to build a jury of peers (12 people who needed to be in the park at the same time as the crime). If you bring your cult, those odds of being convicted by those peers theoretically reach zero. If someone with more concrete evidence or legal knowledge can dismiss or back up this theory, it would be very beneficial.
