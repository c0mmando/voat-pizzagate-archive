<p>This is the promised post about Robert De Niro. He’s up to his eyeballs in pizzagate. His speaking out makes him part of this Hollywood conspiracy. It also reignited a memory. A few years back, I’d read The Gods of Death by Yaron Svoray. He’s a detective that went on this huge mission to find out whether snuff films were real. After what we’ve learned from pizzagate, most of probably think they are. Why else ritually kill something? For me, it went back to Manson and that entire crew … basically inventing the terminology and making their own. Plenty of rumors about Polanski being in on unsavory films that included pedophilia. 
Svoray tracked leads round the world, and one of the leads led to Paris, where people gathered to watch one. But it was an encounter with Robert De Niro that is described in the attached link: <a href="http://archive.is/FVMW3">http://archive.is/FVMW3</a> </p>
<p>If this is true, and De Niro was involved even on the level of watching these films, it could be used as major blackmail to get him to cover up other people’s sexual crimes. And the films are another source of huge money for the elite that pay for these things to be videotaped. As proof, in the book Svoray states that the rapes and murders in Kosovo and Bosnia were all recorded and distributed to interested parties. Yes, it’s an allegation, but the guy did do his homework, and as far as I know, De Niro never sued for defamation of character or denied the encounter took place.  Why? Well, it could be he’s part of the conspiracy. Here’s the link to an incident that happened in 1998. Please note that this incident also happened in France: </p>

<p>Summarization: An international call girl ring servicing such high profile clients as Robert DeNiro, two unnamed French politicians, and an Arab prince is being investigated. The service operated under the blessing and watchful eye of both the French foreign ministry and secret services. By steering Middle Eastern arms dealers to this agency, it was thought that it could control blackmail and the leaking of illegal activities. Robert DeNiro is one of the names that has cropped up on the list of clients using this service. There are also British actresses (this mentioned in the link below) and a HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS that slept with an Arab prince! 
The second link that names some names: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-princes-and-the-call-girls-1187542.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-princes-and-the-call-girls-1187542.html</a> </p>
<p>So there you go! This was in 1998 and the president then was who again? Someone made this all go away for DeNiro and what do you think the payback for clearing up any messy charges might be? Possibly to perform like a trained monkey and issue ridiculous comments on Trump and the new administration?  And now you know why Polanski is so angry. Wood Allen allegedly got away with molesting his daughter and molesting/marrying his wife’s child and other stars frequented call services and had their minors delivered. They’re out free, running around and having a great old time and he’s still being punished. It’s because America was harder to rein in. We had a justice system that worked and needed a political party and secret society with deep pockets to tear it asunder. </p>
<p>This is pizzagate. </p>
<p>P.S. What say we try to uncover the name of that Hollywood actress and make her famous all over again?</p>',

            Another CLINTOON-DeNIRO connection -
           </p>
           <p>
            DeNiro starred in WAG THE DOG.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wag the Dog was released one month before the outbreak of the Lewinsky scandal and the subsequent bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan by the Clinton administration, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality.

                Obviously not as devout a one as uber-pious quantokitty.  She has a special license from Jesus that allows her to do all the judging if he's not around.

                 Remember the "Judge Not, Lest ye be Judged"statement? I believe it was a week after Jesus went into the Temple and cast out the Money-changers calling them a den of thieves...  is said to be the trigger for his death.   ? is was it the action, or the words of judgement?

            I still don't know. Vaccines are very big business and the potential for abuse via vaccine is extreme. If someone pulls a film, it could be as a result death threats-not necessarily exposure of evil. Getting sloppy with accusations undermines a credible investigation. I do think Pedro gate is being made to look stupid with planted and sloppy assertions.

             Totally do not pay for their movies. If everyone just gets together on this issue, we can drive them out of business. Support indie filmmakers. They're bringing you original visions and new fresh ideas. These disgusting decrepit perverse pieces of human excrement need to be starved out of the business.

            And so many horrible movies were coming out like Hostel &amp; Saw. I use to think who would make something like this?  I wonder if they were based or real stories for the sickos to privately cheer about?

             Undoubtedly, Hostel is real. There's no question about it. Saw I don't know. It might be a game one of the sickos played at one time. A lot of the kids caught up in these pedo rings talk about seeing dismemberment. So horrible.

             I believe Hostel was made by the production company Frank Guistra started after Clinton pardoned him. You can hear more about him in the video "Clinton Cash" or I believe George Webb videos.

            Did you ever hear of the play The Vagina Monologues?  I wen to see it in the early 2000s, it was partially about the massive rapes in Bosnia -Kosavo. How women's bodies were abused, well later the govt comes out and says, no we went there and investigated, no one was raped.  I found this so strange, because the the play was claiming 20K women were raped or abused and she did mini skit of some of their stories about how it affected them.  Fast forward now, it seems so similar to the pizzagate investigation.  Like, nope it didn't happen, nothing to see here.
The play still goes on but I wonder if it is very different, like they were silenced.  It was nothing like was I was expecting it to be, like they were trying to covertly get the word out about the atrocities that happened.

             Yes, I did hear of the play, but never saw it. Thanks for the synopsis. Yes, it is strange, and, again, it's the media telling us the narrative and making the reality go away. It only seems logical that there were rapes taking place because the war was described as an "ethnic cleansing". Part of that type of cleansing is to impregnate the women and force them to have the conquering armies children. That way you erase the traces of their heritage and introduce this new one. It's very sick and so there must have been thousands of rapes. Thanks for bringing this whole subject up as it does illuminate this conversation.

             Yes, I saw that! I did a quick search so it's undoubtedly buried. Maybe find the names of a popular French paper and then dig.

            I don't know about this. DeNiro recently came out against vaccines. He stood up in the line of very powerful folks. Smear?

             Smear? This is the opposite of a smear because he did no time. Look, the vaccine controversy was in connection with Robert Kennedy's Foundation so it was more a lib thing to keep the memory alive and raise money that he probably pocketed. It's a jaded view of the world, but these people are disgusting.

            Describing DeNiro as a "trained monkey" is spot on.  This applies to the majority of Hollywood actors and music industry superstars.  Sign that contract in blood, tow the line, or face the consequences.

            I remember DiNiro freaking out for being in a call girl book and being investigated. threatened to give back his Legion de Honor or whatever that award is called. This is nothing new, Sultan of Brunai , Heidi Fleiss, Khashoggi and many many others.The snuff film I think really brings it into ate 1990's and by then not just sick high level royals and politicians were into this but celebrities and CEO's were looking for the next rush, in this case snuff. The Pickton farm was rumored to be making these.

             Yes, he got all uppity when here he is paying for minors. Supposedly, allegedly, there were rumored to be S&amp;M and snuff films at Sharon Tate's bungalow. Polanski was alleged to be into that shit and had several well-known stars participating.

             Yes.  I have been done with them for at lease 20 years.  I have had it with them, starting at first with their high salaries and their drama, and their disgusting lifestyles.  I do not need to know what they are eating, who they are sleeping with and what their kids are wearing.  I no longer spend money on their labeled clothing, or movies.  More money for me.  I would rather pay teachers more than these idiots that will be influencing our children of their kooky and disgusting habits.

               Please do not bunch all of us into one group, the left.  All the Progressives that I know and there are many (of which I am one) are definitely in the group that believe many are making salaries way out of proportion in comparison to those that raise our children.  Yes we all think that sports people and actors make way too much money.  We have people that would make wonderful teachers of the arts as in painting and musicality for students but they cannot live on those salaries.  We now have CEOs and Politicians that are screaming we cannot afford band and sports for kids in school but we have enough money to build sports stadiums for the ball clubs.  I will now get off my soap box.

                "in comparison to those that raise our children."
               </p>
               <p>
                Teachers do not "raise" our children unless your kids are in a boarding school.

                "We now have CEOs and Politicians that are screaming we cannot afford band and sports for kids in school but we have enough money to build sports stadiums for the ball clubs."
               </p>
               <p>
                Most sports stadiums are privately owned and built, by corporations, i.e. not tax dollars.
