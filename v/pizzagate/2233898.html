            Feldman was on HLN today. He said he was not abused by the well known name, but could name one. He said he was abused by someone not known by name. I thought it odd that he said he was a sexual deviant because of what happened to him, but he would never abuse a child. It was an interview with Costello.

            Here's an insider's answer of why Hollywood's most abusive, serial, child pedos are given a pass. By the way Corey Feldman's and Corey Haim's #1 abuser was not Charlie Sheen. Sheen's performing career is pretty much over now, so Hollywood's allowing him to be fed to the wolves in the paps. There were multiple abusers of the 2 Corey's, and almost all are still very powerful money-makers.
           </p>
           <p>
            These power players and Hollywood money makers are dealing with underage victims, so you get into Jeff Epstein territory.  The legal community doesn't want to go there because of the big media and political players.

            Realize that Singer and Dan Schneider also procured kids for the big wigs, so that they would have the goods on more influential people then themselves to use for protection.

            Woody Allen is hiding in plain site like Roman Polanski, because the highest echelons of the entertainment industry have use for them and don't care. The mere fact Woody Allen is directing a script where the lead thinks he is sleeping with a 14 year old is the most incredible hubris I have ever seen given the current social climate. But as you see, his people have hit the press with the Dylan lied crap and people believed it. Ronan was on Colbert last week talking about how the abuse affected him and Dylan.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I guess  "artists" are treated differently by everyone. As Liz Taylor once said about MJ after all the abuse allegations started to come out, he has different needs than other people. As long as it wasn't any of her grandchildren."
