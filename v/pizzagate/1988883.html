            Don't want anyone to think I gave up trying to find some new info on Hampstead Case --
           </p>
           <p>
            This past March 8th (2017) Ella Gareeva's, Mother of the Hampstead children made a report in her video "Believe the Children" and appealed for help.
            <a href="https://dearmandoeshampstead.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/ella-gareevas-statement-march-8th-2017/">
             https://dearmandoeshampstead.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/ella-gareevas-statement-march-8th-2017/
            </a>
            This version includes TEXT.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as a reminder the two children involved are Alisa and Gabriel and, as the Mother reports, they were "have been unlawfully removed from me 11/9/2014."  The Mother has been in hiding.
           </p>
           <p>
            As noted at the website there are two other websites involved ...

            The Jean-Clement Recording was NOT secretly recorded...
Comment by "Hampstead Cover Up" (Ella &amp; Abraham)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "This recording was the very first disclosure to the police reporting the rapes and murders at Hampstead Christ Church primary school and church, 5.9.14. ANYONE listening to this recording immediately realizes the seriousness of the allegations, and that this is NOT a custody dispute, OR a matter for a “Family Court”: it is the report of rape, torture and murder of children....This recording and its FRAUDULENT concealment of its important and highly-incriminating identifying testimony/evidence, proves that DI John Cannon, DS Matthew Fernandez, DC Steve Martin, DC Alan Rogers, DC Carl Savage along with “Judge” Anna Pauffley and “Judge” Nigel Ryder, have ALL participated in FRAUD in order to cover-up the Hampstead Christ Church Child Rapes and Murders. THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION, ONLY A COVER-UP FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY.“

            I haven't as yet had a chance to actually look at and check the websites for any new information.
           </p>
           <p>
            But think it's good to be reminded of this case and to keep it in mind because of the amazing amount of information the children relate of their experiences and their father being "head" of the operation there.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The judgement of notorious High Court Judge Anna Pauffley was fraudulent and in breech of several articles of human rights. She unlawfully assumed the duties of a criminal judge and jury within a secret family court in a case concerning sadistic, satanic ritual abuse of children and the trafficking, torture and serial killing of countless innocent infants. A case which was never a matter for the family court.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pauffley, further abuse of power by criminally perverting the course of justice throughout the fact-finding or fact-hiding hearing. The crucial evidence, a two and a half hour recording made by the Special Constable, Jean-Clement Yahirou, was hidden away on the second day of the investigation. Pauffley acknowledged this fact of concealment yet failed to order a re-investigation. She dismissed and ridiculed the medical findings of a respected medical specialist in child sexual abuse with 26 years of experience that conclusively confirmed the childrens allegations.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            There is a medical report on the children who are suffering Post Traumatic Stress, at the least,
but it's also a full physical report.  I started to LINK to the report but it isn't permitted on this site and will
have to find another link to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing more that the Hampstead Cover-up perverts would like more than
for us all to forget this case, forget the children.

              You've been blown up and your Jew theory has been torn apart, yet you continue to push it. THAT'S why people call you shill. Your story has so many holes in it you may as well be talking about aliens, dragons or unicorns.

                        It's just a term, relax. Anyways, I figured that's what it was, it's pretty obvious you all are a team of shills.

                          Because I don't have time to research leads, retard. Reading is fundamemtal. I'm on a damn cell phone right now and I'm sure as fuck not going to try to do research on a phone. Fact checking and rolling up shills like you is easy enough though.

                            Keep beating that drum. LOL The little research I have done lately blows your whole propaganda fairytale apart. That's why you're so butt hurt. Did you ever think that just because I'm on a cellphone that doesn't mean I have hours at a time to do REAL research. We've all seen the shit research you do on your "phone".
