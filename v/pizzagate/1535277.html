<p>In the first couple of weeks a Pizzgate Investigator made his own video incorporating their own Pizzagate specific Rap intertwined with documents and images relating to our cause.</p>
<p><strong>See this Excellent Video from Electric Thoughts</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/s5y7ac5VV9U">https://youtu.be/s5y7ac5VV9U</a></p>
<p>What I am saying is we don\'t need to make specific Music content like some artists which push the Conspiracy theory angle.</p>
<p><strong>Examples Below</strong></p>
<p>Check this song by Jedi Mind Tricks Frontman Vinnie Paz incorporating samples from David Icke and raps and images about conspiracy theories.  Icke also has this video on his channel with foreign I believe Turkish Subs to reach more people.  There is an alternative video that features a cameo appearance by Icke too.</p>
<p><strong>David Icke and Vinne Paz</strong> - <a href="https://youtu.be/gz9bwHRXIZM">https://youtu.be/gz9bwHRXIZM</a></p>
<p>Probably the best Music Video that has utilized both imo is a video by Irish Rapper Terawrizt concerning the New World Order, Check it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-doIk9Th95o">https://youtu.be/-doIk9Th95o</a></p>
<p>Another Good Conspiracy song that has well over 2 Million Views on Youtube is <strong>Non Phixion Underground Hip Hop Group\'s &quot;Black Helicopters&quot;</strong> Which doesn\'t even have a real video just an album cover.  We could also use the phrase &quot;Insert Artist Name Here&quot; &quot;Featuring Pizzagate&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Q1Khr45wT4o">https://youtu.be/Q1Khr45wT4o</a></p>
<p><strong>Alternative music is also less likely to be removed</strong>, it will not be able to be monetised which is fine as long as they allow copyrighted Music to be used.  Worth checking the video first to see if that song is being uploaded to youtube by others and not removed.</p>
<p>Remember the old days of dial-up Internet and the Peer-2-Peer File sharing waiting hours to download a latest new track only to find out another unknown or up and coming artist had titled their track as a famous artist and it wasn\'t what you expected when listening to it?</p>
<p><strong>We can use popular or alternative songs</strong>, have the thumbnail uploaded as the artists album cover or picture then upload the REAL song as advertised but have the video with Pizzagate documents, court case documents and other images related to Pizzagate.
<strong>They will come for the song but stay for the message.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is also a good way to get round censorship as you do not have to include Pizzagate in the description unless you want to.</strong>  The same way they use Katy Perry, Madonna, Miley Cyrus and even the younger singers like Allison Gold to push their agenda we can do the same.
Pick a popular or controversial song and use the music but with Pizzagate related images and message.  
</p>
<p>Fool Proof if enough people do this.  Stretch the Reach of Pizzagate and beat them at their own dirty Game</p>
<p><strong>We can then post these to other social media accounts.</strong>  
</p>
<p><strong>Youtube are pushing a peverse agenda whilst blocking and deleting Pizzagate related Video</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> allow PTHC and other sick stuff, <strong>Twitter</strong> have also had a Pedo Scandal, time to fight back against the pervers corruption and let our voice be heard.</p>
<p><strong>Have Fun with this, use your favourite artists to promote what you believe and if it has good music as well as a message we win on both fronts.</strong></p>',
