<p>The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz foundation appears to have been the source of financial resources to both James Alefantis\' Transformer Gallery and NXIVM, a stunning revelation given that their granddaughter, the late Pamela Cafritz, was once second-in-command at NXIVM and the architect of the cult\'s insidious slavery program. </p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>The Cafritz family are Lithuanian-American Jews who amassed a large fortune in DC real estate and built several important DC residences. While the original philanthropists are not linked to satanic occultism as of writing this, the family foundation appears to be one of the main donors to the Transformer Gallery. <strong>I must also emphasize that not all NXIVM funding from the foundation seems consensual</strong>--rather, Pamela Cafritz seems to have used an inflated stipend from the family fund to bankroll Keith Raniere\'s operations in Albany, NY. </p>

<p><strong>More on NXIVM-Cafritz link</strong></p>
<p>The Frank Report <a href="https://frankreport.com/2017/06/11/part-9-branded-slaves-and-master-raniere-allison-mack-replaces-the-late-pam-cafritz-at-top-of-the-harem/">aptly summarizes the role that Pamela Cafritz played in not only managing the organization, but adding a lot of the slavery practices to the group</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actress Allison Mack – who was the third lead in the TV show Smallville – has assumed the top position in the harem of Keith Raniere. She has surpassed several long time harem members and assumed the role of the late Pamela Cafritz. In this respect,** Miss Mack operates similarly to the late Miss Cafritz, who performed a triad role of managing recruitment for the harem and Jness, the women’s organization she co-founded with Mr. Raniere and Mariana Fernandez, and supporting Mr. Raniere’s household.** After Miss Cafritz died, Miss Mack assumed leadership of Jness. Then she formed DOS and also enjoys Mr. Raniere’s presence at her household on numerous occasions. Prior to her passing, <strong>Miss Cafritz established the concept of slavery among the women who were united in slavery to Mr. Raniere.</strong>  Despite being the topmost harem member, Miss Cafritz acted as slave to some of women in the harem.</p>
<p>Miss Cafritz encouraged new women and girls to become his slaves, and pointed out to Mr. Raniere numerous young women’s desirable physical features to encourage his amorous propensities. She used her wealth and social charm to make new women feel welcome and always told the young ones that having sex with Mr. Raniere would be the luckiest occasion of their lives. <strong>Out of her <em>six figure annual stipend from her father’s trust</em>, Miss Cafritz paid for all of Mr. Raniere’s personal living expenses for many years. In their domicile, she regarded herself not only Mr. Raniere’s slave, but also a slave to her sister wife and live-in harem member, Mariana Fernandez who was 20 years her junior. Miss Fernandez is rumored to be pregnant with Mr. Raniere’s child.</strong></p>
<p>After Miss Cafritz died in November 2016, members of the harem felt she continued to live on with them. Harem members reportedly continued to utilize her bank accounts and credit cards after she died as if she were still living – in the service of Mr. Raniere. For some time Mr. Raniere and other members of the harem were instructed not to divulge Miss Cafritz had died. It was speculated they needed time to clear up financial affairs related to her estate before the banks and the trustees learned about her passing. Some harem members, it is believed, felt close enough to Miss Cafritz that they felt comfortable signing her name on banking and other documents after she died in order to avoid any confusion that might occur if the financial institutions knew about her death.</p>
<p>Discussions were held with some of the followers with Mr. Raniere about freezing Miss Cafritz body. <strong>Discussion were held about flying her frozen body to the FIJI Islands where she might be restored to life once Mr. Raniere or some other scientist discovered a cure for cancer. Miss Cafritz had such faith in Mr. Raniere that she believed that he controlled the weather in the Albany area.</strong> Prior to her death she spoke of having her body frozen until Mr. Raniere discovered a way to bring her back to life. Miss Mack reformed the model Miss Cafritz employed and enhanced it, creating an organized system where women obey her daily instructions. Her structure is based on a 6-6-6- model. She has six slaves who in turn are required to get six slaves and each of these six are required to get six more slaves.</p>

<p>The Albany Times-Union <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/NXIVM-co-founder-Keith-Raniere-charged-in-federal-12782354.php">reports that Raniere kept on using the trust money from the Cafritz fortune after she died</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2007/10/01/hillarys-30000-fans-are-her-cult-following/">The NY Post indicates that the Cafritz family played a similar role to the Bronfman sisters in terms of funding from a major philanthropic donor.</a></p>
<p>Three of the March and April Clinton pledges came from Raniere’s most high-profile followers: Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman, and Pamela Cafritz, daughter of D.C. A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz.</p>
<p>In a weird twist that cuts right through the DC art world, the daughter-in-law of Gwen and Morris Cafritz had a <a href="http://www.lsb3.com/2011/10/who-is-charlene-cafritz-and-what.html">run-in with who else but Charles Manson in the lead-up to the Manson murders</a>. While her involvement with the family was short, remember that Manson killed Abigail Folger, heiress to the Folger fortune and relative of Izette Folger, who appears to be one of James Alefantis\' best friends. She calls him \'Pan\'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charlene Marie Lawley (maiden name) married Carter Detre Cafritz on May 27, 1966. <strong>Carter’s parents were Morris &amp; Gwendolyn Cafritz</strong>, a prominent power couple, both politically and socially, in Washington, DC. In his book “The Family”, <strong>Ed Sanders mentions Manson meeting a young lady named Charlene Cafritz, in the summer of 1968 at Dennis Wilson’s beach home.  Charlene met Wilson through Cass Elliot, and became one of Wilson\'s girlfriends.</strong></p>
<p>In December of 1968, Manson and 3 girls drove to an exclusive dude ranch near Reno, Nevada, where they spent 2 weeks as Charlene‘s guests. 
At the time of Charlie’s visit to Reno, Charlene was getting her divorce finalized.  According to Sanders, her settlement figure was around $2,000,000.  However, I’ve read that it was a cash settlement of $130,000 plus $20,000 a year, some antiques and 4 thoroughbred race horses.  Carter retained custody of their baby.<strong>Evidently, Charlie’s “double-talk voodoo” worked on Charlene too.  Manson supposedly told Charlene to buy him a blue Fleetwood Cadillac.</strong>  She screwed up and bought a fire-engine red Cadillac and he told her to take it back.  Manson was instrumental in squandering any money she had.</p>

            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In December of 1968, Manson and 3 girls drove to an exclusive dude ranch near Reno, Nevada, where they spent 2 weeks as Charlene‘s guests. 
At the time of Charlie’s visit to Reno, Charlene was getting her divorce finalized.  According to Sanders, her settlement figure was around $2,000,000.  However, I’ve read that it was a cash settlement of $130,000 plus $20,000 a year, some antiques and 4 thoroughbred race horses.  Carter retained custody of their baby.
            <strong>
             Evidently, Charlie’s “double-talk voodoo” worked on Charlene too.  Manson supposedly told Charlene to buy him a blue Fleetwood Cadillac.
            </strong>
            She screwed up and bought a fire-engine red Cadillac and he told her to take it back.  Manson was instrumental in squandering any money she had.

            Trust funds are much prized honeypots for CIA operations like PizzaGate. We need to defund any &amp; all trust funds which are being used as funding sources for criminal activities. Ford Foundation, I'm looking at you!

            The original Washington D.C. immigrant spelled his name as "Morris Kafitz."  This might enlarge the research.

            Have not been here in awhile..nice write up and well done TD.  Can you also tie in Bronfman's????  Cafritz ties great to Alefantis and known bad actors but all these threads lead to the Bronfmans...and they appear to be top of the control structure...the WHO is controlling is khazarian...

            "The Cafritz family are Lithuanian-American Jews who amassed a large fortune in DC real estate and built several important DC residences. While the original philanthropists are not linked to satanic occultism as of writing this, the family foundation appears to be one of the main donors to the Transformer Gallery."

            This was family founder Morris Kafitz' father-in-law:
"Dr. Laszlo Detre de Surany was an interesting-looking though far from handsome man, with an aquiline nose and a brush mustache. He was internationally known among immunologists for having coined the term antigen and having codiscovered what became known as the Wassermann test. August von Wassermann, working in Germany, at the center of the medical world, published his work on a diagnostic test for syphilis in apes just two weeks before Dr. Detre reported his findings on humans—which, a medical textbook concluded, failed to gain the recognition it deserves. He was a kind man (and an expert bridge player) of serious demeanor and a quiet courage: He had often been known to experiment on himself."

            In the District of Columbia there are 3,000 children in foster care; 1,800 children under the age of five who are homeless; and 35,000 children who live in homes where the next meal is uncertain. The Washington Children’s Foundation supports organizations that provide services to children in the District who are at risk. We conduct our own research to identify those which meet the “best of the best” standard. We make site visits to observe the work being done by these organizations and then invite a request for funding. Following our decision to make a grant, we maintain contact with the organization to monitor progress and ensure that our common objectives are realized. The Washington Children’s Foundation does not accept unsolicited requests for grants

               Well, by this point I'd like to think police(et al) have their hands on NXIVM's finances; they should have at least a partially complete list of all persons who had positions as staff(or leaders, whatever) and those who undertook the 'intensives'; incoming/outgoing finances, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               If they(NXIVM) didn't document these things, well, shitty business practice for a start...

                 Well, I guess that's where we can only sort of hope that the required info is available to the relevant authorities and in the hands of good people within the organization(s) of said authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Arrests are what we want, but, that does mean we over here become somewhat limited in what we can do other than hope it will be treated properly(while also looking for more connections in-case someone arrested won't talk) - now that so many eyes are on these things, one would think it quite difficult to corrupt the investigation on the other end...

            All I can add to that is that Lithuania is the way to get control of Russia from the North. Khazars want to destroy Russia because they kicked their  lying @$$#$ out, right after they claimed to adopt one of the three religions which was dictated by the Rus/Slavs. Guess which one they faked. Still embedded, and in contact. Last prehistoric peoples alive.

Basit’s late father was accused of embezzling millions of dollars from the Qaddafi government and sent to prison. Basit fled to Switzerland and lived in exile for years. He was well mannered, well groomed, articulate and played the part of a well-heeled man, which he wasn’t.~~

            Basit Igtet (born 24 September 1970) is a Zurich-based entrepreneur and Libyan national who has founded several companies in various sectors. He became prominent in mid-2011 for his work supporting the Libyan revolution through international lobbying and was consequently appointed as a Special Envoy to the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) on 4 September 2011

Mr. Griffiths became involved in the Libyan revolution early on by working with Libyan National Transitional Council Special Envoy Basit Igtet to facilitate Presidential meetings in Latin American Nations. The purpose of these meetings was to secure official recognition of the National Transitional Council as the sole legitimate representatives of the Libyan people.~~

            We feel compelled to provide this article which has since been cleaned from Authorsden which was boastfully authored by Richard H. Griffiths about himself. The article’s highlights note Richard H. Griffiths’ impressive connections to American and Canadian intelligence agencies such as CIA, CSIS (Canadian Security and Intelligence Agency), and the US Navy. As well as being “…exclusive director of public relations for Scaix (Nasdaq-UGMI) a US based counter Terrorism and tactical equipment developer for the US Military, CIA, FBI and Intelligence…” He further elaborated: “Mr. Griffiths has developed relationships with United States counter intelligence as well as Special Operations command as well as having classified clearance via NASA.”

            Jane Cafritz, Calvin Cafritz wife,
            <strong>
             is building a Children's Museum
            </strong>
            , sponsored by the Morris &amp; Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, and two other donors.
            <strong>
             The site will also host other facilities for children.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR: A sponsor for Alefantis' Transformer Gallery is building a Children's Museum. BIG RED FLAG HERE.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Given all of her fond memories of bringing her kids to D.C.’s children’s museum when they were young, Washington real estate developer and philanthropist Jane Cafritz just couldn’t bear that today’s kids were missing out on all the fun.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Cafritz decided to found Explore!, a children’s museum that will debut with a temporary exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery later this month — and eventually become a full-blown museum and campus on land the Morris &amp; Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation is developing in Fort Totten.
            </p>
            <p>
             The exhibit, which will remain up for a year, is meant to stir up support for the permanent museum before it is built, according to
             <strong>
              Rhonda Buckley, who will serve as its executive director.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The exhibit, which opens Jan. 28, will target children from ages 18 months to 8 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             One goal of the temporary exhibit is to attract more donors for the construction of the permanent museum. To start, the Cafritzes are funding the temporary exhibit — which will cost approximately $200,000 to install and maintain — with two other couples,
             <strong>
              Morton and Grace Bender and Paul and Rose Carter
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             They hope to begin construction by the end of 2017 and open to the public in mid-2019, however.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Beyond the museum itself, the Cafritz Foundation hopes to turn Art Place into a wider children’s campus, leasing other retail spaces to other outlets that cater to children.

            </p>
            <p>
             "On almost every tour of the long-abandoned Fort Totten, somebody asks about the secret Civil War tunnel.
            </p>
            <p>
             The visitors have heard the urban legend about an escape passage built between Fort Totten in Queens, to Fort Schuyler in the Bronx, where the Long Island Sound and the East River meet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Historians, park rangers and common sense suggest it is a myth. The technology needed to build a tunnel under more than 100 feet of water, simply didn't exist at the time, they maintain.
            </p>
            <p>
             But speculation has been stoked by tantalizing clues - including dead-ending corridors and walled-up chambers in both forts. The enduring tale prompted the History Channel to run a segment on it recently.
            </p>
            <p>
             David Allen, 53, is fascinated by the myth. When he's not teaching history at SUNY Maritime College, housed in Fort Schuyler, he enjoys exploring the Throgs Neck fort's complex maze of underground tunnels.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few months ago, he discovered a passage that appears to go under the bay headed directly for Fort Totten.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Every legend is based in some fact," Allen said, before climbing down a rusty ladder hidden in the school's storage cabinet. "This may be the escape tunnel they designed for the fort."
            </p>
            <p>
             Allen was referring to a cold, dank corridor in the bowels of Fort Schuyler. He carefully lowered himself onto a second ladder, this one made of rope, as he shined a flashlight into the mouth of the passageway.
            </p>
            <p>
             To his left was a stairway leading to the fort's center. On his right, the tunnel appeared to go deeper underground. It was filled with about 18 inches of water, rendering it impassable.
            </p>
            <p>
             But 150 years ago, the sea level was about 1-1/2 feet lower, Allen said. The tunnel would probably have been dry.
            </p>
            <p>
             SUNY Maritime Provost Joseph Hoffman said he saw a round, 4-foot-wide exit to what he believes was the tunnel about four years ago at the sea wall near the fort.
            </p>
            <p>
             But after exploring the area on a boat at low tide with the Daily News, Allen was unable to find it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bronx historian Lloyd Ultan, 71, has heard of this passage. However, he's adamant it doesn't go anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It would lead people to believe it's the beginning of the tunnel, but there isn't any," Ultan said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fort Totten Urban Park Ranger Geoffrey Martin is equally skeptical. He tells curious visitors the technology needed to build such a tunnel didn't exist during the Civil War.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It would have been very hard for them to cover this up," he continued. And "there would have been no reason to build a tunnel like this."
            </p>
            <p>
             The narrow and mildewing Fort Totten tunnel featured on the History Channel is a dead end, he said, instead of continuing on to Fort Schuyler.
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin is convinced the Bayside fort's bricked-up archway, which visitors believe could be the passage, is really a cistern or reservoir.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allen was able to slip a camera through the archway where a brick was missing and found what appears to be a room.
            </p>
            <p>
             The photos show what appears to be an exit in the corner leading toward the water, he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Allen may never know where it goes. The city Parks Department, which oversees Fort Totten, has no plans to open up the archway, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Though he would like to believe the secret passage exists, Allen said there just isn't enough evidence to persuade him.
            </p>
            <p>
             "There have been people looking for this thing for the last 100 years," he said. "Now it's up to us to discover the truth." "

            "In a weird twist that cut"s right through the DC art world, the daughter-in-law of Gwen and Morris Cafritz had a run-in with who else but Charles Manson in the lead-up to the Manson murders. While her involvement with the family was short, remember that Manson killed Abigail Folger, heiress to the Folger fortune and relative of Izette Folger, who appears to be one of James Alefantis' best friends. She calls him 'Pan'."
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow - the Cafritz family used to be a big name in DC.  Don't see them mentioned much anymore.

              The Bronfman connection is probably the best indication, but you need to think of every bullshit cult as being at the very least inspired by psychological control techniques pioneered by the CIA and Tavistock, and in turn seeing the influence of the CIA being extended through the pyramidical structure of these organizations. For example, someone blackmailed at the Pegasus museum or at an NXIVM seminar may actually be under the thumb of the CIA or even a group like the World Jewish Congress and not have the slightest inkling they are.

               The World Jewish Congress/Jewish agency pretty much founded the CIA, hence Angleton, Meyer, Gottlieb, Bissell, and all those OSS pedo communist jews running around back in the 40's btw blackmail ops on congress were blowing up even then

               While the CIA specializes in Psychological Warfare, you have to admit the Westboro Baptist Church did international "news" cycles repeatedly. To the point of victimizing Homosexual through "shock &amp; Awe". Like a well oiled psyops should be. Sad.

               Oh, about NXIVM? This was just a simple CIA recruitment tool for Blackmail and Extortion. The kidnapping kind. Follow the money down to Mexico way..

            Great post!  It's clear to me that both NIXVM and the Alefantis operations are CIA.  We just need to make that link now.

             The Family! That's why Alefantis shouts that he runs a FAMILY-friendly restaurant. People in the know hear this and understand that they will be physically dismantled and fed to the pigs if they go against any of his little coterie of Satanic hipster kids undertakers.
