            I know why they think they are doing it... aleister crowley, sex majick etc. but really it is because they are weak, psychopathic personalities that have no choice once initiated into the club. Inbreeding doesnt help either. Just look at the Rothschilds or the Royals. It's a mental sickness passed down from generations. This goes hand in hand with their intense hatred for christ, and all that is good in the world which is especially children, and the common man while at the same time believing they are superior beings and can do whatever they want with impunity. See "the protocols of the learned elders of zion". This sickness needs to be eradicated for good this time around. Many have tried throughout history and failed.

            It could very well be.  So many influences that are subliminal, that we only realize later on in life.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of Satanism is to be the antithesis of God and Creation.  Whereas God gives life and order, Satan will rip it apart and use chaos and destruction to bring forth a new beginning.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's the whole light/dark aspect.  The divide that has kept us guessing since our birth/creation/evolution...we always subconsciously seek to balance it, and some consciously try to manipulate it.

            You have some very valid points, that this is also a spiritual fight. I have been drawn into this also, but I don't have the investigative skills that others here do.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, I do have an understanding of what we are fighting and that we been kept in the dark for thousand of years. We have been kept distracted with media, fear, money, stress, wars etc. in order to keep us from seeking our true power, our higher collective consciousness, our light.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all warriors, with different superpowers, the ones with a deep connection to the source, need to be relentless in keeping strong with our prayers and meditations.  We WILL win!

            Right, same devil down through the centuries, so same garbage. The Aztecs were doing it in South America, other cultures too. Things took a bad turn when the Jews rejected Christ. "And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it." There's the one in charge of it all.

            Don't worry, you're spot on. It just muddies the water too much. But people love to talk. Myself included. But you're right, expend the energy elsewhere, get (and stay) on track.

            I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't holly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason.

           <p>
            Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction. The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions. The Star of David is a mathematical symbol.

             Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.

            Meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:

           <p>
            Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters squared. They squared the circle at the same time.

            Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
           </p>

            Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.

            Well this is the closest to the truth, the Biblical angle is the key. "But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils." The ancient Hebrews were sternly warned against sacrificing their children to Moloch yet they failed over and over. It's still going on.

            I think all do it for different reasons, as for anything humans do it to make them feel good. There has to be pleasure derived from power for some. If you want to dive down a rabbit hole I oddly believe they are addicted to the adrenaline laced blood harvested from the victims who are kept alive. Sounds entirely morbid and maybe just one branch of a giant tree to explain why they repeat these offenses so regularly... but addiction would explain the blatant disregard for human to human empathy in those disgusting situations.

            Simply put, their belief in Satanism is the primary motivation to do rituals during the abuse. Fritz Springmeier wrote about the handlers binding demons to the alter personalities as part of the Mind Controlled slave programming. All of the MK-Ultra technology (scientific and spiritual) came out of Nazi research into mind control and the occult via the thule society, anenerhbe, etc.

            we know the spirit cooking and child pedophilia is real, we can assume the child sacrifice is real.
The question is why. (the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...is convincing the world he didn't exist)
           </p>
           <p>
            First assumption. God is real and the Devil is real
           </p>
           <p>
            2nd assumption. God and the 'Devil' had a 'falling out' some say Lucifer fell from grace due to his arrogance. He hated that mankind was God's preferred creation, and he made it his life's mission (till the end of time) to spiritually ruin as many Humans as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            3rd Assumption: The devil makes spiritual allies in this world (Clinton + Podesta et al) to advance their worldly power in exchange for destroying their spiritual purity (killing children after defiling them is top of the list).
           </p>
           <p>
            4th Assumption: The Humans who do this (and most of them are very smart) must be promised a share in the 'next' life. But also they are working hard to rebuild the 3rd Temple of Solomon. They have a unnatural fixation with Zionism and establishing the world order around Jerusalem.
           </p>
           <p>
            5th Assumption. In order to seat Jerusalem at the center of the world, the existing world powers need to be shoved aside (nuclear war?- MAD , except for Jerusalem of course).
           </p>
           <p>

            Because, even though it has not been recognized by mainstream science, spiritual energies are a real thing. There are fields of research called "parapsychology" or "science of consciousness" with researchers such as Rupert Sheldrake, Dean Radin and David Wilcock, who are discovering the fact that mind is indeed over matter and that thought creates reality. The Satanists are thus trying to influence reality to their advantage using these kind of rituals. Of course, they don't want other people to realize this, because then the people would use it against them:

            Do the top-pedophiles believe that their ritualized child rape grants them some kind of occult power? To fully understand and explain this line of thinking would take a huge post, but let me suffice by stating that the myths of Osiris, Isis, Horus and Seth are taken very very seriously in many occult systems, as they serve as a template for creating rituals. In short: the principle of how the union of the Male (Osiris) and the Female (Isis) produces a Child (Horus) is seen as the basic mechanism of creation itself ie. the method God uses to "make creation happen". People seeking to dictate their will on creation (ie. make their own creation happen), study this mechanism to find out if there is some kind of loophole by which the natural process of creation can be "hacked" to produce the result of the magicians' bidding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Often, only the original myth of Osiris and Isis is mentioned (where Osiris is cut up into 14 pieces by his jealous brother Seth, and Isis resurrects Osiris by putting all the pieces back together again. However, the last piece, his penis, was thrown into the river and eaten by a fish. Remember that picture of John Podesta with the fish and the 14?), but there are other myths as well, in which Horus is raped and nurtured by Seth, and Seth loses one testicle to Horus etc. etc. (Hitler is said to have lost one testicle in a ritual ... just a side note). So, if the Child is the natural result as produced by Divine creation, set to influence creation the way the Divine intended, is raping the Child the way to distort this process and influence creation the rapist intends?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you have to realize that in any occult system, death and conception/sex are seen as the two most powerful phenomena, and they usually take center stage when it comes to rituals. It actually kinda makes sense. Life, no matter how you look at it, is a vast mystery. In death and in conception, so it is believed, a portal to the "other" side is opened temporarily, and "life" enters or exits this material plane of existence. This portal is seen by occultists as another loophole; another way to imbue the universe with your will, forcing it to take form in the material world. To amplify the power of their workings (ie. making sure the portal stays open for a longer period of time), some magicians believe this can be achieved by either prolonging death (by torture), or prolonging conception (by having sex for a long period without reaching orgasm), reasoning this prolonging causes the universe to somehow "anticipate" either death or conception, and therefore already opening the portal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Willful human sacrifice is also seen as a method of already "opening the portal" for a longer period of time by creating this anticipation, as the victim anticipates his death for a period in the buildup to the final sacrificial ritual. In modern days, we find the very idea that a sane human would be willing to ritually sacrifice himself absurd, but isn't this exactly what war is all about? Herds of young men somehow choose to be sent to the battlefield, accepting the fact that they might get killed, and all for some glorious idea. Military uniforms and gear are usually decorated with a slew of occult symbols, by the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, I'm not saying all this actually works, but it does seem that this is what these people believe to be true. And, as was stated by some other commenters, the power-trip these ritualists imagine themselves to be on seems to at least serve as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, therefore granting them the illusion their methods are effective.

            I do believe some reference to Aleister Crowley's literature on his Thelema/Theosophistic beliefs need to be pointed out.  I do recall reading somewhere that via Sex Magick, certain rituals invoke greater power as one increases the level of innocence/bloodshed.   Can someone find the reference?

            Rituals are a form of meditating.  Using a pattern to concentrate one's energy into a singular thought and bring it forward into reality.  Chanting names/verses/spells/incantations creates a certain frequency that can put you into a trance state.  This is where the 'magick' happens, as the psyche is open and vulnerable to suggestions. Drawing sigils, using certain ceremonial items (chalice, sword, altar, etc.) are ways to tie one to the ritual, sort of binding you to the actual manifestation you are trying to achieve.
           </p>
           <p>
            Extended life?  Ritual.
Blessings of wealth?  Ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only that, but blood has always been sacred in most holy texts and other tomes of ancient knowledge.  It is the life force, the all giving energy that keeps us alive.  Recent studies suggest that stem cells in a young child's blood can extend the life and rejuvenate the mind and body of an adult.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ritual is a binding.  Satanists seek to metaphysically 'dismember' themselves into different aspects, trying to create absolute power.  Hence the physical representation of dismemberment with innocent victims.  They are sadists, pure and simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the children/victims they want to keep alive (intelligent, good aesthetics, good 'breeding stock' so to speak), the ritual torture leads to compartmentalization of the mind, and Multiple Personality Disorder.  These multiple personalities are then used as 'channels' to communicate with demons/lords/gods/goddessess/entities/etc.  The Abusers fully believing that the voice coming through that broken human being is a ethereal entity.  Who knows, maybe it is.  I have no idea about our subconscious.

            Aside from the great answers already posted, the rituals also serve to split the brain and create Dissociative Identity Disorder; which is instrumental in the creation of mind control slaves. Fritz Springmeier has written extensively on the mind control programs.

            You know, since we are seriously considering that this behaviour is prevalent in the highest levels of power, I don't think we can state that it is inefficient. apparently it is hugely efficient at organizing power through mutual blackmail, and motivating the retention of power to avoid discovery and prosecution.

            They are putting commands into the matrix by doing dark rituals that contain symbols, sounds, words, and dark energies of pain and fear, this causes the matrix computer(whatever that actually is), to create a reality that favors the darkness and so they gain power, the light workers do the same on the light side to try and reverse the dark spells. It sounds crazy but that is what has been happening since humans were put here. The magic is real, both light and dark and it does work for them, most normal people don't believe in this and so the positive side is greatly out of balance. We need an army of light workers to emerge and do light work to rebalance and get rid of these creatures.

            If it were just a matter of causing terror in the victim, killing, and then drinking the blood, why the need for extensive rituals on particular dates, under particular moons, etc? I don't think this can be explained APART from some spiritual entity being worshipped and appeased. Just my two cents worth.

            <p>
             Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction. The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions. The Star of David is a mathematical symbol.

              Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.

             Meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:

            <p>
             Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters squared. They squared the circle at the same time.

             Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).

             Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.

            Ok, if you're not ready to believe the possessed by Satan business, lets look at it on a psychological level. Psychopaths and sociopaths are born power seekers by nature and achieve it through social deception. This technique of dominance is only possible through a lack of empathy, a certain cold heartedness. When these people start to feel an inkling of humanity or compassion in their heart, this takes away from their egotistical power so to squash that empathy and regain their evil fuel they must witness something sadistic such as a child rape, torture, or murder ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's no secret that people with these disorders have an unusually morbid fascination with violence and death. What we are seeing is just this same behavior at the highest echelon of society and they take it to the extreme because they get away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit I didn't mean to imply that those are the only psychological disorders we're talking about here, indeed many of these people are probably schizophrenic, dissociative identity disorder, etc., many have probably been messed up psychologically as children themselves.
