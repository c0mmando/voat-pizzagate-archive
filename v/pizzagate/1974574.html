<p>the cheese Mia family
after a two year investigation, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission released a Report of the Study of Organized Crime’s Infiltration of the Pizza and Cheese Industry. Wisconsin’s Grande Cheese Co of Fond du Lac was referenced several times.</p>
<p>Grande Cheese Co., mentioned in the body of the report in reference to Joseph Bonanno, Roma Foods and the Falcone Brothers, was born out of a Chicago gang war in 1939. During the first few years of its operation, at least five men, including the owner, were killed. Chicago crime boss Ross Prio eventually gained control of the company. Over the years Grande has been owned by or associated with numerous organized crime figures.</p>
<p>In the 1950\'s the ownership of Grande Cheese passed from Ross Prio to the DiBella family, John and his sister, Rose. John DiBella became corporate President in 1959. John had ties
to Milwaukee crime boss John Alioto, who was Frank Balistrieri’s father-in-law. John Alioto was the Milwaukee mob boss from 1952 until 1961 when he handed over control to his son-in-law, Frank Balistrieri. DiBella’s sister Rose took over her brother\'s stock after his death in 1964, and later sold her interest to the Candela and Gaglio families. The Gaglio family owned Ontario Importing, founded by the family patriarch, Vito Gaglio, in the mid-1960\'s. </p>
<p>The actual control of the cheese and pizza business began with no less a figure than Joseph Bonanno, Sr. Bonanno, living at that time in Tucson, Arizona, was regarded as one of the most powerful leaders of Organized Crime in America. Bonanno initiated a conspiracy to control the specialty cheese business in the United States in the early 1940\'s and even in 1980, he and his associates controlled the activities of some of the largest and most prosperous specialty cheese companies. Bonanno had direct ties to Grande Cheese of Wisconsin; through it to Grande\'s exclusive distributor in the Pennsylvania area, Roma Foods of South Plainfield, New Jersey; and through the distributor to hundreds of retail pizza shops which were financed and controlled by the organization in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Falcone brothers of Brooklyn, New York--formerly associated with Bonanno-tied Grande Cheese and partners with a Grande officer in other Wisconsin cheese companies--built and operated for a decade a network of fraudulent &quot;paper companies&quot; designed to produce millions of dollars for the Falcones only to collapse financially when challenged by claims of their legitimate business victims.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Crime Commission investigation had determined that the Falcones and Thomas Gambino drove another company into bankruptcy in 1976. In December of 1975, the
Falcones and Gambino bought 70% of the stock of the previously family-owned Badger State\' Cheese Company in Luxemburg, Wisconsin. Eight months later, Badger State Cheese collapsed in disarray with $1.3-million in debts. The Falcones and Gambino had taken over Badger and arranged that Capitol Cheese of Brooklyn, New York be the major customer and distributor for Badger. Capitol Cheese of Brooklyn was operated by Joseph and Thomas Gambino. Joseph Gambino was a leader in the Carlo Gambino crime organization.
Capitol Cheese directed delivery of Badger State cheese to Capitol\'s customers, collected payment from the customers, and then the cash disappeared. When Capitol Cheese owed Badger State Cheese $560,000, Badger State closed down and the Wisconsin State Department of Agriculture placed the company in trusteeship. Capitol Cheese, the Gambino business in Brooklyn, afterward, went out of business.</p>
<p>Also involved in the Crime Commission Investigation:
F &amp; A CHEESE of Grand Rapids, Michigan, owned by Francesco and Angelo Terranova. The Company was started with a loan from the uncle of the Terranovas, John DiBella of Grande Cheese. F &amp; A Cheese had another office in Upland, California. Raffael Quasarano, a
member of the Joseph Zerilli criminal organization of Detroit, and Peter Vitale were indicted by a federal grand jury in Detroit in November, 1979 for allegedly extorting $270,000 from the Terranovas. They were also charged with mail fraud, tax fraud and racketeering. According to the indictment Quasarano and Vitale used &quot;fear of economic loss&quot; and threats of &quot;force and violence&quot; to gain control of an F &amp; A subsidiary, Rogersville Cheese Factory, Inc. in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>According to a report printed in the Milwaukee Sentinel on Aug. 7, 1980, the owner of a Wisconsin cheese factory (Rodgersville Cheese Factory) allegedly taken over by organized crime bosses from Detroit was told by either Quasarano or Vitale in 1974, “The big fish is swallowing the little fish, and you\'re lucky your legs aren\'t broken, according to Federal Court testimony that day. Both eventually pled guilty and were sentenced to prison terms of four years each in 1981.</p>',

            Larry Yarber was the local head of a branch of a cult called The Family. They've also been known as Children of God, The Family International, Teens for Christ, and The Family of Love. Yarber was from a blue collar African American family in Racine. He had 11 siblings. When he was 12, his father left his wife for a much younger white woman. Larry Yarber left Wisconsin and went to train under a Sensei in California. He came back to Racine and started a karate school. He was (is) a professional scam artist who tricks his followers into signing over their assets. He even stole his owns mother's house by convincing her to sign over the deed to him. He sold it out from under her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yarber and his some of his siblings have been involved in his cult. His brother was arrested for molesting children that lived at the "Big House" (the apartment complex Yarber and his followers gradually gobbled up and turned into a communal living coop) in Caledonia, Wisconsin. Caledonia borders the far south side of Milwaukee (Oak Creek) and Racine. This is why this particular location/situation may have been ideal in linking "off grid" children born to addicted, brainwashed mothers to the larger PG story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yarber was a big fan of partying at bars in Racine in the 80's, and it's entirely possible he was dealing cocaine. But hmmm.. I wonder where he was getting large quantities of cocaine? A cursory search links Yarber to the Black Disciples, a Chicago street gang headed by David Barksdale aka "King David". David Barksdale was married to Yvonne Yarber, Larry Yarber's sister. Was this group distributing the Contra's cocaine with the assistance of government agencies? Was the Johnson family involved in some way, perhaps in supply chain management, give that they own a massive plantation in Brazil and have the ability to move product on their own with minimal government interaction?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's more on Larry Yarber:

             Racine is connected to several universities that are involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption including but not limited to Cornell University, Penn State University and Arizona State University. You are not wrong about corruption in LA and AZ, but the real story is that small city Racine, Wisconsin is a main root to the entire network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                , as I see strangeness unable to figure-out thus far at UT Dallas.  My prior post a few days ago alluded to UT Dallas and the word Temoc (also seen as T.E.M.O.C. in unrelated UT Dallas findings) - Comet spelled backwards.  Temoc is the UT Dallas mascot and truly a frightening mascot it is, and Comet is their athletic logo.  Other bizzare references to Temoc/T.E.M.O.C. were found, one of which included "deviant art" which was disturbing and sickening after looking at 5 photos.  How deep does this rabbit-hole go?  I do not know if I can go any  further.

                 The hole goes all the way through. We need to poke right through it so people can see the light. That is the whole point of the controlled opposition creating compartmentalized rabbit holes They want people to give up thinking it is a hopeless neverending quagmire of loose ends. They want you to dig until you reach stories about false flags, bloodlines and reptilian shape-shifters to feel hopeless.

                 This is why Racine is a key to global enlightenment. It is a perfect model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and simple for people to understand. It is a controlled community ran by the elite who are involved in the most heinous crimes imaginable and the authorities at all levels are corrupt and complicit to it. Racine and Wisconsin are a lawless cesspool where corrupt community leaders are immune and protected from all laws through systems of blackmail, bribery, extortion, embezzlement, fraud, intimidation, murder, stalking, retaliation, and other means.

                 There are a couple of connections here such as a professor at UT Dallas and Racine Coalition for Peace and Justice (a known corrupt organization involved):

                </p>
                <p>
                 There are likely many more connections to this: 
UT Dallas Institute for Urban Policy Research
                </p>
                <p>
                 This scholarship was also being promoted to local corrupt Catholic high schools involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption:
University of Texas at Dallas – The Eugene McDermott Scholars Program
McDermott Scholars will be afforded an excellent university and cultural education at virtually no cost to the Scholar or the Scholar's family. The McDermott Scholars Program provides extensive financial support for each Scholar's education. The Program covers, year-round for four years, all of each Scholar's university tuition and fees.

                  , wonder if the strong Student Muslim Society at UT Dallas are all McDermott scholars?  As deep as "Pizzagate" and all of the evil and corruption involving just about every facet of our society is, can it all be conquered through Wisconsin/Racine?  Appears to me that our government has to be dismantled.  Can that be accomplished by taking it down, if you will, in Wisconsin?

                   The great fallacy is that the broken and corrupt system can be fixed through the broken and corrupt system. It cannot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The only answer is to enlighten the world with the truth about Racine and how it connects to every corner of the world through Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Everyone needs to know who declared war on the innocent citizens of the world, and the innocent citizens of the world need to declare war and rise up against them. The governments will only work for the people when the people realize they are in charge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We can prove to the world that the entire system of globalization is corrupt at all levels, with the plan to enslave the world through lies such as sustainability and artificial intelligence. The easiest way to enlighten the world is through a simple example of one community as a model to expose the system in all communities.

                    Coincidentally, my piano teacher and friend were discussing small, self-sufficient, rural communities 2 days ago starting with a handful of like-minded adults, preferably "empty-nesters."
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There's a unique area in the State of Delaware, The Village of Arden.  It was founded in 1900 as a Single Tax community based on the economic philosophy of Henry George from Philadelphia, referred to as Georgism.  It is based on the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land, including natural resources, should belong equally to all members of society.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Village of Arden is noted for its arts, crafts, music, and theatre.  Half the land is forests and greens which are not taxed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The community consists of  3 villages, 250 households and 500 residents. The communal land in each village is owned by each municipality while the land leased out for dwellings is owned by trust - people own their houses but pay rent on leaseholds in the form of taxes.  Those taxes - land rent - cover village, county, and local school expenses and are assessed on the square footage of each leasehold.  Each village has a  separate municipal government.

                 Your argumentative skills are clearly lacking, and your comment history is all anyone needs to see to understand what level you are operating at. You should stick to your other favorite threads like Shemales and Schoolgirls.

                 Why are you so concerned about Racine if you call it "such a shithole"? How would you know anything about Racine? Did someone strike a nerve?

                   So why are you so sensitive about Racine when you barely have commented about anything else on Pizzagate? Do you have friends and relatives in Racine? Please share as to why you are so suddenly interested in Racine, Wisconsin? Did EquineLuvr and Donkeyhole call you for help?

            There are many mafia families still deeply involved within certain circles, including Bonanno, Gagliano, Quadracci, Madigrano, Porcaro, Aiello, Balistrieri, Infusino, Tenuta, Ferarro, Santarelli, and even Ruffalo (yes that one), as well as other groups including the Cuban and Dixie mafia which have ties to Podesta and Clintons.
