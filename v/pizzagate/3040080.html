<p>This seems to be the chief complaint of pizzagate deniers like Gabe Hoffman. I got to wondering why, if there is nothing to hide, do we keep seeing Comet being pushed back into the news so the MSM can keep repeating there\'s nothing to see, here? So, I went spelunking in our archives and came across this submission from one of the original <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">r/pizzagate</a> investigators <a href="https://voat.co/u/redditfuckingsucksyo">@redditfuckingsucksyo</a> that deals directly with that subject:</p>

<p>I\'m not sure very many people actually saw this submission, made in January 2017 just a few weeks after this sub was forced to move from Reddit. It was submitted to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods">v/pizzagatemods</a>, and thus does not come up on searches of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a>, unless you unclick the SearchVoat checkbox. It has no relevant key words in the title, so to find its reference to New Hope Academy, you would have to also check the search post body box to find it. The OP received this tip in a PM from another user. He states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis IS connected to the ‘New Hope Academy’ at 7009 Varnum Street, MD Hyattsville. For those not familiar with the Washington area, Hyattsville is a close urban suburb of Washington DC. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a> … … … ….</p>
<p>The children are most likely being packed into homes along Varnum Street, Hyattsville, surrounding the academy, and along Finns Lane, Lanham Maryland 20706, where the previous business manager (deceased) of the academy, Joseph T Scheve lived.</p>
<p>James Alefantis\' Pegasus Museum / Kiddies Playground is virtually slap bang in the middle of the two locations. 7.75 miles from the Academy in Hyattsville and 8.25 miles from Finns Lane, Lanham. per <a href="http://distance-cities.com">http://distance-cities.com</a> .</p>
<p>The academy is described on its website as a private international school.

<p>The second submission made on New Hope Academy the very next day, <strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1555511">Alefantis and Pegasus Museum connections to the Moonie Cult</a></strong>, was by Redberries, one of the <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=&amp;s=&amp;u=Redberries&amp;d=&amp;df=&amp;dt=&amp;nsfw=off">best researchers</a> who was <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/u0j5yw.png">doxxed a week later* and deleted their account</a>. Luckily, it was archived: <a href="https://archive.fo/A2LBf">https://archive.fo/A2LBf</a> </p>
<p>Read it. It\'s loaded. This reference to &quot;Gardens&quot; jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hmm... Nellie owns a fancy place called the &quot;Blooming Gardens&quot;. Her other house, located right near New Hope Academy, appears to have more than 15 residents, comprised mostly of &quot;Scheves&quot; and &quot;Hubbards&quot;. There\'s a big discrepancy in the cleanliness of the two properties, which strikes as odd.</p>

<p><sub>*Question: Does anyone recall if Redberries was the other user Alefantis asked <a href="https://voat.co/u/IsThisGameofThrones">@IsThisGameofThrones</a> about when he called and threatened him?</sub></p>

<p>Toward the end of January 2017, <a href="https://voat.co/u/Zenmaster_411">@Zenmaster_411</a> made <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1575960">a submission</a> showing that Alefantis\' connection to the New Hope owners was more than just buying Pegasus Museum from them. He was an agent of their estate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James Alefantis was an AGENT OF THE ESTATE of Joseph T. Scheve Since he is not an attorney or fiduciary (that I know of), this means he would have to be a close friend/associate of Scheve/Hubbard (much more than just a casual acquaintance).</p>
<p>SO WHY IS VALIDATION OF ALEFANTIS’ CONNECTION TO SCHEVE/HUBBARD IMPORTANT?</p>
<p>As a note from the earlier VOAT post I referenced (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085</a>)), Joseph T. Scheve was the business manager for the New Hope Academy, a school connected to the Unification Church (AKA Moonies) at 7009 Varnum Street, MD Hyattsville. Hyattsville is a close urban suburb of Washington DC. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a>. The Unification Church has curious connections to the CIA (and other intelligence agencies), Washington (friends with the Bush and Biden families and convicted pedophile, former Speaker of the House, Hastert), and Haiti (New Hope Academy has a branch there).The Unification Church also has had quite the reputation for odd sex rituals and brainwashing.

<p>You can dig through the rest of the submissions on the list, as I\'ve run out of time. It seems weird to me that this very interesting topic simply died out. Did we find everything we could? Or did doxxing and intimidation of the most interested researchers succeed in suppressing it? What do you all recall about this topic? Is this school still operating?</p>',

            . The Unification Church has curious connections to the CIA (and other intelligence agencies), Washington (friends with the Bush and Biden families and convicted pedophile, former Speaker of the House, Hastert), and Haiti (New Hope Academy has a branch there).The Unification Church also has had quite the reputation for odd sex rituals and brainwashing.

           You can dig through the rest of the submissions on the list, as I've run out of time. It seems weird to me that this very interesting topic simply died out. Did we find everything we could? Or did doxxing and intimidation of the most interested researchers succeed in suppressing it? What do you all recall about this topic? Is this school still operating?

People, and this means minimum 60–70% globally IMO, need to be made aware and convinced,
           </p>
           <p>
            that the implementation of the seven Part template of the Blog “How to save the World” would result in:
           </p>
           <p>
            Maximum freedom and security for all people, and would require only a modicum of selfrestraint from each Individual.
           </p>
           <p>
            To achieve this i propose the method of Blog two. Everybody should pick some Blog 1 related Info of his/her choosing
           </p>
           <p>
            and adress in a confident, yet non obtrusive, manner at least one other person IRL every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Info provided should be so compelling, that no explicit demand to spread it needs to be added
           </p>
           <p>
            Off course this means one should pick topics one feels strongly about, and believes it will be interesting to the adressed person !
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore one should check ones own consumption of media, food, etc. as well as the time and money spend.
           </p>
           <p>
            This stock taking should focus especially on companies which directly or indirectly do evil, e.g. poison the planet or
           </p>
           <p>
            the minds of millions with adrenalin busting yet attention and compassion destroying filth !
           </p>
           <p>
            Fewer and fewer companies control larger and ever larger parts of entire industries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Often disguised through various brand labels etc. Easy to check for everybody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding the media one has to conclude (this definitly implies the various ”alternative” media, as well)
           </p>
           <p>
            that they very often serve as propaganda and distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leave your “smart”phone
           </p>
           <p>
            (check the last paragraph for its controlling verbiage alone, now add the surveilance hundreds of millions do
           </p>
           <p>
            facilitate onto themselves AND their surrounding, to a ridiculous and unprecedented degree AND add the new technologies
           </p>
           <p>
            hailed as both inevitable and beneficial
           </p>
           <p>
            watch blackmirror)
           </p>
           <p>
            as often as possible unused, read a book JohnXIIHawks, have a walk and talk with people you like !
           </p>
           <p>
            Men are pitched against women, blacks against white, “left” against “right”, rich against the poor etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sidenote: check the history and origin of the term Ideology !
           </p>
           <p>
            Hate is incited, war is made palatable again, to a generation living in peace which never knew about its horrors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Creeds are used to controll and to dehumanize believers of different creeds or nowadays even just different opinions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sidenote: check Blog 1 for the solution to this
           </p>
           <p>
            The use of the term Hatespeech to limit the allowed (!!) range of opinions, the controlled use of similar terms like Refugeecrisis, Fakenews etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            and especially the inflationary use of “Phobia” to label as sick the opinions or fears of people, and thus degrading or even dehumanizing them, comes to mind !
           </p>
           <p>
            Be aware that language can be a virus .. , to quote a singer you might know, and yes that is the the point to conclude this blog with the
           </p>
           <p>
            affirmative : No more heroes, and to hell with war !

            "The second submission made on New Hope Academy the very next day, Alefantis and Pegasus Museum connections to the Moonie Cult, was by Redberries, one of the best researchers who was doxxed a week later* and deleted their accountPN" Moonie Cult gave money to Jerry Falwell, who used to be a prominent spokesperson for Christians ..he had strange ideas though back then.. ..different from MSM christians..(1) he thought one big hurricane was due to lesbians (2) he took over the PTL club when it 's spokesperson , Jim Baker, had to go to jail for tax purposes. Charismatic christians and fundamental  supposedly like Falwell would never do this.The two factions do not mix..Cathy O'Brian stated in Trans: Formation of America that two well known TV evangelists were satanic. At the time, the two most well known were Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. A big red flag to me is when the US govt. gives it's stamp of approval to christian evangelists etc. Have read that the US govt. has given more money to Jerry Falwell's church than to NPR...Unfortunately , did not save the link.

            Nothing looks strange to me. These names can be checked for public court records to be sure.  I think the neighboring homes is a dead end.  I did notice that the parent Corp “Specialized Education of MD” has several other similar names where only the state is changed. That might be worth pursuing. As it is for New Horizon, the owner is still hidden behind a corporate entity. I’d have to poke around more tomorrow or someone else can pick that up.

           <p>
            Seems this Berndt Teacher makes many trips to Gambia.  We have had people post about how there are Children taken on nefarious trips to other countries for nefarious purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Berndt started working with groups in Gambia with that first trip in 1999, then began bringing small groups to Gambia in 2007 for three weeks at a time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Berndt, who lives in Bowie, teaches sixth grade classes and algebra to high school students at New Hope Academy in Landover Hills, where she's been since the school opened 21 years ago. She also tutors, helps with the youth ministry at her church and is currently housing four foreign exchange students, some of whom are from Gambia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another organization that started because of Berndt's work is Side by Side, which started a nursing school that now houses 40 children. That, too, is running out of money to keep going. Berndt is working on a plan to help pay teachers and other employees to keep it afloat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the annual summer program is still running strong. It is what Berndt describes as "the ultimate peace-keeping mission." The program is open to anybody over the age of 17 who wants to have an amazing experience and stay in Gambia for more than three weeks.
           </p>
           <p>
            One year at the summer program, two imams from the area came to talk to the group about their beliefs on marriage and family. To the surprise of those on the trip, they had many of the same underlying values as the young Americans.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHAT?  She let two IMAMS come and talk to the Children about their beliefs on Marriage and Family?  If this is what they believe in at New Hope Academy, God Help those Children.  Also, why so many trips and so many Children taken there.

            Anonymous  My daughter had a play date for the day and has fnially recieved an acceptance call. I have not read any recent posts in regards to this school. If anyone has any opnions on the school please let me know. We have to make a decision between two schools soon. If you have any friends who know anything please post their opnions as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anonymous   I know people who've left this school -- dissatisfied with the instruction and the facilities. For me, I just ruled it out because of the connection with the Unification Church (Moonies). Most people try to downplay this -- but I just find it bizarre. That's my own prejudice. When I was looking at schools, I just ruled that one out for that reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anonymous    Not the PP who mentioned the Unification Church, but we also ruled out the school once we found out about that connection. The school's site has a "statement on faiths" and it mentions that the school was founded by members of the Unification Church. If you google Sun Myung Moon or the Unification Church you'll be able to read a lot about the religion and see if you think the school would be a good fit for your family.

             What was decided at a Secret Meeting at Wingspread?
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In furtherance of his plans for religion, West is also a member of
the advisory board of the American Family Foundation (AFF), an
organization affiliated with CAN. 
In 1985, AFF and Jolly West held a clandestine meeting at the 
Wingspread Conference Center near Racine, Wisconsin. West 
attempted to create some credibility for this conference of anti-
religionists by lending the name of the Neuropsychiatric Institute 
(NPI) at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), which 
West heads, as a co-sponsor. However, when UCLA was contacted to 
see if NPI and UCLA were officially sponsoring and endorsing the 
conference, one of the Vice Chancellors for the university stated in a 
letter that: 
“...Neither the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute’s assistance in
organizing the conference, nor Dr. L. Jolyon West’s participation in 
the program, constitutes endorsement or advocacy by the University 
of California. Dr. West is...free to express his views...and does not 
express an official position of the University of California when he 
does so.” 
Word of this secret meeting leaked out beforehand and prompted 
national protests from religious and civil rights organization 
including the National Council of Churches. During the protests, media 
and protestors compared the secret conference to the infamous “Final 
Solution” conference held by the Nazis to work out the extermination 
of the Jews.

             That'd be great. He does check in here from time to time, but since Voat doesn't have off-platform notifications, it often takes a while. He really took a beating here when he reported about Alefantis' fuckery. I've always believed him and thought he was legit dude who wanted to help and was a bit naive about how the shills would spin his decisions. It would be interesting to get his take on this material.

              Yeah, I'll pop over there and shoot him a message. I dunno if he has been active at all on that account or not recently but I'll give it a shot. I must have missed out on all this stuff because I took a long break from everything around February of '17 or therabouts.

               Lucky man!  I've been here almost every single day since November 23, 2016. Only a few days off. This is the board no one wants to mod, because it puts a target on your back, LOL. I've watched something like two dozen mods come and go -- most taken out by trolling and/or doxxing. It was one of the first clues I knew this shit was real.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                John Jacob Astor founded the American Fur Company in NY in 1808 and its subsidiary, the South West Co., in the Great Lakes region. He had a virtual monopoly on the American fur trade from 1820 until 1834 and was reputed to be the richest man in the US when he died.
               </p>
               <p>
                In mockery and imitation of God’s 12 tribes, Satan blessed 12 bloodlines. One of these bloodlines was the Ishmaeli bloodline from which a special elite line developed alchemy, assassination techniques,and other occult practices. One bloodline was Egyptian/Celtic/Druidic from which Druidism was developed. One bloodline was in the orient and developed oriental magic. One lineage was from Canaan and the Canaanites. It had the name Astarte, then Astorga, then Ashdor, and then Astor. The tribe of Dan was used as a Judas Iscariot type seed. The royalty of the tribe of Dan have descended down through history as a powerful Satanic bloodline. The 13th or final blood line was copied after God’s royal lineage of Jesus. This was the Satanic House of David with their blood which they believe is not only from the House of David but also from the lineage of Jesus, who they claim had a wife and children. The 13th Satanic bloodline was instilled with the direct seed of Satan so that they would not only carry Christ’s blood--but also the blood of his "brother" Lucifer.

              I remember some shills slamming me way long ago over some BS I made up - "retrogressive logic".  Work backwards.  Read right to left.  Start at the beginning and work forward a year or two later.  Everything has new meaning.  Just like looking at Feb 15 2018 Q posts.

             Do you recall in one of the recent MSM pieces whining about pizzagate conspiracists Alefantis or Podesta or someone mentioned a woman said her school had been threatened or something like that? I can't remember where I saw that. The woman wasn't named, and we were discussing schools that had had fundraisers at Comet. Can't find that!

              The email was to Comey's personal gmail account, where the sender admits they know each other then asks for a favor, which seems a lot more like a cover up. The two agents in charge of "Pizzagate" or "Pizzagate cover up" (you decide) are named. They would definitely be ones to ask for updates from.

                My first instinct was that Alice Waters of Edible Schoolyards was the one who sent the email on behalf of one of the schools in her program. James Alefantis is on the Board. My Edible Schoolyard posts have been deleted by the mods in this sub, so I gave up on trying to tell anyone about it back in April.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason I jumped to this conclusion is because they had a "Solstice" fundraiser where they made $167,000. Another fundraiser was for someone 41st birthday party. Alefantis is the likely organizer.
               </p>
               <p>
                Edible Schoolyards has connections to a number of schools named "Monarch" where they have made gardens.

               Yep. Excellent. I'm pretty sure that's what I was thinking of. I was trying to find that when I came across this New Hope Academy thread in PGmods.

               I wonder if Comey was referencing the New Hope Academy, and not Edible Schoolyard?

                  It was 1999, and Webre had just moved to Adams Morgan from New Jersey to start his new job. Beside him stood Rhonda Buckley, founder of the Sitar Arts Center, which ran after-school programs for underserved children in that damp, windowless room. She was nervously hoping that Webre would consider, at some future date, offering ballet classes for little ones at her center, maybe once she had moved it to a better location.

                 Having served for two years in an unrelated AmeriCorps program myself, it's interesting that you bring that up. It has definitely crossed my mind a time or two that some of these programs--particularly those in mentoring and education literacy--may very well serve a much more sinister purpose. It is especially troubling when you consider the fact that a lot of them (Teach for America, for example) provide support to K-12 schools in economically disadvantaged/low-income areas. In no way is that to say that all who serve in these programs have ill intent, but rather, it gives certain individuals access where they wouldn't have had it otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's definitely worth looking into, given the history of the program. The idea for a national volunteer network was originally proposed by John F. Kennedy and came to fruition under Lyndon B. Johnson's anti-poverty platform + the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Early programs such as VISTA and the NCCC were ultimately designated under the AmeriCorps umbrella in 1993; a division of the newly-created Corporation for National and Community Service signed into law via the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. In addition to AmeriCorps VISTA and AmeriCorps NCCC, the act also allowed for the establishment of AmeriCorps State and National programs. As a result, communities of all shapes and sizes, in all 50 states, may utilize stakeholder partnerships to apply for and obtain AmeriCorps funding through the CNCS (and thereby establish local or state level AmeriCorps programs to fit the community's needs).

                 Somewhere as I was reviewing the Search results for New Hope Academy, I believe I read that the guy who owned the Pegasus property prior to Alefantis was also a member of the Dupont Underground adivsory group or something. It was enough to ping my radar when I read it, but not enough for me to include in the submission (maybe because I was getting tired and had 20+ tabs open LOL).

                  Savannah Gutherie, from NBC's Today Show, is full on pedo cult. How do I know this? First of all, on the TODAY show this morning all her notes were on PINK paper ( always on white ) and she wore a baby blue and white traditional dress, a la' Alice in Wonderland. Yes, she looked like Alice. She wore red 4 out of 5 days last week, also. Now, who wears red that frequently during a Satanic celebration period, other than Satanists? To boot, Savannah also got her Masters from ((( Georgetown ))) and hails from Australia. Her biography is replete with red flags as well &gt;&gt;

            What bothered me (reason I backed off) was the researchers seemed hell bent on interpreting Spokeo results wrong; attributing every single name associated to an address as a current resident, and decided they were all children.  I have a pay Spokeo account, and tried on a different dig to explain how Spokeo results should be read.  But some folks, they refuse to see logic.  I got disgusted with them, took my pay Spokeo account and went home.

             That was a very high stress time on this board. Lots of disinfo spamming, lots of Voat bugginess that made people paranoid, lots of leftover paranoia from all the Reddit suppression and MSM attacks. Things are better now.

              I think it might have been the houses neighboring the New Home Academy.  Across the street.  I don’t know what more I can do, what I did at the time was look at other people’s comments, then looked up the addresses myself and realized they were not only wrong, but totally wrong. Not a single thought was given to who owned the homes just LOOK AT ALL THOSE NAMES. You can’t help people like that.  I’m a professional internet researcher, since 2002. I’ve learned that that the
              <em>
               wronger
              </em>
              a person is, the less likely it is they will listen.  So, I didn’t save any of the info and don’t have the addresses.  The only way I know it’s the same dig was the New Hope name and the assumption that the kids must be living in neighboring homes.  A proper dig would look up the owners of the homes, public records, easy, and not assume all the names at Spokeo are kids, and that they all live there at the same time.

                I really don’t remember if I posted, DM someone in private, or just walked away.  I am willing to give it another go and be more vocal this time.  I suspect i just looked at the conclusions, rolled my eyes and walked away.  Internet research can’t be done on assumptions.  We are held to a very high standard BECAUSE it’s the Internet. Considering you have pinged the original researchers, I’m sure it will come up again.  I’ll try to keep an eye on this thread....

                 It would be great if you could find the time and will to do this, Lynnwiod. Our enemies rely on us growing discouraged and divided and giving up. Together, we can prevail, but as you said, it takes discipline and fortitude. :-)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Looking forward to your perspective!
