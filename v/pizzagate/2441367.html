</ul>
<p>Jessica Simpson and Hewitt both had &quot;relationships&quot; with <a href="https://okmagazine.com/news/jessica-simpson-slams-john-mayers-sexual-napalm-comments/">John Mayer</a>, as did <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1860353">Katy Perry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2: Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p>At age 10, after winning a Little Miss competition, talent scouts recommended that Hewitt move to LA to pursue acting and singing. Her classmates then included <strong>Jonathan Neville</strong>, who became a &quot;talent scout&quot; and recommended her for the show Party of Five.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> She joined Party of Five at age 15. Does anyone start working as a talent scout at 15?  
</p>
<p>In LA, Hewitt lived at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OVzXXb4Z9A">Oakwood Apartments</a>, which have been discussed in other posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1595551">Spielberg</a> at Oakwood</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>3. First role: Kids Incorporated</strong> (Disney)</p>
<p>Corroborated sexual abuse by producers, with co-star <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a91275/fergie-reveals-drug-conspiracy-theories/">Stacy Ferguson</a> (<a href="https://hollywoodstreetking.com/fergie-back-on-that-stuff/">Fergie</a>):</p>

<p>At this time, producer Tommy Lynch also made a TV special for <strong>Andrew Dice Clay.</strong> Dice was a raunchy comedian, best known for his pornographic <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Andrew+Dice+Clay%2527s+Nursery+Rhymes">&quot;nursery rhymes&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>In 1994, Lynch created <strong>The Secret World of Alex Mack.</strong> Though a children\'s show, it became well known for <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/flashback/the-secret-life-of-alex-mack-had-one-big-problem/news-story/eb9e4b5703da301e1b620a1f83452d16">creepy themes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In the pilot, when 12-year-old Alex morphed back into a human after a stint as goo, <em>she was naked&quot;.</em></li>
<li>&quot;In one episode, Alex got a duplicate, who among other things, <em>nearly killed her</em> by trapping her in some clogged plumbing and waiting for her to either suffocate or... &quot;</li>
<li>Lynch begged Larisa Oleynik (Alex Mack) to stay on the show, offering her <em>a feature film</em> and a ton of money. But Oleynik left saying she was &quot;burnt out&quot;. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actress <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jessica-alba-on-sin-city-typecasting-and-how-homophobia-pushed-her-away-from-the-church">Jessica Alba</a> also began her career with Lynch/The Secret World of Alex Mack.</p>
<p><strong>4. Music: Jive records</strong></p>
<p>Hewitt\'s managers created a successful &quot;overseas&quot; career for her as a singer, the &quot;success&quot; of which depended on her keeping quiet. Hewitt\'s first album, <strong>Love Songs,</strong> was released by the Japanese label <strong>Meldac</strong> when she was 13.</p>
<p>She released two subsequent albums called <a href="https://www.music-bazaar.com/album-images/vol1002/258/258335/1991366-big/Let-S-Go-Bang-2-picture.jpg">Let\'s Go Bang</a> and BareNaked.</p>
<p>BareNaked was on Jive Records, the same label as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2225344">Backstreet Boys</a>, Britney Spears and NSYNC.</p>
<p><strong>5. TV: Party of Five</strong></p>
<p>Hewitt joined Party of Five at age 15 to play Sarah Reeves. She apparently carried on a poorly disguised relationship with <a href="http://forums.thefashionspot.com/showpost.php?p=9342585&amp;postcount=653">at least one adult</a> making the show.</p>
<p><strong>6. Movies:</strong></p>
