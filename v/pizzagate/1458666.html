            Where did I state that that this is a p.c. issue? I'm saying it's a problem of focus. We need to be focused on what we have and what is provable. Are you saying only Jews are pedophiles? No? So why focus on Jews? Is Alefantis Jewish? Podesta? Clinton?

            No, this post is more of a pragmatic point. Whether or not there is a 'Jewish cabal' is irrelevant because talking about it in the context of this investigation is counter-productive. So far all the Occult Satanist Jew stuff has contributed nothing of substance in terms of leads, and turns away people on the fence about this whole thing.

            It seems like you might be experiencing cognitive dissonance as you attempt to integrate new information into your prior assumptions of reality. Remember what aristotle said: it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea without accepting it to be true.

            Look, as far as Satanism is concerned, I can personally verify the existence of Satanic covens. They believe in creating maximum pain and suffering in the uninitiated. They are similar to con men, they will work in teams on unsuspecting "marks" to try to drive them either mad or to suicide. That is how they gain "points" among each other. The thing is, they are also doing it to one another, blackmailing each other into performing more and more humiliating tasks until as a group their malice and desperation is at maximum. I know these people. Do not doubt.

              The more and more I think about this shit and look back on my life and friends, the closer the movie "The Lost Boys" seems to hit. When you have rebels and outcasts that are then preyed upon by high ranking people in the community that no one would expect or believe. Nobody really knows anything because everything is based in lies and manipulations. Everybody is eventually used up and thrown away.

              I'm not going to say my location, but these are my friends that I grew up with and my regular social group. Satanists target outcast type people and slowly convert them. It's all taken in irony but not really. It's also kept secret. The people on the fringes think it's a joke, but the values slowly change. I would call "Satanism" anti-humanism. A type of non-consensual S &amp; M.

            I think it is important that we keep the discussion primarily geared towards powerful people/Washington insiders engaging in sex crimes and money laundering, and we need to show that these are not isolated incidents.

            How you can claim to be Catholic  -- I too am Catholic -- and not understand that satan is real is beyond me.   If you believe in a supernatural God, is it really too much of a stretch to understand that preternatural evil also exists?

            Catechism, my dude.   You are seriously lacking it.  Get you a catechism and read it from start to finish.  Then read the Bible.  Then come back here and post.

                Ugh.  Well, on the plus side....maybe by 'fake news' he means the mainstream media?

                Promise you that orthodox Catholics are not thrilled with these statements from Holy Father.

               <p>
                And if the Pope has 'gone rogue', let's just say it wouldn't be the first time in history (Borgias).  I am praying for him though and he is still my Pope.  I will respect the office, even if not the man.

             Thanks for your input. At least you're not calling me a shill! (What I feared would happen,) maybe there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamt in my philosophy. But there are so many conspiracy theories out there, we can't just believe them all, can we? You need to be selective in some ways.

               I'm not talking about end-times prophecy, and I'm quite serious. I'm asking you to show that you know what you are talking about, regarding your accusation against  Skanda.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to these two verses a single being caused David to number Israel. In one verse this being is called YHWH (the LORD) and in the other he is called Satan. If you actually understand the material that the OP is talking  (i.e. Satanism and Judaism) about then you should be able to explain this how these two verses can refer to the same being. If not then an apology is in order.

               <p>
                There is no conflict here (between the two verses).  At least, theologically there is not.
               </p>
               <p>
                You noticed I used 'supernatural' to describe God earlier and 'preternatural' to describe satan.  That because satan is a creature (fallen angel), and is NOT equal in any way (being, essence, substance, etc.) to God.  God is above all and created all, invisible and visible.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the two verses you mention, yes, while describing the same event, they show the difference between God's sovereign will (nothing happens without His permission) versus His moral will (not everything that happens is what He morally approves or wants).  We're in deep theological waters here.
               </p>
               <p>
                These verses showcase the distinction perfectly though:  God is
                <em>
                 permitting
                </em>
                satan to tempt David.  In the other verse, we see the result or manifestation of that divine permission, the tempting.  The Hebrew language is idiomatic (have researched) and it can be translated 'to permit'.
               </p>
               <p>
                This apparent contradiction is, in a sense, good news.  It means that evil is on a leash and can only go so far as (though researching pizzagate could make one question that; this is truly mindboggling and heartwrenching evil here).
               </p>
               <p>
                Mercifully, though this does show that God limits the amount of damage that we can do to ourselves or that even fallen angels can do to us.  Evil is not exponential, (though I think we can see even with pizzagate here where if it were not for the hand of God to stem the tide of it, it would/could become so).
               </p>
               <p>
                Does this make God the 'author' of evil?  (If that is what you are asking?).  EMPHATICALLY NO.
               </p>
               <p>
                Because God allowed free will and freedom of choice (instead of creating automatons), both angels and humans are subject to making wrong choices and choosing to do evil.
               </p>
               <p>
                Evil is a human/angelic construct (fallen angels, but still), therefore, not a divine one.
               </p>
               <p>
                Specifically, angels are on a binary system -- the are either angelic and with the redeemed or they fall.  Because of the nature of angels (their ability to perceive with intellect all options of a given situation), once they have fallen, they are lost forever.
               </p>
               <p>
                Humans, because of our nature, have a different chance.  Even if/when we have fallen and chosen to do what is evil, we have the ability to repent, to amend, or to course-correct through the power of the Cross.
               </p>
               <p>
                Though researching this pizzagate stuff certainly is beyond the scope of my ability to comprehend  the depths of such evil and it challenges me very much emotionally, it does not challenge me spiritually  other than an increased urgency to fight it, expose it, and stop it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Evil exists because humans, tempted and encouraged by preternatrual evil beings we call demons, CHOOSE EVIL .  I will repeat that:  humans of their OWN FREE WILL, turn from God and CHOOSE EVIL.
               </p>
               <p>
                I hope this is helpful?
               </p>
               <p>
                May God strengthen and bless us all on here as we seek to expose this grave evil in our country.

            Every time someone mentions "Satanism" I take it as an elite behaving in a manner that rejects all societal or theological concepts of morality.  They're not Levayan, they don't care about Satanic scripture, they just think they're above all of the ants and their rules.  I'd guess more of them are pagan by way of belief than Satanic.

             Ok that makes sense! If that is what is meant by it, then I am fully ready to embrace that term as a designation for these evil pedophiles. I just don't believe in magic and such things.

             Exactly. The whole satanism thing stems from the fact that in the bible it describes Satan's followers as being big into ritual sacrifice. The fact that Moloch worship came from Babylon which was ruled by evil people people  who sacrificed there own children has striking similarities to our own situation. They want a one world government. They are trying to bring about the second coming of Babylon. These are all facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why Satanism isn't really that far fetched. Even if these people think they aren't worshiping Satan the bible says otherwise.

              The relationship between Satanism and sacrifice is hinted at in Job chapter 1 and also in Genesis 15.

              Babylon has always been with us, as empire and as confusion of language. We've now reached the point where the false security of empire (eg Operation Gladio and Gladio B) has resulted in irreconcilable social differences in Europe. The one world government agenda was set back firstly by Brexit and secondly by Trump's electoral success, we are now in a time of profound changes.
