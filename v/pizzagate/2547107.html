            , unfortunately we don't allow unsourced discussion threads per Rule 2...please add a link to an example of what you are talking about. Please review our policy on how to format posts linking to potentially dangerous content as well (in the sidebar). Thanks. Reply to this comment when you've edited, so we can remove the flair.

            Up voat. This is nearly as shameful/despicable as crimes against children, IMO. While it is a stretch to classify the elderly as ‘innocent’, they are still dependent and often helpless. They can be scammed in numerous ways: their pensions and social security, their medications and any assets they have...

            Goldiggers got my grampa and offed him for about a million bucks. There was nothing we could do. I was in my 20s, distracted, partying/chasing girls. He got bored watching tv all the time; started socializing with the neighbor lady. She cooked him dinner a few times... next thing you know, their getting married.... move away... her third (fourth?) husband. Then he’s in some kinda medicated stupor for a couple of weeks... and kicks the bucket. Conveniently, his will was rewritten days before.

            I tried typing it in on Twitter but no success.  Of course, I am really bad at that.  Just wondering if anyone else has tried it and with what results.  They will try anything to spread their filth.  Remember when Bernie Supporters were getting CP attached on their FB?  These SM sites are Highly Suspect.  They need to clean up.

              Wow.   I am sure you are quite use to it, although it's pretty frightening.  Hope it clears up.  But if it is as you say, then I certainly can believe it.  APS is a Cc of CPS.  They evidently thought CPS was a success so why not move ahead with another Kidnap Org. When 1 is working so well for them, why not two.

                How about starting a Lawsuit Fund.  A huge amount for a Class Action by a whole group of people harmed by CPS &amp; APS.  These people do not have money and are usually poor, which is why they choose them.  So sorry that must be scary now being near there.  We never know where it will hit.  Bless you for making those copies available.

                 I like that idea. I started a PAC in Texas a while back, but nobody ever helped me with it so I just file $0 reports every six months. We could easily do the same in every state if we had enough people.

                  Yes, but getting people to take this on is the problem.  Everyone is always too busy.  I would def dox myself due to past statements.  I know there are non profits that you can start funds with.  Someone I know was looking into them for another purpose.  They do not collect a percentage.

            Oh Yes!  This is happening.  Here is a story from Medical Kidnap on Adult Protective Services
            <a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/2016/04/27/elder-medical-kidnapping-in-texas-results-in-abuse-and-death-of-elderly-mother/">
             https://medicalkidnap.com/2016/04/27/elder-medical-kidnapping-in-texas-results-in-abuse-and-death-of-elderly-mother/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            After her release from the hospital on March 15, 2014, to another facility to continue her physical therapy, Darrell found that his mother was not being attended to according to the planned rehabilitation guidelines from Methodist. In fact, he states that the plan was ignored, and that his mother was placed on anti-psychotic drugs from her first day in the facility:
           </p>
           <p>
            Mom was discharged from Charlton Methodist Hospital to Select Specialty Long Term Acute Care (LTAC). The attacks of over drugging with medications that mom is not supposed to be taking, mistakes, and neglect began day 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            By March 31, 2014, my mother had already lost ten pounds or more. I told the charge nurse T.J. Flanagan that I’m taking mom to the E.R.  (NOTE: I was told by other nurses Flanagan was Charge nurse, but other staff said she wasn’t.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Things went from bad to worse.  She kept losing weight and her drugs went from 3 to 6 to 8 and the care went down hill.  I will let you read the story. But I will continue with how APS treated her after she finally returned home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Miller was finally able to bring his mother home, but their peace would be interrupted by police visits brought on by allegations of abuse, neglect, and threats by APS personnel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Miller was finally able to bring his mother home, but their peace would be interrupted by police visits brought on by allegations of abuse, neglect, and threats by APS personnel.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problems only escalated and she was given more drubs with a gross list of side effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Millers went through many tribulations. With Mrs. Miller so heavily medicated that she could not communicate, her voice could only be heard through the constant complaints of her loving son, Darrell. Mr. Miller even describes meeting one doctor, twice, who would turn out to be a different doctor at his second encounter as the misinformation continued:
           </p>
           <p>
            Numerous side effects were notated in the allegedly forged doctor’s report submitted by Darrell. However, the side effects were not attributed to the medication, but were again attributed to Darrell’s inability to care for his mother. These drugs were administered despite warnings from the FDA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over $100,000 in Excessive Billing for Unnecessary Treatment – Estate Targeted?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does the system then use these symptoms as fodder in their reports to take medical  guardianship of the patients?  Darrell tells us that the insurance company reviewed the care given in VIBRA LTAC facility and refused to pay for what they deemed “unnecessary treatment” for 31 days between May and June of 2014. But the LTAC wasted no time billing Darrell’s mother $172,000.00 for care she did not need.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this the end game sought by medical practitioners? According to the federal government, the estates of deceased people cannot file bankruptcy for excessive bills and keep their homes.
           </p>

            Mother Finally Dies From Overdosing and Excessive Drugging
           </p>
           <p>
            They are corrupt. They wanted me to lose it so they could kill me or imprison me. (I sound like I’m crazy, but I think we both(all) know I’m supposed to sound crazy.)
           </p>
           <p>
            My mom was kidnapped, tortured … by APS (Adult Protective Services). This was done to cover up medical malpractice and place the blame for their abuse as ‘neglect’ on Charlton Methodist Hospital and myself (when it was APS who was at fault).

             Study the effects of benzodiazipam..
Corrupt doctors ...
When they administer benzos like clamazipam...mess up the braking system of tye brain ..ie GABA receptors..
..they mess up the dopamine receptor balance ...dopamine is like ur accelerator pedal..+ gearing system...they mess that up with resperadol...
Its like ur carefully brain balance lever system between braking and accelerant ...is extended and kept at its extreme points....
Then ur body when the drug is stopped or reduced sudddenly goes into withdrawal and asks for more..
The patient goes from being anxiety prone ..to bipolar ..to schizophrenic...
Its well understood by the psychiatric system..
Just curious..what was ur mother administered intially...
..
My sister went through this..had just a sleeping problem and then they progressed her to bipolar..
..hemp oil without thc ..and hemp smoothies ..helped..becuase the cannabinoid receptors are ur handbreak ..system..

              I am going to include Nancy's story here.

              Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer may have known more about State-sponsored kidnappings than any other politician in the United States before she was murdered in March of 2010. Her published report, The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services, is reproduced below. It was the basis for many lectures and interviews she gave on the topic. She claims the report caused her to lose her Senate seat in the Georgia State Senate, but she stated:
             </p>
             <pre><code>However, there are causes worth losing over.
</code></pre>
             <p>
              This cause was so big however, that there are some who believe she lost more than just her job. They believe she lost her very life.
             </p>
             <p>
              On March 26, 2010, police from Habersham County Georgia reported that they found Nancy Schaefer and her husband Bruce Schaefer dead in their home. The official report was that it was a murder suicide, and that Bruce Schaefer had killed his wife and then turned his .38-caliber handgun on himself. Their daughter reportedly found them in their bedroom, and investigators say they discovered a suicide note, as well as notes to each of the couple’s five children.

                In the article I posted she has an interview with A Jones.
               </p>
               <p>
                Alex Jones asked her if there were “bounties on the heads of children” and Mrs. Schaefer said “yes,” and that in fact just the day before she had learned that “an order” had come in to a CPS office stating what kind of child someone wanted to adopt.

              I know her story.  She was and still is an American Patriot.  And her husband too.  Medical Kidnap always carries her story in their Side Bar.  What we must do is start talking about these agencies  CPS and APS to friends and relatives and also spread on other sites and blogs.  We must spread what they are doing to take away their power.  CPS and APS should both be Shut Down.  We would be better off without them until a replacement can be found.  They do not offer any real help for Children or the Elderly.

               Truth!! I printed out that article and made several copies and posted it on my front door for free in case APS ever shows up... Unfortunately, I have parents who are minutes from the location of the APS that murdered the elderly woman from the link you posted. Close to home.

                Oh my God.  How strange.  I am worried for people I know.  They will be warned.  If anything this CPS and APS is a great way to red pill about the govt. and what they are doing.  This may lead the way to people waking up about trafficking.  There seem to be more articles about SRA as well.
