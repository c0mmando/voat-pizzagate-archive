<p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- The U.S. State Department has begun a community policing program
 in Haiti that aims to strengthen ties between officers and the neighbourhoods they patrol.</p>
<p>Stuart Smith, director of the U.S. Bureau of Intl Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs,
 said Friday that the program hopes that by building trust with police, residents will share information
 about crime and other matters.</p>
<p>The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has contributed between
 $15 and $20 million annually toward security programs in Haiti the past five years, Smith said.

            The Model used for Community Policing is from Racine, Wisconsin which has deep ties to the Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            Community Policing is the way they will enforce The Mark of the Beast which are microchips.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first American company to begin chip implants for employees was just announced in Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            ”The end goal is to get everybody chipped, to control the whole society, to have the bankers and the elite people control the world.”–Nick Rockefeller [Aaron Russo interview]
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin is the ROOT and MODEL for the real agenda beyond U.N. Agenda 2030 - Total Global Enslavement.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why Paul Ryan was on the plane with Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, why he was picked for VP with Mitt Romney (LDS), and why he is the most powerful political figure in the U.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shine the light on Racine. Good work

            This landmark experiment showed that routine patrol had no significant effect on crime rates, citizens fear of crimes or citizens satisfaction of police services. The results of this experiment repudiated a tradition prevailing in police work for over 150 yrs.  This was from the Kansas City Police Chief.  THIS is  problems have been escalating year after year.  Everyone knows that the policeman on the beat and on the corner and the patrol car riding around in your neighborhood made us feel safer, and deterred the burglars from committing crimes.  They have bamboozled the public into believing their claptrap. Wonderful Post
