<p>I, I, I love little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so good</p>
<p>I love, little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so bad</p>
<p>When they\'re around</p>
<p>They make me feel</p>
<p>Like I\'m the only guy in town</p>
<p>I love, little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so good</p>
<p>They don\'t care if I\'m a one-way mirror</p>
<p>They\'re not frightened by my cold exterior</p>
<p>They don\'t, ask me questions</p>
<p>They don\'t, want to scold me</p>
<p>They don\'t, look for answers</p>
<p>They just, want to hold me</p>
<p>Isn\'t this fun?</p>
<p>Isn\'t this what life\'s all about?</p>
<p>Isn\'t this a dream come true?</p>
<p>Isn\'t this a nightmare too?</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh I love little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so good</p>
<p>I love, little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so, bad</p>
<p>When they\'re around</p>
<p>They make me feel</p>
<p>Like I\'m the only guy in town
I
 love, little girls</p>
<p>They make me feel so, good</p>
<p>They don\'t care about my inclinations</p>
<p>They\'re not frightened by my revelations</p>
<p>Uh oh (uh oh), take a second (take a second)</p>
<p>Uh oh (uh oh), it\'s a mistake (it\'s a mistake)</p>
<p>Uh oh (uh oh), I\'m in trouble (I\'m in trouble)</p>
<p>Uh oh (uh oh), the little girl was just too little </p>
<p>Too little, too little, too little, too little</p>
<p>Isn\'t this what life\'s all about?</p>
<p>Isn\'t this a dream come true?</p>
<p>Isn\'t this a nightmare too?
And I don\'t care, what people say</p>
<p>And I don\'t care, what people think</p>
<p>And I don\'t care, how I look</p>
<p>When I\'m down my street</p>
<p>They make me feel so--</p>
<p>I love, little girls&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Slightly mortified? Sorry. With lines like “They don\'t care about my one-way mirror / They\'re not frightened by my cold exterior” and the (hideously catchy) chorus hook, it’s a pretty disturbing song and video, imagining a predator living in a house seemingly designed by M.C. Escher and inhabited by voyeuristic dwarves in smart-casual attire. Several little girls visit, pillow fighting with the character, restraining him, kissing him and floating in some kind of void.&quot;</p>
<p>They mention how Grammy-winning composer Danny Elfman who wrote the song. Elfman, when asked why he wrote the song said </p>
<p>&quot;What made me write it? At that point I was just grabbing onto things that popped up in my head and taking characters and singing from their point of view. So whether it be the right wing guy talking about capitalism or the feisty little girl or quasi molester - these were just things that I thought were funny or interesting and I would just kind of jump into the skin of. Often things I wrote were motivated by nothing but the newspaper. I’d read an article and be thinking about something and write a song from that perspective. So it didn’t necessarily reflect me…but it was just fun and I knew it was irreverent. I was out to offend everybody when I started out. Any subject matter I could find that would be offensive I was embracing, so that was just one.”</p>
<p>They show a still image from the music video. In it a man is kissing a little girl. </p>

            Thx for bringing this guy to our attention!
           </p>
           <p>
            The video on youtube starts with him looking into water and a devil face on the water surface. His inner demon? Water portal to summon evil?
           </p>
           <p>
            He is also friends with Tim Burton(friends with satanist Johnny Depp and director of Alice in WL) and made amongst others the music for Charlie and chocolate factory. 
We know that another hollywood composer, freemason and alleged pedo Christian Kriegeskotte
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2387245">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2387245
            </a>
            did also compose for that movie. Interesting right? 
But the creepiest thing is  this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Danny Elfmans brother made a bizarre movie called "Forbidden Zone" in 1980 with all kinds of occult symbolism including dominos.
This is the movie description on imdb:
            <strong>
             "The bizarre and musical tale of a girl who travels to another dimension through the gateway found in her family's basement."
            </strong>
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080752/">
             http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080752/
            </a>
            And Danny himself plays the devil in the movie. Here is the trailer:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjN4Ysdc69w">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjN4Ysdc69w
            </a>
            and it starts with saying "just keep telling yourself its only a movie"   hahahaha this shit is getting too weird now. Im out.
