Then we can match the photo\'s, certainly there are photos of ALL the Andrew Kline\'s on google and if someone printed those photos they could walk into Besta-Pizza and casually ask, which guy is the owner of this place.

            BINGO
My records I found that the entire block is owned by a CONNEB Ii LLC, which I'm finding is a construction firm out of Saudi Arabia, this guy ABDEL RAHMAN could be the front man who has been working with CLINTONS since BILL WAS PRESIDENT.  Forward this information to blueberry.

            All the property's appear to be rented,and sold to Andrew Kline in 2003 for Zero Dollars, ... or something like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only theory is that somebody has given ANDREW KLINE power of atorney over all this property, we need to see the title and see who is the real owner, the entire block is all  owned by same person, but we did find records showing all was sold in 2003 for zero-dollars, it would be good to see WHO bought the block before that, both sides of the street.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm now finding that the strawman behind everything is this

           <p>
            CONNEB Ii, LLC is the owner of record as of 2003, and I believe the SAUDIS own the entire block, or transferred it to Andrew KLINE, and it would make more sense that it would be the DOJ KLINE as we're talking 10's of Millions of dollars of real-estate for FREE.

            Who is Jimmy Coment?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the first step is just consistently use the same names.
           </p>
           <p>
            The inquiry was about James Alefantis, who allegedly had an instagram ( now deleted ) where he called himself "Jimmy Comet"
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is, does he OWN the BERLIN Diner or NOT, in my mind he doesn't as he couldn't have been in two places at once working his ass of in 2012. The article makes it appear he spent a long time just having 'fun' in Berlin before he decided to make a diner for late night eating, e.g. pancake &amp; steak at 6am before you sleep, this sounds like the life of a partier, or playboy on parent trust-fund, hardly a middle-class guy working his ass off running two restaurants in DC,
           </p>
           <p>
            IMHO NOT same person.

            As someone who works as a manager at a normal pizza place (sad that I have to clarify that my business
            <em>
             isn't
            </em>
            a satanic sex trafficking shell for cannibals), we get a ton of calls on Monday morning for the owner, mostly bill collectors and telemarketers, but also from several of our suppliers and big customers. Lot of phone traffic early in the week concerning finances, logistics, supply, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if someone, hypothetically, were to cold call any of those businesses, you would want to make it look like you were part of the business's usual chain of activity; call early in the week, ask for the owner (you don't even have to ask by name), make it sound like you work with them on the regular. Figure out when they get their Coca Cola order, if coke delivers to them on Wednesday, call them on Monday and pretend to sell them some Coke Zero (they fuckin' love to sell that shit over the phone).
           </p>
           <p>
            The more inconspicuous you are, the more you blend in with what should normally take place at a pizza place, the less likely you are to blow it. If you call up to their shop and ask the guy if he owns a pizza joint, it's going to raise flags... and judging by how ghost-like these dudes are, I wouldn't be surprised if they dip out and change hands.

             I was thinking more for a walk-in, at this point the call's a dead end these ppl are paranoid, as you see in the comet-pizza walk-in the guys were asked to leave within 10 minutes by local cops
            </p>
            <p>
             More is coming out, it turns out that Andrew Kline owns many of these business on the block
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think much flags, pizza places are casual, if your a customer, your not rude, your just curios who really owns the place, ...
            </p>
            <p>
             It's odd that nobody has made a video of other biz, or done much walking around; too much focus on comet-ping pong, most likely because alefantis was flamboyant and that attracted more 4chan interest, he had web, he had instagram, sort of like flys on shit went to pizza-comet
            </p>
            <p>
             Now we're finding out that almost all of these are tied to andrew kline and not 5021 can do corpse-disposal with caustics and drainage, and 5029 is besta-pizza
 Conneb II LLC, H Gill &amp; Son - sold all on 2003, for $0 ( zero dollars )
