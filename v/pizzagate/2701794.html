<p>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — For more than a decade, a conservative Catholic diocese in Nebraska was the only church in the U.S. that refused to participate in annual reviews of sexual misconduct that were a key reform enacted in the wake of the Boston clergy abuse scandal.</p>
<p>the Diocese of Lincoln is now paying the price for its unwillingness to change and lack of transparency.</p>
<p>Accusers have been coming forward in recent weeks with allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by clergy in Nebraska, and the diocese is facing a potential criminal investigation and criticism that it mishandled abusive priests even as it should have been subjected to increased scrutiny after the Boston scandal.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2015, leaders of the Lincoln diocese refused to participate in annual audits designed to uncover sex abuse allegations and gauge how well church officials were complying with child-protection policies. Church leaders called the audits a pointless endeavor that assumed wrongdoing by the diocese and its priests, but one of the bishops during that period knew of at least two allegations against priests...   
</p>
<p>“I think the closed nature of the diocese made this worse,” said a member of the  Call to Action Group.  Even if the audits never revealed anything — and I think they probably would have — it still shows an unwillingness to be open.”</p>
<p>The Nebraska Ag’s  office has spoken with at least two accusers and urged others to come forward about abuse in the diocese. Lincoln police are also investigating a priest accused of having an “emotionally inappropriate, non-sexual relationship” with a 19-year-old male altar server that involved alcohol in 2017, church officials said.</p>
<p>A Lincoln police spokesman confirmed the investigation but declined to comment further. On Wednesday, the diocese unveiled a new, anonymous hotline and website to take complaints.</p>

<p>The scandals come amid accusations that Pope Francis was complicit in the face of sex-abuse allegations against a former high-ranking cardinal in Washington, D.C., and a grand jury investigation that identified more than 1,000 child victims in Pennsylvania.</p>',

             i'm a twenty-six year old named brandon michael henry who was born in fort scott, ks to stephen michael henry + jessica jane henry (01/10/1966) / davis. i currently reside in omaha, nebraska + am trained as a graphic designer.
            </p>
            <p>
             my father passed away when i was six years old from a failed kidney transplant. my mother is a drug addict + a satanic witch. she has been addicted to meth since she was sixteen years old + that is how my grandfather Dr. George B. Henry a renowned mason in the Iola, KS area (obituary for reference:
             <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40716375/george-b.-henry">
              https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40716375/george-b.-henry
             </a>
             ) took advantage of the situation + the ritualistic abuse began.
            </p>
            <p>
             i have many memories of my "cousins" (whose parents were also drug addicts) + i being photographed in the bath tub + other compromising positions. i remember he had a green tile walk-in shower built in his home as well + would abuse us in it as well as across the street. my mother + her boyfriend for many years, joseph beamen, would even sell my brother + i for drugs. much of this was done for access to drugs. i even recall my brother + i being left in a car in the middle of nowhere overnight for the police to find us + abuse us. i now believe this was intentionally set up.
            </p>
            <p>
             my brother is incarcerated + has severe mental issues due to our childhood abuse + bc my mother's drug use was much heavier during her pregnancy with him. his name is darren logan henry (03/03/1993) + he is currently locked up in shawnee county jail in topeka, ks. KDOC# 0104886 (
             <a href="https://kdocrepository.doc.ks.gov/kasper/search/xml?kdocNumber=0104886">
              https://kdocrepository.doc.ks.gov/kasper/search/xml?kdocNumber=0104886)
             </a>
             )
            </p>
            <p>
             when i went home to kansas a few weeks ago my mother prepared food for me, biscuits + gravy, and the gravy was brown...looking back i should have questioned but i didn't. days later there were marks all over my arms indicative of a bacterial infection. when i went to the emergency room for this + heart palpitations they claimed i was "dehydrated" yet never even hooked me up to an IV. i asked my mom later about the gravy + she acted shocked. when she was here "helping" me move she also spread some sort of weird smelling bacteria all over one of my towels + tried to say it was her "jergons natural glow" so i would wash it with all of my other towels. freemasons have been sneaking into my home every time i leave + placing bacteria in the sink of my kitchen + in my bathroom. i recently cleaned my apartment after only living here for one week and found many odd bacterial + fungal things smelling awful in my kitchen + bathroom as previously stated. i have installed a front door camera + they can somehow edit it or something + still enter. i know this all sounds so far-fetched but that is what they want. they want you to think that i am crazy or on drugs + i swear to the highest, most divine god, the father of jesus christ that i am not making any of this up or exaggerating. i have learned within the past few months that truth is truly stranger than fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
             i have issues with my sinuses + could not smell for a long time, come to find out, they were even placing this bacteria on my sandals so people at my workplace would judge me + not want to be my friend / cause me embarrassment + shame. the tactic for months was to drive me to suicide but i realize that i am here to serve a higher purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
             prior to this year i was 350lbs, i believe over-eating was obviously a coping mechanism from early childhood trauma, but further than that, entities have been sent to me through my grandmother who was married to the aforementioned George B. Henry to worsen the situation. i even had my gallbladder removed roughly a year ago. basically, any avenue that could compromise my health in any way has been taken. this summer when i visited her i awoke to a very warm feeling over my root chakra, and from my understanding, this was an entity attaching itself / entering my aura. since then i had perverse sexual thoughts + depression. i have since cleared it though.
            </p>
            <p>
             my mother came to stay with me last october for a few weeks since she had nowhere to go after a meth binge + guilted me into it, and i didn't realize at the time why, but she spread water all over the walls of my shower (it did not have tile on the walls). this was to try + give me black mold poisoning. at my old apartment all of the drains also became clogged very frequently with bacteria + various other things. recently, in my new place, i came home to my toothbrush smelling like urine / the toilet. i also had a sage stick in the bathroom + it wreaked of urine as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             being raised by my grandmother was not a pleasant experience, she owned "SystemWorks" a company affiliated with the district court of Shawnee County in Topeka, KS. she retired somewhere around 2005. she was beyond physically + emotionally abusive, i believe satanists further abuse victims as a means of control + because they are serving their "master" if there is terror, fear, and sadness being injected into another. there should be records of her being reported to CPS for beating me with a metal pole when i was fifteen years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             from my understanding, i was born as livestock to my family, just a sex slave to be used + abused, then tossed away. my life is not worth anything to them, in fact, i am a liability. you may wonder why i have continued relationships with them up until the past month, which i am unsure about as well...it's almost like a sick dynamic in therapy we called it triangulating. almost like an addiction. it is a constant between my grandma, my mom + i. further than that, my grandmother is a multi-millionaire + uses money to control me / keep me a part of her life as well as using love spells i believe.
            </p>
            <p>
             i realized that i was abused most of my life but once i came forward about all of it to my family last october, before realizing they were so heavily involved too, things have only gotten worse little by little.
            </p>
            <p>
             prior to last october though, in april of 2011 i had a car accident which i believe heavy black magic was involved in. again, in february of 2012 an entity entered into my body + took far too many pills. as it was happening i was extremely conscious of the fact that i was not the one taking these pills. this was shortly after i had asked my grandmother if she worshipped satan + she did not respond. we have never spoken of it since. after this i ended up running my car off of the highway in yet another car accident but somehow survived.

            <p>
             i believe judge bullock of shawnee kansas also abused me several times, among other people of whom i do not have the full names of. i was involved in rituals + i remember hiding with my grandma sally (birthdate 01/17/1938) in the dead of the night in the prairie once bc they saw a car coming.
            </p>
            <p>
             someone said i should state all of the details, dates etc that i can so this is me trying to do this. there is obviously more to report + say but as of now this is what i have. perhaps if this is approved i will reply with further information in the comments. i am formulating a plan but need to protect myself + get my story out in the meantime.

            I don't know much about the diocese of Lincoln, but Call to Action is not a legit or trustworthy source. They are a cabal group that seeks to tear down a lot of Church doctrine. They also have an axe to grind with the diocese they are attacking, which excommunicated members of the organization.

            UPVoat!  Thank you for bringing this up.  There is no end to the sexual abuse debacle,  it is like the mafia rat lines.  All of it is connected somehow.  This Bishop, that Cardinal, they are all moved around causing horrible sexual abuse through their coverups.  The more they coverup the more they are kicked up to High Level Positions.  This stuff is making me sick.

            I am going to sound like a babbling idiot.  I have a horrid headache and am feeling sick and nauseous not from an illness but from reading what you just put in this post for it reminded me of Blase Cupich and his connection to Omaha Neb. being born there and his connections to Spokane Wa. and the Morning Star Boys Farm.  Also it took me to a case in Chicago where he is Bishop and a priest with the Claretians named Wellems who molested a boy of 5 when he was 15 and Cupich is letting him work in the the Mexican Community with children. This guy Wellems also was in Neb. for a while and had connections to Boys Town.   Cupich and others claim since the abuse happened before Wellems was ordained a priest, it does not count.  I have not done the math yet on this, but Wellems also went to college in Spokane.  What is the chance he was there when Cupich was.  I truthfully believe all this has some kind of crazy connection even though Cupich is a liberal and your diocese article is  about conservatives.  They may have some differences, but they all are on the same page when it comes to coverups.  I am at another time when I think I will need to take a rest.  This stuff is making me physically ill.  I can't even right now.  I want to Barf.

            Many of the new allegations in Lincoln focus on the actions of the Rev. James Benton, a 71-year-old priest who retired last year despite church leaders knowing about abuse allegations against him for at least 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Stan Schulte, a 37-year-old chiropractor in Lincoln, said Benton, his uncle, molested him at a rectory sleepover in the early 1990s when he was a boy. Another Lincoln man, Jeffrey Hoover, reported a similar experience with Benton during a camping trip in the early 1980s while he and the priest slept in the same bed.
Church officials said they didn’t have enough evidence to pursue charges. Benton has not been charged with a crime, although the two men have spoken with an investigator from the Nebraska ag’s office.

            A diocese spokesman, the Rev. Nick Kipper, said church officials would not comment.
Hoover said he reported his experience to a priest in 1997 and directly to then-Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz in 2002. Schulte notified the diocese in 2017 and said he probably would not have been molested if the diocese had properly responded to Hoover’s allegations.
Bruskewitz led the Lincoln diocese until 2010 and was the bishop who refused to participate in the audits, saying the diocese was already following all civil and Catholic laws. He argued that some members of the board that oversaw the audits were “advocates of partial-birth abortion, other abortion, human cloning and other moral errors.”
“It is understandable then how such persons could dislike the Diocese of Lincoln, which upholds the moral teaching of the Catholic Church.

            Under the audits, participating dioceses must disclose cases of sexual abuse and misconduct to a national review board that compiles all cases for an annual public report that shows the number of allegations and makes recommendations for how churches can improve.

            The Lincoln Diocese is one of the nation’s most conservative, a reputation highlighted by its refusal to allow female altar servers. Virtually all Catholic churches eliminated their ban.
Conley, who succeeded Bruskewitz, reversed the diocese’s policy on the audits and began participating in them in 2015 after declaring that the process had improved from its previous methodology.

            Benton has denied the allegations and an investigation didn’t turn up enough evidence to prosecute, But the church offered to reimburse Schulte up to $3,000 for counseling if he submitted receipts showing where he had sought treatment. Schulte said he felt it was intrusive for church officials to know where he went.
The church also promised to keep Benton at a home for retired priests and said it would not let him help with Lincoln church services.

            Benton retired in 2017 after new allegations surfaced, and the church imposed new restrictions to prevent the priest from engaging in public ministry in the diocese and banned him from being alone with minors.
Hoover said Benton touched his hip and groin area twice on a camping trip with other boys, when Hoover was around 10 years old.
Hoover said he was disgusted by the diocese response but didn’t pursue it because he doubted the church would do anything more, he felt embarrassed, and he assumed Benton wouldn’t interact with young boys in the future.

            “I probably would have just lived with it,” he said. “But as soon as I started having kids of my own, I realized it’s not just about me.”
The cases came to light after a defrocked priest leveled allegations this month against the late Monsignor Leonard Kalin, the former pastor of the University of Nebraska’s Newman Center. Kalin served at the Newman Center from 1970 to 1998, and died in 2008.
Those accusations prompted another former seminarian, Wei Hsien Wan, to allege that Kalin made unwanted sexual advances toward him and another man when he was a young seminarian in 1998.

           <p>
            Wan said he reported Kalin’s actions to a priest twice, after which time Bruskewitz imposed restrictions on Kalin.
Wan said he doesn’t believe the diocese has been transparent. He pointed to an Aug. 4 public statement from Conley, which acknowledged “one report of a physical boundary violation” by Kalin. Wan said the church was aware of allegations from him and another seminarian in 1998.
“The Diocese has proven itself incapable of handling allegations in a responsible manner,”

            Here we have two more people in denial.  The victim
And then the victimizer!

            This should never have happened this
Is personally responsible in my book via blatantly not
Following the rules.  Rev Benton should be hung by his thumbs.
