            If you don't think I'm legit for some reason, just look through my posts on here going back to last year when Pizzagate broke. Or check out my Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point I can trace some of the weird malware stuff to last December which was shortly after I started helping out a friend who wanted to file a complaint against the Jill Stein for President Recount effort for accepting foreign donations. It is possible at this point that some of this traces back to several different people but since Law Enforcement has done nothing despite my requests, until recently when I was informed that YouTube took down Toy Freaks (I suspect law enforcement or Trump may have had something to do with this) it is impossible for me to figure out who is behind any of them other than by just basing my suspicions on timing and topic.

            Anyway, thanks again Cc1914.

            Hey guys, thank you so much. I am going to create a new account on here, because using the name GregChism is really traumatic at this point. Yes I was sent numerous threatening messages including "die in a fire and lose your kids to CPS" as well as messages about "see you at the mill" with a link to the Pelzer SC blog. I did not click on it. I'm positive people do know where I live but I am not going to be posting much for a long time. I was told I better STFU or else and that's what I am doing. At this point what I most need help with is purchasing a breast pump and getting copays for medical and a lawyer because some of this has affected the custody of my children, my ex husband may or may not be involved - and at this point I do not know but someone did call CPS on me a couple of days before the channel got deleted. I was so scared that my ex is trying to claim I was exposing my kid to the dangers of pizzagate and also later interfering with my custody and slandering me horribly. I do not have enough thanks in my heart for how much it means to me that anyone actually cares about me at this point, after what I went through but let's just say that it was not worth it. I am glad they shut his channel down but I don't wanna be a target any more. My other usernames were

            on Voat. I had a few others I have forgotten and my computer is so messed up from the malware infections I can not even log into my old gmail or anything now so if the hackers want to give me my password that would be cool.

            Yeah people who use anti-"racist" messages as their avatars are usually sensible, intelligent people.

            Because if one thing is clear after one  year it's that we aren't able to single out one race as PG offenders.

             I visited the MLK monument in San Francisco many years ago with my ex husband, I believe that is the photo I found on my computer from that but the photo was just posted as an inspirational MLK photo. Do you know who MLK was or what he did? Was he a lawyer? No, he was a minister. God has helped me, and I find MLK to be an inspiration. I apologize if I offended you with an anti racist picture?? I do not get on Twitter anymore after the threats I receive. It is most unfortunate how you feel about my chosen profession, not sure who you are talking to but whatever you do, I'm sure that it involves something great.

            Amy has been out there pushing for the take down  of ElsaGate from the very beginning and we have finally started to have some results.  Had it not been for Amy putting her life on the line, success might never have happened.  Thank you Amy from the Bottom of My Heart.  Your Courage Has Been Amazing.

            How much garlic on a spoon does she partake every day would be my first question. The immune system needs things to make it complete, but when a person fails those requirements, it breaks down. Then you need to find out what is missing and replace it for life.

             Thanks for the tip. I love Garlic, I need to start eating it again. One bad thing about garlic though is it's a blood thinner and that's not good if anyone tries to cut me. I will cut back.

               I didn't say overdosing, I said it's a blood thinner. When I was postpartum with my third child I had a bleeding issue and my midwife said to stop taking so much of it immediately. The part about the "if someone cuts me" was really more of a warning to Greg Chism and his friends, since I know he has what appears to be 6 stab wounds on his stomach from the last person whose car he might possibly have tried to mess with... I am not a badass like his Geek to Freak work out friends but that doesn't mean I wanna end up like Nicole Kidman either.

              I.e. make a thread about the people who targeted her. Of course be as absolutely ruthless about it as possible when it comes to exposing them. Make an example out of them to show others what happens when you target a pizzagater.

            If it wasn't for the fact that Amy has been researching PG since the minute she heard of it just like all of us have , I'd probably be rolling my eyes at the fofundme page 🙄

             Thank You!  Do you know if she goes under another username?  I have someone that wants to help her but is asking if she has another name.  So good to hear she is OK.

              here on Voat. She has been doxed and threatened due to inadequate security precautions on her Facebook account, as I understand it. Elsagate subjects figured out where she lives, who her kids are, etc. She had to move. I am sad to hear it has hurt her health.

               Not only am I afraid for her health, I am scared that they will find her.  I hope she is safely in hiding.  I am so sick of our LE using the excuse that they cannot do anything since no crime has been committed. This is a crime waiting to happen if she is not protected.  This is not a game for these people, they mean business. If they do nothing after she gives them what she knows, then they are complicit in protecting them.  Her last posting was 23 days ago.

            Amy James says ..
           </p>
           <p>
            I have some medical issues that are going to be expensive to handle and they need to be handled immediately, but since I lost my job and I am focused on studying to pass the bar exam I am without funds to address this. 
After receiving threats, I am severely traumatized and it is aggravating a postpartum thyroiditis condition I have. I need money for lab work, and money to hire an attorney to represent me as I was recently retaliated against for my investigations into Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The retaliation is severe enough to threaten the custody of my children. I do not feel as safe as I would like, and I would like representation to protect myself from any outside threats.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also need money to order medical records to help in this situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any and all money donated over and above any costs I have to incur in my own defense will be used to help any remaining victims of retaliation for their invesgitations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to form a team to offer help to others who have also been threatened, for legal defense of other journalists.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was told to be quiet, so quiet I will be, except for as to how it has affected me and that will be handled in a defensive manner through lawyers.
