<p>I came across this recently deleted thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1711328">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1711328</a> and believe that this is a major lead for us to pursue as it is absolute proof that the Emily McMullin connection has been manipulated and is being actively covered up by both WHOIS (which now shows <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/trump-email.com">https://www.whois.com/whois/trump-email.com)</a>) and Archive.org (explained below), which both look compromised. So far, archive.is (from a 3/7/17 snap) is the only place showing the history of Emily McMullin updating the registration of trump-email.com on 6/29/16: <a href="http://archive.is/tAIO8">http://archive.is/tAIO8</a></p>
<p>Here is one of several articles that originally exposed this attempt to frame Trump as connected to Russia via a server set up to connect to two Russian banks: <a href="http://www.northcrane.com/2017/03/06/breaking-mcmullin-setup-trumprussia-server-that-allowed-fisa-wiretap-warrants/">http://www.northcrane.com/2017/03/06/breaking-mcmullin-setup-trumprussia-server-that-allowed-fisa-wiretap-warrants/</a>. Trump-email.com was specifically manipulated to create a server connection to 2 Russian banks. This was done on 6/29/16 by Emily McMullin, tied into the efforts by Obama/Lynch to get FISA approval to spy on Trump. The ICANN WHOIS, which I have seen personally a few days ago, was changed to remove her name and replace with generalcounsel@trumporg.com, but the update date still shows as 6/29/16, meaning that this is a cover up occurring at the ICANN WHOIS directory level - the central registrar and repository of record - which is HUGE.</p>
<p>Archives have been manipulated as they do not show what showed before but what shows today. 1/11/17 archive.org shows the same info as showing currently, despite the registrar being edited on 3/8/17: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170111070008/https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=Trump-Email.com">http://web.archive.org/web/20170111070008/https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=Trump-Email.com</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: These bullets show the differences in results in the registrar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170111070008/https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=Trump-Email.com">http://web.archive.org/web/20170111070008/https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=Trump-Email.com</a> (1/1/17 shows new name of email@trumporg.com and old 6/29/16 date) - maybe corruption is ICANN</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170101213028/https://www.whois.com/whois/trump-email.com">http://web.archive.org/web/20170101213028/https://www.whois.com/whois/trump-email.com</a> (1/1/17 shows correct name - Emily - and 6/29/16 date right now on archive.org)</li>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/tAIO8">http://archive.is/tAIO8</a> (archive.is history that is correct - same as above bullet)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really interesting that bullet 1 and bullet 2 are not a perfect match. They should be pulling from the same database. It is proof that the first bullet, the archive from the ICANN WHOIS database, was hard-code edited to eliminate the trail tying things to Emily McMullin (not pulling from the same database). I tried to archive each bullet on archive.is:</p>

If Pamela is going to the embassy now to provide a cover story, it is for pay and it is a body double Assange, or drugged to the stone age Assange. Hell, Maybe Assange is alive but whacked out and she's his handler. With Hollywood being as corrupt as it is, that would be plausible. BUT GIRLFRIEND??? NOT BUYING IT. PERIOD.

            Comey also made a legal mistake by claiming: Since a Judge could compel you to answer, nothing that you say may be private.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a very fake "low relief" opinion.

           </p>
           <p>
            Comey is breaking a law and committing a Capital Crime. It's called "Taking Away People's Rights under Color of Law" which is a real crime and is on the level of Treason since performed by a High official.. I.E. High Crime.

            He also says your' memories don't belong to you ; which may refer to all the back -dating of documetation and events which is going on ; including the Current Legend that Pam Anderson is girlfriend to Assange and visited many time.

            Did you get a screen shot FWIW?
Also, because of the release of all the elite hacking tools they will hard time proving anything. 
Except to change a data field in a registration. ? It could be done by anyone? How can they prove it's valid?

            More info on Cendyn/ Emily McMullin. It looks like Cendyn does do travel &amp; tourism promos but people can work from home? Kinda confusing:

            Accel-KKR acquired Cendyn

            They are just going to get worse. More and more desperate. So, for those of you who may not have heard...someone with a weapon jumped the fence at the Whitehouse last night and was within shooting distance of Trump's quarters. How the hell was he able to get that close?!

            Too much being made of trump-email.com server. Originally the domain was registered by Emily McMullin of Cendyn to send out promotional emails for Trump Hotel. After all the controversy erupted, she was probably getting bombarded by conspiratards and others accusing her of being in on this great big CIA scam, so the registration info was changed to direct people to Trump's legal counsel. That's the way it should be IMO. It's likely Emily McMullin who registered the domain is NOT Evan McMullin's sister - I mean that's just really, really stupid if she is. You'd think between the two of them, both college educated, one of em would think "Hey if we're gonna set up Trump like this - maybe we should pay the extra $7 per year for domain privacy protection/proxy registration?" Emily McMullin is a real person who really works for a marketing firm, she's not part of some vast left-wing conspiracy. She has a real profile on Linkedin, or at least she did yesterday. She's the VP of marketing for Cendyn. I understand how suspicious it looks that the record was just changed so recently, but you can't expect her to just keep taking crap from the internet conspiracy community do you? People see Emily McMullin and freak out OMG IT'S EVAN'S SISTER. No, it's not. Just someone else with the same name. Happens all the time. Search facebook and I'm quite certain there's a lot of Emily McMullin's in this world, just so happens that one of them sold Trump some marketing services... Occam's razor, people... come on.

             Every lead is worth checking. I wouldn't accuse Emily on anything at this point and I guess a lot of people here are not. Her name and email at Cendyn was used, and that's a fact. Was it Emily, any of her colleagues, bosses, any of her relatives? What and when? Why? . We might focus on Cendyn and their leadership connections, we might focus on Emily's relatives and connections, whatever, and run into dead ends at some directions, while others might turn up to be valuable. Reason for downvote (which I can't do yet): No links for claimed original use, no links showing that they are not connected, so no reason to drop a lead. Q not asked: Let them be relatives or not, are they connected?

            Exactly. But check out the official ICANN WHOIS, controlled by an international non profit now, which was edited yesterday:

           </p>
           <p>
            It does NOT match the above, which could only happen in a hard edit, bypassing the audating, which would have updated the "Update Date" field.

            Turns out they already have an affidavit they will sign and send on request for specific pages, but they ask you to use it as a last resort for proving a website capture's authenticity in court.

            I'm going to ask for a signed copy of the affidavit for the icann page. If it was manipulated and they sign the affidavit, and proof comes out that it was manipulated, it will at a minimum destroy archive.org's credibility for good. Hopefully it helps push people to a decentralized web.

            archive.org is 100% compromised. First of all, they got their main start on this old chat group for hippy satanist freemasons in the SF Bay Area called "the well". They started by archiving concerts by known satanists the Grateful Dead, whose members attend Bohemian Grove despite their bullshit image as "anti-establishment" hippies.

           <p>
            Secondly, in the earlier days of the internet around 1995, there was a site that completely exposed masonic symbolism. This site became very popular. It was archived in the wayback machine, but later vanished from there after the guy was forced to remove his site. So they are 100% compromised from the beginning. Never trust them at all, though they can occasionally be useful.

            Your connection between this and pizzagate is pretty weak. I would say that it is valid because it involves websites that we use and rely on in our investigations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Archive.org is compromised
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So was sli.mg and, even though its in iceland, archive.is is still vulnerable. This is what happens when the corrupt own the institutions that have access to all of this centralized infrastructure or people who know how to break into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I kinda stopped trying to collect data after realizing I don't have a good way to ensure it can remain online, secure and not turn into an information silo. I have been playing with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">
             IPFS
            </a>
            (interplanetary file system) in my lab, which allows a decentralized web meaning that, to take down a website, or any content hosted on the ipfs server, they would have to take down everyone who chose to replicate (pin) the data. It works pretty much the same way as a torrent and all content is hashed using merkleDAG's the same as a cryptocurrency blockchain to ensure that data cannot be manipulated. It essentially allows for a decentralized 'permanent' web.
           </p>
           <p>
            The neat thing is that there is already an existing project that combines the IA's wayback system on top of IPFS.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb">
             https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also there is a project for hosting a wiki on top of IPFS.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jamescarlyle/ipfs-wiki">
             https://github.com/jamescarlyle/ipfs-wiki
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And a project for hosting a pastebin/img dump
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/rameshvarun/ipfs-share">
             https://github.com/rameshvarun/ipfs-share
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This means that if enough people would volunteer to host the contents, we could potentially have a way to store information that is much more resistant to manipulation and take down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only reason I am not totally on-board with this and going nutty over how cool it is, is because 1.) It is a new protocol, there are sure to be some bugs (same with any software ) and 2.) By design the protocol shares both the users public and private IP. It has to be carefully routed to ensure your IP is not leaked and even then a bug in IPFS or the VPN could cause a leak.
           </p>
           <p>
            So at this time, it should only be run by more advanced users who are comfortable running something potentially vulnerable on their system (IE they know how to set up a sandbox, monitoring, and lock down potentially dangerous processes) and preferably have a system just for that task and no other personal data is hosted there. Hopefully I will have an example and tutorial for folks in a few weeks if I get the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The great thing is that malicious actors can replicate the data but will not be able to manipulate it thanks to the way to stores file cryptographically and uses merkleDAG to verify its contents.
           </p>
           <p>
            What would be really cool is if I could put together a buy list for parts to put together a raspberry pi and 1TB HDD for storage and anyone who wanted to be involved in replicating the data could buy those, run a setup script, put it on their network and be come another node in the ipfs network.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something to think about for now, I'll be making a post about it soon.

             Thank you for your deep thoughts in the post. I see two levels of relevance:

            <ul>

               They are trying to take down Trump because they fear he will go after PG.

             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               We have hard evidence of manipulation at the level of ICANN and archive.org. This is important to document as we know we have run into this before with PG, in addition to the LSM and social media manipulation and censorship.

             You could always video the evidenc as well. In this case, Ron Johnson's video has the McMullin link and George Webb has the evidence for the server linked back to that hospital in Michigan which appears to have ties back to the Awan bros. Super bizarre.

              Wrong, because by itself it still can be totally manipulated. It is easy with video or screenshot, you don't even have to edit the video just rec a video of your copy of the website. You can edit a live website in-browser and make it say anything you want for a screenshot or video. It is trivial. Your video of a website is completely inadmissible in court and I suggest nobody take a video of a website as proof of anything since it can be manipulated too easily.
             </p>
             <p>
              Archiving a copy of that website in a system that makes it
              <strong>
               unalterable by design
              </strong>
              may have a chance to stand up in court. Your video of a website would be dismissed. No question about that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if you want to use your video evidence for private investigation, the point is that there is no easy way to share all this information and ensure that it does not get altered or the hosting taken down in some way. So you are giving a horrible example and missing the point at the same time.

            Seems that the president of CENDYN (mail server admin of emcmullen(a)cendyn.com) Charles Deyo was

             arrested
            </a>
            on drinking&amp;driving on February 2nd, on the same day there was possible fake news about "Trump administration relaxes U.S. sanctions on Russia imposed under Obama". Was the reason for this arrest actually something else then?

              That's not a whole bunch for a man with 3500 registered domains... So many possible scenarios. Probably not his. Might be anyone elses. It's a mess I wouldn't touch, maybe let's keep it simple and stick with the one probably used as evidence (trump email com) and the company behind that (cendyn)

            Look like Charles Deyo was
            <a href="http://florida.arrests.org/Arrests/Charles_Deyo_30264880/">
             arrested
            </a>
            on drinking&amp;driving on February 2nd, on the same day there was possible fake news about "Trump administration relaxes U.S. sanctions on Russia imposed under Obama". I doublechecked this guy arrested is actually the president of CENDYN, the company admining the mail server in question "emcmullin(a)cendyn.com". Was the reason for this arrest actually something else then?

             Yes, but we know that they CAN actually edit the archives. That is what happened to archive.org (part of what I documented in the post). The fact that they literally hard edited ICANN WHOIS and archive.org shows this to be very important. They are trying to scrub any evidence of her connection to the server that they targeted with the FISA request as a method to frame Trump for ties to Russia.

             </p>
             <p>
              That cuts both ways. One man's hard editing is another man's obstruction of justice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think of the big picture here. They knew if Hillary didn't win they'd be going to jail anyway. So why not manufacture evidence and hack a little used Trump server to make it look like it's communicating with a Russian owned bank.
             </p>
             <p>
              Same thing here, hack into the ICANN WHOIS page and remove the evidence, they're going to jail anyway.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem for them is they'll be LUCKY to get a jail sentence if you know what I mean. You can't kill 1300 Syrian men, women and children in a false flag Sarin attack in Ghouta and get off with a slap on the wrist.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whoever planned that false flag has another thing coming.

               Oh, this is absolute obstruction of justice. I see no innocent explanation for provable editing of historical pages of record of a domain registration, which has legal ramifications. The whole thread we put together is very damaging for them to go to these lengths.

              Charles Deyo was arrested
             </a>
             on drinking&amp;driving on February 2nd, on the same day there was possible fake news about "Trump administration relaxes U.S. sanctions on Russia imposed under Obama". I doublechecked this guy arrested is really the president of CENDYN, the company admining the mail server in question. Was the reason for this arrest actually something else then?

             They are trying to remove the link of McMullin to trump-email.com. While the intiial story seemed almost too hard to believe as this would be really sloppy by them, the changes to WHOIS history are incredibly suspicious. Shill activity around this brings more confirmation. It is far worse than Trump not being found to have a true connection to Russia...worse than ordering a FISA tapping...it implicates a conspiracy to frame Trump, way worse than Watergate or anything before. It would involve Obama and Hillary (as she tweeted on 10/31 about this connection on something that was supposed to involve top-level secrecy):

             Thank you for catching. I have fixed above but cannot edit the title itself. The fact that this thread of connections has been resisted (falsely claimed as debunked yesterday), along with activity in the last 48 hours with WHOIS, indicates that this may be a major thread to expose the literal effort to frame Trump. Why would they change the WHOIS connection and also edit the history for it (falsifying the records)? There is only one logical reason: A deliberate effort to cover up the truth.

              It appears to me as if someone may have used sliding techniques on the few sites which offer whois history lookups as well, dozens of lookups on trump-email.com all in the last few days.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are some pay sites which keep whois history for years, my employer has an account with one, I believe it costs $995 a year. Unlikely that hyperactive shills would have paid that much, I'll ask the boss on Monday if I can have the login details.

               Yes. This connection has been heavily shilled and falsely claimed as debunked. If it is not true, I want to see the proof. Until that happens, it is a good lead. The fact that they retroactively changed WHOIS and archive.org is a huge smoking gun to me that this is something very threatening to them.

                You're right. And it technically
                <em>
                 cannot
                </em>
                be debunked. We see the WHOIS information with our own eyes on archive.is... and the info is even still viewable as we speak on whoismind.com
               </p>
               <p>
                Then with your thread we learn that they realized their mistake and tried to cover their tracks... but we caught them red handed! If you ask me this whole story is a true smoking gun. Not
                <em>
                 directly
                </em>
                pizzagate related perhaps, but still very connected.

                 I see it as related to PG and as strong evidence that Trump is with us. There is an assumption here: TPTB do not want Trump in office and are trying ANYTHING to get him out of office. I believe the reason is #PedoGate, which is why this is so relevant.

            Nope. That posting was about the core story. It was listed "debunked" based on a story that had debunked the connection of Trump to Russia, which we already knew. The actual story about the server and the effort to frame Trump WAS NOT debunked. My post is not about the story but about the effort to wipe the fingerprints off WHOIS about the involvement of Emily McMullin. This has been scrubbed on WHOIS and on Archive.org for the history, a provable cover up of what showed just yesterday. The only place showing this history now is:

             Remember Obama intentionally released control of ICANN in October. First time in Internet history. Gave it to "international" companies at the UN. This is intentional.

             <p>
              He's got a way around it paying for some special registration for many years in advance, and then fixing his own server so you can get there Via IP address alone. He explained it at one point but it was too technical / over my head. 
And I didn't take a screen shot.

              His site changes regularly.
             </p>
             <p>
              The DNS for his site was erased immediately after he called out evidence / proof of sabotage on Ononfry [sp] Dam.

              Since the Web Tools have been released to who know whom, doesn't that mean there's no way to prove who did it?

             Archive.is is also compromised...possibly run by the Mossoad as godlikeproductionsDotcom lets it through and (((THEY))) LET NOTHING THROUGH and that site was searching for vulnerabilities in peoples routers and the IP traffic was coming from an Israeli Embassy in Washington DC.  So the government/CIA/Mossad can can and will shut down or change the information contained within Archive.is anytime they want.

               I have a theory on Vault 7 which I seriously hope is wrong. I'm beginning to think WikiLeaks were compromised a while ago and have been used to gain people's trust by dumping the CIA leaks. I think they will begin to release damaging info against Trump to get him impeached

                That would make sense. I for the life of me cannot figure out why Assange would not have used his private key to assure us that he is fine. How on earth would that hurt him and why hasn't he done it? My son (who is totally thinking I am loony as a ... well loon) also is puzzled by this and believes he is dead.
