<p>Hey, after reading the things I have from the wiki leaks, and I have extensively. I am inclined to make a tip as a concerned US citizen. Yall are who yall are so I\'m sure I\'m already plugged into some database or another. In any event I\'m not a bad guy. I know that and so do you. I am a guy that looks through Craigslist SomeCity/gigs/labor for side jobs regularly. Its common to see the &quot;coded&quot; drug post, I don\'t care about those but there is one, that is under my skin, now with Pizzagate, even more so. Not cool with adults attacking kids. Zero empathy there. Here\'s the reoccurring post link, </p>
<p>cvznb-pedospedos@gigs.craigslist.org </p>
<p>This post or slight derivatives of this post have been on CL now for at least 4 months. Same jobsite location, always a wall reference, 2 houses mentioned and a &quot;deadline&quot; offering cash. Every time. Real similar to pedodestas emails. (Yall need to arrest that guy and his brother) I digress. </p>
<p>To me, with 20 years in the field, to many things here are off kilter, and especially after investigating how a pedo ring talks via wikileaks, alarm bells. </p>
<p>1, No one would CL this type of work, this is permit contractor level work, not to be amateured out. Way to many variables at play to affect final out. </p>
<p>2, A job of this type would have been long picked up, this is like an 8 to10k job that is relatively easy actually, if you know what you\'re doing, which leads to 3, </p>
<p>3, No one, deadline or no, is pouring a slab of that size in the temperature suseptable months of December and January, even in cuckafornia, yet, here it is. At least 4 months and counting, 65\' slab, wall, 2 houses, deadline, cash. </p>
<p>I\'m reading as 65 people, border jump, stash house to stash house, timeline, payment. </p>
<p>Normally I wouldn\'t actively chime in, not my job. Stronger immigration laws should deter. And will in the near future thank God. </p>
<p>This kid trafficking though, naw. Absolutely not. </p>
<p>If I\'m wrong yall can high five and laugh at the office about stupid civilians, I don\'t really give a $hit. Oh well. </p>
<p>If I\'m right though and yall save even just one kid from God knows what. Then blipping on the radar was worth it. </p>
<p>I\'m sure it\'s all super secret agent man and I never hear either way, which is imo, lunacy. But what ever. Check this out please, in any event I\'ll sleep better having sent this left assuming that you will, thanks. </p>
