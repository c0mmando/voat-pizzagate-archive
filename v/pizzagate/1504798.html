</p>
<p>I search Fiona Apple, filter by # of views and &quot;Criminal&quot; from 7 years ago is top result.  The lyrics sound like a young girl sexualized too young to me but I\'m no poet/song lyric expert and the references are not nearly as blatantly sexual as the video is.

<p>The video, on the other hand, could easily be interpreted as a young girl being sexualized too young and/or having done sexual things too young.  
</p>
<p>Long story short, as I was watching I noticed a brief and odd pizza reference at the 38s mark:  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFOzayDpWoI?t=36s">https://youtu.be/FFOzayDpWoI?t=36s</a></p>
<p>Now, I would not have even noticed that before pizzagate...I know it is very obscure and probably not even noteworthy but with the tone of the video, her portraying a sexually active young girl and for no reason at all, they decide to put a 2 second clip of pizza in there?  Seemed odd to me.</p>
<p>So my question:  Is there a thread that serves as a catch-all for odd/obscure pizza references in pop culture?  Obviously, the Miley Cyrus level stuff isn\'t obscure/odd but like I said, not sure this 2 second bit from a 7 year old video deserves it\'s own thread....</p>',

            She was just trying to be edgy lol, like all those 'oh so post modern' 90s stars. I wouldn't read too much into it if I were you. She was a hot young thing, so yes, I'm sure she had a million dirty old men scamming on her.
The Olsen twins intrigue me. Can we assume that all the guys they date/are married to, are perves? I mean, to be with women who have undeveloped bodies and look like 11 year old girls means you're a sicko right?

             I think you're misunderstanding...I don't find her to be a 'hot young thing' (then or now) - I was just finding it curious that she included a random pizza cameo in a video of hers that has clear sexual connotations. And since it was such an obscure thing, was wondering if there was a catch-all thread for such things in case there were just-as-obscure connections from them.

            It says on her wikipedia that she had an eating disorder, so I bet the subtle nod to pizza was a psychological trigger to her young female fans about eating/obsession with food and being rail thin at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also says she grew up in an entertainment family and split living between New York and Los Angeles and dated film director Paul Thomas Anderson early in her career. I think the Miley Cyrus/Olsen twins factor make this worth at least pointing out. Plus she's in the news now for singing an anti-Trump Christmas song, "Trump Nuts Roasting On an Open Fire."

             Yes, that vid is what got me trolled and I went looking her up because I honestly did not know/remember her...just happened upon that lil blip in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good points, very plausible....betting there are millions of obscure things like this, was looking for a catch-all thread for them so as to not clutter up things or distract - never know if the obscure leads to a connection...best to mention than not mention?
