<p>As the Jeffrey Epstein case continues to unfold, a laundry list of celebrities, business magnates and socialites who have flown anywhere near the registered sex offender\'s orbit are now tainted with <strong>pedo-polonium</strong>. Many of them, such as <strong>Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak, and Victoria\'s Secret boss Les Wexner</strong> have sought to distance themselves from Epstein and his activities - however their attempts have fallen on deaf ears considering their extensive ties to the pedophile. </p>
<p>As Vanity Fair\'s Gabriel Sherman notes, &quot;The questions about Epstein are metastasizing much faster than they can be answered: Who knew what about Epstein’s alleged abuse? How, and from whom, did Epstein get his supposed $500 million fortune? Why did Acosta grant Epstein an outrageously lenient non-prosecution agreement? (And what does it mean that Acosta was reportedly told Epstein “belonged to intelligence”?)&quot;</p>
<p>Also illuminating is a statement by attorney Brad Edwards, who said during a Wednesday press conference seated next to Epstein accuser Courtney Wild that &quot;There were other business associates of Mr. Epstein’s who engaged in improper sexual misconduct at one or more of his homes. We do know that,&quot; adding &quot;In due time the names are going to start coming out.&quot;</p>
<p>What\'s more, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will release of approximately 2,000 pages of documents, likely over the next several days, which may reveal sex crimes committed by &quot;numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders,&quot; according to the court\'s three-judge panel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The documents were filed during a civil defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a former Mar-a-Lago locker-room attendant, against Epstein’s former girlfriend and alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell. “Nobody who was around Epstein a lot is going to have an easy time now. It’s all going to come out,” said Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies. Another person involved with litigation against Epstein told me: “It’s going to be staggering, the amount of names. It’s going to be contagion numbers.”</em> -Vanity Fair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other famous names associated with Epstein include LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg, who Musk introduced to the registered sex-offender. Zuckerberg spokesman told Vanity Fair &quot;Mark met Epstein in passing one time at a dinner honoring scientists that was not organized by Epstein,&quot; adding &quot;Mark did not communicate with Epstein again following the dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Musk told the magazine &quot;I don’t recall introducing Epstein to anyone, as I don’t know the guy well enough to do so, Epstein is obviously a creep and Zuckerberg is not a friend of mine. Several years ago, I was at his house in Manhattan for about 30 minutes in the middle of the afternoon with Talulah [Riley], as she was curious about meeting this strange person for a novel she was writing. We did not see anything inappropriate at all, apart from weird art. He tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island. I declined.&quot; </p>
<p>According to one source, Epstein had a steady stream of who\'s who\'s flowing into his Manhattan mansion, including Bill Gates, Larry Summers, and Steve Bannon. </p>
<h1 id="md-dc-on-edge">DC on edge</h1>
<p>&quot;Epstein bragged about his contacts in Washington,&quot; said attorney David Boies. </p>
<p>According to the report, &quot;One theory circulating among prominent Republicans is that Epstein was a Mossad agent. Another is that the George W. Bush White House directed Acosta not to prosecute Epstein to protect Prince Andrew on behalf of the British government.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The royal family did everything they could to try and discredit the Prince Andrew stuff,&quot; said Boies. &quot;When we tried to follow up with anything, we were stonewalled. We wanted to interview him, they were unwilling to do anything.&quot; </p>
<p>And now we await those documents. Meanwhile, Epstein\'s bail hearing is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. on Thursday.</p>',

            Yes, I am happy that Epstein is in jail, but I was happy about the NXIVM arrest and Weinstein also, but no big KABOOM. No leads ... no squealing ... no leaks ... no big surprises. Fizzle ... fizzlerock.

             This conspiracy runs deep. Global and all tiers of society. Also, keep in mind that normies have no fucking idea about any of the shit we know about so imagine the fallout when news drops of all the elites that have been idolized by these normies. It's going to be insanity.

              You're right, of course. The only news normies have gotten is debunking cabals and sex abuse. They think we're all crazy and making things up because their gods (the media) has labeled us as such.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just hope it happens. I'm so tired of waiting as I imagine are all of you.

              Every victim of these creeps is going to be able to go so much deeper in their healing processes just because they will finally be believed-by everyone. No one will be able to deny hard facts even though they will try as hard as they can. The jig is up. Shit is exploding in massive proportions.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's also going to be so satisfying to rub it in every person's face I know who vehemently and even sometimes  aggressively denied the truth as I spelled it out for them.

            Musk needs to worry about his own issues. It’s all over the internet he beats up his young girlfriend Grimes and plies her with coke. While also plying himself with coke.

              “Tesla and Musk are Intel-backed projects which operate half in the real world, and half in their fake government-backed world, and generally the public is none the wiser. But Tesla has dug a hole of epic proportions, and people are beginning to catch on. Miles suggested that Elon Musk may have been brought in to kill Tesla (and the idea it represents), and that’s certainly possible. Both Elon’s and Peter Thiel’s fathers were intelligence officers, and they probably met when both were working in Africa, where they built a lot of their wealth plundering the continent of its commodity assets. The same goes for the father of Elizabeth Holmes and many others.”

               It was a genuine story - Musk is such a Narcissist that he wanted to play the hero got thwarted and reacted accordingly by grabbing more attention to himself.

                 The story about trafficking is ridiculous there is a 2000km border that can be crossed in a million different places no need for tunnels. It just so happened that last year they had a flash flood in Chiang Rai this year its a drought. And there was a cover up but that was to save face over the Thai Seals getting lost in the tunnel and one got drowned - I know one of the divers.

            I’m trying to research some basic info on Egg Penis.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Where was he born?
           </p>
           <p>
            -Who are his parents? Relatives? Neighbors?
           </p>
           <p>
            -Any siblings?
           </p>
           <p>
            -Any kids legitimate or otherwise?
           </p>
           <p>
            -High School?
           </p>
           <p>
            -High School friends? Childhood pals?
           </p>
           <p>
            -Where does he go to dinner in Manhattan?
           </p>
           <p>
            -Has he ever had any illnesses? Been hospitalized?
           </p>
           <p>
            -When he’s not busy raping minors or blackmailing politcos, where does he frequent?
           </p>
           <p>
            You can’t be a NYC socialite (which he was desperate to be) and not be visible or somewhat transparent at least 50% of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Such a mystery!

             AN INTERESTING COMMENT
"Prosecutor in 2019 Epstein Case Is Maurene Comey,
Daughter of Fired FBI Director James Comey — Who Participated in 2017 
Pussy Hat March !
Prosecution is rigged ,already talk of a quick deal , any sane person can read the writing on the wall SDNY will soon start leaking that Trump is target of Epstein Testimony and this will occur prior to election !
The Department of Just us and FBI are still loaded with Epstien, Comey , Clinton co conspirators and POTUS should have fired Wray for insubordination long ago !
When leaks start this will not be a possibility ! 
Anyone who believes that Epstein will do hard time is delusional..."

             Based on the photo from 2000 with Trump, Melania (pre-marriage) Epstein and Maxwell, I wonder who introduced model Melania to Trump? Was their marriage a "surprise"?

             According to a Vanity Fair article
"The auspicious beginnings of the First Couple: At a Times Square night club in 1998, Donald Trump asked for model Melania Knauss’s phone number while his date was in the bathroom. (She declined and took his numbers instead.) They married in 2005 at a lavish Palm Beach wedding and have one son together, Barron, born in 2006."

            Thing I'm concerned about his David Boies represented Harvey Weinstein and went after his accusers with the help of Black Cube. Then there's the fact James Alefantis also sought legal help from Boies firm Boies, Schiller and Flexner.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that wasn't dodgy enough, NXIVM connected Kirsten Gillibrand was a partner at Boies, Schiller and Flexner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does David Boies really have Epstein's accusers best interests?
