            Really though. How is it that the satanic calendar in and of itself is stating these things that are in fact being portrayed in so called art and insinuated in code words.

            Atheist here. I'm aware that people can do some strange and sick things if they're scooped up in a strong enough belief, whether that be Xenax or Moloch.

            While looking at religion and occultism might help to find new clues, be careful with relying solely on it, and focus on how such links further the investigation.
