<p>15 minutes to go to work...i agree that the search engine is where shit is hiding and WANTS us to find it.

None of the Amanda little girl pics are naked but they are obscene she;s too young.</p>
<p>Here today im still suspicious of those numbers so I type them in...just plain old bj69bj  first hit is an old Twitter account from 09 with one tweet to visit muathe.com which seems money tech consultish... Not sure if it doesnt matter next hit pizza and so on more pizza on pinterest. So here we go it says PIZZA alot see my screenshots, don;t be afraid to open screenshots. This is results of searching jb69jb lots of pizza on pinterest. So I open Pinterest first page- and low and behold a sex worker from Qatar who can get other girls, says so on her own site malikakrishnamurti, sounds indian maybe shes a slave. I dont want anthing bad to happen to her. <a href="https://ibb.co/hnQism">https://ibb.co/hnQism</a>
PS* one of my last posts was on Toyota having PIZZA prominently in 3scenrs in the latest 2018 ad, notice that the search bj69bj brought up Toyota in the first page of Pinterest, on the same page as the ad for the sex worker. Indeed right above Malika\'s ad for escort service.

             Not sure u mean my account at nameof. This account is my own, not used for sliding other threads.  There's so much that is truly worthless. Like a person Not putting any  value on 11 months! that's one way of censoring my contribution to this forum. Call me slider... If my posts we're so bad why are they still up? Paul Guerin photographed and  raped a little girl actually there were at least two,  after trying to get me ( age 16) alone in 1986 he's married to Jean Bush he tried to scrub his internet conviction(s( for pornography and rape of child....I posted that up. Not to mention this shit is dark enough with out people calling people sliding, and if you refer to comet ping pong then say anything else is not PIZZAGATE , like Paul Guerin is not PIZZAGATE. That's just not right, if you don't see pizza as a message used in some mass mind control agenda then you don't see it. But I see pizza in this Toyota ad as a message suggestive of everything we've been talking about all year, there is 1. Gold 2. Black people 3. Pizza in that order. You see nothing strange, you see no link to pedo-ism. Fine but I DO. ESp when it is apparently well known black blood is prised by the blood drinkers.  You don't notice the black people in the commercial as odd? Contrived. I think that's odd. I think that's imperceptivity.

              Sorry. I was not in top form that day and was rude. You did a terrible job of presenting your case. What you just described to me should have been in your post and you should have given us a clue where you were headed. I can tell from your reply to me that you are sincere but your post was low effort.

            While I have heard of many exploits by the kingdom, this sounds like a setup of some kind by the Royals. Great way to gain leverage on visitors. I am sure laws are strict on such activities.

            I'm finding it hard to recreate your results. I can see the link that once hosted the pictures of this "Amanda" you're speaking of, but they are currently unavailable. Also, they were tied to a website called mediamynx.com which has been inactive since 2010. Not sure if this helps.

             Hi thanks for asking. I mixed up the numbers when I made the post and saw that by the screenshot u can see the search term I used in the screenshots shot but I kept calling it the otherway round.  Good to know Amanda doesn't pop up anymore. I think when I posted about it it was hostedby Alibaba who had scheduled looking girls too, also Qatar. But I'm getting tar brain, and it's probly better to check the post. The search term I used here was just 69bj69. That's the Amanda code from imgbb.

            Getting my BJ's and 69s all mixed up. Grrrrff. Sorry. It's 69bj69 that brings up Amanda on imgbb. So those are the ones I was using to search just plain old internet.
