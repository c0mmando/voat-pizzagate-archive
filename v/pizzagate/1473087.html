<p>Still, I never knew how bad #pizzagate was. It probably involved some underage prostitutes. But did it involve Satanism? Spirit Cooking? The occult? Child trafficking? Disposing of bodies in barrels? I didn\'t know.</p>
<p>Well, I recognized a third data point today (new information to me). Together I think, statistically, it is basically impossible for #pizzagate to not involve occult child sacrifice.</p>
<p>First, let\'s start with the data point that everybody knows. In a famous Wikileaks email, someone wrote the following to Hillary Clinton:</p>
<p>&quot;With fingers crossed, the old rabbit\'s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333</a></p>
<p>Now this is bizarre for many reasons. First, ordinarily people know about crossing fingers. Ordinary people know about rabbit\'s feet. But ordinary people do not know about Moloch. I\'m a 35 year old attorney, graduate of a first tier law school, and I did not know who Moloch was. I first found Moloch on Google/Wikipedia a few weeks ago, and I learned (from Wikipedia) that Moloch is the ancient Canaanite god of child sacrifice, and he is usually depicted as a bull. Even after that, I still did not everything about Moloch, as I will show below.</p>
<p>But the email is weird for another reason: the email says sacrifice a chicken. But Moloch is the god of child sacrifice, not chicken sacrifice. Moloch has nothing to do with chicken.</p>
<p>Now, is this a bizarre coincidence? Sure, maybe. Did someone mean &quot;voohoo sacrifice&quot; instead of &quot;Moloch sacrifice&quot;? Maybe. I mean, I don\'t know how someone confuses voodoo for Moloch. Voodoo and Moloch have nothing to do with each other, as far as I can tell, and I searched. The email does not mention voodoo. Voodoo is a counter-argument that was hallucinated by people who read this email and try to not believe in evil. The email itself provides no evidence for voodoo.</p>
<p>But this email is just one data point. The author seems to be half serious, because the author also mentions crossing fingers and the author also mentions a rabbit\'s foot. And I doubt that the author takes either one of those things serious. So it\'s just a strange email. As a single data point.</p>
<p>Now we get to data point #2. So let me back up a step, I get in arguments with people about #pizzagate all the time. Because I cannot show them all of the circumstantial evidence at once, I show them the strongest evidence I have. As of this morning, that was data points 1 and 2. I have not seen people previously link these data points together, which is kind of shocking to me:</p>
<p>Data point 2: We know from #pizzagate evidence that these people use &quot;chicken&quot; as a code word for a young child or boy. We <em>know</em> that. We are not speculating. It is not up for debate. In the Comet Ping Pong Instagram, there is undeniable proof of a man holding up a baby boy, with a necklace around them both, and the only tag is &quot;#chickenlovers.&quot; We also know that, long before #pizzagate, chicken is a criminal/pedophile code word for an underage child.</p>
<p>Well, isn\'t that a big fucking coincidence? We have a bizarre email about child sacrifice that has the word chicken where we would expect the word child, because Moloch is the god of child sacrifice, not the god of child sacrifice. Then, independently, we discover that people in #pizzagate use the word &quot;chicken&quot; to refer to the children.</p>
<p>These two data points fit together like a puzzle. It is statistically impossible, in my view, for these two data points to be a coincidence. One data point explains the other, and it cannot be explained otherwise. It is exactly the same thing with the Podesta handkerchief email, and then the handkerchief code discovered on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>But this leads me to this afternoon. While arguing about #pizzagate with a friend, I was googling and discovered data point 3. I was doing research about Moloch. Previously, I had already known that (A) Bill Clinton is associated with Jeffrey Epstein, (B) Epstein is a creepy convinced pedophile billionaire, and (C) Epstein has what looks like a creepy occult temple on his island. Today, I also remembered that (D) Epstein is a co-founder of the Clinton Foundation (FBIanon - who made so many correct predictions - said that the Clinton Foundation is the source of mass evil and corruption) and (E) the creepy temple on Epstein\'s island, Little St. James, has an occult statute on it.</p>
<p>A statute of an owl.</p>
<p>You can see the owl here:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/2vugqypz4bvx.png">https://i.redd.it/2vugqypz4bvx.png</a></p>
<p>It looks just like the owl at Bohemian Grove:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lovethetruth.com/jis_images/cremation_of_care.jpg">http://www.lovethetruth.com/jis_images/cremation_of_care.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now, with just a little googling, you will learn that the owl is the sign of Moloch, too! The bull symbol on Wikipedia is confusing, because Moloch has two different symbols. But there is undeniable proof that Moloch is strongly associated with an owl, and this was before FBIanon, #pizzagate, Wikileaks, or anything else.</p>

<p>This article (linked above) was first published in 2004, updated in 2015:</p>

<p>And so on. Moloch is strongly associated with the owl.</p>
<p>So let\'s recap. Buckle up your seatbelts, because we\'re slowly discovered that a cult involving child sacrifice is rooted in the highest levels of government for decades (I guess it couldn\'t keep up with secrecy in the age of google and cell phones):</p>
<ol>
<li>email to Hillary Clinton mentioned sacrificing chicken to Moloch (Moloch previously predicted as part of the elite Bohemian Grove occult, Moloch is the god of child sacrifice)</li>
<li>#pizzagate people use chicken to describe young children, explaining the &quot;chicken&quot; reference in point 1</li>
<li>Jeffrey Epstein\'s occult temple on Little St. James has a giant occult owl on it. Owl is the symbol for Moloch. Epstein is the cofounder of the Clinton Foundation, which is the center of the evil and corruption (according to FBIanon and countless threads on reddit and voat).</li>
</ol>
<p>These three data points are not a coincidence. It is statistically impossible, for all practical reason, for data points 1 and 2 to be a coincidence. But fine. If that\'s not enough for you, add in data point 3. And if that\'s not enough for you, add in the other thousand data points about #pizzagate.</p>
<p>This will get weirder before it gets more normal. It will get darker before it gets lighter. It will get worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>Buckle up, diggers.</p>

            A lot of writing to say what we already know. Yeah chicken means kid probably and this message is weird. Also epstein has a shiny temple thing on his island. this is a silly post honestly. You really lost me on all the "voohoo sacrifice bit" 
Seriously drawn out post and by you writing skill you are obviously not a lawyer.

            I like this post, thank you. I always thought Killary was joking and that maybe so but you are right, people don't say Moloch, people say "sacrifice a chicken to the gods", not one specific god. Unless you are studying theology, mythology or are a hopeless conspiracy theorist you wouldn't even know who Moloch is.

            If you have a statistic like the amount of disappearing children in the Washington area, per capita compared with the rates from around the rest of the country. About four times more, then its reasonable to assume that this industrial disappearance is centralised around this particular area. That's a dumb move as the saying goes don't shit on your own doorstep, unless they are very confident that they will not get caught. This seems to be where all the sociopaths that have made it to the top seem to congregate. They think they are bulletproof. Didn't they bother to fudge the statistics,? this has got to be the biggest giveaway, as they seem to be efficiently mining a resource close to home first which requires the lowest energy outlay..

             I'm not sure what you mean by this. But I am cautiously optimistic that Trump will drain the fucking swamp.

              From the look of his cabinet LOL, we need to feed the swamp with it. But hey, let us give trump a chance. Let us see what a guy whose idol is Darth Vader will do.

               Yes, let's give him a chance. Every other President has let us down. But Trump doesn't seem to be part of the Bohemian Grove / Jewish club.
