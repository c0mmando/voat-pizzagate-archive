Now check this video out at 14:33 - a picture I\'ve never seen before.

<p>Now check out these close ups of Majestic Ape\'s mouth - gosh it rings a bell. close up, it doesn\'t look like a woman\'s mouth after all. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZkojrcD_0IYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZkojrcD_0IYouTube</a>  This video also states J. Comet is 5\'6&quot; tall, 160 pds. No supporting documentation. If true it could account for how Majestic Ape looks like a sort of &quot;dumpy&quot; female while J. Comet looks fit. With awkard clothes and a bra I suppose his drag could transform him into a dumpy broad pretty easily. He is partial to heavy crocheted pieces and flats, which really don\'t do a thing for his figure.

<p>Voice - here is a recent radio interview with both Alefantis and Kleinman.  Hearing Kleinman\'s actual voice and comparing it directly with Alephantis\', he sounds a lot more like the voice, speech pattern and accent of Majestic Ape in the notorious &quot;Everybody Has Preferences&quot; video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkHPA0iSBbA</a></p>

            I disagree.  It's pretty clear that Amanda is using a pitch shifting unit to make her voice low.  If Alefantis did that it would sound way lower.

             In my opinion, Alefantis is using the pitch shifter to disguise his voice.  The effects used could also elevate his voice in pitchy places that might make it resemble a female.  Overall, I've heard that argument and listened more than once for the female pitches and have to say it is not "pretty clear" at all.  I've struggled to hear that female voice "over" or "under" the effect.  If you could provide a video and tell me on that video the exact seconds you hear the female voice, I would very much appreciate it.    Thx.
