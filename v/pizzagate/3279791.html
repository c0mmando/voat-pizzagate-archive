<p>PELHAM BAY -
Police say the man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl at a motel in Pelham Bay turned himself in Thursday afternoon with his attorney.
Police say the incident took place at the <strong>Hutchinson-Whitestone Motel</strong> on Westchester Avenue on Friday, Jan. 4. The man has been identified as Carlos Medina, 51, of the Bronx. He was charged with two counts of rape, predatory sexual assault, criminal sexual act, criminal impersonation, act in a manner injurious to a child and two counts of sexual abuse.  Authorities say Medina, who was caught on surveillance video, approached the victim in a black SUV on Elder Avenue in Soundview around 10:30 p.m. Police say he displayed a badge during the encounter.  News 12 is told the 12-year-old girl was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.</p>
<p>The manager of the motel told News 12 that an adult coming to the front desk to book a room with a minor is required to show an ID. However, the manager says he left the 12-year-old girl in his car.</p>
<p>The manger also adds he doesn\'t know if the suspect was asked to show an ID to the front desk person because he wasn\'t working that night. <strong>He says they don\'t ask for identification for regulars and won\'t start now despite this incident.</strong> He does, however, say they will more cautious looking for new faces given that this suspect was a new customer.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Councilman Mark Gjonaj says he was incredibly disturbed by the incident.
&quot;There\'s a heavily populated community ... schools are in walking distance and we could\'ve jeopardized everyone that lives here,&quot; says Gjonaj.  Gjonaj says he reached out to the motel\'s manager regarding safety measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don\'t ask for ID from their regular customers?  Uh huh..  According to comments on that article the motel has a very sleazy reputation..</p>
<p>I can\'t find much information on the motel apart from the fact that the manager is Luis Pichardo   and then there was this odd video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Fw80pilNc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Fw80pilNc</a>   Check out the logo of the spa mentioned.  I\'ll look further into that YT channel when I have time as I see he\'s done lots on WeWork and we\'ve covered quite a bit about that company on this subverse.</p>
<p>And in 1992, a high flying Wall Street lawyer, who was leading a double life, was murdered at the motel by a young gay prostitute <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994910161misc2d7491796">https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994910161misc2d7491796</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On November 9, 1992, David Schwartz was found stabbed to death in a room at the <strong>Whitestone Hutchinson Motel</strong> in Bronx County. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some context as to who this lawyer was.  He is mentioned in this article and was a high flying lawyer at a highly corrupt law firm: 
<em>Lawyer of the Day: A Prostitute-Loving Cravath Partner?</em> - <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/lawyer-of-the-day-a-prostitute-loving-cravath-partner/?show=comments#comments">https://abovethelaw.com/2009/02/lawyer-of-the-day-a-prostitute-loving-cravath-partner/?show=comments#comments</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, aka the “D.C. Madam,” has a New York counterpart. From ABC News (via our sibling site, DealBreaker): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall street lawyers, investment bankers, CEOs and media executives often used corporate credit cards to pay for $2,000 an hour prostitutes, according to the madam who ran one of New York’s biggest and most expensive escort services until it was busted last year.</p>
<p>But prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office chose not to pursue any of the corporate titans, says Kristin Davis, who pleaded guilty last year to charges of running a prostitution business that used more than a hundred women.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the names ABC News was able to confirm on [Davis’s client] list: a partner at the Wall Street law firm of Cravath Swaine Moore, “looking for a party girl to come fully equipped,” [who] spent a total of $20,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the comments on the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>my mother’s second husband’s brother in law (i know i know) was an ex-cravath man, he was also had the creepy grey complexion of death and was quite clearly a closeted pervert who likely burned small asian boys with cigarettes . . i think it comes with the territory. . .</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, not a lot on that particular motel but whenever I searched for it another motel within the same vicinity kept coming up, the <strong>Capri Whitestone Motel</strong>: Google map <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/555+Hutchinson+River+Parkway,+The+Bronx,+NY,+USA/2815+Westchester+Ave,+The+Bronx,+NY+10461,+USA/@40.8278089,-73.850368,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28b2bec439747:0xa20ac1d3100e8f74!2m2!1d-73.8370819!2d40.8173845!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28b52221fe613:0x91cf1b4713c5de82!2m2!1d-73.8364157!2d40.8440447!3e0">showing the location of both</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2008 - A motel with “fantasy rooms” is getting some respect.
The Capri Whitestone Motel in the Ferry Point section of the East Bronx was just sold for $11.675 million to Baywood Hotels of Maryland. That works out to just under $123,000 for each of its 95 rooms.</p>
<p>The circa 1962, 33,000-square-foot building has over 190 feet of frontage and parking on its 98,000-foot lot. The sellers, Whitestone Motel Co., expanded the hotel back in the 1980s. </p>

<p>The other place that came up was :

<p>And that was interesting because of this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3094958/17428520">Buckingham Palace has announced that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get their own PR guru Sara Latham - Freud/Podesta, Clinton and Matthew Freud links...</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why would Podesta and Sara Latham be interested in a cleaning company at La Guardia?</strong> Well, just yesterday I was looking into a company called ISS because of this comment <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2074387/10231657">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2074387/10231657</a> . ..</p>
<p>The origins of <strong>G4S</strong> can be traced back to the Danish company Kjøbenhavn-Frederiksberg Nattevagt (Copenhagen-Frederiksberg Night Watch) - then merged with Securicor. Securicor managed detention at Manchester and Heathrow.</p>

<p>The Ferry Point/LaGuardia area seems like an interesting geographical area to research.</p>',

            The manger also adds he doesn't know if the suspect was asked to show an ID to the front desk person because he wasn't working that night.
            <strong>
             He says they don't ask for identification for regulars and won't start now despite this incident.
            </strong>
            He does, however, say they will more cautious looking for new faces given that this suspect was a new customer.

            Councilman Mark Gjonaj says he was incredibly disturbed by the incident.
"There's a heavily populated community ... schools are in walking distance and we could've jeopardized everyone that lives here," says Gjonaj.  Gjonaj says he reached out to the motel's manager regarding safety measures.

           They don't ask for ID from their regular customers?  Uh huh..  According to comments on that article the motel has a very sleazy reputation..
          </p>
          <p>
           I can't find much information on the motel apart from the fact that the manager is Luis Pichardo   and then there was this odd video:

           Check out the logo of the spa mentioned.  I'll look further into that YT channel when I have time as I see he's done lots on WeWork and we've covered quite a bit about that company on this subverse.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Wall street lawyers, investment bankers, CEOs and media executives often used corporate credit cards to pay for $2,000 an hour prostitutes, according to the madam who ran one of New York’s biggest and most expensive escort services until it was busted last year.

            <p>
             But prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office chose not to pursue any of the corporate titans, says Kristin Davis, who pleaded guilty last year to charges of running a prostitution business that used more than a hundred women.

            2008 - A motel with “fantasy rooms” is getting some respect.
The Capri Whitestone Motel in the Ferry Point section of the East Bronx was just sold for $11.675 million to Baywood Hotels of Maryland. That works out to just under $123,000 for each of its 95 rooms.
           </p>
           <p>
            The circa 1962, 33,000-square-foot building has over 190 feet of frontage and parking on its 98,000-foot lot. The sellers, Whitestone Motel Co., expanded the hotel back in the 1980s.

              FYI.  At one point I found a pic of Mateen Sr. in the halls of Congressstanding in the hall outside someone’s office. Hard to find now. Also he was going to or did try to run for President  of Afghanistan.

              Congressman Posey of Florida had recently had his district redrawn (2015) which included Pulse Nightclub (shooting occurred in 2016) . He was an avid supporter of  families with vaccine injured children. Earlier in 2014, CDC vaccine whistleblower Dr. William Thompson had sent posey ALL of his evidence of CDC corruption regarding scientific fraud committed by the CDC vaccine safety researchers to cover up evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and an increased risk of autism, especially in African-American young children.  Hmmmm.

              Bill Posey Leads the Fight Against Human Trafficking
             </p>
             <p>
              "“Zonta International has been fighting human trafficking for over fifteen years. The Zonta Club of Melbourne has been very active in the fight by making our own community and beyond aware of human trafficking and how rampant this horrific crime has become,” said Claire Ellis, the vice co- chair of the Space Coast Human Trafficking Task Force and Anti-Human Trafficking Chair of Zonta Club of Melbourne.
             </p>
             <p>
              “We are very active in the Space Coast Human Trafficking Task Force,” Ellis added. “Congressman Bill Posey’s Symposium on Human Trafficking in conjunction with the Space Coast Human Trafficking Task Force will provide training for health care professionals and law enforcement, who are more likely to come in contact with traffickers and victims and therefore be able to recognize the signs and know what to do.”"

               "The Royal family, the Windsors, are not Jewish. They run the Protestant Anglican Church of England. They also run The Pilgrims Society which obviously is a Royalist organization, first, last and foremost. There have been three Rothschilds in The Pilgrims to the extent of the incomplete info I have, but the famous finance family has had many more representatives in the Society. It appears that William Winters is one of those Rothschild representatives, proxies and/or associates."
              </p>
              <p>
               "William Winters, Pilgrims Society, is a board of directors figure in NOVARTIS which traces to 1758 in Switzerland. Headquartered in Basel Switzerland, Novartis reported 126,000 employees as of 2017 info and $7.7 billion net income; operations in 155 countries. So! William Winters definitely is a PILL-GRAM pushing synthetic chemical Pharma pills with hundreds of untoward side effects, and this Standard Chartered Bank he’s heading, plus his past links with silver shorts Bear Stearns and Morgan Chase Bank, involved in massive thefts of countless trillions of grams of silver and gold! Despite being
headquartered in Switzerland, that nation and Italy have banned Novartis flu vaccines

               recalled The same suspension occurred in France, Spain, Germany and Canada in 2012."
              </p>
              <p>
               "Being as Winters connects Novartis pharma behemoth to Standard Chartered banking titan, and considering SC’s historical opium for silver activities, the question should be asked, “How much seed capital for what became today’s Big Pharma came from the British opium “trade” in China and the Far East?”"

                I think it was political opportunism. The people behind vaccines don't mess around. Even Trump has backed down from them a bit. It is in Israel's interest to keep up the Islamic divide.

              Interesting.  A comment on the DM article:
              <em>
               G4S is directly linked to the Clinton crime family by way of Schroders bank (where they have assets stashed), Might as well add these victims to the Clinton body count.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              That led me to a few interesting links, including this one:

               ..A year before World War II ended, high-level Nazi officials, industrialists and bankers held a secret meeting on August 10, 1944 at the Hotel Maison Rouge in Strasbourg to develop plans to protect German economic assets, by that time, in the inevitable Allied victory. Among those present were  representatives from the

               ..After leaving the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker became chairman of J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co, the prominent New York investment bank formed in 1992 (“Other 13.” Washington Post, Mar. 3, 1992). James Wolfensohn would head the World Bank in 1995.
