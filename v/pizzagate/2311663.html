<p>Documents Detail FBI Investigation of Scientology that Never Resulted in Charges (May 2017):  <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/documents-detail-fbi-investigation-of-scientology-that-never-resulted-in/2322624">http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/documents-detail-fbi-investigation-of-scientology-that-never-resulted-in/2322624</a></p>
<p><strong>From the article:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;What happened to the investigation? And why didn\'t it result in charges?</p>
<p>For its 2013 report, the Times interviewed experts who said the likely reason was a ruling in August 2010 by a federal judge in a civil case brought by two former Sea Org members, Marc and Claire Headley. The couple had sued the church, saying its harsh punishments and controlling tactics kept them from leaving for years.</p>
<p>The judge ruled in part that the First Amendment\'s guarantee of the free exercise of religion prevented the court from delving into whether the church\'s discipline methods were reasonable. To do so, the judge said, would &quot;entangle the court in the religious doctrine of Scientology and the doctrinally motivated practices of the Sea Org.&quot;</p>
<p>In any criminal case brought against the church on the same issues, the experts said, the burden of proof would have been even higher and not easily met.</p>
<p>News of the FBI investigation first surfaced in February 2011 when journalist Lawrence Wright mentioned it almost casually in a story he wrote for The New Yorker magazine about former Scientologist Paul Haggis, the film director.&quot;</p>

            I love how all you have to do to be anyone in Scientology is 1) buy a camera and 2) pretend to be an artist and 3) start taking pictures of yourself posting Satanic crap and 4) pretend it's hipster.

            Scientology, like all other cults, is a CIA opperation. L Run Hubbard's father was CIA, Hubbard uses mind control and seperates the children from the family and uses forced child labor. The current head of Scientology is David Mscavige, and he was formerly cited as a CIA source. Trump is a Jesuit and an occultist who was bailed out by the Rothschild family. He is not likely to take on his masters that placed him where he is, he is more likely to play out the role he has been prepared for, for a long time. Scientology also serves the purpose of demonizing religion, so their crazy ways are pointed out and criticism is encouraged by the propaganda press.

             Trump was bailed out by Rothschild money. Super ultra mega Insider. There doesn't seem to be a single aspect of the cabal he is not directly connected to. I hope people in here will stop selling the Trump disinfo psyop and the pretend behind the scenes war.
