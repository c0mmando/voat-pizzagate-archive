            There was a post on here a few weeks ago about these dolls coming from China I believe and being packed in child sized coffins. Was very creepy. Maybe another manufacturer?

           <p>
            You see what they are doing is getting us to debate if them using a sex doll that looks like a child will prevent them from moving onto children.
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn't matter. You are thinking about sex with children, you should be shot and many of us agree!
           </p>
           <p>
            See...I didn't even read the whole article. Not only did they find child sex dolls but also possession of children being sexually abused of course sick fuck. They are already fucked in the head don't be fooled into thinking they are not if they don't act on it

            Their defence is that fucking child dolls will stop them wanting to move to the real thing.  In fact, studies show the opposite.  Men who use child sex dolls then want to move on to real children.  All sex dolls should be banned

             Yes, I was just reading about that yesterday.  And in the UK some police chief says that they should not bother to arrest the low level viewers of soft child porn when studies show that these people tend to move on to more criminal activity to do with children.  We really have a societal problem with this liberal agenda to desensitize people to pedophilia in order to legitimize it with a softly softly approach.

             Yes, you are right. In a follow up article the journalist is referring to some "experts" -" Puppets can increase risk of abuse, but experts are unsure whether they can prevent it."  IMO that is an effort to normalize the use of children sexdolls....a prelude for later on normalizing pedofilia..

            Since autumn 2016 the Customs Service has identified several cases where Norwegian citizens ordering and importing Sex dolls portrayed as very lifelike children.

            It informs NCIS NRK.
Some of the recipients had previously been convicted of sexual offenses, several have access to children through work or family, and several have hitherto been unknown to police for similar conditions.
- I know that I react violently, when I see this. The first was seized in October, since then we have seized 21. We are worried and shocked, says Jørn Ferner Bergersen, Acting Deputy Director of Customs Administration's intelligence center, told NRK.

            NEW DEVELOPMENT: A total of 21 such dolls have been seized by Customs since autumn 2016. The dolls are about a meter long.

The dolls are about a meter long. Some dolls have been wrapped in blankets and children had children's clothing.
In addition, the packages have contained various processing equipment. The dolls are ordered by men aged 18-60 living around the country.
- malaise
- There is no doubt that you know what you order when you buy this online, says Bergersen and pointing at the doll who arrived on Monday.
- I'll simply unwell.
Customs Administration, together with NCIS chosen to inform seizures because they are concerned about the development.
- We think it is important for the socio-protective role we have at the border, says Bergersen.
Experienced customs officials who found the dolls should have reacted strongly when dolls were found, get NRK illuminated.
- We were not prepared for what we should pack up. I'm getting sick, said customs chief invigilator Birgitte Hansson told NRK.
four cases
Erik Rand, police lawyer in South Western Police District, said that they now have four cases under consideration. A person is in custody for two weeks on suspicion of storing abuse material.

            FOUND THE DOLL AND PHOTOS: Erik Rand, police lawyer in South Western Police District, said that they found both a doll and abuse images during an examination.

- The basis is that the police undertook a search of competent after we had suspected that he had introduced a Sex dolls designed as a child. During the search, police found indecent images of children in sexual situations. We will investigate this further and asked for custody to avoid prelude hands of evidence, says Rand, adding:
- The investigation will show whether it is the accused ordered the doll and he knew what he ordered.
Defender of the varetektsfengslete husband, Jørgen Berner Torstensen, says the client did not acknowledge guilt.
- He is now in custody for two weeks and sitting on the letter and visitation. Beyond that I do not want to comment on the matter, he says to NRK.
- An increasing number of cases
The doll was stopped by Customs at the airport, and prosecutors believe it under the Penal Code, section 311: "Production of child sexual abuse or representation sexualize children."
Penal Code § 311
