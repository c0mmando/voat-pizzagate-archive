<blockquote>
<p>A teenage girl filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Scores accusing the nationwide strip club chain of sexual abuse and human trafficking.</p>
<p>&quot;Jane Doe,&quot; a self-described developmentally disabled and emotionally disturbed teen, said in 2017 a male acquaintance brought her to a Scores in Tampa, Florida, where she said she was put on stage within 30 minutes and sent down a path of abuse, exploitation and prostitution.</p>
<p>The lawsuit targeted Scores Tampa but the plaintiff\'s attorneys said the allegedly reckless and illegal practices were consistent with the chain\'s business model.</p>
<p>&quot;Enabling and profiting from the sexual abuse of a developmentally disabled teenage girl is deplorable even by the standards of the adult entertainment industry,&quot; said Michael Dolce at Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Scores failed to confirm Jane Doe\'s age or identity or follow other measures required by law to combat human trafficking.</p>
<p>For the several days Jane Doe was illegally employed as a minor at Scores Tampa, her lawsuit said she was regularly put in the position of performing sexually explicit acts and was encouraged to take illegal drugs to numb herself so she could perform.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Scores Holding Company declined to comment to ABC News.</p>
<p>Scores, which has more than 10 locations in the U.S, returned to the spotlight in the 2019 film &quot;Hustlers.&quot; Jennifer Lopez\'s character was based on a former Scores dancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story coming out of Florida will hopefully draw more eyes to the subject since the Superbowl (in Miami this weekend) is often claimed to be one of the biggest human-trafficking-related events of the year. Especially so with the SB taking place at Hard Rock Stadium with all of HR\'s shady associations.</p>',

            Thank you for this post. Hope that people eeill be reminded to spread the word about this Sinful Event. Many fans bring their Children to the game not knowing what’s going on behind the scenes. A large protest across the street would tick them off.

             We’ve done posts on here before re the Super Bowl. The fans will be cheering and howling for their saintly stars while the Children are brought in for their disgusting pleasures. To add to the glory this year one of the commercials will feature drag queens. Nice family sport had gone down the toilet.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are not allowed to post info for petitions but I’m sure you can find it online. I plan on saying the Rosary during the Bowl.
