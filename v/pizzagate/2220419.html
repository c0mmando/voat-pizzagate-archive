<p>The Oakwood had once been called &quot;the largest singles complex on earth,&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oakwood Worldwide is a corporate housing giant with 25,000 temporary-living locations throughout the world. The Toluca Hills outpost, perched on a hill between Hollywood and Burbank, was never intended to be a destination for aspiring child stars. <strong>When Oakwood’s activities director, Rosie Forti — a 64-year-old former seamstress with bad knees and a dramatic swoosh of white across her short black hair — first joined the company back in 1973, her job was to amuse a population of swinging singles.</strong> ”It was just a free-for-all,” recalls senior property manager Brett Hughett. That changed in 1988, when the Fair Housing Act added an amendment that made it illegal to deny housing to families with children. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a place for swingers: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/03/13/oakwood-shedding-old-swinging-image/2f6dfb87-f55f-4453-8fff-cb3138e233ac/?utm_term=.7024e0344d36">Oakwood Shedding Old Swinging Image</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What clinched Oakwood\'s early reputation as &quot;swinging singles central&quot; was the fact that it was built by R&amp;B Enterprises, a California company that was well-known in the Los Angeles area for its adults-only apartment developments -- and some of the adults-only games the tenants were said to play. Thus, Oakwood\'s reputation was assured before the first brick was in place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Milano Apartments is a nondescript, 248-unit complex in Torrance that\'s just sold for *$60.75 million (it\'s likely to continue being apartments). Few would guess, however, that it began life in 1965, and enjoyed considerable national fame, as <strong>The South Bay Club</strong>, one of the first singles-only apartment buildings, according to the Daily Breeze\'s South Bay History. The swinging singles domain was featured in Time magazine and the LA Times, with each outlet getting more and more salacious interviews from residents, described by the former as &quot;500 single stewardesses, doctors, teachers, engineers, secretaries and salesmen&quot; (so you can probably imagine the shenanigans they got up to). The party kept going until about 1969 when the marketing plan (and name) changed, and the SBC became a dreaded Oakwood, but those first four years sound pretty nuts.  </p>

            Background on the beginnings of Oakwood:
           </p>
           <p>
            In this 2014 Forbes interview with Howard Ruby of Oakwood Worldwide
            <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/09/04/howard-ruby-the-father-of-corporate-housing/">
             http://fortune.com/2014/09/04/howard-ruby-the-father-of-corporate-housing/
            </a>
            , Ruby says the company’s first venture was intended to provide housing for employees of the space program and military.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Back in the ’60s, people were coming to California for the space program and the military, while the war built up in Vietnam. People wanted a place to meet others, so in 1965 we launched an apartment complex in Torrance called the South Bay Club. Our slogan was “Live where the fun is.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Ruby was fresh out of the Navy himself, having served as the supply officer on a destroyer that traveled the world.  “That exposure influenced the rest of my life,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Space program employees would have included those from nearby companies like Jet Propulsion Lab, which had been cofounded by occultist Jack Parsons and from which he was later expelled because of his association with Aleister Crowley’s Ordo Templi Orientis.

             I saw this article but didn't read it thoroughly and completely missed the space program and military references.  Thank you.

            I looked up some of the reports of Rick James' death and there were mixed reports.  Some were natural causes and others accidental death.  Hmm.  One said he took a cocktail of drugs.  Does this mean they were all taken at once like you do with a drink, or separately and  mindlessly thus causing someone to lose track of what was taken.  This also causes another Hmm.
