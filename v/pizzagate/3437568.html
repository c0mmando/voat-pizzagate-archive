<p>The Protestant equivalent of the Catholic Knights of Malta, also known as the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, gained greater credibility when the head of the British Empire HM Queen Victoria became their Sovereign Head in 1888.

<p>The unusually shaped Cross of Malta was the original emblem of the controversial Knights Templar, and was adopted as the official insignia of the Knights of Malta, when the Knights Templar were forced to submit to the authority of the Vatican.</p>

<p>The Order of Malta expresses its heartfelt condolences for the murder of the 35 year-old policeman (carabiniere), Mario Cerciello Rega, during the night between 25 and 26 July in the Prati district of Rome. He had been a volunteer for the Order of Malta’s Roma Delegation since 2009, distributing meals to the homeless and the vulnerable in Rome’s main railway stations - Termini and Tiburtina. His constant and regular commitment was carried out with such dedication and passion that he was awarded a Merito Melitense decoration in 2013. <a href="http://archive.is/ZCPML">http://archive.is/ZCPML</a></p>
