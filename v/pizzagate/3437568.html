<p>The Order of Malta expresses its heartfelt condolences for the murder of the 35 year-old policeman (carabiniere), Mario Cerciello Rega, during the night between 25 and 26 July in the Prati district of Rome. He had been a volunteer for the Order of Malta’s Roma Delegation since 2009, distributing meals to the homeless and the vulnerable in Rome’s main railway stations - Termini and Tiburtina. His constant and regular commitment was carried out with such dedication and passion that he was awarded a Merito Melitense decoration in 2013. <a href="http://archive.is/ZCPML">http://archive.is/ZCPML</a></p>

            Yes the Order of Malta and Knights Templar, etc, are all Freemasonic groups. None are Christian. Also, that cross has nothing to do with Christianity.
