Here is a look into those years, which as no surprise to me, was riddled with questionable associates, run-ins with the law, and debauchery. </p>
<p>It appears as though Alefantis began attending James Madison University in the Fall of 1993 and by the end of his first year had already gotten in trouble in the typical college fashion. The Breeze, the local student run paper, publishes the happenings of the University including police reports.</p>
<p>The April 28th, 1994 Edition had in its Court Files (Page 11) a report on Alefantis receiving a Public Drunk and Fake ID charge. <a href="http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/i19901999/495/">The Breeze</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219231829/http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1494&amp;context=i19901999">Archive</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Student James A. Alefantis, 19, of McLean, charged with possession of a fake ID and drunk in public on Oct. 24, 1993, was found guilty of both offenses on April 14. For the first offense, he was fined $50 and charged $26 in court costs. For the DIP, he was fined $15 and charged $26 in court costs. His case is being appealed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next mention of Alefantis in the Breeze comes in March of 1996, where he is served a Bench Warrant for payment failure. <a href="http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&amp;context=i19901999">The Breeze, Page 3</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219225717/http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1062&amp;context=i19901999">Archive</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Student James A. Alefantis, 21, of McLean, was served a bench warrant at the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house for failing to pay fines at 1 am. March 14.</p>

<p>Being served at the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity indicates he was a member of the fraternity, as Fraternities are going to be the ones coordinating and hosting the parties, not a random student at JMU. </p>
<p>This begins the decline of Alefantis\' college career; the point where he realized he wasn\'t any &quot;good at college&quot; and shortly drops out following the next brush with the law.

</blockquote>
<p>All of these arrests related to the drug bust stem from the same fraternity that Alefantis was allegedly a member of, and one can see that it appears as though Alefantis was arrested on drug charges only a few months before the huge drug bust goes down. Being exposed to these individuals, it can be argued Alefantis could\'ve obtained the skills necessary to run an illegal operation successfully. </p>
<p>Apart from this revelation, the Fraternity Alpha Chi Rho had many issues throughout the 90s, culminating in their expulsion before the new millennium. Alefantis being served a Bench Warrant leads to suggest that he was in charge of the social aspect or risk management of the fraternity at some point during his college vacation, as many fraternities have a position for these.

           There are many more examples one can find by searching the Breeze Archives. This brief insight into Alefantis' early life demonstrates that archives can help elucidate material previously thought unsearchable by search engine. His history can help reveal clues, trends, potential leads to associates, and evidence if people take the time to search.

            -be me
-be pansexual
-raised in the 1990s 
-watched a lot of South Park as a kid as it just came out
-met many fellow uberdykes and ultrafags
fellow LGBT+  pals had a similar sense of humor, irl and online (guess I got lucky?)
-ironically called ourselves dykes and fags to take the piss out of the words, like "nigga" in regards to black people, for example. I suppose I felt that when anyone else said it to us in an attempt to break us, it was a means to say, "your words don't mean fucking shit to us anymore. These are now our words now." 
-enjoyment out of using words formerly wielded against us for even more lulz and the deep discomfort of homo/transphobes grows on you over time. It's worth it.
-calling nazis "stormfags" generally makes them very, very upset. Which is why the internet refers to them as such. To piss them the fuck off.

            I believe Achilles "Lee" is his dad, and his grandfather was Louis George (1915-2001).  Greek Immigrant. And his great grandfather was George Louis. 
Susan is his mom.

            Etymologically speaking, the term "fag" is a synonym for "fasce", which is a bundle of bound sticks, often with a blade attached, used to beat someone into submission. It is featured on the American dime (clearly shown on the reverse side of the Mercury dime), as well as in many federal buildings. Fascism also comes from the same etymology. I'll leave you to contemplate the significance of this revelation on your own.

            I think this lead could be extremely important.    I actually always thought Alefantis's name felt a little too perfect (like he is probably a spook and it's not his real name).    Maybe I was wrong about that.     Or maybe this is where you will find out one way or the other.   Great work OP.

            Nothing about these younger years seems too odd. I'm thinking he really started getting involved when he had the art gallery in Georgetown. Georgetown was shown to be involved in MKULTRA in 1977. Podesta's went there, Clintons went there. Both went to law school.  The Wikileak email about beanie bays was directed to Georgetown Law staff so at least some had to know the code. I thought about making a post on this. Across from Georgetown Law are supposed student housing but I only saw one review for the, on Google which I found odd. Also on Google maps there is security to get in to the Georgetown Law area. Maybe that's normal. Saw a Youtube video about tunnels under at least part of the school.

            Another post with information that was already posted and removed for irrelevance and over half of this post isn't even related to JA directly. What the hell is going on with this subverse? His ridiculous antics as a college kid provide no information on what is happening with the CP issue. Come on mods!

             It should be considered relevant. There is no understanding to how long "pizzagate" could've been ongoing and this sheds light on a history that some have claimed nonexistent. It opens the door to potential leads to investigate while showing he didn't have a squeaky clean past that involved direct connection if not direct involvement in a drug and gambling ring. Fraternities easily have 30+ members, and some of his brothers he could've kept in contact with and potentially has more involvement with. Yes this has no mention of pizza, but this man is the cornerstone of Pizzagate and all parts of his life should be scrunitinzed for potentially illuminating evidence

              Ignore them. JA is a prime player in PG and any information on him can be helpful. And showing he has a prior criminal history with a shady fraternity is something we should be looking into further.

            I was in a sorority in college and went to every fraternity party of my now ex husband's fraternity during that time. I only saw 2-3 people drink enough to get sick. You'd have to drink a LOT to start hyperventilating and vomiting blood. He sounds like a complete degenerate even back then. The minutes containing a story of a rape and a gang rape doesn't sound like a joke. It sounds like a coverup to say it's a joke, but if they wrote it down, you can guess they were probably proud of it and trying to brag as a joke, but that it was completely serious. Nobody writes that shit down in the minutes. Unless they're completely insane.

             There's another report in the breeze of two guys throwing another in the lake behind the fraternity house at night. Then the guy who got thrown in refusing to identify himself. If you need a source I can link it

            I think fraternities are a front/gateway into this satanic/cult shit too. They also provide the connections to place "their people" in positions of power across the country after college.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think not being able to handle all the drinking and partying in college indicates a certain instability, that's my take at least. Probably lots of problems with alcohol and drugs in life. He sort of doesn't look very well for a guy in his early 40s either.

            That is a valid point... but most people who deal with drug trafficking don't end up trafficking people, especially children.

             <p>
              Crime kingpin King not only used his young victims as “boy toys” for gay politicians at after party Republican fundraising events during the Reagan and Bush years of the 1980’s, they were also used as drug mules moving shipments of cocaine out of California that Reagan and Bush senior deployed the CIA during the Iran Contra years running guns and money trade for cocaine from Latin America that flooded urban ghettos in the US creating the crack cocaine epidemic. King’s Franklin Credit Union was laundering drug money from the Iran Contra scandal. Another major player in Washington was lobbyist Craig Spence who longtime investigator-author Nick Bryant believes was a CIA asset that notoriously ran midnight tours with the boys to the Bush White House. King hired photographer Rusty Nelson to take photos of the politicians in compromising positions as blackmail insurance. Young victims were not only sodomized by the powerful pedophiles in Congress but often King would drug, sadistically burn and torture them for sexual sadism as well as terrorizing them for control purposes.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Paul Bishop arranged for Noreen Gosch to testify in August 1984, at the "Organized Crime Senate Hearings" in Washington, D.C., before Senator Specter. Books were made available by the FBI showing children in a Sears Roebuck type of catalog offering children for sale.
Noreen Gosch reports Paul Bishop eventually vanished without a trace. Suddenly the phone number was no good.
Noreen Gosch reports that it was to be years before she learned that the CIA was part of the International kidnapping and pornography ring. She and others have attempted to obtain copies of the catalog of children for sale and, "There has never been a single reply to any request to produce this document". She also attempted to obtain from the Washington Press Core photographs from the hearing, also with no success. Noreen Gosch reports that Paul Bishop was in his early 20’s and called her, "Mom". She now wonders if he was one of the "lost" children.

              If suspicions are correct, and Alfantis is also connected to CIA/MK ULTRA programming, these children were programmed for homosexual prostitution, drug running, and spying/espionage for purposes blackmail.
Some were also used to lure other children to a car in kidnapping set ups.

            LMFAO!! What a tool. That being said, I'd put down a huge bet and say Jimmycomet was in the CIA mind kontrolle program as a child and likely experienced horrific, sick, evil shit done to him at an early age. This actually makes me feel a bit sad for him, but not the fact that he turned the tables and is now an abuser himself. The illuminati is fucked all the way around, you can't win, they kill their own at a moments notice. People are expendable to them. Lunatic psychopaths.

             Yeah, it seems they view the whole as greater than the sum of its parts but in a really twisted way.  Like Hot Fuzz so aptly put it, "the greater good."

            Great work, very informative. I think we should start finding out who went to college or highschool with James and reach out to them. See if we can get any details on what sort of character James was back then, who knows he may have shown signs of psychotic traits which would only validate our cause even more

            This information supports my view that much of the decadence of modern America is not due to the nasty gays, but to the fraternity culture entrenched in most American colleges and universities. This is the true breeding ground of evil.

              It wasn't a "rape memo", it was a recording of a rich, successful guy bragging about how women let him do whatever he wants because he is so famous.

             LOL. Mens clubs have been a cornerstone of this country. The gay lobby and Hollywood brainwashing people to absurdly estimate that  gays constitute as much as 10% of the population is recent.  Your view is asinine to say the least.

              And yours is factually and morally questionable. Some of the loudest vocal supporters of this investigation are LGBT, so what in all the fucks on earth are you on about?

               loud is not wide, can you source the LGBT support, it is not my experience.
I find the progressive media silence deafening.
I am interested in evidence to the contrary.

                Uh, what..? Are you implying that the people that I personally know have mysterious sexual orientations unbeknownst to me? What other PizzaGaters would I be referring to otherwise? There are other people who are well-known and openly "out" who've been calling for an investigation (YouTubers, smaller celebrities, etc)pretty publicly anyway. I am confused as to what your motives are for challenging me on something so irrelevant to the investigation in the first place, but ok.

             I don't think its a problem for the average person. In regards to Alefantis I think, particularly the non-payment of his fine, which was paltry shows his lack of regard for the law, and further ties in to his blatant displays of pedophilia, and its also troubling that this man is the 49th most powerful man in DC and involved with the worst, most powerful and immoral propagandist going.

              Cops gave me a fine too. Like fuck I was going to pay over a hundred dollars for drinking a beer in the park after work. If not paying a ticket on a bullshit law is having a "lack of regard" for bullshit laws, then I guess we both are guilty of that.

              Lots of people engage in self-regarding actions that cause police intervention (doing drugs, drinking underage, selling drugs to people who are literally asking for them) I think the focus regarding his illegal actions should be related to fucking children.

               Hey I agree with you, there are laws I disregard, I'm just saying, chap is high up in the political world, yet clearly doesn't give a toss about laws, law enforcement etc. I think it just further illustrates the company the higher ups keep. I don't know why the likes of Clinton Brock and Podesta would keep a guy with this record so close, and by association help make him GQ's 49th most powerful man, I'm not condemning him for these actions, just saying that he is clearly not above reproach, and has not been since his childhood.

               While I agree that not paying a fine/doing drugs doesn't necessarily a degenerate make, at the very least it shows he has a history and therefore insider knowledge on trafficking rings.

              I've been out of my mind on drink and drugs and I've never raped anyone, from what I can remember at least. People have told me lots of wild and stupid shit I've done while I've blacked out, but raping someone is not one of those things. I understand that it's harder for someone with a vagina to be a rapist, but it does happen... By the current laws, when people have sex with me when I'm wasted and willing, they're raping me cause apparently "fuck me harder" means "no" if you're drunk.

               I didn't say that everyone who drinks heavily and takes drugs commits sex crimes, I said that most people who commit sex crimes do so while drinking heavily and taking drugs. I'm a 'true crime' addict and, believe me, this is true, especially for the really heinous crimes.

                Do you think they would have done those crimes if they were sober? If not, is it a case of taking the drug to loosen them up a bit (like having a few shots before calling the girl you really like to ask her out) or prepare them for the task at hand (kinda like how some people will do a bump of coke to help them through a shift at work)? Or is it a case of the drug making them psychotic and act out in ways they normally wouldn't (like a friend of mine who I guess was pre-disposed to mental illness, and ended up becoming paranoid and delusional after dosing)?

                 I don't think they would have - at the very least drugs 'loosen them up' and in many cases they do very much more.

            This is interesting. I'm curious to know if you or anyone has learned where Alefantis attended high school? As a resident of McLean, VA., he could have attended Langley High, very near CIA Headquarters.

             Yes!  Came here to say something similar.  I'd be willing to bet $$ that Elephantis is second generation from a spook family.  I think he's a CIA asset.  Mr Kiddie Brownstone-op fix it man.  McClean is to spooks what the upper west side is to banksters.  It's a breeding ground.

              Thank you! I searched and found a reference to Alefantis saying
"Yeah. I went to Georgetown Day School, down the street"

              I think that was a quote from him in one of his magazine profiles. Apparently no leads based from this? I'm sure it was looked into.
