<p>Did you know that at the State Department they have an exorbitantly paid employee, of Middle East background, who is in charge of the sex-trafficking brochures for the State Department? Did you know that same person refuses to cover this issue as domestic issue? This plays right into the hands of the Deep State cover-up of their child-sex-trafficking practices at the highest levels of government? This is tantamount to overtly supporting and covering up child-sex-trafficking and the State Department is the willing accomplice.

            ^^ TOTAL FAIL^^.
           </p>
           <p>
            Monika Wesolowski is an INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, NOT an employee. She claims that they have been "harrassing" her and "threatening" for LIFE for YEARS. All she has to do is NOT renew the contract! A job is NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE AND THE LIFE OF YOUR CHILD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking of her child, this woman was in the "alternative news" a few years ago claiming that she was being harassed and threatened over the custody of her son.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave Hodges is a DISINFO AGENT who EMBELLISHES details to make stories MORE DRAMATIC. He has been busted on Voat many times with bullshit stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this woman Monika Wesolowski is an attention whore/drama queen who for some reason is constantly in the news, over two different administrations, being the "victim" and having her "life threatened" all over a damn job that she could QUIT by NOT RENEWING THE CONTRACT.
