            Ah, so they're painting the image that he's antagonized by his mistake and wishes to correct them by over protecting children.  Probably the only correct thing I think I've seen them do throughout this whole operation.

            Is it one car or two cars? Just asking because of that handkerchief email mentions it. Yeah, maybe it sounds absurd or out of place, but what is a car? It's just a reference to a pile in one car instead of riding in two different cars, gossip-wise. It suggests there are two layers of information happening in the same text, doesn't it?
