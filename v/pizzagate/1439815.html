            Well the point here by Inquistir is correct, that way too much focus here is on jimmy-comet, and not enough on the real criminals.

           <h1>
            Pizzagate has taken on a life of its own, and its not a good thing where its going, its almost as if the HASBARA shills drove #pizzagate off reddit to voat, I note today a ton of Jewish bullshit about satanism and jusdaism, Hasbara troll/shills are working over time to prove that voat is owned by david duke
           </h1>

            Back to reality this east coast child-fucking was all started by Trump/Epstein back in 1980's to entrap politicians like the clintons and podesta's, now Trump is setting pretty nobody talks about him and Epstein being bro's and Clinton takes the flack,
           </p>
           <p>
            Jimmy comet is the fall guy in all this meaning, nothing good will come of this and nobody is helping the children,
           </p>
           <p>
            In the meantime sex-island is ok and trump/epstein are laughing their asses off
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein was setup by Mossad, Trump was a mossad/cia mafia front man for the casinos in the 1980's they made him rich, Epstein was brought in by Mossad and Trump introduced him to NYC/DC elite and epstein had everyone compromised, ...

            I still don't understand how we are labeled "alt-right" for this...
I also laughed when I read the hyperlinked, "One of the emails released by Wikileaks also pointed to a meeting between John Podesta and Alefantis, and there is a picture of Podesta
            <strong>
             holding a handkerchief with a “pizza-related” map on it,
            </strong>
            according to Washington City Paper. Anyone reading up on this mess hopefully knows about the handkerchief "map" email, and no, there was never any photo of alleged handkerchief, nor Podesta holding it, but hey, if you are going to scream about "fake news," might as well make up some yourself, no?

             Exactly.   The MSM also never asks any of the questions a reasonable journalist would:  These were your Instagram posts and who made these jokes?  You allowed them to remain there, right?   Did you find this funny?   Here's lyrics and videos from bands that you let play at your family restaurant.  Appropriate?   Here's a film you produced and play you produced both with Satanic themes.  Is that your chosen religion?   Instead, it's a pre-scripted piece that NYT/WaPo/HuffPo/Fortune/Bloomberg all run written by David Brock most likely.

             <p>
              And then I'd like to ask the question, "stepping back and looking at all the things said, and pretending it was all 'in jest,' who makes sick jokes like this about children? Repeatedly? While saying they are a cannibal, and posting creepy photos of themselves in drag covered in blood? And you think you are qualified to run a 'family-oriented' business WHY???"
             </p>
             <p>
              It's like Maria Abrahamovich (I probably screwed that last name up fiercely) crying "I'm NOT a Satanist. STOP!" on her twitter feed. Yet she has built her reputation with the Spirit cooking shit, and has the photo with the skinned ram's head, and has stated that "when performed in a private place, it's not 'art.' " Um....sure. If it WALKS like a pedo, and it TALKS like a pedo, and it posts pictures like a pedo...Well, I'm sure you understand where I'm coming from...
