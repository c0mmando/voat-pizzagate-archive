Not only were the officers involved, some of them would tip off the others which locations were under investigation in exchange for discounted prostitution rates. The law enforcement members who were arrested are Carlos Cruz, Louis Failla, Cliff Nieves, Giovanny Rojas-Acosta, Rene Samaniego, Giancarlo Raspanti, and Steven Nieves. Many other people were involved, as the NYPD did a three year investigation on this issue.</p>

<p>I think this goes to the heart of the pizzagate issue. While there don\'t seem to be any noticeable names involved, it shows how bad government corruption can be. (The first article does criticize Mayor De Blasio\'s policy of less police transparency but that is about it for public figures.) Here we had a government agency employing people involved in crime on the side. When some of the people doing the investigation found out, they tipped off the criminals so they could better hide their operation. </p>
<p>Two years ago, when pizzagate first broke, we were told to laugh it off by people like Stephen Colbert saying that Comet Ping Pong doesn\'t even have a basement (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfXWXNItF_Y)</a>), despite the fact the James Alefantis himself said it did a year before. (<a href="http://archive.is/03Lhm#selection-1585.572-1585.612">http://archive.is/03Lhm#selection-1585.572-1585.612</a>) All we wanted was the local police to do an investigation so we could know for sure if our worst suspicions were true. Instead we got this dumb &quot;I stand with Comet&quot; out of the D.C. police chief. (<a href="http://archive.is/jaUpf">http://archive.is/jaUpf</a>) Because the police chief wouldn\'t investigate, we were permanently labeled &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for even believing that a police force could be corrupt enough as to cover up sex crimes. I think this New York story shows how a police force can become corrupt. </p>
<p>I could have put this story on the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">/v/pizzagatewhatever</a> subverse but I know we have a lot of new Voaters and I wanted to take the time to explain to them part of why I still come back to pizzagate. I know many of the users on the new GA subverse were put off by the vulgarity on voat. While that is allowed here (and needs to be for free speech purposes) this sub is far too focused on investigative work to go around saying random nsfw words on each others\' posts. Also, we believe that claims should be backed up by evidence. Therefore, most of the discussion is based on connecting the dots to other previously known material. Blanket statements about race get down-voted if they have no evidence to back them up. If you don\'t care for the rest of Voat, you may like it better here.</p>',

           Two years ago, when pizzagate first broke, we were told to laugh it off by people like Stephen Colbert saying that Comet Ping Pong doesn't even have a basement (
