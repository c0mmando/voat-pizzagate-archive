            <p>
             ...Verde owns 111 industrial distribution facilities comprised of 18 million square feet of space in major U.S. distribution markets and gateway trade markets along the U.S. and Mexican border, as well as over 20,000 acres of land intended for future sale and development. Under new ownership, the company plans to expand its holdings and seek consolidation opportunities in the fragmented industrial real estate sector.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Verde, a Maryland real estate investment trust, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT that specializes in the ownership, acquisition and management of industrial distribution facilities.

            Sustainable movement..i.e. windfarms , total hoax on the American people. One was built near my house...owned by two hedge funds. Larry Summers was big in one....Rahm Emanuel the other. They had no money but got their loans through Deutsche bank, Credit Suisse and other slime banks. Tax payers and rate payers end up paying the bills for the wind farms and minimal power is produced. The money is made through renewable energy credits. SEC report on the corporations which built the one near me, says we do not have to produce power to make money. Wind turbines are a gigantic hoax, only perpetrated on the US and Europe through bribes to politicians. Trump getting out of the Paris Accord is a positive. By the towns and municipalities realize they have been tricked, it is too late. ...only politicians and corporations benefit. The name of the criminal organization which built the wind farm near me is First Wind......bought out a lot of Enron assets...founder of the group was next door neighbors in Italy to an important mafia type....all connected.
