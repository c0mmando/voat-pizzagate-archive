            So a customer of Comet Ping Pong likes an artist. That's what this post is about?
           </p>
           <p>
            And you baselessly call this woman's artwork pedophilia related?

             It could be nothing. It could be related to other pedophilia within artistic circles, which is discussed on other threads. I said that the customer of CPP left a comment that was a red flag
            </p>
            <p>
             "Super great pizza, on top of that. Love this place, and my toddler adores the cheese pizza!" Strange to note that the pizza is great, and then to note that your toddler adores the cheese pizza. I have a toddler, I'm in a stage of life where there are lots of friends with toddlers. None of them eat pizza, so again the comment stood out: why is the customer calling out the toddler's love for cheese pizza? So i looked into this customer, saw her art was NOT necessarily pedo-related, but that she had an interesting association: Buried Diamond. Buried Diamond is worth noting for anyone following pizzagate within the art community.

              NOTHING about Buried Diamond is pedo-related either.   And it's breathtakingly irresponsible of you to suggest it is.
