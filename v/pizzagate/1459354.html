<p>This painting is obviously &quot;see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&quot; and the artist is Keith Haring. 
He was flamboyantly gay, had tons of orgies, and then (surprise) died of AIDs. Again, could be coincidence,
but considering James\' deliberately chosen profile pic of a known pedo statue, maybe this is a nod to
his pedo customers.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

Are there any interviews that mention him and pandas?

            I mean pandas are cute and were kind of trendy for a bit. Memes are about more than just gifs and text overlays. What my link shows is that pandas were very much a meme, with or without text overlays. People like panda pictures. What's next a cat pic or someone linking to
