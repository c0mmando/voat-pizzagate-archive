            You cannot think that every idiot posting a YouTube video is connected to #pizzagate. Seriously. The Twittergate spreadsheet alone is over 25,000 links (Eclipse is desperately seeking people to help comb through THAT mess.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise, you cannot assume that the pedos who you are bound to trip across as you start to research #pizzagate are connected to the situation. Seriously. People are posting FB pages of alleged pedos, thinking they MUST be involved. The world is sadly FULL of sick, twisted, and evil people. They ARE connected in the fact they are sick, twisted, evil people. But connected to THIS situation? Not so much.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE don't assume and then post links, while admitting that although it seems "shady" and "weird as fuck," that you have NOTHING linking the shady, weird as fuck people or incidents to #pizzagate. You merely muddy the waters people are working very hard to filter through. If you think it connected to the situation, then please make more of an effort than just throwing random weird as fuck shady links here. This is not a repository for every weird as fuck pedo to be investigated. STAY FOCUSED. PLEASE.
This is NOT a "new link." This is just random guessing/witch hunting....(Gee, I think THIS person is a witch! Weird as fuck MUST be part of the situation!" No. Just no.
