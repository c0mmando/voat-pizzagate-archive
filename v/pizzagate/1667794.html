<blockquote>
<p>I am going to be as vague as possible, but I am here to give you all a few insights about what is going on here in Washington. </p>
<p>I will give you two hints of who I am </p>
<p>1) The individual I work for in Congress leans libertarian </p>
<p>2) That individual was not a lawyer before coming to Washington </p>
<p>There is absolute chaos going on in D.C. right now. I want to answer some questions of which I might be able to answer. I don\'t have info on everything relating to Trump or things of that nature, but I can promise you if you ask the right questions, I could probably give you all a lot of great insider info. </p>
<p>This is my first time doing this and I am kind of scared to be honest - so go easy on me. 
+++++</p>
<p>Very few people (not just members of Congress but lobbyists, media people, staffers, etc in D.C. are clean. No one knows what Trump is going to do and who he is going to go after. I can tell you with absolute certainty there is worry that he will deliver on what I think you all call PizzaGate (we call it PedoGate and have for years) and it will completely change everything. 
+++++ </p>
<p>The Republicans are in deep but not as bad as the Democrats. Just because I despise them, I can say with confidence McCain and Lindsey are probably going to go down. There is a lot of fear in neocon circles that Sasse, Flake, and a few others will go down as well. They are working on using fall guys on both sides of the aisle so only a few go down. If I had to predict it, I would say Sasse will be the R on with maybe McCain and Lindsey and for the D\'s, it will probably be Blumenthal after WeinerGate goes down. Schumer will survive all of this but I promise you he is the worst one here. DON\'T LET HIM OFF THE HOOK 
+++++ </p>
<p>it just depends. Most just do what they are told by leadership. Some are principled though. I work for probably the most moral member of Congress since Ron Paul. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Of course McCain has been leaking some of this stuff. He is guilty of treason on about 30 accounts. No... literally. Just look up his dad and you will know who he serves. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Some of them are actually legitimate pedos who like single digit aged kids and it is my hope they get the death penalty. But the truth is most of them are just idiots who met girls in private bars (sometimes 15 or 16 year olds with fake ID\'s) and get video taped in wired rooms. Even good people in Congress who I am sure you all like is guilty of this. Israel is the master at this by the way. AIPAC is not the most powerful lobby in Washington D.C. because they have all the money. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Here is a secret nugget for you all that you probably don\'t know about. Any time we talk about sensitive issues like this, we literally just write it on a piece of paper and carry conversation like that. I am not even kidding. NSA tracks everything we do in our office, so we have to be very careful. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Hahaha it is not Rand but you are very close. Rand is a good man. It bothers me a lot how many diehard supporters of his father don\'t respect Rand very much. Rand is here to actually get shit done and is ok with playing the game a little bit... but he won\'t do anything evil (if you know what I mean). One little secret I will tell you about Rand is he very much regrets going to Israel a few years back. He learned his lesson. You will see him continue to support Trump as much as possible without giving up on his key issues (civil forfeiture, NSA spying, interventionist foreign policy, etc). If Trump doesn\'t get impeached or killed and is relatively successful, I think he will win again in 2020 and Rand will run in 2024. He might even win. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Ryan, Pence and Priebus will probably be the fall of Trump. I honestly don\'t understand how Priebus is still in there. Believe it or not, McConnell is actually an asset for Trump right now. That might be surprising to you guys. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Gowdy is a good guy but make no mistake, he is not perfect. There is a reason he initially supporter Rubio. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Our constituency is very very very Pro-Trump... maybe that can give you a clue of who I am. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Yeah, just realized I did. Sorry about that. I thought in my previous answers I already told you I knew. We have talked about it and we believe it is real. It will all start with Weiner. I heard that could start on Friday but you never know. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Yes. Good man. But he is bought and paid for sadly. He, like Gowdy, didn\'t support Rubio for idealogical reasons. 
+++++ </p>
<p>One thing I have learned with guys like Schumer and McCain over the years I have been here, they are so connected that they will always have fall guys for everything they do. It is possible Lindsey will be that for McCain. But Sasse and Flake are other possible options. Look into current Congress members with deep ties to Hastert and use that in the future to put pressure on them. You guys need to realize how much power the internet has nowadays, you guys do not go unnoticed and that is why Washington is so freaked out. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Obviously, I feel like this isn\'t even worth answering but I will say the CIA has their fingers throughout the mainstream. Particularly Time Warner, Disney and Viacom. 
+++++ </p>
<p>Trust me, I agree. I guess we will have to keep trying. I know my boss sure is. 
+++++ </p>
<p>I can tell you right now no one knows. Not even Trump. The deep state is doing everything in their power to bring him down. Pence is the most dangerous man in America right now. 
+++++ </p>
<p>I don\'t know who Webb is but I know Haiti has always been the most sensitive subject for the Clintons. All bets are off concerning what has happened there. I wouldn\'t be surprised if everything you said is true. 
+++++ </p>
<p>I\'m gonna go now. I don\'t have all the answers. I am not as connected as some of you might think. I just wanted to give as much as I could. Take care guys.</p>

            LARPer? Maybe. One thing I know for sure though is high ranking members of the US Military took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC.

            Is it possible military men and women are caught up in this? Yes, but most are clean. They would never rape a child. Only politicians, staffers, lobbyists, lower level analysts and poges would ever rape a child. (Poge?

            The military brass took an oath and they're not about to forget it. Have no fear. The CIA and the Clinton Foundation don't have several Divisions of Mechanized Infantry backed up by stealth bombers and fighters and 5 aircraft carriers and on and on. They just don't.

            The gigs up. The CIA and the Bush/Clinton crime family know their Goose is Cooked. We know their Goose is Cooked. At some point this will go viral, it'll hit a critical mass, the Math behind exponential growth is Dark my friends.

            You'll know it when it happens, it'll be so big the fiber and wire of the Interwebs might melt and the Earths magnetic poles may switch. Just remember to bring your soda and pop-corn.

             Do you think insider is right when he says it could all start happening Friday? Can't decide myself if he/she is a LARPer. Friday sounds good to me, though!!!!!!!!!!!

              "start happening".........I don't know the date when this thing "happens" officially. I don't think anyone knows the exact time.
             </p>
             <p>
              All I know is it WILL happen, it's impossible for it not to happen at this point. There's too much evidence and the evidence is so horribly sickening the only thing we need to worry about is people literally trying to dismember the perps in some sort of French Revolution "Reign of Terror v2.0".
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure many perps were blackmailed into this and have been praying for it to end. The key is getting the perps at the top, the Bush's, the Clintons etc.
