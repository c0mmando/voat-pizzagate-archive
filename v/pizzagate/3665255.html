<blockquote>
<p>In December 2007, Mrs. Wexner formed the YLK Charitable Fund, according to Internal Revenue Service records obtained by The Dispatch. A month later, Epstein, who recently had been accused of having sex with children in Florida, donated $47 million to the fund through his company and his own foundation.</p>
<p>It would be the only money donated to the fund, according to records.</p>
<p>Epstein for years was a Wexner financial advisor and in 1998 was identified as president — along with Wexner — of the <a href="https://newalbanycompany.com/about-us/founders/">New Albany Co.</a> in Ohio business records. Epstein owned land in the New Albany development, including a home on King George Drive that he owned from 1994 until selling it for $0 to the Wexners in December 2007, shortly before he donated money to Abigail Wexner’s YLK foundation.</p>

<p>Thanks for that link <a href="https://voat.co/u/planncktonne">@planncktonne</a> </p>
<p>&quot;The Wall Street Journal reported on a letter that solves at least a portion of the mystery. Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of Limited Brands who was Epstein’s only well-known client, told members of his foundation that Epstein “misappropriated” more than $46 million of his wealth. Wexner says he figured this out as he was cutting ties with Epstein in 2007, the first time Epstein got in legal trouble over his sexual abuse of minors.</p>
<p>The letters YLK are the initials of Mrs. Wexner\'s late father, Yehuda L. Koppel <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Yehuda-Koppel/6000000007948889569">(1917-2006</a>.  Mr. Koppel played an important role in the founding of the State of Israel as a leader in the (Zionist military group) Haganah. (Later Haganah had an offshoot group:  Zionist paramilitary group called Irgun. Reportedly a terrorist group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">Irgun</a> <sub>Two of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on 22 July 1946 and the Deir Yassin massacre, carried out together with Lehi on 9 April 1948. </sub></p>
<p>The YLK charitable foundation was formed in Dec 2007, Epstein donated to it in Jan 2008 via COUQ.</p>

<p>An SEC disclosure form shows that Second City Capital I received a total of $30 million in 2004 from two entities that share an address with Epstein\'s US Virgin Islands headquarters: COUQ Foundation, a nonprofit Epstein uses to fund science-related projects, and an entity called YHS LLC.</p>
<p>Two sources familiar with Second City Capital Partners confirmed to Business Insider that both investments were made by Epstein on behalf of Leslie Wexner, the billionaire founder of the L Brands, who is the only publicly known client of Epstein\'s purported services as a money manager to the hyperwealthy.<sub><a href="http://archive.is/2ZSva#selection-1708.0-1717.306">Jeffrey Epstein and Sen.

<p>Tax returns for COUQ Foundation show that the nonprofit first made a $3.8 million investment in Second City Capital Partners I in 2004. By 2008, it was worth $7 million; COUQ Foundation transferred its interest in the fund to a nonprofit associated with Wexner that year. </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/xcivj#selection-631.0-676.2">http://archive.is/xcivj#selection-631.0-676.2</a></p>
<p>In February 2008, a month after Epstein donated the money, Mr. Wexner announced that Dennis Hersch would replace Epstein as his business manager. Previously, Epstein had been Mr. Wexner\'s personal investment manager and a trustee of two Wexner foundations.</p>
<p>The timeline involving Epstein and the Wexner foundation overlaps a significant period in the investigation and prosecution of Epstein in the underage sex case. In September 2007, federal prosecutors drafted a 53-page indictment against Epstein that could have sent him to prison for years.</p>
<p>However, after nine months of intense negotiations, in June 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He also paid a settlement —  $5.5 million in total — to three of more than two dozen teens who sued him. During those nine months between the initial indictment and final deal, Epstein had time to put his financial house in order.</p>
<p>The obvious question is: If Wexner figured out 12 years ago that Epstein had stolen a very large amount of money from him, why didn’t he do anything about it? He could have tried to get Epstein arrested and indicted for the theft. He also could have sued Epstein civilly. Didn’t he want his money back? <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-epstein-stole-from-wexner-why-didnt-wexner-sue.html">http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/if-epstein-stole-from-wexner-why-didnt-wexner-sue.html</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is/was (early on during writing this post before so many other things popped up): Did Epstein pay back the money via donation to Abigail\'s charitable fund?  OR was it ever really misappropriated to begin with (meaning did that money essentially go from Wexner to Wexner, via Epstein). OR Were the Wexners helping Epstein hide/move Epstein\'s own money while he faced legal problems over his sex crimes against minors?</p>

<p>Also of interest: <a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3379428">https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3379428</a> which was about this <a href="http://archive.is/yYDvO">http://archive.is/yYDvO</a> in regards to Les Wexner and Jeff Epstein and public corruption, bribery plus information related to the murder of Columbus attorney Arthur Shapiro.</p>
<p>The fun never stops while researching this thread:   The State of Ohio Inspector General David Sturtz (deceased Sept 18 2015)  <a href="https://columbusfreepress.com/article/memoriam-david-sturtz-1937-2015">https://columbusfreepress.com/article/memoriam-david-sturtz-1937-2015</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1988, Governor Richard Celeste appointed him the state’s first Inspector General to investigate public corruption plaguing Ohio’s state agencies. Republican Governor Voinovich, elected in ’91, retained Sturtz as Inspector General until he began to uncover serious scandals involving the Governor’s family business in 1994.</p>
<p>Sturtz uncovered a vast network of corruption in Ohio involving <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/1997/dec/15/more-ohio-jail-construction-corruption/">unbid jail contracts</a> going to the so-called “V” Company owned by Voinovich’s family; ties between Les Wexner and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lindner_Jr.">Carl Lindner, Jr.</a>, organized crime and the CIA; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coingate_scandal">“Coingate” scandal</a> connected to the Ohio Bureau of Worker’s Compensation and their money laundering into the George W. Bush campaign. As a result of these investigations, Voinovich fired Sturtz in 1994.</p>
<p>After Voinovich removed him, Sturtz was hired to investigate the <a href="https://www.thelantern.com/1998/08/mayor-relieves-police-chief-of-responsibilities/">corruption of Columbus Police Chief James G. Jackson</a>. One of the things Sturtz was able to establish is that Jackson destroyed the Shapiro murder file – a report linking Wexner to the Gambino family of New York City through ties to the Debartolo family in Youngstown. He also was one of the first to investigate infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Wexner’s confidant and fixer.</p>

            In February 2008, a month after Epstein donated the money, Mr. Wexner announced that Dennis Hersch would replace Epstein as his business manager. Previously, Epstein had been Mr. Wexner's personal investment manager and a trustee of two Wexner foundations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The timeline involving Epstein and the Wexner foundation overlaps a significant period in the investigation and prosecution of Epstein in the underage sex case. In September 2007, federal prosecutors drafted a 53-page indictment against Epstein that could have sent him to prison for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, after nine months of intense negotiations, in June 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He also paid a settlement —  $5.5 million in total — to three of more than two dozen teens who sued him. During those nine months between the initial indictment and final deal, Epstein had time to put his financial house in order.
           </p>
           <p>
            The obvious question is: If Wexner figured out 12 years ago that Epstein had stolen a very large amount of money from him, why didn’t he do anything about it? He could have tried to get Epstein arrested and indicted for the theft. He also could have sued Epstein civilly. Didn’t he want his money back?

           My question is/was (early on during writing this post before so many other things popped up): Did Epstein pay back the money via donation to Abigail's charitable fund?  OR was it ever really misappropriated to begin with (meaning did that money essentially go from Wexner to Wexner, via Epstein). OR Were the Wexners helping Epstein hide/move Epstein's own money while he faced legal problems over his sex crimes against minors?

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            1988, Governor Richard Celeste appointed him the state’s first Inspector General to investigate public corruption plaguing Ohio’s state agencies. Republican Governor Voinovich, elected in ’91, retained Sturtz as Inspector General until he began to uncover serious scandals involving the Governor’s family business in 1994.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sturtz uncovered a vast network of corruption in Ohio involving
            <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/1997/dec/15/more-ohio-jail-construction-corruption/">
             unbid jail contracts
            </a>
            going to the so-called “V” Company owned by Voinovich’s family; ties between Les Wexner and

             Carl Lindner, Jr.

             “Coingate” scandal
            </a>
            connected to the Ohio Bureau of Worker’s Compensation and their money laundering into the George W. Bush campaign. As a result of these investigations, Voinovich fired Sturtz in 1994.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Voinovich removed him, Sturtz was hired to investigate the
            <a href="https://www.thelantern.com/1998/08/mayor-relieves-police-chief-of-responsibilities/">
             corruption of Columbus Police Chief James G. Jackson
            </a>
            . One of the things Sturtz was able to establish is that Jackson destroyed the Shapiro murder file – a report linking Wexner to the Gambino family of New York City through ties to the Debartolo family in Youngstown. He also was one of the first to investigate infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Wexner’s confidant and fixer.

            Though the page is titled BLOOMBERG CONFRONTED FOR BEING IN EPSTEIN’S LITTLE BLACK BOOK the interesting part of the piece is that somebody uncovered the fact that Alexander Djerassi, who is Ghislaine Maxwell’s nephew, was a high-ranking official in Hillary Clinton’s State Department. There's mention of Alexander's brother, Dale, and connections to the Bronfmans and NXIVM and the art world, in particular an anti-Christian piece
            <em>
             ‘St. Batman Crucifixion’
            </em>
            which caused problems for Clinton.

             The Friends of Libya group was an international collective established to support the Libyan National Transitional Council in their effort to overthrow the regime of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. It was hosted by western nations and members of the Arab League, and known by a variety of other names including the Libya Contact Group and the International Contact Group for Libya.[1]
            </p>
            <p>
             The Contact Group was set up following the London Conference on Libya in March 2011.[2][3] The conference included United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, prominent delegates from the Arab League and from European countries, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and representatives from NATO. Leaders of the Libyan National Transitional Council including Mahmoud Jibril were consulted prior to the conference but did not attend.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
             Its first three meetings were in Doha, Rome and Abu Dhabi.[4]
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In its fourth meeting, held in Istanbul in July 2011 and attended by American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,[5] the Contact Group announced its participants' agreement to deal with the Libyan National Transitional Council, the major coalition of anti-Gaddafi forces, as the "legitimate governing authority in Libya".[6][7]
             </p>
             <p>
              The fifth meeting was planned to take place in New York on September,[8] but the events in Tripoli forced the members to meet again in Istanbul on extraordinary meeting on 25 August to set up road map for construction of "new Libya".[9][10]
             </p>
             <p>
              The group recognized the progress made by the Libyan people, NTC, and NATO forces, and underlined the importance of continued support from all entities in the formation of a free and democratic Libya.[11]

              At the meeting on 1 September 2011 in Paris, the Contact Group was dissolved and replaced with a new international meeting group called the Friends of Libya.[12][13]

               So aside from this quagmire (for now): 1994 Edmund James, president of James and Donohew Development Services, negotiated with Southern Air Transport (
               <em>
                CIA run airline
               </em>
               ) and announced that it was locating to Rickenbacker International Airport in Columbus, Ohio. Much of the Hong Kong-to-Rickenbacker cargo was for Leslie Wexner's The Limited Inc. Governor George Voinovich stated: “I am extremely pleased to welcome Southern Air Transport to Ohio, as it will be the first airline to have its world headquarters located at Rickenbacker Airport. This will help Columbus tremendously in becoming a world-class inland port.”[9]

              <p>
               ...I found it curious that Wexner's father-in-law helped create the Nation of Israel.

               YLK are the initials of Mrs. Wexner's late father, Yehuda L. Koppel (1917-2006. Mr. Koppel played an important role in the founding of the State of Israel as a leader in the (Zionist military group) Haganah. (Later Haganah had an offshoot group: Zionist paramilitary group called Irgun that behaved essentially as a terrorist group.  Two of the operations for which the Irgun is best known are the

               The YLK charitable foundation was formed in Dec 2007 (
               <em>
                presumably as a memorial,  Mr. Koppel died in 2006
               </em>

                Epstein donated to it
               </a>
               in Jan 2008 via COUQ just as investigations were coming to a head.
              </p>
              <p>
               One might say that the Wexners, somewhat like Robert Maxwell and Edgar Bronfman Sr., (but not as much as Marc Rich did),  have Israel in their debt.  That may have had come in handy when Epstein became a liability.  But that might be off the mark, a lot of people probably rested easier once Epstein was choked to death under 'high security' circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
               So when "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu challenged Ehud Barak
               <a href="http://archive.is/53twZ#selection-2567.323-2567.357">
                <em>

                </em>
               </a>
               to explain why he was paid over $2 million by the Wexner Foundation in 2004 (for what was described as a research program) when Epstein was among the foundation’s trustees" he probably should paused to and had a bit more respect.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hard to keep track of how much the Wexners paid Ehud Barak:  "... the Wexner Foundation paid “consulting fees” to Ehud Barak of $1 million in 2004 and $800,000 in 2006.  In 2005, The Leslie H Wexner Charitable Fund paid Ehud Barak $505,000 in “consulting fees”."  Cheaper than paying Hillary though /s

              <p>
               Curious that Wexner traded multimillion dollar real estate with Epstein in exchange for less than a kid's lunch money.  (Or maybe it was in exchange for kids /s)

               IMHO, tho, Israel can't be last without Canada being last too.  Because Wexner, and prominent Canadian Zionists are joined in business.  Too much to lay out in detail.  But here's info to connect dots and just for reading.

             Thank you!  I started digging and am still knee deep in it.  I started out based on your research, hoping to dovetail info into it at some point.  A lot of it involves businesses and obscure, incestuous connections between them, involving Wexnar, Epstein and Belzberg and Bronfman(s) plus others.  Corrupt Canada and corrupt Ohio!  Too much to lay out yet

              Yeah, the tangled web they weave is really exasperating. You need a whiteboard the size of China to keep track of it all.

               Example:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The ownership of Edper Investments Ltd. was held by the personal trusts of brothers Edward and Peter. Its structure changed after 1989, but for most of its existence it was owned by the private trusts of each brother. The Edper corporate empire was noted for its intricate web of ownership and control that extended from the top tier. Its organizational structure was described as "very, very complex" and "dizzying"[4] Through careful use of labyrinthine accounting and complex strategies and corporate structures, Edper capitalized on Canada's relatively lax securities laws, tax laws, and disclosure requirements that resulted in its rapid growth into a highly complex, pyramidal empire of interwoven companies and cross-ownership. Edper controlled but did not own many companies. Privately held Edper could own a controlling stake in one public company that would hold a controlling stake in another public one that would hold a controlling stake in yet another, without having to use much of its own money. Other strategies used were cross-ownership and partial ownership of a parent company by its subsidiary and the liberal use of restricted or non-voting shares for public investors and super-voting shares for insiders. These enabled the Edper empire to raise billions of dollars without having to use much of its own money. During the Eighties boom, Bronfman-connected companies issued more securities than anyone else in Canada and raised more than $30-billion in equity.[6] In addition to the two brothers, who were heavily involved in the management of Edper and many of its subsidiaries, there were two other men who played key roles in the Edper group's rapid expansion and management: accountant Jack Cockwell hired by the Bronfmans in the 1960s who later headed Hees International/Bancorp, Edper Equities, and Edper Investments; and Trevor Eyton, a corporate lawyer who headed Brascan Ltd. following Edper's acquisition.[6][7]
