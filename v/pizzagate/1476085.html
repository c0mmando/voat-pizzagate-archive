            The former first lady, former Secretary of State, will try again after the defeat of 2008 against Obama tomorrow will announce his candidacy for the US presidency with a video entrusted to Facebook and YouTube To convince the most radical electorate focuses on social inequalities, wage and blocked mobility
Hillary 2.0, social networks and youth to bring back the Clinton White House
And the strategist of his campaign, John Podesta, preparing spaghetti peri journalists
FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT FEDERICO RAMPINI
NEW YORK. And now the enemy from bat-tere is called: inevitability. Yesterday the staff of Hillary Clinton has an-nounced a few everyone knew. Seven years after the terrible 2008, when the most favored in the democratic camp was beaten to the pri-marie by the young outsider Ba-rackObama, she tries again. Doma-ni will address the nation, with a vi-deo spread via members to the me-dia: YottTube, Facebook &amp; C. Already in that message will look for a to-no human, sympathetic, Seductive-you, motivating. To give the "the" in a campaign that has to be very different from the previous. Clinton aside, again, in pole position. But he knows how dan-gerous to race in the lead, has tried on her skin. Not only has one rival and have been declared in the democratic camp: there is time, however, this solitudinein summit gives an idea of ​​its strength. The movements of the base left prancing and bustle: Mo-ve0n, Dernocracy for America, have launched Elizabeth War-ren as a possible competitor, far more radical. For now, the War-ren does not fit. Yet Hillary takes seriously this challenge to his left. more and more often speak of social inequality, stagnating wages, blocked mobility, arrogance of the privileged-gees: precisely the issues that have re-know the famous Warren who was close to the Occupy Wall Street movement. Calibrate a message and a more shifted program sini-stra-especially in comparison to the centrism with which ruled her husband Bill - he is part of this co-
construction of a 2.0 Hillary. The -new Hillary Clinton-must riu-scire to repeat the exploits of two Obam to the victories of the president in 2008 and in 2012 were co-struite of an unpublished 'rainbow coalition': women, young people, they-re, Hispanics, Asian, gay. Apart from women, and towards Hillary avran-no special attention, the mino-rities who gave a push to de-cisiva Obama, are all to re-conquer. Youth, immigration-ti, blacks: it is said that they feel drawn by a lady 67en-ne, a professional poly-matic long-time, tied to dop-wire pious establishment, with -dinastiao touch that is the surname of the former presiden-yourself husband. This was the old imagelessness it Clinton. The new one must be built piece by piece to parts-King from the video-announcement tomorrow. In America, long the elec- t-ni first win on the per-centage of turnout. The rule is quite simple: if it goes the turnout, it means that they vote especially white elderly, the disci-plinata and faithful component, ie a elettora-to majority Republican. Why win a democratic de-Vono go to the polls en masse all the others: the New America, that is, ethnic minorities and the Sun-rooms. Hillary must focus on them, since ilTea Party already has a solid grip on America WASP (white anglo saxon prote-stane) middle-aged. But in the absence of rivali- at ​​least for now - in the field re-Democratic schiadi make his pa-radossalrnente task more difficult. A lively internal debate in the pri-marie generates attention, wings-mint passions, then creates a dynamic that can raise the af-fluence to the polls. The ineluttabi-ity, if becomes the first part of the Hillary campaign in a quiet stroll to the in-coronation of his party, on-sciterà more yawns than enthusiastic
smi. Luckily they will think the Republicans to focus on her enemy fire in order to create at least a little 'excite-ing. Dall'affaire Bangasi to emails destroyed, have already comin-ciated with raising scandals. One thing must be cautious: the temptation of sexism. God help us if the attacks against Hillary doves-sero look like an offensive against her as a woman, this error could be made-that of 2016. America's most important mission for Hillary is this: the show-you can breaking the final "glass ceiling *, as the Americans call them that-mild invisible yet real hindering the rise of women. This is the aspect most enthu-smantedella his campaign: Ledà a historical dimension, the race to break down the last barrier. While its video-ad spread vein, Hillary tomorrow will already be on the ground: at Iowa State, the first to host the primaries (in the form of "caucus'), that in 2008 forced her to a humiliating third place die-tro Obama eJohn Edwards. Que-is once Hillary does not want to risk re-runs, will not leave anything to the ca-so, he'll be careful not to snubbing any constituency. his pro-granuna election will look in particular to the economic, tentaredi to regain that-the middle class impoverished, im-paurita and discontented, that even after five years of shooting and 15 million jobs created, continues to suffer insecurity: its purchasing power has stagnated for thirty years. Meanwhile, his extra-tega electoral John Podesta has also inaugurated a new style with the press: preparing spa-ghettos puttanesca for gior-ists. a 'other -constituency "which in the past did not have easy rap-ports with the Clinton clan"
