They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture. ( http://sli.mg/senxlZ). </p>
<p>
Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members. </p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewish </p>
<p>http://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut</p>
<p>
Guess what else?  He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass. </p>
<p>"The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")." </p>

<p>
So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering  the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews. </p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up.  Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil.  The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism. </p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists.  Jews are Satanic. </p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said,  who was a Jew btw. </p>
<p>
" You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."</p>

Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.  </p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate.  The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics  and even names them. </p>

<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism.  I can show you  statements made by both  Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>',

            Anti semitism is totally inappropriate here.  You MUST LEARN to distinguish between good jews around the world, many of whom particularly in russia and the eastern block have been poor as dirt for generations.  The people trafficking in children for occult purposes are NOT legitimate jews.  They are occultists embedded within jewish culture.  They are satanic.  These are a tiny minority of world jewry.  But they are pernicious, indeed.
