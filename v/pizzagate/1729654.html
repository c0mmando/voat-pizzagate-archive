            Wow, a great story, and you are about my age too.  I know about the Presidio and at the time it was presented as an isolated event, but they can't pull that BS any longer.  With the Internet they can no longer hide or lie the way they used to.  We have awoken to this and are finally going to do something about it, thanks to the internet.  Before the Internet the paper could put out anything they wanted, like with the Presidio.  But today there would be much more information and pictures of what what as going on.
            <br/>
            I may be rambling but in the end, thanks for your story and from what it sounds you were hanging around a victim.
            <br/>
            If you look around the people have HAD IT with these 'elites' and 'politicians' and are going to do something about it.  We really have to thank the internet for connecting the people, the media and elites want us divided, hence racial and homophobic rants and so forth.  They cannot win if we are united!

            Very sad, disturbing. Are you working within the news industry or freelance? Please write more!
Also, if you can find out or remember the girl's name it would take
            <em>
             the internet
            </em>
            five minutes to locate her.
Thank you for sharing.

             I was in the industry for many years but am currently taking a break to write a book about a completely unrelated subject. You are right, it might not be that hard to find her.  I should ask one of my childhood friends who I'm still in contact with if she remembers her last name.

            So sad. God gave you a gift.  It's writing. Please help inform the world about all the Jessicas suffering today and for Jessica in SF.  Some of those pedophiles in that SF neighborhood that abused Jessica are still there abusing children. Now go tell the world the best way you can!

            Wow! Thank you for sharing this. I will confess, as I began to become more informed, I have had some incidents that had I known what I know today I would have been able to identify it for what it was. It is so important to share these real life incidents because it gives names and faces to this. Otherwise it is all theoretical . I too knew someone who said he grew up in a satanic family  that abused him sexually and physically, he was gay and in a relationship with an older man. I simply thought he wanted shock value attention. I did believe the satanic part but not the description of abuse, it was too awful and fantastical.  The older man also came from an abusive home where the father was a police officer and was accused of sexual abuse by all his children and nothing came of it....the father adopted 4 children from cps that he also abused viciously. I personally reported some of the abuse since I witnessed it. Nothing ever happened to this police officer family. I now suspect there was more to this family since the older one had pets named moloch and Azreal but he said these were names of angels. (Had I known then what I know today!!!) 
The details get worse: I forgot to mention The older one worked for a Haitian charity and oacasionaly went to Haiti. 
As for the gay couple the older one continues to work for the Haiti charity and the younger is in jail for child porn.
            <br/>
            ( I am convinced it is not a coincidence) knowing what we know today about Haiti. It is happening everywhere right under our noses and awareness is so important! We just did not know, ignorance and misinformation is how they thrive! The network is very powerful and I believe has been powerful for a very long time!
