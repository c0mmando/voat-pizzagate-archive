<p>This post is so much deeper than I can express here. High level institutional organised child abuse, big politicians named (including future accepted Jewish paedophile Greville Janner who was considered too ill to face trial), Leon Brittan (Jewish and named by many in paedophile allegations), Cyril Smith (now dead MP and accepted paedophile), Jimmy Savile, convicted rent boy abuser and ex MP Harvey Proctor and more... locations were also consistent with places that are known to have been used for abuse including Dolphin Square and military bases.</p>
<p>So a man, Carl Beech (AKA Nick) who came forward with statements about abuse by high level paedophiles. The evidence was so convincing that police invested £2million costs into the investigation and MP Tom Watson actually brought it up in Parliament.</p>
<p>This man, Carl Beech, has now been convicted of 12 counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice (I wouldn’t doubt that that number is deliberate.)  Now I don’t have the details or transcripts, but I have never known an alleged victim to be prosecuted for making statements to the police; even if the case was not considered viable (which it was.)</p>
<p>This stinks. Even the supposed left wing people’s (((newspaper))) has repeatedly attacked Carl Beech, including, ridiculously, blaming the fact his allegations were taken seriously just because he was ‘middle class’:

<p>CAVEAT - Carl Beech was found to have indecent pictures of children on his devices (admittedly a known set up tactic by the authorities.)</p>

            Carl Beech was today sentenced to 18 YEARS by the (((Judge)))
Meanwhile far, far more lenient sentences are passed on rapists, child abusers including non custodial sentences. I will gather this all in another post as it deserves it - and meanwhile the (((press))) asks for more protection for sex abusers saying ‘evidence is needed’ before names are released. And it is well known that the concrete ‘evidence’ they mean is very difficult to gather as sexual abuse cases especially historical sexual abuse are largely testimonial. I AM VERY ANGRY and concerned at this farce.....

            Definetely we must keep an eye on that blog. He or she seems to be in the UK, (also very anti Trump, who I'd like to be the one cleaning all this crap, but who knows...) If you just get carried away with who knows or hanged around at one time, everybody might be guilty... just look at all the connections aanirfan makes in her/his blog.

            The slaughter job is over the top. The main thrust of the defence is that ‘there was no proof’...... sorry what kind of proof do the court expect can be provided in this instance? The logic, the cover up is irrational

             In the trial of the child abuse whistleblower Carl Beech, the judge blocked the cross-examination of Harvey Proctor, who is alleged to have murdered children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The police searched Harvey proctor's home, at the Duke of Rutland's Belvoir castle.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Proctor's home, the police found whips, straps, blood-stained child's underwear and a notepads entitled 'Bizarrre sex'
            </p>
            <p>
             David Granby, aka the Duke of Rutland, is in Jeffrey Epstein's Black Book of contacts.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Duke of Rutland has been close to Ghislaine Maxwell.

             On 4 March 2015, Proctor's home, on the Belvoir estate, was searched by the Metropolitan Police as part of the Operation Midland investigation into allegations of historical child sexual abuse and related homicides. Proctor denied any wrongdoing in an interview with the Today programme. He retired from his job with the Duke and Duchess of Rutland on 25 March 2015, "with immediate effect".
            </p>
            <p>
             Proctor was questioned by the police regarding the allegations in June, and again in August 2015. He held a press conference at St Ermin's Hotel, London on 25 August 2015, and gave several media interviews. He described the inquiry as a "homosexual witch hunt", stating "I'm a homosexual. I'm not a murderer or a paedophile. I'm completely innocent of all these allegations."
            </p>
            <p>
             On 21 March 2016, Proctor was told that he would face no further action. He was the last living person under investigation by Operation Midland, and called for an independent inquiry into it, for the resignations of senior officers involved, and for his accuser to be prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.[14] Proctor wrote an open letter to all MPs published in the Daily Telegraph on 21 March 2016. The Metropolitan Police closed Operation Midland with no charges brought and no files passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. Proctor held a further press conference on 29 March 2016 and was interviewed on many news outlets including BBC, ITV, Sky News and Channel 4 News and BBC Newsnight programmes
            </p>
            <p>
             Following the publication of Sir Richard Henriques' Report on Operation Midland and other police investigations on 8 November 2016, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Police Commissioner for the Metropolis, apologised to Proctor and others for the over 40 mistakes made by the Metropolitan Police service in Operation Midland. He said Proctor was innocent of all the allegations. On 15 November 2016 Hogan-Howe met Proctor at Hogan-Howe's request in Dean's Yard, London and repeated his apology and said he was very, very sorry for the MPS's mistakes. Proctor sued the Metropolitan Police in February 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 10 October 2017, Proctor criticised Mike Veale, the Chief Constable of Wiltshire Police, for allegedly “trashing” his reputation a second time by reviving claims of an establishment paedophile ring. Veale had called for a fresh inquiry into claims of cover-up and conspiracy in Westminster.
            </p>
            <p>
             In June 2019 Proctor appeared at Newcastle Crown Court where he gave evidence at the trial of Carl Beech, who was accused of lying to police about the alleged VIP paedophile ring investigated by Operation Midland. Proctor said "The allegations are wrong, malicious, false, horrendous" and later explained that intense media interest, following the police raid, had led to him losing his job and then him deciding to move to Spain as the UK "wasn't safe". At that trial, Beech was convicted for making false claims against Proctor and other victims.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This is what Protor was found guilty of
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             June 1986, The People newspaper published claims that Proctor had taken part in sexual relationships with males aged between 17 and 21, in his London flat. The age of consent for same-sex sexual relationships was still 21 in 1986 (although 16 for opposite-sex relationships), and the following year Proctor was charged with gross indecency and resigned his candidature. He was succeeded as MP by Teresa Gorman at the general election the following year. At his trial in May 1987, Proctor pleaded guilty and was fined a total of £1,450. The offences he was convicted of can now be expunged on application.

            Total Establishment cover up. I'm from the UK been following this since it broke. Beech was handed over to Northumbria Police for investigation. I live in Norhthumberland, big county, sparse populous being 80% rural. Why hand him over here? Easy, our Police force are poor, easy to manipulate for Governmental funding. Met (London) Police are wealthy. He has no ties to the North of England. Exaro News which broke the story were shut down due to this case and their backing of 'Nick' Carl Beech. They've basically taken 'Nick' to the cleaners and then exonerated all those men who have MULTIPLE identical accusations from many many others. Lord Janner for instance. Leon Britton who was caught with CP at the UK border. Thatcher protected him. It doesn't take much digging to find out multiple accounts of the same nature reported to Police.

             Yup. Apparently a simple guy who was a nurse concocted this huge fabricated ( and very accurate) story, even convincing top policemen and MPs using his own imagination, even naming individuals and locations who/which were later to be found to be paedophiles or where such activity took place.

              He wasn't just a nurse. He was middle management in the NHS. This is a very very well paid job. You're looking at least $90,000 a year.
