             I'm glad a few people see it... Even I was watching hours of Milo talks just a few days ago. He's a very well spoken and politically entertaining speaker. However, You have to learn to let it go people, with new light comes new shine.. The fact of the matter is you're right and he is definitely pushing pedo vibes!

            Let's not lump the morally grey and the morally black together.  Sex with 13 year olds isn't morally equivalent to sex with 3 year olds.  One is a contention as to where someone is 'developed enough for sex', with social mores and upbringing playing an influence--the other is a categorical attraction to the undeveloped.  Only someone with impure intentions tries to equivocate the two.

             In any case, sex with a minor (13 years old) is NOT OKAY for many reasons... Can you imagine a world, where a room full of men use their intellect to manipulate youngsters(12/13) into sex because it's legally and morally acceptable... Is it okay to manipulate a young mind because you're horny, and think it "might benefit" them? I think not. The potential for abuse is far too great and that's the greatest point. There are other clear moral reasons however for Sexual activity being allowed at around 16-18 years old. Not 12 or 13.

            I'm not sure how to put this but I feel like I should chime in as a "left side of things" person. First of all I have to say I disagree with the assertion that Milo made in regards to someone as young as 13 being able to give consent. No someone 13 does not have the mental maturation to give consent to have sexual contact with much older people. That said I do see the gray area that I suspect he was trying to convey. In some places in the world even in our own country the age of consent is very low by my standards
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_the_United_States
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            so 16 in parts of the country. I personally think 18 should be the cut off but hey that's me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also know quite a few adults (gay and strait) that will admit to finding teenagers attractive. Lets be real some of them look much older than they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is there are a load of double standards out there and case specific things that muddy the waters. At the end of the day we have to draw a line someplace and that can create situations that are complicated.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a friend who was convicted of statutory for having a relationship with a 16 year old while he was 21. I think thats not okay personally but its a weird situations because the girl never had a problem with it and it was her father that found out and pressed charges. He and her remain friends to this day. In some other states this would not have been a crime. Do you guys get what I am saying?
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think this kind of thing is a bigger deal in the gay community and again sometimes the lines are a little blurry.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also individuals that are cognitively speaking older than others their age. This does not give adults the right to molest them but its a fact. I know when I was in my early 20s (and I suspect this is still an issue) it was pretty common for underage girls to try and lie about their age. So dating could be a bit of a mine field.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I have never been a fan of this Milo guy and I don't care that he is being taken down. It is very obviously however politically motivated.

            Why can't people hear his real words??? 
I will use Trump as an example.  During dude talk he said "you could grab them by the pussy and they would not care" he was speaking about gold digging whores. What libs heard is I grab women by the pussy. A shitstorm breaks out when people twist what was actualy said.

             Wait a second.... I'm mind blown.... Here is a Milo quote with exact wording. Please tell me which part I'm taking out of context and using it to abuse this poor innocent "victim" Milo.

               I have. Those points are not taken out of context. He means what he says here, point blank... He very passionately elaborates on how young 13 year old boys can severely benefit from sexual apprenticeship from adult males... I understand having sex at 16, I did myself, but what's with him advocating the 13 to 28 relationship?

                 The fact of the matter is, we as mature beings create the rules. If we create a rule set where manipulating a 13 year old into sex is okay, than the potential for sexual abuse is far too great. It is an un-even relationship. Similar to smoking pot, one must acquire the knowledge in due time... Not for greed or perversion should you stunt the growth of a minor.

                  I don't defend Milo's beliefs, as I agree they are abhorrent. I do understand why he may hold them, however, even if only to shield himself from his past. I can see an odd occasion where a 13 year old is physically and mentally mature enough to consent without undue coercion, but we cannot presume that is typically the case (and I doubt Milo was one of them) and let the age needle be moved that far back. This is far from the norm, and so an adult cannot reasonably assume this happens to be one of those very special cases, so MUST decline for that child's safety and sanity.

            No 13 year old is mature enough to give consent, not even homosexual 13 year olds period! Milo was giving his thumbs up, for an older man younger boy relationship. The whole TY father shit was beyond disturbing!

             Please enlighten me on how I've taken this out of context... Did you bother to hear Milo's own word? I %100 assure you have not heard a word he said...
             <strong>
              His own words on SEX WITH 13 YEAR OLDS
             </strong>
             is enough to disqualify him from the credible zone... Jeez, you organized shills are something else.

            None of us can see all the angles of this but I hope Milo at least has an offer of protection from the trump machine and is free to speak now. Either way he's going to be judged for what he says next. 
Stay alive and speak truth Milo.

             Dude, did you look at and hear Milos on words? He himself states sex with a 13 year old boy or girl is not only acceptable but healthy... Are you looking at the same video as me? Why would you want anyone that condones sex with 13 year olds anywhere near the White house is beyond me.

              I cannot abide dealing with such easily led minds. Learn to think for yourself and stop jumping on the media band wagon. This is the same exact tactic they used with trump and his video grab them by the pussy. I would NEVER defend a pedofile. I will not convict someone with simple words that are used to shock.  Alefantis, podesta, epstein, clintons all of them are guilty based on FACTS and circumstantial evidence. Milo had 3 pedofiles arrested how many has clintons pprotected? So as I said to someone else we have bigger fish to fry! Milo apologized and disavowed pedofilia. Unless I see an instagram that is similar to alefantis' which shows children getting hurt I will believe him. Then this is bull shit! Where are the children he hurt? If you convict him then you convict Howard stern and Saturday night live and bill Maher! Stop being so divisive and spreading drama for the media. Wake up! You small minded mental midget!

              Thanks for sharing your opinion I already heard enough on milo. He has completely disavowed pedofilia and brought 3 pedofiles to justice. Actions speak louder than words. Right now all I hear from podesta brothers and alefantis and all the other elites is complete silence as they continue to avoid the questions that surround the satanic and pedofile practices.  We have bigger fish to fry, who should go first the fat podesta or the skinny one?

               The fact that Milo openly is condoning sex with young boys &amp; girls as young as 12/13 years old is
               <strong>
                NOT
               </strong>
               something that should be simply overlooked. He is not a victim, he is playing his role as a political puppet... Yes, there are bigger fish to fry, but your failing to see that Milo is not separate from those big fish... Understanding his role in all of this, and understanding his pedophile nature, is painful, but required to see the bigger picture.

                We have bigger fish to fry and you are spreading misinformation. He disavowed pedofilia and helped convict 3 pedofiles. Now when will you focus on the real abusers such as Epstein, wiener, alefantis, podesta? They have not disavowed anything and on the contrary they are profiteing from a trafficking network. While you sit here throwing stones at someone who says shocking things for a living. You are a joke and a hypocrite. You are either the dumbest sheep I have ever encountered or the dumbest shill that thinks he can influence anyone with half a brain on this site.  Most people here are not so easily influenced by the media and will not hop on the latest fad the media screams about. You are pathetic and have not one unique thought in your brain. Get off the media band wagon and start to think for yourself. You clearly need to learn sometimes people say things they regret, like bad jokes. What defines a man are his actions not the words he speaks. Remember the trump video grab em by the pussy.  Get over it already, the man helped bring 3 pedofiles to justice that's actions!. And you? How many ? A big fat zero! You are nothing but a mindless follower. Wake up!

                 You are plain and simply defending a Pedophile... You're accusing me of being mainstream media, adding half truths. Yes it's clear Epstein and the Clintons are ring leaders in all this. No shit. I've mentioned this before in previous posts in a magnitude of ways... You're resorting to insults and claiming that these were "bad jokes"... Are you fucking serious? Listen to the interview.  You are the true dis-informant, utterly spreading disinformation through
                 <strong>
                  willful ignorance
                 </strong>
                 on this subject... I'm merely making a blatant connection. A highly coveted "key figure" in the supposed free speech movement
                 <strong>
                  is actually a pedophile
                 </strong>
                 ...  WAKE UP. I'm not saying he's bigger than Epstein. I'm just saying you've been duped. You think those were bad jokes?

            Nice try, nice spin. you some professional journalist?
           </p>
           <pre><code>Milo: “This is a controversial point of view I accept. We get hung up on this kind of child abuse stuff to the point where we’re heavily policing even relationships between consenting adults, you know grad students and professors at universities.”

The men in the joint video interview then discuss Milo’s experience at age 14.

Another man says: “The whole consent thing for me. It’s not this black and white thing that people try to paint it. Are there some 13-year-olds out there capable of giving informed consent to have sex with an adult, probably…”

The man says, “The reason these age of consent laws exist is because we have to set some kind of a barometer here, we’ve got to pick some kind of an age…”

Milo: “The law is probably about right, that’s probably roughly the right age. I think it’s probably about okay, but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger. I think it particularly happens in the gay world by the way. In many cases actually those relationships with older men…This is one reason I hate the left. This stupid one size fits all policing of culture. (People speak over each other). This sort of arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent, which totally destroys you know understanding that many of us have. The complexities and subtleties and complicated nature of many relationships. You know, people are messy and complex. In the homosexual world particularly. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can’t speak to their parents. Some of those relationships are the most -”

It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me, another man says, interrupting Milo.

Milo: “And you know what, I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.”

Other people talk. Oh my God, I can’t handle it, one man says. The next thing in line is going to be pedophilia…says another man.

Milo: “You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13-years-old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet. Who have not gone through puberty. Who are too young to be able (unclear and cut off by others)…That’s not what we are talking about. You don’t understand what pedophilia is if you are saying I’m defending it because I’m certainly not.”

Another man said, “You are advocating for cross generational relationships here, can we be honest about that?”

Milo: “Yeah, I don’t mind admitting that. I think particularly in the gay world and outside the Catholic church, if that’s where some of you want to go with this, I think in the gay world, some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys. They can even save those young boys, from desolation, from suicide (people talk over each other)… providing they’re consensual.”

             Sorry if this seems repetitive. I know there must be ton's of Milo stuff floating around the last 24-hours. What kind of troubles me though, is no one seems to really be discussing the fact that he's a pedophile.. I think digging a little deeper into how/why Milo was catapulted will eventually reveal yet even more connections.
