            politicians and corporate heads are both in bed.  That's why they're all covering this up and trying to re-direct it all elsewhere.  Unravel the pedo  thread and this entire  sweater unravels, leading to other crimes.  They'd rather lay charges on other crimes and ignore the pedo, like they conveniently foisted upon the public in the Franklin Scandal.

            You're right, the CIA and FBI and whatever other shitheads work for the government put podesta egomaniacs in high positions for too long.  That was the biggest  Fuck up EVER, for sure.  I'm happy to see that  they're attempt to do damage control isn't working.

            As information becomes less and less compartmentalized we move closer to documenting what goes on. It is because Alefantis and his crew are name dropping braggarts that we have documented this culture. We live in such times where young people emerging into adulthood within this "family" will be less and less discreet adding to the documentation of how they operate and do all this wetwork for the elites.

            It would take a staff of 25 and a few million dollars to audit/FOIA the government on such matters. But since the modus operandi is to make the public think there is no such thing as human trafficking in the U.S., that process could be super enlightening to average person. It is unlikely that high-level arrests would happen for the exact crimes related to violence against children. It would always be couched in tax evasion or corruption because it's a mutually assured destruction scheme and EVERYBODY is in on it. Even the non-participant (non-anointed) underlings, who know, are most likely conditioned to protect their job at all cost (because there is no "next job" for them if they talk.) It's a brilliant scheme that isolates anyone who talks as a lone weirdo until they die...

            I'm operating under the presumption that there are good guys and bad guys at every level of our gov't as well as these so-called alphabet agencies.

           <p>
            The battle has been raging for some time but there is only so much they can do publicly, for fear of well, you know the obvious, (public humiliation, isolation from coworkers/loved ones, loss of job; some cases death).
           </p>
           <p>
            My only hope is that the conversation gets louder and more and more come forward with damning leaks and information that will push the cause forward.

            Yeah, I'm wondering how many out there are fighting the good fight.  I've heard 'You don't know how bad it is' and that this could 'take down
            <em>
             the entire government
            </em>
            '.  I've also heard that this is the year the criminals are exposed and the public's world will be turned upside down.
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO if 1% of a group of people can be corrupt, so can 99%.  There are no guarantees.

            I believe the police start at the bottom and work their way up. The problem is that they're allowed to investigate only so far.  Once they reach investigations of the higher ups, they're stonewalled and told to back off.

            The compromised ones are promoted to the top. Anyone who doesn't "protect" the others gets demoted or ruined. So you can pretty much expect that most of them have crimes to cover up and a lot of it is to maintain standards to prevent revolution and keep the masses sedated and paying in.

             I so agree with you. They continually promote their "people" up and then control their puppets into doing whatever they want. Every now and then they throw one under the bus for the sharks that circle.  My question is have they thrown HRC under the bus? You read the headlines where the Dems want her to go away. Almost like they are detaching themselves from her for when the axe falls.

               HRC has finally surfaced from the woods and is now on the blame tour.  She has had numerous interviews etc. where she has thrown DNC and even the "operatives" from Macedonia under the bus as to why she lost.  The only one she doesn't blame is herself.  This new narrative that Hillary is spewing is not sitting well with the Dems. They are trying to detach themselves from her and just wish she would go back out to the woods. Makes you wonder if she might be the sacrificial lamb that they may offer up to be left alone to their pedo ways.

              I don't think they threw her under the bus, but more likely they want her to just shut the fuck up. I think they realize that she is a loose cannon, and that she could take them all down with her in her fury, there were so many Hillary for Prison signs even in New England that other Dems have to see that she was a bad candidate and ran a bad campaign. Every time she screams "cheated" and doesn't go away, the more normal people get disgusted and start looking into the emails, the clinton body count, the connections to Comey, the odd circumstances of Seth Rich. For every other election you had the losers just say whatever and accept it. even Al Gore didn't contest the outcome when there was so many reasons too, so she is showing herself to be not only a ungraceful loser in a valid contest, but vengeful and vindictive against allegedly innocent people. All of which points to validating Clinton Body Count and Clinton criminality. If I were in "with her" I'd seriously be thinking of taking her out before she causes more damage and implodes the whole cabal. But if she is actually charged with crimes, they will all be associated so they can't just offer her up.

              I really hope that McCabe is chucked and a real investigation can move forward. WallstreetonParade.com raised some conflict of interest issues with Wray yesterday, it just seems like they are all part of the viperpit. I would like to be proved wrong.

            If the "good guys" are not in "brass" (mangement/administrative) positions, then their presence is moot.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are top-down orgs we're talking about here.  Everybody follows orders from the level above him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "brass" are hand-picked.  Every PD chief in every major and mid-sized city is one of THEM.  And that was 25 years ago.

             The 'brass' are nothing without subordinates to carry out orders.  If the regular cops understood what evil they were serving, they wouldn't in good conscience be able to continue serving it.  That's if they're good cops.
            </p>
            <p>
             One possibility is that the good people who understand the evil and its magnitude could be/are organising an underground resistance.  Fighting the secret societies with their own methods, remaining invisible until a point of enough organised heads and stockpiled evidence can mobilize against it.  It's probably the only way, and if that isn't happening in some form then there's no chance of this being overthrown.

             The good news is fixing the problem is simple. Remove the very thin layer at the top and we're home free.

            <p>
             But how do we do that? We're Deplorables and have no clout. Asking the 99%ers to fix the problem is like trying to pull yourself up by your own boot straps. Hhhmmmm

               Have you ever heard the term "Fighting the last war?"
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course you haven't. You're illiterate. Fighting the last war means "Hindsight is 20/20.".
              </p>
              <p>
               You're unable to see what's coming next so you perseverate on what just happened. I can assure you what's next is not rule by the bankers be they Jewish or Irish or whoever. You need to start looking at History on a much longer timeline.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can't see the forest for the trees. You think History began in 1750. I can assure you it did not. Before "The Jews!(tm)" ran the banking industry it was the Venetians who bee tee dubs invented accounting.
              </p>
              <p>
               Before "The Venetians!(tm)" is was the "The Knights Templar!(tm)". And on and on and so forth...............
