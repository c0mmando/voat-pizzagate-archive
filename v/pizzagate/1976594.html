drugs go hand in hand with sex and trafficking
Cocaine The primary drug threats in Wisconsin are the availability and abuse of powdered cocaine transported into the state by Mexican DTOs and the subsequent conversion, distribution, and abuse of crack cocaine. Mexican DTOs transport large shipments of powdered cocaine from the Southwest Border intermixed with legitimate goods in tractor-trailers, and Mexican criminal groups are the primary wholesale distributors of powdered cocaine. Once the powdered cocaine is converted, African American and Hispanic street gangs control the retail distribution of crack cocaine throughout the state. Crack cocaine is the drug most often associated with violent crime in Wisconsin.
The rise in powdered and crack cocaine abuse has affected families drastically, especially in Milwaukee\'s inner city. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Milwaukee Field Office, most crack cocaine abuse still occurs in the inner city, predominantly in Milwaukee, and directly affects lower income and African American families. The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District reports that approximately 8,000 to 10,000 cases of child abuse and neglect are cited each year in Milwaukee, almost all of which can be attributed to drug abuse, particularly cocaine. 
the abuse of powdered and crack cocaine is spreading to suburban and rural areas. Powdered and crack cocaine abuse is a growing problem in small to midsize cities such as Appleton, Green Bay, La Crosse, Madison, and Racine and in rural areas such as Door, Clark, Menominee, Shawnee, and Taylor Counties. The Forest, Menominee, Kenosha, and Brown County Sheriff\'s Departments all indicate that crack cocaine is a major threat in their areas
Transportation
Transportation groups ship cocaine to and throughout Wisconsin using a variety of means, including commercial and private vehicles, rail and air transport, and couriers. Cocaine frequently is concealed in automobiles, minivans, recreational vehicles, and tractor-trailers, which are used predominantly for bulk shipments. Transportation groups extensively employ tractor-trailers using the U.S. interstate system to ship cocaine north from the Southwest Border. According to the DEA Chicago Field Division and the Wisconsin DNE, the concealment of drugs in legitimate cargo, especially produce shipments, is an increasing problem. Transportation groups believe that law enforcement seldom stops these shipments because the produce may spoil, rendering law enforcement agencies liable for lost revenue. Mexican DTOs are responsible for most of the transportation of powdered cocaine, according to the Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance. The DEA Chicago Field Division, which includes the Milwaukee District Office, states that Mexican DTOs are the single largest suppliers of cocaine throughout its jurisdiction. The Wisconsin DNE states that many local cocaine distribution groups have connections to Mexican DTOs and use the DTOs to transport cocaine supplies from the Southwest Border. The Wisconsin DNE, the Milwaukee HIDTA, and DEA Milwaukee indicate that Mexican DTOs transport large quantities of powdered cocaine to Wisconsin directly from Mexico or through California, Florida, and Texas; Chicago .

            Some of the direct evidence we have details the fact that the FBI and DOJ are absolutely corrupt and incapable of upholding the rule of law and equal protection under the law. This has led to multiple private investigations that have since uncovered the network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption that is tied to prominent businesses, foundations, organizations and secret societies in Racine, Wisconsin. There is a long list of who is involved, and it is growing daily. It connects directly to RICO investigations that need to be conducted in relation to the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, global companies, global organizations, PACs, and many other foundations and institutions involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know where additional evidence is, some of which is within Hillary's 650,000 emails as well as communications between groups in Racine, which is easily accessible by the FBI, DOJ, DHS and NSA, and there is a long line of witnesses ready to testify under protection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless these agencies are willing and able to uphold the law, there is evidence that the agencies themselves are involved in the network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and that they are all guilty of treason along with Hillary Clinton, John McCain and many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            The root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is tied directly to the Council of 13, Committee of 300, Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Club of Rome, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, Art in Embassies, United Nations, and other corrupt organizations in the chain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are known shills such as Donkeyhole and EquineLuvr so afraid of investigating Racine, Wisconsin? It is because Racine holds the key to the real truth behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
