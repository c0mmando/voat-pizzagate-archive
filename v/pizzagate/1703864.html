            Ben Sasse, is always one degree of separation from pedophile cases involving places where he has worked. 
already struck by allegations that he helped cover up the sexual abuse of underage male pages while tutoring and proctoring the House Page Program in the late 1990s, is now faced with another brush with pederasty and pedophilia as a result of the conviction of the former chief of cyber-security for the Department of Health and Human Services. The chief of cyber-security for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Timothy DeFoggi
Timothy DeFoggi, was convicted by a jury for the U.S. District Court of Nebraska in Omaha for "engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography in connection with his membership in a child pornography website." DeFoggi used the sites, including two called PedoBook and Onion Pedo Video Archive, to traffic in child pornography. The sites were operated in Omaha by Aaron McGrath, who used the Tor anonymity service to cover the tracks of himself and clients like DeFoggi.
The FBI's Operation Torpedo targeted DeFoggi's and McGrath's cyber-pedophile operations based in Omaha. DeFoggi used the handles of "fuckchrist” and “PTasseater” to traffic in pornographic images and video of children, including infants. Sasse's sordid record of affiliation with major pederast perpetrators may be exactly what the secret society of pedophiles in Omaha and Boy's Town wants to have representing them in the U.S. Senate.

            I don't think it's helpful to the cause to be pushing much of this out as fact. It was never proved that Gannon was Johnny Gosch &amp; the reason for the raid was to clear out porn at a bank. This was a CIA operation run by Spence whom had hired professional photographers. Spence had the wired and bugged brownstone and there were bars and other locations used.

            This is not responsible in my opinion to say all of these are facts. Compared with all the other research people have been doing grabbing more factual evidence.  It did happen exposing the foster system and boys and girls club and a witness telling of killing of children.

            I'd like to upvote this because keeping attention on the Franklin scandal is important for helping people see their way to an understanding of what is really going on. However, a lot of this article states speculation as fact. This is a confirmation bias for some, but serves as the opposite for others. As we continue forward with this extremely important issue, we should be as clear as we can about where we have good facts and what pieces are speculation. I personally believe Warren Buffet is dirty, and for years I've thought he was one of the primary reasons why congress was exempt from insider trading laws (many are invested in Berkshire Hathaway). And I even have some second-hand information to that extent. But I'll tell all that like it is when I do tell it.
