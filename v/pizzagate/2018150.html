What I initially posted: When we were waiting for <a href="https://voat.co/user/swordfish69">@swordfish69</a> leaks, another poster came on and put up some vids. Before you say it was a shill, please watch this vid and specifically, pay attention to what Majestic Ape/Heavy Breather says which I feel are important clues: &quot; We are UNDER the Subway sandwich shop&quot; and -&quot;I\'m the manager&quot; or something like that, it was hard for me to hear? </p>
<p>What does &quot;it&quot; (I think it\'s a she) mean by manager??? manager of bands, manager of getting kids, manager of putting these underground gigs together, manager of the club, manager of auctioning off the kids? Also not sure if the Subway Sandwhich shop means a chain of Subway Sandwiches, a subway station that has a Sandwhich shop or what. If anyone has anything to contribute, please do. And if these labels of the pics (which again is just screen shots of the video isn\'t good enough, can I get a DM so I can change it before just deleting please?</p>
<p>Here is the VIDEO. It appears to be a montagé of what we assumed long ago of CPP (but this vid seems it may not be) various women and maps
 <a href="https://vid.me/4vSVj">https://vid.me/4vSVj</a></p>
<p>I took various screen shots of the VIDEO from above. Maps, subways, the names of the women so we could investigate. 
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/aTLtC">https://imgur.com/a/aTLtC</a></p>
<p>More screen shots of the VIDEO- again, maps and women names. There also appears to be a family chart or some chart connecting people. I couldn\'t get a very clear shot
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/67Hay">https://imgur.com/a/67Hay</a></p>
<p>More screen shots of the VIDEO- this part of the video actually had reference to one of our researchers from here. It focuses on the genetic quirk of the eye, coloboma, like Soros has and Madeline. Also a tarot card &quot;Clone&quot;. </p>

<p>Already posted in the groups above, but want to highlight this map again-trying to figure out this &quot;Subway&quot; whether it is an actual subway station depot or a Sandwhich shop
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/TnRL0">https://imgur.com/a/TnRL0</a></p>
<p>Much of what\'s &quot;happening&quot; in D.C. Is underground- my thought on this is if there are these underground night clubs like Swordfish was referring to in those bizarre PG type bands, which are known and called underground bands, the tunnels under D.C. are perfect cover. Also, transporting kids from place to place without being seen or heard would be very easy for these freaks. </p>
<p>Also, if Elites have powerful people they want to blackmail using crime against kids,  the closer the &quot;venue&quot; is to the WH, the better. </p>

This has caused confusion from the beginning. The show were heavy breathing mentions Subway Sandwich Shop takes place at a venue called Tropicalia. (not comet ping pong). Tropicalia is literally underneath a Subway Sandwich shop.</p>
<p>Here is the Subway and Tropicalia is down the steps on the side.

<p>Observations:</p>
<p>Album 1: Photo shows window casement, likely mahogany, in a house built between approx 1900-1940. Of course there are tens of thousands of houses like this in the DC area.</p>
<p>Subway address: 1015 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005 (though I\'ll be damned if I can find it on street view)</p>
<p>This is probably NOTHING. Just odd. One of the comments mentions &quot;they play Eric [sic] Satie over the sound system&quot;. I had no idea who it was - a 19th century composer. One of the Wiki citations on the composer says this &quot;In 1983, Dave Greenfield and Jean-Jacques Burnel of UK band The Stranglers, recorded &quot;Trois Pédophiles pour Eric Sabyr&quot; in homage to Satie. An instrumental piece, it was the first track on the B-side of their album Fire &amp; Water (Ecoutez Vos Murs).&quot;</p>
<p>The 555 13th St NW location is not the same location on your first album. Note it\'s position relative to the EW running Constitution Ave aka Rt 29</p>
<p>I\'m not sure what you are getting at, but if you need more region-specific insights, hit me up.</p>
<p>Edit 1: I guess I should have saved the time and read down farther.</p>
<p>Tropicalia images: <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Tropicalia+dc&amp;t=disconnect&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Tropicalia+dc&amp;t=disconnect&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images</a> If this is the place I\'m thinking of, it has been around quite some time in various iterations.</p>
<p>It\'s not the same location. The pin is what I am pretty confident is the Subway located at 1015 15th St NW. (Referring to the wrong Subway shop I had originally posted)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?rtp=">https://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?rtp=</a>~adr.2001%2014th%20St%20NW,%20Washington,%20DC%2020009&amp;cp=38.9171791~-77.0316086&amp;lvl=15</p>
<p>I think it is the one a few blocks to the east based on the proximity and number of streets between the pin and 9th St. I am assuming all you have is this screenshot?</p>
<p>Based on that route and distance, it looks like Connecticut and Military Rd NW approx. I eyeballed it. It\'s almost in MD. (Talking about the map provided that is 18 min drive from somewhere north of the Smithsonian Zoo)</p>
<p>And blacksmith21 final reply which I think really needs to be dug into</p>
<p>****** RIGHT HERE-----&gt; Could this be what you seek? Have fun with it. I\'m getting hungry:</p>

I would advise everyone to dig into these videos and archive all the information and photos. For now I would say the reference is directly related to Jared Fogle of Subway pedophile fame.

           The pointing up as Majestic Ape did indicates they were underground. The Majestic Ape character identity is critical to understanding as is the "genetic quirk of pizzagate" the coloboma eye conditiion seen in Madeline McCann and the CARIS James child.
          </p>

           The two female identities not really researched as much showcased in these vids are critical.

This has caused confusion from the beginning. The show were heavy breathing mentions Subway Sandwich Shop takes place at a venue called Tropicalia. (not comet ping pong). Tropicalia is literally underneath a Subway Sandwich shop.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here is the Subway and Tropicalia is down the steps on the side.

          <p>
           Album 1: Photo shows window casement, likely mahogany, in a house built between approx 1900-1940. Of course there are tens of thousands of houses like this in the DC area.
          </p>
          <p>
           Subway address: 1015 15th St NW, Washington, DC 20005 (though I'll be damned if I can find it on street view)
          </p>
          <p>
           This is probably NOTHING. Just odd. One of the comments mentions "they play Eric [sic] Satie over the sound system". I had no idea who it was - a 19th century composer. One of the Wiki citations on the composer says this "In 1983, Dave Greenfield and Jean-Jacques Burnel of UK band The Stranglers, recorded "Trois Pédophiles pour Eric Sabyr" in homage to Satie. An instrumental piece, it was the first track on the B-side of their album Fire &amp; Water (Ecoutez Vos Murs)."
          </p>
          <p>
           The 555 13th St NW location is not the same location on your first album. Note it's position relative to the EW running Constitution Ave aka Rt 29
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm not sure what you are getting at, but if you need more region-specific insights, hit me up.

           Edit 1: I guess I should have saved the time and read down farther.

           If this is the place I'm thinking of, it has been around quite some time in various iterations.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's not the same location. The pin is what I am pretty confident is the Subway located at 1015 15th St NW. (Referring to the wrong Subway shop I had originally posted)

          </p>
          <p>
           I think it is the one a few blocks to the east based on the proximity and number of streets between the pin and 9th St. I am assuming all you have is this screenshot?

          <p>
           Based on that route and distance, it looks like Connecticut and Military Rd NW approx. I eyeballed it. It's almost in MD. (Talking about the map provided that is 18 min drive from somewhere north of the Smithsonian Zoo)

             Very interesting. Thank you. I have to assume any "tunnel" archives are falsified in the US too. But the Subway stations could be a clue. Can't exactly hide subways but tunnels leading from one building to another would need extreme digging. The Hamstead case should be an eye opener to everyone. And that Aaron guy (forget his last name) although people wrote him off as a nutty flat earther, had a lot to say

            I don't know but I do know, she was a holistic style doc (vet but I had read somewhere she was looking into holistic approaches to cancer). There have been a shit TON of natural/holistic docs murdered or die "mysteriously".  Think her death is unrelated to PG but more related to all the holistic doctors deaths.

            YES! Forgot about that! Also, I was thinking that some of these trains/subway tunnels, most people go under ground and just stand and wait. I'm sure others know, if you walk down the tracks, there are doors. I bet people would assume like maintenance rooms but I bet there's other things going on.

            Thank you, I totally missed him saying sewer...I was busy looking up all this stuff. I just wish I knew D.C. area better. I'd like to compare the tunnell entries/exits and paths to some of these clubs. Also, since Goog earth doesn't go into alleys, another perfect place to hide.

            We know there are tunnel systems in DC and we know traffickers use tunnels.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only interesting angle here is whether ALL THESE FOOD CHAINS are artificially promoted/advertised just as we know media spins everything else.  This gets at the root of why greasy disgusting pizza exploded in popularity in the U.S. fifty years ago.  The media in the U.S. is of course totally dominated by Jews.
