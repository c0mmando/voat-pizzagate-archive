<p>This chapter uncovers new evidence that debunks a previous debunking I did.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethnicelebs.com/heather-orourke">https://ethnicelebs.com/heather-orourke</a> Looking into Heather’s family tree.</p>
<p><a href="https://heatherorourke.com/biography/">https://heatherorourke.com/biography/</a> Seems Spielberg had JUST finished up Raiders of the Lost Ark when he discovered Heather. </p>
<p>Just like with Jaws the Revenge, people connected to Steven Spielberg were involved in Poltergeist 2. His co writers. Around the time of pre production of Poltergeist 3, </p>
<p>Heather had swelling in her legs and feet (later shown to be symptoms of Giardia). According to testimony from Heather’s family, they all drank the same water. Doctors and her family were puzzled by how Heather even got Giardia in the first place. </p>
<p>The Giardia theory is officially back on the table. <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/MillennialVulkan">@MillennialVulkan</a> <a href="https://voat.co/u/carmencita">@carmencita</a> I found the smoking gun that proves the blind item (see below link).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/illness.html">https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/illness.html</a> Giardia symptoms can show up again weeks after infection. Swollen legs and feet is NOT one of the initial symptoms, but rather the returning symptoms.</p>
<p>This is a key piece of evidence I overlooked when I previously tried to debunk my original giardia theory. The recurring symptoms showing up weeks after initial</p>
<p>infection actually lines up with the approximate time Heather had swollen legs and feet. </p>
<p>Given this was in late December, the time line matches the possibility of one of the people involved in the Rocky Road incident being the person who infected her. Keep in mind that giardia CAN be spread by sodomy. Meaning that a potential “object” inserted during the Rocky Road incident was a culprit’s “member”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/six-human-parasites-you-definitely-dont-want-to-host-17332">https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/six-human-parasites-you-definitely-dont-want-to-host-17332</a> Giardia is typically spread by ingesting the parasite’s dormant phase (cysts). Symptoms can last for weeks. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/giardia_lamblia/article.htm">https://www.medicinenet.com/giardia_lamblia/article.htm</a> Children are the most likely people to become infected by Giardia. Stomach acid activates the cysts and turns them into the adult form (trophozite).</p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident. “Medical Homicide” on the operating table.</p>',

           Seems Spielberg had JUST finished up Raiders of the Lost Ark when he discovered Heather.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just like with Jaws the Revenge, people connected to Steven Spielberg were involved in Poltergeist 2. His co writers. Around the time of pre production of Poltergeist 3,
          </p>
          <p>
           Heather had swelling in her legs and feet (later shown to be symptoms of Giardia). According to testimony from Heather’s family, they all drank the same water. Doctors and her family were puzzled by how Heather even got Giardia in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Giardia theory is officially back on the table.

           Giardia symptoms can show up again weeks after infection. Swollen legs and feet is NOT one of the initial symptoms, but rather the returning symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a key piece of evidence I overlooked when I previously tried to debunk my original giardia theory. The recurring symptoms showing up weeks after initial
          </p>
          <p>
           infection actually lines up with the approximate time Heather had swollen legs and feet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given this was in late December, the time line matches the possibility of one of the people involved in the Rocky Road incident being the person who infected her. Keep in mind that giardia CAN be spread by sodomy. Meaning that a potential “object” inserted during the Rocky Road incident was a culprit’s “member”.

           Giardia is typically spread by ingesting the parasite’s dormant phase (cysts). Symptoms can last for weeks.

           Children are the most likely people to become infected by Giardia. Stomach acid activates the cysts and turns them into the adult form (trophozite).

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident. “Medical Homicide” on the operating table.

            Docfag here. I can clarify the bowel stuff for you. "Intestinal stenosis of the ileum" doesn't exist. You can have an intussusception but that is mostly a condition affecting small children under 4, it causes bowel obstruction. Other Bowel obstruction can either be large bowel or small bowel. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is not something that gives you sepsis, generally. You vomit and keep vomiting until it is resolved. Intussusception can produce a small bowel obstruction (but I don't think it's that because of age). Large bowel obstruction is a super medical emergency and is obstruction of the colon. It doesn't usually give you vomiting because there is a valve at the small bowel which stops stuff going in the reverse direction. If the valve fails you can get vomiting but more often you get a "closed loop" of bowel and the bowel bursts, killing you with fecal peritonitis and sepsis. This is almost certainly not applicable to a 12 year old because 99% of large bowel obstructions are due to some event happening later in life such as bowel or ovarian cancer. A traumatic injury doesn't cause LBO.

            So what is more likely? I agree that the presentation as suggested is almost certainly sepsis. Now, sepsis can be from many sources but we assume it is bowel related because of the cover story. So the story is almost certainly of a bowel perforation. This leaks bowel contents into the abdominal cavity and over 48-72 hours will kill you without surgery. I think that fits the timeline. In order to get a bowel perforation you have to have some trauma to it (or a distal obstruction with a LBO, as I said you don't tend to get perforation with SBO because you just vomit). That is, a tear or injury. In this age group it has to be a puncture injury.

            Somebody has rammed something either up the rectum, tearing it, or up the vagina. A perforation of the vagina can cause sepsis in itself if made with a dirty instrument. More likely though would be a rectal perforation. This would lead to sepsis (requiring ambulance) within 48 hours and death within hours from that point.

            Hope that helps
