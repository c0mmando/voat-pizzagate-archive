            Okey that all sounds strange now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you found anything shady about that place in Berlin in particular? Also in case we find out about something going on there:
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have anyone volunteers living rather close by to visit the place if needed?
I might but for me it'll be like 10h to get there so I'd have to take an entire weekend off. (only gonna do that if there's some real proof something is strange!)

             The smoking cum is that berlin diner is 800 meters from mr.pong, which is a model for comet-ping-pong pizza, ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The question is, the timeline is all the same, how can it be that alefantis is working his ass off running two restaurants in DC (2012) and gets nominated most powerful man, yet at the same time, he had spent years in Berlin also building a restaurant which is the most popular diner in the world, while honestly nobody ever recognized the pizza-place, I doubt its the same person, but the autist's that run pizzagate sub seem obsessed that its the same person.
...
The other thing is its been established that Alefantis DC, went to school at a prep-school in DC, yet the guy with the restaurant in Berlin, say's he's from Indiana, and Hawaii, and makes no mention of ever being in DC,
            </p>
            <p>
             Ergo me thinks not same person,
            </p>
            <p>
             Why does numbnutz use the tunnel I have no idea ( Secret tunnel connecting dupont-cir-dc to berlin )

             <p>
              if evidence hardens and we have more stuff pointing to this "mr.pong" and this other pizza place, I could MAYBE check them out and look if I see any strange stuff like the pedo logos or strange photos and paintings and stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              But as I already said, I'd have to take a day off work and pay about 100€ for tickets to get there so I won't do it without any REAL, hard proof beind it ;)
             </p>
             <p>
              Is anyone already checking out that "Mr. Pong" in Berlin?
