<p>&quot;Elsagate&quot; is a disturbing phenomenon which was uncovered through the intensive research of members of the public.</p>
<p>We will also consider within the preparatory affidavit, violations of obscenity laws by celebrities James Gunn, Rian Johnson and Anthony Jeselnik on the public platform which has no age limit in place for membership. The site does feature a censorship for explicit visual content but does not carry the same feature for the written word, which introduced the tweets by way of retweets and likes and also potentially followers, to an audience of minors. This is a serious crime which because of it\'s cybernetic nature, should best be sent to an international criminal court.</p>
<p>Obscenity is not protected under First Amendment rights to free speech, and violations of federal obscenity laws are criminal offences. The U.S. courts use a three-pronged test, commonly referred to as the Miller test, to determine if given material is obscene. Obscenity is defined as anything that fits the criteria of the Miller test, which may include, for example, visual depictions, spoken words, or written text..</p>
<p>In Miller v. California (1973) - the currently-binding Supreme Court precedent on the issue - the Court ruled materials were obscene if they appealed, &quot;to a prurient interest&quot;, showed &quot;patently offensive sexual conduct&quot; that was specifically defined by a state obscenity law, and &quot;lacked serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value.&quot;</p>

<p>CEOS’s Role The Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) remains dedicated to the enforcement of federal obscenity laws. CEOS attorneys work with the High Technology Investigative Unit (HTIU), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and United States Attorney´s Offices throughout the country to investigate and prosecute violations of federal obscenity law. The use of the Internet to distribute obscenity has blurred traditional notions of jurisdiction. CEOS maintains a coordinated, national-level law enforcement focus to help coordinate nationwide investigations and initiatives. Given the importance of community standards under the Miller test, however, CEOS recognizes that the full commitment and support of local United States Attorney´s Offices, who best know local community standards, are absolutely essential to the federal obscenity enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>CITIZEN\'S GUIDE TO U.S. FEDERAL LAW ON OBSCENITY 18 U.S.C. § 1460- Possession with intent to sell, and sale, of obscene matter on Federal property 18 U.S.C. § 1461- Mailing obscene or crime-inciting matter 18 U.S.C. § 1462- Importation or transportation of obscene matters 18 U.S.C. § 1463- Mailing indecent matter on wrappers or envelopes 18 U.S.C. § 1464- Broadcasting obscene language 18 U.S.C. § 1465- Transportation of obscene matters for sale or distribution 18 U.S.C. § 1466- Engaging in the business of selling or transferring obscene matter 18 U.S.C. § 1466A- Obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children 18 U.S.C. § 1467- Criminal forfeiture 18 U.S.C. § 1468- Distributing obscene material by cable or subscription television 18 U.S.C. § 1469- Presumptions 18 U.S.C. § 1470- Transfer of obscene material to minors 18 U.S.C. § 2252B Misleading domain names on the Internet 18 U.S.C. § 2252C Misleading words or digital images on the Internet</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court established the test that judges and juries use to determine whether matter is obscene in three major cases: Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24-25 (1973); Smith v. United States, 431 U.S. 291, 300-02, 309 (1977); and Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 500-01 (1987). The three-pronged Miller test is as follows:</p>
<p>Whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, finds that the matter, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interests (i.e., an erotic, lascivious, abnormal, unhealthy, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion); Whether the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, finds that the matter depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way (i.e., ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, masturbation, excretory functions, lewd exhibition of the genitals, or sado-masochistic sexual abuse); and Whether a reasonable person finds that the matter, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>
<p>There are also laws to protect children from obscene or harmful material on the Internet. For one, federal law prohibits the use of misleading domain names, words, or digital images on the Internet with intent to deceive a minor into viewing harmful or obscene material (See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252B, 2252C). It is illegal for an individual to knowingly use interactive computer services to display obscenity in a manner that makes it available to a minor less than 18 years of age (See 47 U.S.C. § 223(d) –Communications Decency Act of 1996, as amended by the PROTECT Act of 2003). It is also illegal to knowingly make a commercial communication via the Internet that includes obscenity and is available to any minor less than 17 years of age (See 47 U.S.C. § 231 –Child Online Protection Act of 1998).</p>
<p>The standard of what is harmful to minors may differ from the standard applied to adults. Harmful materials for minors include any communication consisting of nudity, sex or excretion that (i) appeals to the prurient interest of minors, (ii) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable material for minors, (iii) and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.</p>
<p>In addition to facing imprisonment and fines, convicted offenders of federal obscenity laws involving minors may also be required to register as sex offenders. Furthermore, in some circumstances, obscenity violations involving minors may also be subject to prosecution under federal child pornography laws, which yield serve statutory penalties For one, federal law prohibits the use of misleading domain names, words, or digital images on the Internet with intent to deceive a minor into viewing harmful or obscene material (See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252B, 2252C).</p>

                   Thanks for the ping and I wish I could participate in the fun here, but I'll have to wait until later. Here's the archived thread where he says he isn't a pedo and that he's co-owner of The Pastorum Group.

                   I'm pressed for time, so real quick: The Pastorum Group is a think tank combined with direct action, and I'm suspecting they may have arranged Alefantis' meeting with Megyn Kelly. I have found absolutely no evidence that Podesta is co-owner and he mentions Seth Rich in the archived thread and wonders why we think that he's involved with his death when his family hired TPG. Yet, questions surround Brad Bauman and people are suspecting that HRC hired Bauman to represent Rich's family. Meanwhile, Bauman has direct ties to Alefantis through David Brock. Careful with JohnDavidPodesta. I don't believe he's THE JDP, and he mixes truth with mis/disinformation. Gotta run for now, but I'll stop back in later.

                     Call me crazy, but I think the class action lawsuit is a distraction, so I started looking at what else he said, which was in regards to the International Criminal Court. I started researching if Elsagate would even be something the ICC would take on. Well, I found something interesting, but I'll warn you that this is going out on a limb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     First, let's take a look at the International Criminal Court:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <em>
                      The International Criminal Court (ICC or ICCt)[2] is an intergovernmental organization and international tribunal that sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. The ICC has the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.
                     </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <em>
                      The Rome Statute is a multilateral treaty which serves as the ICC's foundational and governing document. States which become party to the Rome Statute, for example by ratifying it, become member states of the ICC. Currently, there are 123 states which are party to the Rome Statute and therefore members of the ICC.
                     </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now for the interesting part:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Bill Clinton was POTUS in 1998...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <em>
                      Finally the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome in June 1998, with the aim of finalizing the treaty to serve as the Court's statute. On 17 July 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted by a vote of 120 to 7, with 21 countries abstaining.
                     </em>
                     <strong>
                      The seven countries that voted against the treaty were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar, the United States, and Yemen.
                     </strong>
                     [10]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <strong>
                      Israel’s vote against was due to the inclusion in the list of a war crimes of “the action of transferring population into occupied territory”.
                     </strong>
                     [11]
                     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court">

                    <p>
                     Read that very carefully. Israel did not want to become part of it because they were already being cited for crimes against humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I wonder why China, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Yemen, and the US didn't want to be included?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This above occurred during Bill Clinton's presidency in 1998.

                    <p>
                     Even if you don't read the Bible, it's not difficult to see the odd coincidences between these countries and the 7 heads of the beast of Revelation when it's explained simplistically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <em>
                      The wild beast with seven heads introduced at Revelation 13:1 represents the worldwide political system.
                     </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <em>
                      The beasts in Daniel’s prophecy are identified as specific kings, or political kingdoms, that rule in succession over empires. (Daniel 7:17, 23) Thus, the wild beast of Revelation chapter 13 represents a composite political organization
                     </em>
                    </p>

                     <em>
                      Even though nations may agree on few things, they unite in their determination to maintain their authority rather than submit to the rule of God’s Kingdom. (Psalm 2:2) They will also join forces to battle God’s armies commanded by Jesus Christ at Armageddon, but this war will result in the nations being destroyed.
                     </em>

                     <em>
                      Likewise, the seven heads of the beast of Revelation 13:1 represent seven governments: the primary political powers that have dominated through history and have taken the lead in oppressing God’s people—Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and Anglo-America.
                     </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yeah, I know. This is really out there, but strange and didn't feel as though I could really keep this to myself especially since the numbers match - The Rome Statute was adopted on July 17 = 7/17, which is the same number in the Book of Daniel (7:17), and Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If it hadn't been for the Rome Statute, these 7 countries may never have been revealed. All roads lead to Rome?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Just looking at these countries (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and Anglo-America) and seeing all of the symbolism we see today that's historically representative of them, this is getting pretty fucking creepy because it has everything to do with Pizzagate and ancient rituals that are still being performed today that do involve human sacrifice, debauchery, paganism/Satanism, the masons, and all of those who are thumbing their noses at God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Anyway, take this for what you will. My research takes me down some weird roads, and I didn't want to do a thread on this, but wanted to get it out there.
