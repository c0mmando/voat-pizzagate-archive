<p>&quot;BBC executives will today be condemned for failing to stop Alan Yentob “deliberately intimidating” the Corporation over the collapse of Kids Company by a cross-party committee of MPs. Mr Yentob’s behaviour when allegations surfaced about the charity, where he was chair of trustees, raises questions about conflict of interest at the BBC, a report says.&quot;</p>
<p>He REALLY wanted to shut down the investigation and tried to interfere. He ended up stepping down from his position at the BBC. Really seems like a &quot;go away quietly&quot;. Camila is a con artist that at the very least stole money from the charity.</p>

            I do not think Frank Giustra owns Pizza Express.  He used to have a company called 222 Pizza Express.  They are not one and the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            The founder of the UK based Pizza Express is Peter Boizet

             https://www.instagram.com/p/BM4THSIA-YW/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, I can't find who the new owners are as Boizet sold his shares a while ago but articles never seem to mention to whom.
