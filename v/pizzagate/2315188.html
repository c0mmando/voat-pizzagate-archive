<p>Relevance: Taco Bell was already connected to pizzagate through their Super Bowl commercial that featured George Takei eating pizza while people at the party played ping pong. </p>

<p>George Takei just recently came under fire when he was alleged to have sexually assaulted a young model. But this second commercial entitled BELLUMINATI is filled with Illuminati symbolism and a Rothschild-like party/ritual atmosphere that directly links to the group pulling the strings on those involved in pizzagate. It\'s Eyes Wide Shut on adrenochrome. </p>

<p>Holy Christ! I was on Twitter and ran into talk about this new Taco Bell Stacker commercial. There was a link given to it so I gave it a look. I really thought it was a joke and put together as fake footage, but it turns out it\'s real. How can this be? TACO BELL is actually putting this out there? </p>
<p>If you haven\'t seen it, I\'m posting the uncut commercial as is. However,  I\'m also posting a slo-mo one where you can see exactly what we\'re actually seeing and what our brain is processing. So that table of stacker $1 offerings? It begins to look an awful lot like a Marina Abramovic spirit cooking scene with every conceivable kind of meat. The shapes, the shadows, you\'ll see what I mean when you watch it. Even the sound when it\'s slowed down sounds like one big acid trip. The party guests look like a combination Rothschild bash meets Eyes Wide Shut. It\'s crazy shit. </p>
<p>There\'s also this huge connection between Taco Bell, the dollar bill, and the word ONE. It\'s prominently featured if you watch the slow motion version. ONE is the org that Bono is involved with so is the name another coincidence? Doubtful. Here goes. </p>
<p>Here\'s the link to the commercial itself: </p>

<p>Please note that at around 3:27, a man walks in front of a wall sconce/pitchfork/trident looking thing. The prongs of this pitchfork serve as horns on his head. You can\'t see it in the fast version, but you can when this guy walks in front of it and then BOOM! There are the devil\'s horns on either side of his head. Also at 1:25 when the doors open, you can see a giant T. It looks like a T-square architects use. Then there\'s the inside of the bell being turned into an all-seeing eye.

            666 in logo and the serpents eye so not surprised by the luciferian "in our face" commercial but nice breakdown. Normies never see this crap.
After red pill you can't not see it - everywhere. You know they like to taunt us.

             I keep asking myself why they would reveal themselves for the world to see. The answer? Arrrogance. Just like all those Rhianna videos. Like Nicki Minaj tagging along with the pope and performing a satanic ritual. And what about the snake building at the vatican? Same thing.

             I'm glad you had the same reaction. I really thought it was a joke. I thought it was made by a diehard pzzagater trying to convince us of Taco Bell's involvement in this shit. I hesitated because some are going to find it too far out there, but after seeing it in slow motion? I had to post it. I mean, devil horns?

            Just another example of how the cabal flaunts it’s power and laughs at our powerlessness. Their icons are so pervasively ingrained in the cultural zeitgeist that they can use those elements to sell mass produced tacos on a national level. Everything in this commercial is obviously satanic, yet even here; amongst the “awakened”, the quotient of its evil substance is debated. It may be hailed as brilliant advertising, even as a funny conspiracy-theory diatribe. It’s STILL satanic, though, and it does nothing to make me crave a stacker. By associating it with Abramovic, my appetite for Taco Bell was instantly destroyed. I used to like the Doritos-flavored tacos, by the way. As a final thought on the matter, I wonder if this is actually a shot directed at this community, considering how frequently Taco Bell has been in the news regarding the fecal content discovered in their tacos.

             I would never eat there. I would wonder what was in that food and the kind of meat they were using. They've already been caught using horse meat.

             The symbology is in our faces, and if the desire was for this to go viral, it was a poorly executed tactic. As you said, it does nothing to make the product appealing. I would never walk into another Taco Bell, let alone eat one of their products. I'll forever associate them with this reprehensible offering.

             The next thing to do is to dig and find other associations. They are officially on my radar and seem to confirm the rumor that certain fast food places are being run to funnel money into The Cannibal Elite. If this is true, and I believe it is, then we have to start making better choices in terms of where we spend our money and not fork it over to people that have identified with the dark side.

             There are so many small details ... like the man taking on devil horns ... the steps up the pyramid. And think about it, those details are lost at regular speed which means they're subliminal. Why put subliminal satanic messaging in a pardody? Parodies are supposed to be broad, obvious humor that is for everyone to see and get the joke. These jokes are hidden unless you slow the commercial down. It makes no sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             And why is SA missing? Does that mean it's been taken over by the Cannibal Elite? Are they referencing it as no longer part of the world, but something under their domination? It makes absolutely no sense.

            Thanks for the slo mo...will watch.  Don't know if it is this one or another I watched recently but at the end the guy is holding a burrito and my SO said that is a penis symbol plain as day.  Yep, sure was.

            And to think way back before I stopped even the occasional fast food emergency stop (never have liked it per se) I considered taco bell one of the least offensive.

             Yes, as stated above, we need to pick and choose where we spend our hard-earned money. I don't want to fund the Cannibal Elite. It would have been like donating to Killary's presidential election campaign.

            Ok. BREAKING: AN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE HIRES ADVERTISING FIRM TO IMPRINT THE TACO BELL LOGO IN THEIR MAIN CUSTOMERS BRAIN AND SUCCEEDS!
           </p>
           <p>
            National advertising firm finds taco bell patrons to be made up of mostly stoner Bernie loving faggots and creates an ad campaign based on what triggers these individuals. Now these people think "taco bell" at all times.  /s

            It's not a conspiracy you shill.  You are paid to post this shit to make pizzagate seem retarded and discredit the real happenings. You do this by making stupid as fuck posts so when people see it they lump all the pizzagate fags into a single group of idiots.

              You’re not wrong at all here. Still feel these presumed “connections” are a stretch; personally I consider it pretty astute advertising targeting if you ask me. If more evidence presents itself I’ll dig.
