             That's why I think 4chan might have been onto something in those very first day's. I was getting annoyed at all these people saying we should be making meme's an I was like 'I haven't looking at Alefantis's instagram or Itchie Gross's linkedin [seriously,, what happened to that lead and the house in florida,, that was real dungeon house for sure!... ].
            </p>
            <p>
             But in the last few months I've watched how meme magic got it to the masses,, it even forced the elite pedo pr machine to invent #fakenews ,,, a meme more powerful than what they did with Conspiracy Theory.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think I saw a thread here with all the pizzagate meme's and I've been thinking about just flooding twitter &amp; facebook with my fav's...

             exactly my point!! Just like if you walked up to the average UK citizen and said there were Elite Pedo's in places of power they wouldn't bat an eyelid thanks to the exposing of Savile. If you walked up to the average SK citizen and said that there were politicians in power that were into Crowley/Thelema Occult sht they wouldn't be surprised.... fastest way to help everyone get over their cognitive dissonance is by getting all of this info out there!!

            I don't watch a lot of news on tv or even bother with the national daily papers but I've seen nothing about South Korea and the Gyen Hi Park story. There is very rarely anything about South Korea in general so that's nothing new. Occasionally there is a reminder that NK is an evil and powerful enemy, but its hard for me to see how they are a threat to the US, except that any Korean unification or peace accord would threaten the need for our military presence in Seoul.

             Same,,, only alerted to this as I've got a few friends in S Korea.

             The thing that stood out to me [and a reason it should be on msm globally] was the HUGE amount of people that hit the streets. This was massive, well over a million people. Strange that footage of this didn't even seem to get a mention on MSM. Maybe they're scared of giving the masses any ideas....

              Atrocities committed by North Korea against its own people are "strikingly similar" to those perpetrated by the Nazis during World War II, the head of a United Nations panel said Monday after publishing an unprecedented report.
             </p>
             <p>
              "At the end of the Second World War so many people said, 'If only we had known, if only we had known the wrongs that were done in the countries of the hostile forces,'" (United Nations) inquiry chairman Michael Kirby told a press conference in Geneva after releasing the report.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Well now the international community does know … there will be no excusing the failure of action because we didn't know - we do know," Kirby said, holding up a copy of the report.

             No, no isn't! Please don't say that. It is nowhere near true. Do some in-depth research on the situation in North Korea if you never have and you'll see that. It is virtually like Nazi Germany with the concentration camps operating, but the world has looked away from the horrible abuses for decades. For most people there, it is a hell on earth, where they are worth less than dogs.

            <p>
             When Kim Jong Il died recently, people were required to mourn in public, and those who didn't act distraught enough in public were taken away to prison camps. The Kims are considered to be actual gods in North Korea. People are regularly arrested like that for no legitimate reason at all and either killed outright or put in prison or prison camp - in part to supply slave labor for the government, and in part due to power struggles and for the sake of keeping the population in fear. In this prison system they are tortured, starved, worked to death, and often executed. North Korea is very poor, with the people facing starvation frequently, yet just trying to trade something for a little food can result in years in prison in those Auschwitz-like conditions. Trading a blanket for some food is considered a treasonous capitalist act and counter-revolutionary, and is an accusation against the "dear Leaders" - the Kims - and the government that they aren't taking good enough care of you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Western spy satellites have shown these prison complexes to be huge, with one the size of Washington, D.C. North Korea also punishes three generations of its political "criminals" in order to eradicate whole families. So if one person is arrested the rest of the family is too and placed in camps. Prison guards are corrupt and brutal, and are rewarded for killing prisoners.

             There are some possible reasons for why the world is ignoring North Korea's Holocaust situation, among the most likely that this isn't a European country, it's half-way around the world, and China is the powerful protector and ally of North Korea. North Korea couldn't exist without China's support, and it sits as a buffer between China and democratic South Korea, so it's very vital to China's interests. And despite being poor, it has nuclear weapons.

              The world ignores NK because NK possesses deployable extinction weapons and a willingness to use them if provoked. Their nuke program is the least terrifying thing about NK.

               Perhaps. But the atrocities and prison Holocaust have been going on for decades, going back to the Korean War, and have been ignored. And they are also a very small country, dependent on China, which protects them within the UN.

                 I was responding to your comment saying that North Korea is better than the South. Do you still stand by that?
                </p>
                <p>
                 And why do you call these people criminals? Most aren't criminals at all, but they get the most brutal treatment. Where's your concern for the atrocities taking place in North Korea, which the UN has said are like Nazi Germany's?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The leaders of the North would also have plenty to lose themselves if it were to launch weapons of mass destruction. And sanctions have been leveled against them in the past without WMDs being deployed. China is their protector. Would China want North Korea killing off the entire American population, if what you claim is even remotely a possibility?

                  According to North Korean law they are criminals. It is not our job to re-write North Korea's laws. The sanctions of the past were not an existential threat to North Korea's existence. However, regime change in the North would likely result in deployment of their extinction weapons. Even if most deployment's fail, the cost would be in the hundreds of millions to several billion lives world wide- as well pacific and indian ocean trade would cease for several weeks or months. Then we'd have to worry about novel bioweapon spores floating around the stratosphere for several hundred years- randomly landing and starting up new pandemics every couple decades.

             lol I know right,,, I'd be so interested to hear how this is playing in NK.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then again when Pizzagate broke I kept thinking the lads in Iran must've been so happy. 'See we told you America was the great satan' lol

             on a side note: I'm the son of a US diplomat so went to international schools most of my life. I remember when I was at frankfurt international school we had a big contingent of Koreans. I was one of the few non korean's that used to talk to any of them and I was alway's curious at how there seemed to be two groups of korean kids who wouldn't talk to each other. Wasn't until I was out of school I realized that Kim Jong Un actually went to the international school in switzerland  [we used to have basketball tournaments there/or they visited us] and after talking to old classmates learned that Kim's current personal body guards went to our school [Frankfurt].

               i'm pretty sure the commenter firmly had his tounge in his cheek with that one.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm not gonna argue your point but I'm curious as to where you get your views? as you can see from my post you've replied to I have direct ties to people who happen to be a part of the north korean power structure at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also have quiet a few friends who went to the same international school as Kim Jong Un at the same time as he did. While this doesn't give me any reason to discount your views it certainly has opened my eyes to the strange contradiction as I am now aware that many if not most of the people at the top of the power structure of NK had the same 'high school' education as myself and most of the children of the worlds diplomats and industry leaders had.
              </p>
              <p>
               Like I said I'm not arguing with you, just sharing an interesting fact that many may not realize [though it totally explains to me Kim's love of basketball amongst other things]. This realization has made me more hesitant and cynical when it comes to information on NK [or anywhere] that we get from western media sources [which happen to do the whole propaganda thing with waaay more refinement and subtlety]

                I did read your post, and remember when successors to Kim Jong Il were talked about, Kim Jong Un's Western education was brought up. But consider, if having a good Western education means that much, then why is this pizzagate investigation going on? Why suspect the elite class who are native Westerners of trafficking in children to exploit them sexually, and possibly to kill at least some? Outside of pizzagate, Western educations often haven't stopped radical Islamists from joining al Qaeda and ISIS, or certainly from being part of repressive Islamic states, like Saudi Arabia. As you mention, too, the Koreans largely kept to themselves. Students from other countries with different values may not have those values really challenged if they stay isolated to themselves. On North Korea, I've kept up with things going on there for years. There is simply too much verifiable evidence for this to be false information by Western governments, who have been more apt to ignore it as much as possible than anything else over the decades. What has typically made headlines are the concerns about North Korea's nuclear program.

                 no no,, totally agree. In fact it's made me look back at my education and the people I shared it with and ask a lot of questions. It's why I'm on here trying to help expose Pizzagate. And like I said I don't disagree,, NK is pretty shit! I also think we're in a much better position 'in the west' given the current mood to recognize the fact that the masses are viewed as the chattle of the ruling classes. Up until know it's been difficult for people like me to try and convince the 'average joe' of that fact. Thank god for Pizzagate,, we might just be on the verge of sorting this sht out. :)   we can start thinking about helping NK sort their shit as soon as we've cleaned house and actually do have the moral high ground!!

            sorry new to starting a post so didn't know how to put more comments. I'm just wondering if Americans have seen any footage of the MILLIONS of people who hit the steets in south korea to get rid of their president.

            Now the article I posted uses the term Satanic but the BBC say Shamanic [good ol Beebs is great at minimizing the problem right].

           <p>
            In anycase I'd be curious if this is on any of the MSM in the US. In my humble opinion the best chance America/the World has at tackling the international Elite Pedo ring is by not letting these stories sit in Silo's. We shouldn't leave Pizzagate to just be Podesta's little problem. By including Norway, UK etc etc we might actually start getting to the real problem like the ninth circle.... imho of course.

            and before anyone hates on me for using the blanket term Satanic please don't... my personaly opinion is that it's more specifically Crowley based magick they're into ie Thelema [see the podesta Thelema email]

               Like those two anti-trafficking journalists with the girl eating pizza...? I hope there are honest people at fbi who know this shit already.  The US is top heavy with treasonous devils,  and they need to be exposed and dealt with.

               Maybe somehow connected to the Steve Bing/Bill Clinton rescue of the Ling sisters in NK? That's the closest I've seen in the threads, but I haven't read all of them.

              that would generally make sense,,, but having the president booted out because of ties to a Satanic/Shamanic Cult and Corruption/PaytoPlay with MILLIONS of people hitting the streets in protest is kinda international news. I think they might just be scared to highlight this real news story given the current battle against 'fake news' ,, especially given the ties to Abromovic and how that narrative could be spun.

               yes, I completely agree with all you are saying. But it is also kind of normal that there is very little coverage of international news in the US. I'm not sure that people here even know that LG and Samsung are Korean companies.
