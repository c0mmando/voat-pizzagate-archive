            Caring405, what you have to realize is that many people on this site are offenders and their defenders who are looking to steer the conversation.  When you deleted your post and announced you were out of here, they got what they were after.  Also, many here who are genuinely interested in the welfare of children are tech bullies who seem to enjoy savaging newbies who haven't yet learned the rules of posting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please push through it and continue to research and document it here.  Ignore obvious attempts to divert your attention from the research and just try to learn from experience.  Ask for help.  Remember we're doing this for the children. The abuse dished out here is nothing compared to what they go through.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please resubmit the post you deleted, but this time archive it first so that people can look at the contents of the site without actually going there.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, highlight and copy the address of the website.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then go to archive.is.
            <a href="http://archive.is/">
             http://archive.is/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Paste the website address in the red box and click "save the page."
           </p>
           <p>
            When it's finished, notice that there is a new archive.is address in your browser for the saved website.  Copy and paste that address into your post.
           </p>

            When did us Americans decide that people are criminals because they looked a picture? I've got to say.. the most depraved criminals and pedophiles have iron cladded their behavior by making anyone who questions or looks into their behavior fear for themselves. It's no wonder. We can only imagine what happened to those who have tried to expose this before pizzagate. Luckily everybody in my family knows that I am wanting an end to this human atrocity.

            Sorry for the misunderstanding but I hope my comment didn't necessarily make you delete the thread, you really just need to reformat it a little. I clicked on a link that led to a porn site that in your words was breaking laws, why would anyone want to be taken there? Your idea is right, approach is wrong. I have no idea what the  site does because I wouldn't go any further but from what I saw they exploit the Mormon theme. I think your investigation warrants more of a look. Obviously, you've taken a nice long look to determine that there might be underagers, for that then, warrants an official police investigation, not us, and it seems your eagle eye for detail your the one to bring the charge. It seems odd to me these people could get away with doing what you are saying with such a layout, but there's definitely something weird with that mormon angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            You just need to just find a different angle of attack.

             Mormons LDS Masons = Romney. Their family was thrown out many moons ago and moved to Mexico for marriage practices and then were let back in and given a money to start out again. Moved to Michigan and became Gov. His son could have been Pres. Think about it. Look up the Romneys George Samuel Romney Wiki says that there is a Cheney as a relative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Probably is real Mormons running that site.

              There's a vice video, back when vice was decent, with an interview with Romney's fam across the border that's worth a watch. It was during the 2012 election. They said the really would like to talk to him (they said they hadn't spoken to that side of the fam in years) since they could tell him all about what's going on in mexico and illegal immigration.

            I have been on here for about 10 months and have not had to look at boys or girls being raped in order to investigate.  I don't know why you need to talk about how much chest hair is on your son's chest.  Or penis size at whatever age.  This has nothing to do with investigating on here.  We should not be entering sites that show either sex being raped.  That is Child Porn and Against The Law.  You should know that.

             I was using facts I've learned from parenting to conclude that they are children in puberty. If that offends you... what are you doing here? Besides trying to stop critical thinkers of helping solve a sick problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know what... I've got one just over a year until my son is an adult. I'll just focus on making sure he's safe. If this is the way someone who cares, but doesn't "follow the ridiculous RULES properly" is treated. And is put down for trying to use critical thinking skills while looking at things that hurt my soul...
            </p>
            <p>
             I wish you guys the best of luck "investigating" or whatever you think you are accomplish... and thank goodness this won't be anything I will need to really care about anymore. And may god have mercy on this Jerry Springer mentality of a country.

             No, I posted a link that came up in my internet search on ritual sexual abuse which was very obvious male child rape. DO NOT CALL THAT GAY PORN!!  And I am a 17 year married, Christian Orthodox Mother of a 16 year old boy. So it was very powerful for me when I saw it. That horrified thought was OMG what if that was my kid?? Every Mom of a teen boy should get on there and make sure it's not their kid.

             And yet OP is still not satisfied that we won't click her links.  That makes me question the motive behind OP's participation here.  No problem though.  We just add her name to the watchlist to see if future posts align with the sub's purpose or not.  Kinda like you alphabravo.

               At this time (despite my snarky meme) I believe you are sincerely concerned about the welfare of children.  If you want to point out crimes against children on voat, I suggest
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                /v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               .  The standards for topical content are much broader than here in
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                /v/pizzagate

            Tons of content is made overseas, in particular in the countries that used to make up the USSR. Huge numbers of orphans for child trafficking rings in Romania et al where abortions weren't the norm. Those in warehouse-like care homes get thrown out in the streets while still a teen without real job related skills. Rates of alcoholism approach 90%.
           </p>
           <p>
            While it's claimed the big porno producers overseas use only those who are 18 everyone knows how to get a fake ID. Privately made content adhering to current demand is the norm. Or they copy whichever online porn content currently gets the highest clicks. Don't believe most of the underage appearing porn is necessarily filmed in the USA. "Models" are given drugs, often temporary housing &amp; food to guarantee their reliability for filming. Drugs keep the actors looking thin, meaning young.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or the young &amp; unemployed respond to legit sounding ads to go to the West for physical labor jobs. In reality they're sold into some kind of slavery that includes porno as bait to draw in customers.

             I know. And it's a pretty powerful system they have in place to scare people with an accusation of being a pedophile when you are just trying to help stop it. I can't even imagine being a man and trying to solve this. Maybe we should all just mind our business and fiercely protect our own children. :(
