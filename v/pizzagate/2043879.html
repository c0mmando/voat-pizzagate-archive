To quickly recap, back in 2010 Van Susteren did a strange soft-ball interview with Laura Silsby fake-&quot;lawyer&quot; Jorge Puello right before he got arrested for sex trafficking, and Van Susteren herself was deeply involved in covering up Franklin Scandal-related child sex trafficking allegations in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Here is some more important information re Van Susteren: as journalist Nick Bryant in his &quot;Franklin Scandal&quot; book documents, Greta Van Susteren\'s family background has some extremely strange coincidences. Van Susteren\'s father was a Wisconsin judge who worked as a campaign manager for Joe McCarthy in the 50s. McCarthy was the infamous Wisconsin Senator in the 50s who waged a vicious witch hunt against accused &quot;communists and homosexuals&quot; in the US government, destroying many careers based on false charges. Joe McCarthy was the best man at Van Susteren\'s mom\'s and dad\'s wedding. The chief legal counsel for Joe McCarthy in his crusade against communists and homosexuals was none other than ROY COHN. <strong>As Nick Bryant also documents, Roy Cohn, who later became an extremely well-connected NYC lawyer and political powerbroker, also just so happened to be a good friend of CRAIG SPENCE.</strong> Craig Spence allegedly ran a child sex trafficking and blackmail operation out of DC, and tried to pressure DC pimp Henry Vinson into becoming part of his pedophilia activities. Vinson refused, and quickly thereafter was put under federal indictment for his own (<em>adult age</em>) pimping activities. It was Van Susteren who then just so happened to swoop in, take Vinson as a client, and quickly negotiated a plea deal where Vinson agreed to keep his mouth shut about his knowledge of Craig Spence\'s child sex trafficking, amongst other nefarious DC-related sex trafficking operations, in exchange for a lenient sentence. One other point of documentation: author David McGowan in his really important book &quot;Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder&quot; also links Craig Spence to Roy Cohn, stating that Spence once held a &quot;birthday bash&quot; for Cohn.</p>
<p>I think Roy Cohn definitely deserves his own investigation on Voat, but to briefly state one really important observation, Roy Cohn is himself accused of running a pedophile blackmail operation in NYC similar the one Craig Spence and Larry King were allegedly running in DC and Omaha, NE, as disclosed in the Franklin Cover-up allegations. Historian Burton Hersh wrote the book &quot;Bobby and J. Edgar: The Historic Face-off between the Kennedys and J. Edgar Hoover that Transformed America&quot; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/review/Corn-t.html">NY Times book review</a>. In the book about the long, complicated history between FBI Director Hoover and the Kennedy\'s spanning decades, Burton Hersh dropped this bombshell revelation about Roy Cohn\'s pedophile operations:</p>
<p>&quot; [...] New York attorney John Klotz began to investigate Roy Cohn on behalf of a client. Declassified New York government files and spadework by a private detective substantiated the allegation that there was indeed a &quot;blue suite&quot; at [NYC Plaza Hotel], Suite 233. &quot;Roy Cohn was providing protection,&quot;  Klotz discovered. &quot;There were a bunch of pedophiles involved. Thats where Cohn got his power from- blackmail.&quot;</p>
<p>Given the above, its entirely possibly that Roy Cohn, Craig Spence, and (possibly) Larry King were all working together in the same pedophile blackmail operation, ensnaring all kinds of powerful people in their web. <strong>Not to egregiously piss off all the Trump people out there, but there is no shortage of articles indicating that Roy Cohn was a very important mentor to, friend to, and lawyer and political &quot;fixer&quot; for Donald Trump over many years. Not trying to step on anyone\'s toes, just reporting back all the info thats out there.</strong></p>
<p>Getting back to Van Susteren, so to recap: so in the early 90s when a major child sex trafficking scandal threatens to blow the lid off many powerful DC figures, including Craig Spence, the lawyer who rushes in to do damage control just so happens to be the daughter of a judge who himself was closely connected to DC power brokers Joe McCarthy, and to Roy Cohn who himself is directly connected to... Craig Spence?? This whole web of inter-connections stinks to high heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Greta Van Susteren and the Haiti Connection</strong></p>
<p><strong>As already reported on Voat, Greta Van Susteren gave her name to the &quot;Greta Home and Academy&quot; orphanage located in Leogane, Haiti</strong> <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/article/about-the-greta-home-and-academy/">Link to Orphanage website</a> Leogane is a community southwest of Port au Prince on Haiti\'s southwest peninsula. Leogane was hit especially hard in the 2010 earthquake, and Van Susteren\'s orphanage was built soon after the quake. Apparently Van Susteren raised a lot of money for the Haiti cholera epidemic, and maybe for the orphanage?? The Greta Home and Academy is part of the larger &quot;Samaritan\'s Purse&quot; Christian charitable organization.  <strong>The President and CEO of Samaritan\'s Purse is Franklin Graham, the son of none other than Christian Crusader BILLY GRAHAM</strong> <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/franklin-graham/">Franklin Graham\'s page on Samaritan\'s Purse</a></p>
<p>Australian ritual abuse survivor Fiona Barnett specifically named Billy Graham as one of her childhood abusers, accusing him of drugging and raping her at a Bohemian Grove pedophile party [Fiona Barnett webpage] (<a href="https://fionabarnett.org/">https://fionabarnett.org/)</a>) She also named TED TURNER as being one of her abusers as well. <strong>As mentioned in my last post, soon after Van Susteren did her dirty work for Henry Vinson, she got hired as a legal analyst for TED TURNER\'s CNN... strange connection there.</strong></p>
<p>I have done some digging on Van Susteren\'s orphanage in Leogane, Haiti, and came across one potentially important lead. Author and researcher Stephen Lendman wrote a really important article on child trafficking in Haiti, called &quot;Child Slavery in Haiti&quot; <a href="http://dissidentvoice.org/2010/02/child-slavery-in-haiti/">link to article</a>. **In the article, Lendman talks about Haiti\'s horrible &quot;restavek system,&quot; a century-old system where poor children from mostly rural families, known as restaveks, are sent by their impoverished families to work as servants for wealthy Haitian families in the bigger cities. These &quot;restaveks&quot;, some as young as 3, in many cases fall victim to physical and sexual abuse, and are kidnapped into child sex trafficking rings. **</p>
<p>Lendman talks extensively about the Laura Silsby trafficking case in Haiti, and discusses how the director of the SOS Children\'s Village in Port-au-Prince said that many of the children Silsby was trafficking came from families and were not in fact orphans, despite Silsby\'s claims. He described how child trafficking increased massively across the board in Haiti after the 2010 quake. Getting back to the restaveks, Lendman cites a report from the Pan American Development Foundation about the restavek system and child trafficking. A really important finding in the report is that most of restavek child slaves who are trafficked to wealthy families in Port-au-Prince, specifically come from poor families living in &quot;... the southern peninsula communities of Les Cayes, Jacmel, Jeremie, and **Leogane&quot; (location of Greta\'s orphanage).
**
<strong>So we have confirmation that the location of Van Susteren\'s orphanage, Leogane, Haiti, is a source location for child slaves.</strong>  Given all these connections, I really think it would be worth the time to start digging into Greta\'s orphanage in Leogane, and the broader Samaritan\'s Purse organization. Here are some potential avenues to dig down:</p>
<p>1.) Here is a listing of Samaritan\'s Purse Board of Directors and Key Employees <a href="https://www.samaritanspurse.org/our-ministry/board-of-directors/">Link here</a> Do any of these people have connection\'s to the Laura Silsby/ Jorge Puello trafficking op? Do they show up at all in Podesta emails?</p>
<p>2.) Does the Greta Academy in Leogane itself show up, tangentially or otherwise, in connections to Silsby and her cohorts, or to any Podesta emails or related leads?</p>
<p>Hope this can potentially shed some light on this sordid mess, good digging.</p>',

            Glad I found this. I was scouring this place hoping to find something decent and I finally did. Good work and remember Craig J Spence and Roy Cohn are just the tip of the iceberg. Roy Cohn being Trumps mentor and Roger Stones friend should prove that this is a giant limited hangout and all these people are guilty.

             Not to egregiously piss off all the Trump people out there, but there is no shortage of articles indicating that Roy Cohn was a very important mentor to, friend to, and lawyer and political "fixer" for Donald Trump over many years. Not trying to step on anyone's toes, just reporting back all the info thats out there.

            Roy Cohn was the second most important person in Donald Trump's life after Fred Trump.   Cohn was Trump's entry to the rich and powerful and Manhattan society.  Remember Trump grew up rich, but he was from Queens and not Manhattan and his family made its money in apartments in Brooklyn and Queens for working to middle class.  He was part of the Brooklyn political machine and family friends of the mayor and the governor, but he was never part of the society crowd and it took him several years of scrapping to break into it.

            I posted late in the other thread...so re-posting here....more coincidences...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Great work, very interesting. It's starting to look like every pedo case has something in common...CIA and CIA controlled media involvement. The part about somebody from the WaPo calling and recommending Greta piqued my interest...Was WaPo CIA controlled back then as well? And if so, how did they hook up with Greta?
           </p>
           <p>
            So I looked at her wikipedia page
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren
            </a>
            ....Georgetown Law graduate...Podesta's alma mater and rumored to be a CIA recruiting center/hangout. Startpage it for tons of links, but here is one of the first
            <a href="http://georgetownvoice.com/2009/04/23/gu-profs-receive-secret-cia-funds/">
             http://georgetownvoice.com/2009/04/23/gu-profs-receive-secret-cia-funds/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I am doing a little digging in the Podesta email dump right now, but I used the search term Greta and interestingly enough, Greta Van Susteren was mentioned in the weird movie pitch email that could have been code for the Scalia hit. Characters Alex and Inez appear on the GVS show (about 2/3 of the way down the email).

            These people are way beyond any semblence of creed.  their loyalty is to Scientology because the church forces it, but within that it is to whatever agenda they are pushing.

           <p>
            The link to evangelical charity Samaratin's Purse (active in Alaska) and Van Sustren/Coale can be made as far back as the agenda of promoting Sarah Palin as far as her failed VP run - they thought they'd have a candidate amenable to their interests in dumb Sarah.  Coale advised her on setting up a political PAC slush fund and brought her to Washington DC where she met Kissenger, another time she attended the Press roast with old DC insider and Nixon CREEP Malek.

            Evangelicals run adoption mills, some are probably okay, some less so, just like funamentalist congregations.

            .  Something about this Scientologist, VanSusteren, has given me the heebie-jeebies for well over a decade.  I get a pretty strong "lesbian" vibe from her, too, even though she is married.  I have weak gaydar that doesn't buzz too often, but when I get a vibe, it's almost always accurate.  I've had that vibe from this cow for many years.  I'm so glad she's not on tv anymore, and cannot wait to dig further into her disturbing background...  On a side note, it ticks me off that so many involved in this crap are lawyers.   Lawyers seem to wield so much power in our society.  Too much.

            <p>
             Good point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just read that Greta defended Roger Ailles  in the Gretchen Carlson 
sexual  harrasment law suit.
            </p>
            <p>
             She and Ailles must have really had some kind of a connection ?
            </p>
            <p>
             Really surprised me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Had no idea that she was still practicing.
            </p>
            <p>
             On another point:
            </p>
            <p>
             If the story I just read is correct
            </p>
            <p>
             MSNBC gave Greta her unexpected notice on Thursday and she left
            </p>
            <p>
             the same day.  Gone supposedly.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand her husband is her manager.
He is also a litigation lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another point:
            </p>
            <p>
             I could listen and listen
            </p>
            <p>
             and listen to her on Fox...
            </p>
            <p>
             and get absolutely nothing out of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically stopped watching Greta in 2011.
            </p>
            <p>
             I kept watching her previous because that's
            </p>
            <p>
             what I  thought everyone else was doing.  ?

             Same goes for Tom Cruise and John Travolta. I remember watching a documentary on how the Scientologists un-gayed people. It was effed up to say the very least!

               A taxi driver once told my father a very very long time ago he has Tom Cruise in the back necking another guy. His jumping up and down on Oparahs couch solidified that fact for me. It's all a front. Which is pretty sad :(

              , good reminder that Scientology hides the gays.  The cult uses abusive tactics and blackmail on its members, and once Scientology has "the goods" on people -- especially the high-profile ones -- they own those celebrities.  Kind of reminds me of the politicians getting "brownstoned" in DC.  I did a quick Twitter search on Greta possibly being a lesbian, and came across the tweet linked below (posted in 2011) which says:
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               RT

                @AlecMapa
               </a>
               : If Greta Van Susteren isn't a lesbian, someone needs to tell her face, hair and clothing. Oh, and her girlfriend
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              I never did such a search before but I'm glad to see that Alec Mapa, an actor who's gay, gay, gay, gets the same vibe from Greta Van Susteren that I do.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here's the link to that tweet:

            Never forget, Van Sustren is DEEP DEEP DEEPLY embedded in Scientology, both her and her DC llobbyist lawyer husband John P. Coale, (who proudly calls himself "a pirate")  To the point that they actually employed David Miscavige's mother for years and years as their "money man" accountant at their personal law firm - you don't get deeper than that.  We are talking they are at the highest level of Scientology with decades of donations, deep operations and legal advice - Scientology's "ethics" require members to lie, cheat even murder if it benefits the church.  No joke there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientology has reared it's abominal head once in awhile here and you can bet if Van Susteren is involved, so is Scientology at some level
           </p>
           <p>
            Samaritan's purse as well as Van Susteren and her husband were all involved with trying to get Sarah Palin elected and we have never taken a deep look at her but there were a lot of questions around Trigg's birth which probably involved a fake pregnancy and shady adoption for political gain.

            Your characterization of McCarthy is mistaken; I would expect you to be smarter than to accept the conventional history on anyone LIONIZED or DEMONIZED to such extent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you not understand drilling in these historical narratives is how they brainwash people, through education and hollywood, known bastions of communists?
           </p>
           <p>
            "power brokers Joe McCarthy"  he was publicly censured by the Senate and died in disgrace of alcoholism.  Nice power broker.
