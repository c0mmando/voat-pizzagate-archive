<p>It just seems like mighty fine cover for himself to be leading this charge. In this thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1552674">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1552674</a> someone said &quot;I researched in 2005 and Atlanta, GA was the worldwide HUB for Human Trafficking. Can anyone here find info on \'The Dream House\' outside of Atlanta? It\'s a place for parties in the past with sex slaves. Attendees were Chris Dodd, Bob Corker and Fred Thompson.&quot;</p>
<p>Does anyone have anymore suspicious info on Bob Corker and his past? I really think he should be looked into... btw this is my first post as a longtime lurker. Happy to join the fight!</p>',
