<p>The l<strong>argest publicly available stem cell bank in the world</strong> has opened for business at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see the project moving to this stage,” said Brian Kennedy, the Buck Institute’s president and chief executive. “We think it is an important mission to create these banks. It’s going to be extremely valuable for scientists in the stem field and regenerative medicine, including probably our scientists.”</p>
<p>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine awarded Wisconsin-based Cellular Dynamics International and New Jersey-based Coriell Institute for Medical Research about $26 million to establish and run the stem cell bank. Both organizations pay rent to the Buck Institute and have staff working on the institute’s Novato campus.</p>
<p>The bank is stocked with 300 stem cell lines. Stem cells are seen as a possible regenerative therapy and as a means of generating human tissue for the testing of drug treatments. Embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into any cell type in the body: neurons, heart muscle, skin, liver or kidneys.</p>
<p>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was created soon after then-President George W. Bush placed strictures on embryonic stem cell research due to moral and ethical concerns. However, the Buck Institute won’t be banking embryonic stem cells.</p>
<p>The stem cell bank at the Buck will house induced pluripotent stem cells. Like embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells have the potential to be reprogrammed into any cell type in the human body. But pluripotent stem cells don’t have to be harvested from embryos; they are mature cells, like blood or skin cells, that have been converted to an embryonic-like state.</p>

Cellular Dynamics International will convert the tissue into stem cell lines at the Buck Institute.</p>
<p>Kaz Hirao, Cellular Dynamics’ chief executive, said pluripotent stem cells “are proving to be powerful tools for disease modeling, drug discovery and the development of cell therapies, capturing human disease and individual genetic variability in ways that are not possible with other cellular models.”</p>
<p>tem cells will make it easier and faster for drug companies to test new drugs for side effects. Currently, extensive testing is done on animals before drugs are given to people, which is a long and costly process. The ideal solution is to test drugs on human cells without risking human health. Since the most common drug side effects occur in the liver, kidney and heart, stem cells can be used to create those tissues for testing use.</p>
<p>The Coriell Institute will manage the biospecimen collection at the Buck and distribute the samples to labs worldwide.</p>
<p>Kennedy said, “They’re kept in liquid nitrogen stock so they’re kept very, very cold.”</p>

            Have done extensive research here...even though they claim harvesting stem cells from the elderly...stem cells come from living or recently living tissue.  More here:
            <a href="http://www.stemcellresearchnews.net/sources_of_stem_cells.html">
             http://www.stemcellresearchnews.net/sources_of_stem_cells.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the article:  "Adult stem cells
           </p>
           <p>
            Cord blood, umbilical cord blood
Bone marrow
Blood, peripheral blood stem cells
Menstrual blood
Skin
Teeth
Placental tissue
All of these sources of adult stem cells share some characteristics. Others are unique and options are being researched daily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Embryonic stem cells
           </p>
           <p>
            Human embryos
Fetal tissue"
           </p>
           <p>
            Key points...
-stem cells can be harvested from almost any living or recently dead tissue.  Best sources is bone marrow and teeth.
-"adult" stem cells just means they are harvest not from embryo's
-this would be an excellent way to dispose of bodies and also the bodies would be a fresh source of new stem cells
           </p>
           <p>
            Some thoughts - I have read alot about aging.  I have researched several vectors here.  BTW..part of pizzagate should include the alterations of science in our textbooks, etc...BUT..every single cell in your body regenerates.  So every cell can grow anew.  And yet we age...why?  One thoughts is something called telemores...which are kind of a mitrochondrial tail on cells...but it turns our telemores regenerate...so where is aging?  Where is clock?
-my research indicates we are capable of living well beyond 300 years..
-all this stuff we are now seeing about stem cells and drinking the blood of the young..do work at extending life...but certainly are not the magic bullet..

            The Buck family left a huge amount of money in a fund that was supposed to ensure that there was help for people in poverty. It was in the will that poverty was the issue to be addressed by the fund. They pulled some monkey business and used it for the Buck Foundation 
Research for Aging. That was not the intention of the Buck heiress who left it.

             A Novato High School track and field coach was arrested Thursday on suspicion of sexual relations with a 17-year-old girl, a former student at the school.
            </p>
            <p>
             Steven Deschler, 64, was taken into custody at 11:25 p.m. minutes after he and his wife stepped off a plane at Oakland International Airport following a visit to Hawaii.
            </p>
            <p>
             During a press conference Friday morning, Marin County Sheriff’s Lt. Doug Pittman said investigators immediately separated the couple so the wife could be questioned alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The arrest totally caught her off guard. She was visibly shaken at the time,” Pittman said. “It appears to us at this point that this is new information to her, and she needs to process it all.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Deschler was booked early Friday morning at the Marin County Jail on suspicion of oral copulation with a minor, sexual penetration of a minor, communicating with a minor with intent to commit a specified sex offense, and arranging a meeting and then meeting with a minor for the purpose of engaging in lewd and lascivious conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
             Deschler was released Friday morning on $100,000 bail. He could not be reached for comment.

             Shawn Buckley, 20, and his fiancee, Jazmin Moniq Khayami, 21, were booked on suspicion of human trafficking and probation violations. They remained in custody Sunday night at Marin County Jail, where they were being held without bail.
            </p>
            <p>
             The investigation began when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children sent a tip to a human trafficking task force in Marin. The task force consists of investigators with the San Rafael Police Department, the Marin County sheriff’s and probation departments and the FBI.
            </p>
            <p>
             The information was that a minor was offering sex through a website for escorts, said San Rafael police Sgt. Scott Eberle. Investigators arranged a sting to meet the suspected prostitute at a motel.
            </p>
            <p>
             Investigators met her and determined that she was a young adult who was being trafficked and sexually exploited by two other suspects, Eberle said. Further investigation led police to identify Buckley and Khayami as the suspects.

            Novato solar farm nearly ready to power homes

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Construction is nearly complete on the one-megawatt, ground-mounted solar project — the largest such installation in Marin — which will provide locally sourced energy through MCE, formerly known as Marin Clean Energy.
            </p>
            <p>
             “One of our founding goals is to provide 100 percent renewable energy service as close to customers as possible,” said Jamie Tuckey, MCE’s director of public affairs. “In Marin, we heard building local was important. Over the last few years, that’s something we’ve been able to accomplish. The Cooley Quarry project is an example of one of those projects.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The project stands at 6.5 feet tall on 11.5 acres of the 952-acre quarry where serpentine rock was once mined.
            </p>
            <p>
             The $5.5 million project will begin generating one megawatt of electricity to MCE via nearby power lines. In the following months, another half-megawatt, and a total 6,446 solar panels, will go into operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Three hundred houses will be powered in MCE’s service area, including Marin and Napa counties, Benicia, El Cerrito, Lafayette, Richmond, San Pablo and Walnut Creek.&gt;&gt;
