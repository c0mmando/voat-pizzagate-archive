            Can't get into the club unless you are willing to compromise your state of mind. If you try to leave there are tried and true ways to stop you. In the end it's individual belief to believe or not. They slip up over a large enough timeline to see the cracks. It's club logic. Everyone plays the game. Politicians, Police, Antifa, BLM, Neo-whatever. All of them. You cant fight them with morals of love and peace. I know the Satanists, Luciferians, Temple of Set, and whatever Alister Crowley's sect call themselves believe. "Do what thy wilt." 
Not all are involved, but the ones who are not in the secret club will cover or deny for the few that are in the circle. Log and document is the best we can hope for until more of us wake up. We are too busy working a nine to five to do anything for the most part. Family's to support, children to feed. The system is set up this way. Mores the pity. 
They will use anything to their benefit. Our petty differences and loathing of those who think differently allow them to move in the shadows.
Keep an open mind to everything, It's a false seance of  security to believe everyone thinks like you. They will use every slip to their advantage. We are all the same in the end.

            I'm going to argue here for a sensible middle ground. Yes, you are correct that people of faith, people with spiritual values, are more likely to take this problem seriously. I think that's a statistical reality, just as it is a statistical reality that "blue" states are somewhat less church-going and less likely to volunteer or give to charity than "red" states are.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I want to urge you -- all of you, not just OP -- to consider how your spiritual beliefs make you vulnerable to manipulation. Because they do. Back in the 1980s, the pedos exploited this vulnerability by playing up the Satanic abuse angle, rather than playing it down. The accusations quickly escalated far beyond what the evidence supported, dragging literally hundreds of daycares and kindergartens into prolonged scandals that led nowhere. The idea of Satanic abuse got discredited, which was a victory for them. And it got discredited in large part because of the excesses of sincerely spiritual people, who weren't good investigators, who didn't have anyone to impose rules of evidence, and who thereby got way ahead of the actual facts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that Voat's structure has some disadvantages. But this little community has developed some strong BS filters, and has stayed focused on real facts. (By that I mean, facts that will also qualify as facts to an atheist.) There won't be a repeat of the problems of the 1980s here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have something I am working on that will help address the scattered and repetitive way that subjects are addressed. Hopefully I can post it tomorrow. In the meantime, I would just say: Don't let

             There is a good healthy line were you can be spiritual without becoming a paranoid fanatic. Still your point is valid.

            Logically speaking this is a really dumb argument. How can you possibly equate some one's  believe in God with their belief in pedophiles who are actually tangible yet heinous on the Earth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, if God is so powerful how does God allow such evil to exist and cause so much harm? It would seem that God wants pedophiles to live and commit terrible crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is the the existence of pedophiles now atheist and agnostic peoples' problem? Why are atheists expected to compromise their Satanic operations?

            Discussion of personal religious beliefs and accusing pedos of belonging to 1 or more religious/ethnic groups really turns off potential helpers who could be adding to and disseminating info gathered. MSM loves to falsely rant on of how pedo accusers are anti-Semitic and/or obsessed with "Satanic Panic." That said, I've been repeatedly told Christian Conservative Secret Service Agents absolutely hated and often refused to accompany Hillary to certain private parties in Hollywood and also in Chicago.

            There's more than enough evidence available online (see numerous videos on the subject on YouTube) of what's going on by witnesses and former participants. Issue is LE fears serious retaliation and is often compromised. Word coming down to all levels of LE, from the very top on down,  "Hands off anything related to anyone or anything re "The Old Religion" if you don't want to get brutally killed.

            Solution? Petition to ask Pres Trump to appoint National Guard to interfere? He should go for it as there's direct Deep State connections. You do know they just tried to assassinate him in Vegas on 10/1, right? Word is a former MKUltra victim was able to warn him to change his plans ASAP and to visit Puerto Rico Sat night instead.

            POTUS met with those that $$$$ benefited from 10/1 attack in Vegas, after 10/1 at the Luxor. Shots were still fired and an unknown VIP on the tarmac of "Janet" en route to Area 51 was hit. At least Vegas wasn't leveled with 10's of thousands killed as originally planned.

             I wanted to address this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Discussion of personal religious beliefs and accusing pedos of belonging to 1 or more religious/ethnic groups really turns off potential helpers who could be adding to and disseminating info gathered.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The bottom line is we are not dealing really with your garden variety pedo. Just like everything in this currently post truth climate, even pedos are being used/weaponised as a smoke screen for some truly nasty stuff. We all agree pedophilia is bad, but there is a subset of abusers where pedophilia is at the heart of their Crowleyan practice. An evil doctrine that is being used as a blueprint for their "works" that involves pedophilia and ends in ritual abuse that has been witnessed and whistleblown by many for decades (Cathy O'Brien, Brice Taylor, Ronald Bernard, Cheryl Hersha, Svali)
            </p>
            <p>
             I too, don't agree that the ethnic group of perpetrators matters. To be sure, anyone screaming "it's the jews" is a shill. Try being more honest shiller: say "it's the kaballist/sabatean frankists/babylonian talmudists. WHY they are doing what they are doing does matter. And they have wanted to make sure that part of it is covered up as long as possible. Make you think if you lock up a few peons you've dealt with the problem when they are still doing it at the higher eschalons. This aspect is the most problematic because it is the one that their coverup is covering up.

             Also I do understand how it might piss folks off to hear the religious angle, but we are running out of time to help kids. We have a window of opportunity to make some big positive shifts while the TV is still blarring Weinstein. The Old Religion must be exposed, in all it's facets. Quickly. Thanks

            Submit to God. Resist the devil, and he must flee.
            <br/>
            Order of operations: 
1. Submit to God
2. Resist the devil.
3. He must flee.
Whether you believe in spiritual beings or just the concepts of good and evil, the steps remain the same: first, submit to the Good. Love, truth, courage. Second, resist evil- harming others unless absolutely necessary, deceiving and lying. Live in the Light. And then evil must flee. Look at the lights being shined right now in Hollywood. As Jesus said, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."
By the way, one of my friends who experienced these abuses in Australia said they did not have a religious component. Australia has traditionally been less religious than America. Yet the abusers still committed the same heinous actions- rapes, torture, killing animals and children. I think the religious aspect is invoked in countries where it will be perceived as powerful because of the culture.

            This is complete disinformation. Weinstein is part of The Cabal. It's not pulling me away from Comet Pizza, JA, Pedosta, or The Cannibal Queen. It's ridiculous to think so. But this thread did remind me of a tweet I saw. Now if I can only find it.

            by playing by their rules?
           </p>
           <p>
            Alinsky’s 12 Rules:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.“ Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Never go outside the expertise of your people.“ It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.“ Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.“ If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.“ There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.“ They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.“ Don’t become old news.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.“ Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.“ Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.“ Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.“ Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.“ Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.

            Ok this is the second time in a couple days that someone has implied that not being religious prevents one from believing p-gate is real. When did that become an argument? I don't see what one has to do with the other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the argument here, if you aren't religious it's time to get religious because whatever god is the only way to stop this?
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe and know that
            <em>
             they
            </em>
            believe in what they are doing,
            <em>
             they
            </em>
            believe they are doing Satan's bidding, but that doesn't mean the only way to overcome it is to believe in it, or the other side of the coin myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you try to bring religion into it on a universal level, this effort to stop it will continue to fail. It really needs to be a broader "us vs them" than "theists vs non."
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to digress, but that's why being on voat everyday gives me little hope in us succeeding. We absolutely can not stop the powers that be unless we all band together, but there are people here, that they think it's white vs everyone else. How the fuck will that succeed? Talking out both sides of their mouths, "Oh you've been brainwashed, goyim!" while buying directly into the division tactics that have thrust upon us to assure we'll never unite to overcome the evil reigning the world.
           </p>

            That's what I also think of, "you can't beat Satanist unless you believe in God..." That's personal. If that is your path to believing it and trying to overcome it, good for you. And my all means, speak your mind. But if you try to hard to change minds or say it's the only path... We will continue to fail in this effort.

             This is a reality I'm living right now. I can't tell you the number of people that live around me that disbelieve this could happen amongst real people. I'm hearing that I don't believe in this and It's not in my backyard, so I don't believe it. Some people still actually believe it's a story made up by the right to depose Hillary. I kid you not. All of these folks have one thing in common. They all claim to be athiests/agnostics and give me long tirades how this isn't happening because it's not being covered by mainstream news and because satan doesn't exist I'm just spouting crazy-talk. I'm sure you can feel how annoying that is, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not trying to make this a religious fight. They did that. So by acknowledging this we can find better information from more knowledgeable people, what it really is they are trying to extinguish with their sacrifices.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm also not trying to divide people. Just get more heads recognizing the gestalt of the problem. Anybody concerned about this is worth getting the right info to. We really are in this together. We just need to find individual ways to attack this. We have more than enough individuals. We just need some inspiration. And to strike while the iron is hot.

              I think that associating it to non-theism is something you did on your own, though. Even in the example you gave, you state they think it's made up to trash Hillary and it would be covered by msm if true- that sounds like run of the mill brainwashing to me. What does it have to do with religious beliefs?
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't you think millions of Christians think that same way? No one in my family beliefs p-gate, and they are all Christians. Fact. So should I jump to the conclusion that we need to figure out how to get Christians to realize it's true? That's exactly what you did with atheism.

             <p>
              Your title (paraphrasing here) is how can we stop them from torturing, raping, murdering the children? but the context of your post is, We can't stop them until or unless you acknowledge there is a God and they're Satanists.
             </p>
             <p>
              And then you say, "I'm not trying to make this a religious fight."
             </p>
             <p>
              As a result, the comments are a discourse on atheism vs. believers.

               It is ironic that you call the title a bait and switch, as this is the actual tactic they are using. Their doctrine requires that they expose some of what they are doing so that the subsequent public silence constitutes consent. They bait us with lurid details such as spirit cooking and Thelemic ritual deaths (such as the West Memphis Three/The Doutreaux affair/The Lost Prophets OTO affiliations) and then when citizen researchers are allowed to show anything to the general public it is switched for the sanitized version removing the component that gave credence to the MO for the deaths: Satanism/Luciferianism/Thelema ad nauseum. If we keep ignoring the reason for the deaths (sacrifices), we will run out of ways to prevent them by avoiding the truth. We can't fight lies with denial. No bait and switch. It's a call to action.

                Understood. But perhaps a more descriptive title would have mentioned the Satanic aspect. I absolutely agree that we need to call them out on what they're really doing and their true motivations, but as I'm reading the thread it seems more like you're saying investigators can't really fight/research this if they don't believe in God. If that's not what you're saying, perhaps it might switch the focus back to where you intended it-- a call to action.

                My personal frustration is that if I go off the script here in Voat I'm at risk for being called a shill when really all I'm trying to do is focus on the larger picture. I believe that everything is connected and the horrors are worse than even many of use here imagine. I also believe you and I probably agree more than disagree.

               Oh, they know she lost. They just didn't read/see the news reports 1980s and 90s about her and all the crap she and Bill were up to at that time. If you have even a bit of memory of that time/those articles, you could see through her in a heartbeat. the "rest of the world" is a little less informed.

                I don't understand where is the connection to pedophiles and Hillary in the MSM? The pedophilia blackmail is used to allow them to get away with bigger crimes - like foreign wars, massive fraud, worldwide organ, drug and weapons trafficking.
               </p>
               <p>
                How can people not believe existence of pedophiles? Are they in denial of all the millions of Catholic Church cases? The Pope allegedly has a direct connection to God, so wtf??

             An atheist will believe in Pizzagate. He will understand that there are pedo's in the elite. But He will not understand that all this defiling of the human race has a much bigger greater purpose which is a real danger.

            I am so glad you posted this. I posted a while back about this and it didn't get the attention that it needs. I've listened to several videos Timothy Holmseth conversations he recorded and of the threats he's received.

            I highly recommend that people watch this video and check out his website. This is his website.

            Also, I must say there is always something missing when we research a case, there is always a hanging thread that we just can't unravel. Whenever one of us finds something they categorize it as a Potential Lead or Clue.  Who keeps track of this stuff.  We should add it all together and see what we come up with.  Also, if we do have some really important clues that add up and we have serious evidence, who do we take this to that we can trust (and I do not mean any of the YT Idols).  I am really interested in hearing everyone's thoughts.

              I hope so too, but I  find it odd that someone else has not picked it up.  We have lost many good people that were extremely useful and instrumental in our quest to end the horrible crimes against our children and the globe.

             The design of the voat software scatters things out and stops conversations about topics from going further. I don't think it is intentional it is just a byproduct of the design.
            </p>
            <p>
             That does not happen in a forum that works on a bump system. On a bump system forum everytime somebody posts in a thread it bumps to the very top of the forum and everybody can see it. As new info comes in over time people use the same threads.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ideas and subjects don't die off nearly as easily in a bump system and the info tends to stay in the same thread.
            </p>
            <p>
             At Voat there are literally dozens of threads about the exact same subjects. I can't think of worse system to save information and keep a discussion on track. Its a train wreck for organizing information and keeping a particular aspects of a themed discussion alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example there should really only be one Harvey Weinstein thread that everybody posts to. That thread/post would be active as long as information came in and it would all be together. As interest in it eventually died out it would stop rising to the top of the forum. If new info came in it would bump to the top of the forum because somebody posted something in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the info would be together in just a couple of threads.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat's design is the opposite. It scatters info everywhere and kills topics. Not on purpose in my opinion, just an unfortunate side effect of the design.

              There is absolutely nothing stopping y'all from using the forum in this manner. But people want to accrue SCP for themselves (even though it does nothing for you...I think they think of it like reddit karma?) so everyone posts their own threads on the same topic instead of posting their material as a comment in a thread that is already live. I don't know why everyone does this, but they do.

                Putt had to remove Search both to simplify the port (it's a server hog), and especially to protect the site from the ongoing DDoS attacks. It is apparently quite simple to write bots that constantly search for stuff and bog down the server. That said, try using the search.voat.co (linked in the sidebar). It works better in many ways than the in-house search tool ever did.

               Yeah the desire to accrue points is probably part of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               But even if people keep posting in the same thread on voat the thread doesn't get seen unless you go hunt for it. If it bumps to the top it is immediately visible and everybody realizes that something new might be happening with a topic or new info has been found on it. It gets visibility and the discussion gets participated in. People might help you look for info.
              </p>
              <p>
               The way it is now if people want to hunt for topics on voat they will pull up multiple threads in a search. Then you have to hunt through all those threads to find what you are looking for.
              </p>
              <p>
               And
              </p>
              <p>
               If you find something new about a topic and you add it to a thread because you want others to look and participate you would have to ping a bunch of people to get them to look at it or nobody will know new information is found.
              </p>
              <p>
               I often find myself thinking "which post was so and so in?" and then I think "aww fuck it, i'm not looking through all those threads for it."
              </p>
              <p>
               So, I started saving threads. That didn't help much. Now I have a bunch of saved threads I still have to look through to see if I can find shit. If I do find it and think its interesting and want to discuss it some more nobody will know unless I make a new thread or ping a bunch of people.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wish voat would do away with the points and change the code to a bump order system. I think the forum would benefit from it. I'm not sure how the people that love their points would like it though.
              </p>
              <p>
               Frankly I don't care about them damn points all that much.

                Actually, this isn't true. Not if you are viewing via HOT. Anything people are commenting in rises to the top of HOT. And if you are viewing TOP, anything people are upvoating rises to the top. People just don't use it very effectively to keep posts alive. This is why it might be an interesting experiment to try a One-Thread-per-Topic Rule for a month or so.

                This is true...although we could add a "NEW Info" flair. If we culled all but one thread, people would have to read the new comments to find out new info.

                  I don't know. That would be a question for

                  . You might be able to guestimate the answer, though, by looking at HOT and examining the number/post time/frequency of comments.

                 Great thread.  My two cents.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One piece of reality seems to be that this site is working well enough to cause lots of stress on some persons.   ie the said to be expensive bots hammering voat.

                 It could be the chaos that we suffer through, that is actually working in our benefit.  The treads at present get lost so fast, they need to be carried forward in the minds of those who are here because they care for the children.  Our collective memory ability is building.  A hive mind is happening.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Chaos is a creative space.  Lets think carefully before changing the recipe.

                   Was hoping you would understand.  My point could be put, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

                  <p>
                   I'm trying to puzzle through how to have fewer topic headings and also accommodate how things tend to branch over time. New insights often create a need to start over.  But when you do start afresh, old work well done can be lost.  Mostly haste is waste,  I wish for a maximum word limit per writer also.  Everybody gets like 1000 words per week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If comment threads didn't need to be opened, that would help.  What says
                   <strong>
                    1 reply
                   </strong>
                   often hides a gem of a longer conversation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I see some folks posting several new topics in one day, that's a problem,  It's an abuse of our attention.   How about one a day with a three a week maximum?    I'm a comment-er only, It works for me.  I like the view from the peanut gallery, up hereI don't have to worry about the rules.

               Interestingly, mods don't remove comments -- so all the anger about post removals would go away if people started posting their submissions as comments, as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that I think about it, this might be worth contemplating as a rule change. That is: allowing mods to remove posts on the same topic and asking folks to repost as a comment within whichever thread on the topic was put up first.

              Bump refers to cocaine, just so you know what the MSM is now saying about 4chan, it is where you can buy and sell drugs because of all the bumping over there.

               I didn't know that MSM was trying to equate a bump forum with cocaine. I knew cocaine and "bump" were affiliated but I didn't know about the MSM part. Not surprised though. Guess we have to come up with a new term.

              Are you sure this was not created on purpose?  It seems there are certain rules that cause posts to be deleted and this nonsense about the monitoring goat is laughable at best .  Really.

            I am going to say that I believe they want bad deeds to take over this world.  Bad deeds create very bad vibes and the more evil  the more vibes, etc.   A vicious  cycle.  We must pass around good deeds and good words and smiles.  The more good deeds we do the more good we will create.  Think about it.  All the fake good deeds they pretend to create and tout on TV, they are fake and creating bad more bad vibes that I believe pass  through the air and the world.  They want us to create bad by creating fear and hatred of each other.  We must turn things around by doing good deeds especially for those they want us to hate.  If someone comes up with another idea that is fine, but we can still continue to create good vibes.

              It is hard to do that sitting on my laptop all day, but I am working on it.  I do at least a couple when leaving the house.  You can even do this on the phone, telling people how instrumental they are in your life. If you live in a building or home you can offer to pick up groceries for a single mom or senior. If you live in winter climate, offer to shovel that sidewalk for someoneThere are many things to spread the love.

            I have thought a lot about this. How does anyone stop this? No way to monitor everyone, every min of everyday. There is so many different reasons these sick fucks do this Evil shit. So trying to isolate this to therapy will not work. I don't believe someone is "born" a Pedo! 
So many people have kids, that have no intention in protecting them from anything! You can't make someone love! 
Just like with other disgusting addictions, or habits, how in the hell do you stop it!
We can take the $$ away, yet you still have "their power" you don't need $$ to hurt someone!
            <br/>
            So, you have to stop "The Power" 
You have to stop each individual's ability to have "power" over someone else.
Mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, reasoning, survival, educational, developmental, reproductive, fear, hope, happiness, love, hate, empathy, guilt, consciousness, conscience, pain, joy, trust, gut feelings, instinct, response, reaction  and soul.
Only death takes away mortal power!

             We can compromise their operations by exposing the "root", model and headquarters - Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone has heard the term Sustainability, but few know the real meaning. It is a deception (Satan's Ability) to forge global control and collusion across governments, industries, religions, media, and social groups. It is the central theme of Agenda 2030 that leads to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI and Community Policing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is the "Root" of all Evil, and the "foundation" of the entire system through such groups as Pilgrims Society, Club of Rome, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Committee of 300, Council of 13, Jesuits, FLDS, LC, Scientology, OTO, Kabbalah and others. It is a Global Coalition.

              Was the TPP part of their sustainability project? I want to have a look at what you're referring to that affects the area I'm in so I can redpill people in my region.

               TPP is part of the power struggle over Sustainable Development, which is partly why no one agrees on it. Keep in mind that on the surface many goals of Sustainable Development are worthy, but it is only a platform for power and control through their global network. Much like the false hope of AI, there are initial advantages like comminication and access to information, yet there are deeper underlying issues that lead to grave results and eventual enslavement in the wrong hands.

            I will speak my mind and hope i am taken serious. That atheism and agnosticism that prevents us from aknowledging them is just another of the traps they have placed on society to keep us from seeing the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            And what is the truth?
The truth is that God almighty exists and there are demons from the otherside that need/want humanity to fall.
This exactly what these people stand up for. The fall of humanity and the coming of an antichrist. The sooner you believe it the better your understanding will be of all that is going on.

             The truth also being that as I said before just because you DONT BELIEVE doesnt mean that they also dont.....THEY DO! No matter what they call them they do rituals to honor these demonic forces and they are using children in them. Can  we all at least agree on that and stop trying to disprove what others believe? Lives depend on it!

             agree.. if God is not in your heart and you dont believe Jesus died for all humanity and rose up in 3rd day you are against God and may as well belong to the Synagogue of Satan as you will not equipped to protect against the Illuminati spells present in entertainment.

             Oh geez, some of the most intelligent and caring ppl I have known are atheist.  An atheist says they don't believe in a source creator...so fucking what.  That does not make them anything other than someone that does not believe.  The atheists I know have a deep abiding love of humanity and feel they have to be good ppl bc this is the one shot they get to contribute to humanity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Agnostics say I need proof.  Again what is wrong with that?  Just bc they don't accept something on blind faith that makes them less than?
            </p>
            <p>
             Know what the real problem is?  Ppl holding themselves above others bc they 'believe'.  That is the most ridiculous load of crap from 'believers' I've heard.  For the believers of the christian flavor here what about judge not lest ye be judged?
            </p>
            <p>
             Lost their souls?  When were you appointed spokesperson?
            </p>
            <p>
             Know why nothing gets done...the apathy that is caused by living in judgement of others just bc they believe something different.  The belief that being a believer makes you superior.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then you have the various religions that look down on others...they all do it.  Heck, even the baptist can't come together so they have different sects and snub noses at the others.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the while children are being warehoused, tortured, raped and murdered.  Nothing will change until we see we are all connected, we are all a part of All That Is.  That's what I call source energy...does that make me some kind of heretic?
            </p>
            <p>
             No wonder none of this ever goes anywhere...god help the children bc we certainly aren't doing a very good job even helping ourselves.

              You're getting downvoted, but you're right. The problem is not the lack of Christianity, but the emphasis on a strict materialist framework. If you have a spiritual framework that allows for something other than strict materialism, you can resist the spiritual assault of these monsters, and you can
              <em>
               see
              </em>
              what they're doing - whether that framework is Christian, Buddhist, Indigenous, Pagan, or what have you. There are plenty of Christians who are more or less strict materialists who will never see that this is going on because they're stuck in the world of 5 senses and can't see beyond that. Materialism as a philosophy driving society was created to hide the actions of these sick fucks and to discredit anyone who spoke out against them because under a Materialist framework the belief in the existence of dark forces is insane, no matter
              <em>
               how
              </em>
              one comes to that belief, so they can smear the person who discovers any of this as insane for believing that there are people who literally do believe in dark forces and do horrific things to appease and invoke them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              a Christian, and with what I've discovered in my spiritual journey, I can never be one. I won't tell a Christian not to be a Christian, because this is something I came to through direct experience and not something I can expect a believer to just take me at my word on - they'll have to come to it themselves in their own way. But neither will I let a Christian tell me that only a Christian can resist or detect any of this, or that only a Christian can ever be a truly good person - I'm living proof otherwise. And
              <em>
               yes
              </em>
              , I do acknowledge a higher benevolent intelligence and spiritual power - but this does not require any of the other spiritual baggage that goes along with Christianity (or any other organized religion, for that matter).

               The masters came and spoke of the world beyond the 5 senses.  The religions came and reinforced the 5 senses...one could only enter 'beyond' thru dogma and some appointed leader/which of course varies according to system of belief.  One can only enter the 'kingdom' (various descriptions and hierarchy according to a specific belief system) yet the kingdom is within/has always been within/when we turn our senses inward.  It is right there, has always been right there.

              You are outraged that my words speak my mind. Every little thing that steps you farther from the truth is an obstacle that prevents you from seeing with clarity. Be it atheism/gnosticism or Lady Gaga. i speak for myself to whoever wishes to listen.

             A atheist would use the word interdimensional being, a gnostic would use the word archon. A Christian would use the word demon. Is there a difference between them entities? If not, how are atheism and agnosticism preventing us from acknowledging them?

              Because both the cabalists and regular people choose to label them as crazy and they are not. They have lost their souls but they are not crazy. When you call our enemies crazy you are underestimating the enemies in a plot that has several thousands of years. When they are caught their own people call them crazy, they do not want the population to understand what is at stake.

               the above said, but would add that the greatest enemy is apathy right now. That's what "they" (the followers of this interdemensional/archon/demon) want from the normie populace. We need new ways of interrupting things at their source, so we can save children's lives. Not this ridiculous slut shaming and apathy I'm seeing from the Weinstein exposure. Just sayin'

              I may not agree with atheists or gnostics, but they can still have a good heart and do good deeds.  Who knows what reason they do not believe, we have to work together.   I believe many of them want to rid the world of this wrong too.
