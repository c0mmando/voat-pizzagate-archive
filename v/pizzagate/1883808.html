            John Podesta and the team at Crowdstrike are on the case.  Here is what they have figured out so far.  Cozy Bear, Fancy Bear, Grizzly Steppe, Cozy Car, Cozy Duke, and the rest of the Dukes are actually all the same group called the Office Monkeys.  Seth Rich was the lead leaker in the Office Monkeys, which infiltrated the DNC via routers installed by the Awan brothers.  This team discovered that Hillary Clinton's IT guy (codename Oh Shit Guy) negligently stored SAP material in a toilet.  The team made copies of these documents and handed them over to another elite GRU hacking unit called "Wikileaks."  It's run by Australian and Icelandic hackers and is currently headquartered in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  They also have some German hackers living in New Zealand in their network, but it's actually a Russian cutout.  Seventeen different anonymous sources have independently confirmed this information and there is no question that 83% of American counties voted Trump due to this interference.

            They can't keep the game going much longer. They fucked up killing SR in such a sloppy manner. That's what happens when you send a dumb cop to do the work of trained CIA field agent. Maybe I'm wrong and the CIA has much lower standards these days. Fact is they have been scared for quite some time. Going back years to the abduction of TAM (The Anonymous Messager).
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck finding any information in the events that took place. But TAM was abducted for a week. Last he remembered being at a bar and stepped out into the sidewalk. A bit of lucidity he remembered being in a cell. Then being dumped out of a van on the outskirts of town. Got home all his computer shit was gone. A trip to the hospital found "truth serum" drugs in his system. Not long after he was dead. One of the last lines of the tweets I read "They are scared". Just had a flashback I thought I'd share.

            I also agree that there will be further continuation of the Russian Roulette Story.  They love to beat a dead horse (that is only a figure of speech I love animals).  They have been using  this story ad infinitum and will run with it until we put an end to it.

             Thank you. I know. I think that even if there is proof that Seth Rich was the leaker, they will still blame the Russians. It's absolutely ridiculous.

              I really do think there is something in the air, the water, or something.  People are so stupidly gullible.  They seem to be walking in a type of Dream Sleep.  They keep accepting the same propaganda talk over and over and over and.......over.  Until we stop them.

               I know. They are brainwashed and they think WE are the conspiracy theorists. But, they are the ones saying the craziest things. Then, the real evidence right in front of their face, such as crimes of Hillary Clinton, they just gloss right over. They need to go after the crime! Not the one that exposed it.

           </p>
           <p>
            Brennan, do you know David Attlee Phillips, Cord Meyer, Angleton, Dulles? Bush Senior? The mayor of Dallas in '63? And his brother?

           <p>
            What about Mary Pinchot Meyer? Dorothy Kilgallen? Lee Bowers? Johnny Roselli? Sam Giancana? Roger Craig?

           <p>
            What about William Bruce Pitzer? Ring a bell? Michael Hastings? Barry Seal? What about Gary Webb? Seth Rich? Phillip Marshall?

           <p>
            Who killed George de Mohrenschildt? David Ferrie? Who electrocuted and burned to death Dr. Mary Sherman?

            I hope you're reading. Does this look familiar? This is the guy that pleaded for help from your buddy George Bush, remember? And then he "killed himself"?

              I'm old I guess. They can all be googled. The graphic pic is the guy who was Oswald's Russian handler and also was a good friend of Bush when Bush headed the CIA. The guy got spooked 'cause he was about to be called to testify in the '70s and said he was being harassed (his testimony would have been damning). So he begged Bush for help. Their correspondence (handwritten letters) is available on the net. (They're both named George.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Bush Sr. told him to relax, it's just all the new interest in the Kennedy killing. Shortly thereafter he died from a shotgun blast to the head. In his wallet was "Poppy" Bush of "Zapata Oil," and Bush's phone number and address in Houston (I did the Bush's family Christmas card as a graphic designer just before he was CIA chief 'cause I worked at his BIG OIL printing company he had stock in, Fidelity Printing, which he named his boat after). Oil out the ears.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mark Lane went up to hear the recording of the shot. Some detective let him. The guy had a timer/recorder on to tape his wife's fave soap opera. Mark Lane heard an odd ticking sound on the tape and asked the detective about it. The detective said that sound meant someone entered the house. When Lane shockingly asked the detective about it the detective said they had no comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rant off. Sorry peeps. I hate George Sr., he has no heart, no soul.

                No doubt. On direct orders from Bush I would (almost) stake my life on it. They were FRIENDS, business partners.

               <p>
                It's all on the record. But the guy (Bush) is still walking free. There is plenty info that Bush set up the Reagan hit. Who shot Reagan?

                "The family of the man charged with trying to assassinate President Reagan is acquainted with the family of Vice President George Bush and had made large contributions to his political campaign, the Houston Post reported today.

                "The newspaper said in a copyright story, Scott Hinckley, brother of John W. Hinckley Jr., who allegedly shot Reagan, was to have dined tonight in Denver at the home of Neil Bush, one of the vice president's sons." - Houston Post, March 31, 1981, Tuesday, PM cycle

                  The Hinckley kid was the black sheep of the family. It was another Sirhan Sirhan thing. They used Hinckley, he was on the scene, but don't remember if he actually fired shots or not. But someone certainly did. Possibly it was just to scare, or threaten Reagan, into handing over the reigns to then VP Bush. Which he did.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Sirhan was brainwashed by the CIA, hypnotized (only a small percentage of the population can be hypnotized) ... or likely he was MKUltra'd ... he doesn't remember anything about the Robert Kennedy killing. He's only 5' tall or so. He fired shots, but wildly ... Kennedy was killed by a bullet to the brain from behind, Sirhan couldn't have done it. Likely (most agree) it was the security guard standing behind Kennedy.

                  Oh, one more thing. The only thing RFK said after he was shot was, "Is everybody OK?" Rosy Grier his good friend was standing by helpless, the big old famous gentle giant football player. It was beyond sad.

             I'm sure his attorneys don't want him showing everything to the public. It has to be done right. Unfortunately we don't see what's going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, he has all of those emails as proof.

             Well, Bernie is a socialist (communist) so their argument might be logical, but I doubt they'll go there.  Because it implies that the Russians really wanted a Democrat to win, and points away from Trump.

              Bernie is not a Socialist Communist.  Bernie has always identified his policies as a Social Democrat (similar to those of FDR) and even ran as an Independent in Vermont.  The Democrats allowed him to run under their Party for over 30 years.  Please do not spread something that is not correct.

               Read Quigley's "Tragedy and Hope".  The bankers (the CFR leaders, the central bankers - new world order crowd) thought FDR was an idiot.  The whole New Deal program was a huge loan from the bankers to the US Govt, at interest.  We would have been out of the depression with or without it.  And, btw, FDR was a communist.
