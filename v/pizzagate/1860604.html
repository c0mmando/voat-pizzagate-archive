<p>Udo Ulfkotte (20 January 1960 – 13 January 2017) was a German journalist and political scientist. He was an assistant editor for a German main daily newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</p>
<p>He published a courageous book in which he said that the CIA had a hand on every significant journalist in Europe, which gave Washington control over European opinion and reduced knowledge of and opposition to Washington’s control over European heads of state. Essentially, there are no European governments independent of Washington.
Watch this interview from 2014 when he basically spelled it out as clear as you can get! The CIA controls the mainstream media all over europe, usa and uk and commonwealth countries..
He speaks of been asked to do favors for friends who later turned out to be cia operatives, and also been directly asked by the cia on some occasions to publish articles written by them and sign his name to them which he did.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance to PG:</strong></p>
<p>The whole fake news narrative is blown out of the water here by listening to his testimony. This is similar to that Dutch finance guys testimony in that its very telling and excellent for red pilling people.
This is absolutely relevant to our investigations.</p>

<p>Recently, Dr.Udo Ulfkotte went on public television stating that he was forced to publish the works of intelligence agents under his own name, also adding that noncompliance with these orders would result in him losing his job.</p>
<p>He recently made an appearance on RT news to share these facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been a journalist for about 25 years, and I was educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public.</p>
<p>But seeing right now within the last months how the German and American media tries to bring war to the people in Europe, to bring war to Russia — this is a point of no return and I’m going to stand up and say it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia, and it is not right what my colleagues do and have done in the past because they are bribed to betray the people, not only in Germany, all over Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Udo Ulfkotte is a top German journalist and editor and has been for more than two decades, so you can bet he knows a thing or two about mainstream media and what really happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Dr. Ulfakatte is not the only person making these claims; multiple reporters have done the same and this kind of truthfulness is something the world needs more of.</p>
<p>One (out of many) great examples of a whistleblowing reporter is investigative journalist and former CBC News reporter Sharyl Attkisson.</p>
<p>She delivered a hard-hitting TEDx talk showing how fake grassroots movements funded by political, corporate, or other special interests very effectively manipulate and distort media messages.</p>
<p>Another great example is Amber Lyon, a three-time Emmy award winning journalist at CC, who said that they are routinely paid by the US government and foreign governments to selectively report and even distort information on certain events. She has also indicated that the government has editorial control over content.</p>
<p>Ever since Operation Mockingbird, a CIA-based initiative to control mainstream media, more and more people are expressing their concern that what we see in the media is nothing short of brainwashing.</p>

            As well as Mockingbird, it's very revealing to look into the term "Conspiracy theorist". It was a CIA psyop to dissuade people from questioning the official story behind JFKs assassination. There's declassified documents to prove it.  I blogged about it here
            <a href="https://redgreenalliance.com/2016/03/30/conspiracy-theorist-just-another-pc-thoughtcrime-label/">
             https://redgreenalliance.com/2016/03/30/conspiracy-theorist-just-another-pc-thoughtcrime-label/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this relevant? Because conspiracy theory is the mind control technique used to slur and silence anyone who questions the motives and actions of those in positions of power or control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best rejoinder to this accusation is to say
           </p>
           <p>
            "If I admit I am a conspiracy theorist, will you admit you are a coincidence theorist?"

            Need to look into "Non Official Cover", its basically a classification for a non official cia agent, where they will deny any knowledge of this person working for the cia when asked. NOC (Non official cover) probably sums up most of the cia agents in the field who are pushed into working for them non officially.

             i think they killed carrie fisher ... for whatever reason .... possibly star wars related ... but her and her mother debbie reynolds were definately hollywood mk ultra cia op related victims .... thats why carrie was so messed up and actually seeking shock therapy in the end probably because the cia was using it on her for mind control since she was a child seeing as she grew up in hollywood .... anyway i have a theory that after carrie died because she and her mother  were very very close debbie went ballistic and then she ' died of a heart attack ' only days later. another celebrity heart attack that left the public with cognitive dissonance
