             Alma Mater is Latin, the Vatican is Latin, Allumni is Latin, if you wiki all those titles they all pertain to the holy mother Mary. They had thier first global Allumni gathering in 2016. It was monumental.

            Cleaning this mess up is what's going on, but to do that, this ha to be uncovered. Be happy it's occurring. Think of what's gong to go on n the heads of those believing all the false narratives and lies. They're the ones that are gong to be red pilled by all this.

            Hey, I'm not sure if your last sentence was a joke or exaggeration or not... but, if it wasn't, and you are seriously feeling any kind of pressure. I want to offer you some comforting words.
           </p>
           <p>
            When this began to break last year and the shit hit the fan... DNC/Podesta/HRC leaks blowing up the web. Reddit getting shut down. 4Chans being flooded with "Zzzzzzz" shills. Archives being scrubbed. And an immediate anti-PR campaign being waged against a totally inaccurate PizzaGate narrative... etc, it was (and still is) absolutely overwhelming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every day we find more leads, more links, more dead-ends, more setbacks and more momentum... and that's just from the comfort of our PC monitors while chasing information. Beginning to think about what's actually happening in DC behind closed doors on both sides of the aisle... in the alphabet agencies... starts to crush your mind with endless possibilities and unknown outcomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, you need to take pride in the fact that you are part of the right side of history. You are educated and aware. You are possibly a part of a movement towards the next Renaissance, towards breaking the "chains" wrapped around true progress/transparency. Smashing the iron curtain and entering a new age of logic paired with accountability, stemming from the destruction of this MASSIVE conspiracy theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is everything accurate? No... Is every lead legit? No... Will Voat make a true difference in the course of history? Probably not... but, rest assured, you are far more valuable/educated/aware than most people. Take pride in that and keep your chin up.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are on the right side of history.

             Nice pep talk SoSpricy.  We've both been around from the "start" and have watched a lot of people ride this roller coaster.  Some can take it, some can't, some shut down, and some are paid to come here and try to discredit any research.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are not many of us out here, from what I can tell, who are operating at the level this sub is - in terms of generating leads, analysis, and intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             4 Chan is a nightmare.  I can't follow anything there.  I wait until it makes it onto Voat before I'll look.
            </p>
            <p>
             The one thing missing from the pep talk to anyone listening - take time to enjoy life, family, friends, and anything else good and relatively untainted by the evil in this world.  Disconnect from this sub once in a while.  Then come back to it.

              Agreed 100%... Family &amp; Career first... this kind of research/info gathering/red-pilling has become a hobby of mine. It's replaced TV, and I don't need to sleep that much :)

              I disconnected for about 3-4 weeks and came back fully recharged. October will be a good month my friend.

              R4R - I don't find this place depressing at all. Every post I see you guys make, every attempt to hold TPTB accountable, every debunked shill attack makes me proud to be here and in the company of those who refuse to bow to the power of the mighty and corrupt. There are so many here willing to risk themselves to see this through.

            I was reading today that 17 politicians were asked their opinion on Awan and the domestic violence being purported by three women.  There were 15 that would not comment. What the hell does that tell you? Politicians love to shoot their mouths off to whomever will listen. I think they are all probably being blackmailed and panicking about what he is saying to the Feds.

            Reposting my comment below because it is now hidden as a result of "Are We Sure" getting downvoated into oblivion:

            If these implications are true... and these large payments coincide with some kind of action (or inaction) related to Shawn Lucas and/or Seth Rich, that are made by the DNC. The payments were made before/after the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz by the way:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             7/10/16 = Date of Seth Rich's death
            </li>
            <li>
             7/11/16 = $98k paid to Crowdstrike for "Maintenance" via the DNC
            </li>
            <li>
             7/24/16 = D.W. Schultz resignation (I'd like to remind you that she maintained Imran Awan's employment until the day after he was arrested - 7/24/17 &amp; fired on 7/25/17)
            </li>
            <li>
             8/2/16 = Date of Shawn Lucas' death
            </li>
            <li>
             8/3/16 = $113k paid to Crowdstrike for "Maintenance" via the DNC
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Multiple email threads from the DNC leak implicate "Imran" (but no Awan... nor is he CC'ed on any emails) just before this timeline opened up. Indicating that Awan had access to at least Pelosi's and DWS's hardware:
           </p>

           </p>

            "On Wed, May 4, 2016 at 3:45 PM, Kroll, Amy wrote:

            "Subject: Re: DWS MOVEMENTS - 5/12/2016

Thanks."
           </p>
           <p>
            Those are the most direct mentions of access/higher ups at the DNC working w/ Imran. Interesting that they don't just include him on the emails... no? If it's a security issue, then he clearly should not have had access to their hardware in the first place. Especially not if he is the only one on the chain that had their passwords!
           </p>
           <p>
            So... with all of the circumstances above, you're going to tell me that Crowdstrike completed the investigation to "determine" that the DNC hacks were of a Russian origin. And never bothered to interface with, interview, or meet Imran Awan - the highest paid IT staffer on their payroll?
           </p>
           <p>
            For putting so much faith into the Russian hacking narrative Crowdstrike was paid to weave, you clearly don't have much faith in their investigatory prowess if they didn't even have a discussion with Mr. Awan. He should have been one of the first people they met with.

            <p>
             No it doesn't make any sense if they didn't know or had doubt. I can only conclude that there was no reason to ask Awan because they did know. If they'd asked him and gotten the truth, they might have been forced to testify to what he answered. This way they can just pretend they believed the Russian hacking fairy tale.
            </p>
            <p>
             And not for nothing, but those payments look so damning.

              This is called confirmation bias and you give a classic example
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Confirmation bias... is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses..... .People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Confirmation bias is when we ignore all other explanations.  For example,. Do these bills seem excessively high?  Because Crowdstrike did actually do work, so any "hush money" would be on top of that.  How many people would you have to pay off?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also Crowdstrike identified APT 28 and APT 29 as the culprits.  Was that report fake?  Because a fake report would cost something like 9 figures.   Why?  Because if independent companies examined what they did, but didn't confirm it, they could be driven out of business.   They are a one billion dollar company.   If you had a one billion dollar company, what would you charge for a few months work for consulting, hush money for 2 murders, and a fake report that could drive you out of business or make you a 500 million dollar company instead of one billion?   I would charge a lot for that.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have a question for the investigators. How much did the DNC pay Crowdstrike in 2016?

             Dude, are you kidding?  Do you not know how much specialized IT services cost?  Especially when you're security's ALREADY been compromised? Do you know how few firms are capable of doing what they do? They are a cutting edge, next generation cybersecurity firm.   Massive payments?
            </p>
            <p>
             Their competitor FireEye made 100 million last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's some of what they did.
            </p>
            <p>
             Installed their software on every DNC machine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monitor all program activity on these machines.  ....what commands are being executed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Compare this activity to a massive database of computer activity from PC's they monitor. (A database that monitors about a trillion computer events a year.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Isolate  the security events to compare them to previous hacks.  Look for identifiers
            </p>
            <p>
             So what's your basis for saying these payments are out of the ordinary?

              The chronology of the payments... the other smaller payments surrounding these larger ones. Furthermore, it was the FBI that funded the outsourced investigation via Crowdstrike. The funding did NOT come from the DNC:

               Other high-tech companies have also won business from the FBI, including CrowdStrike, a cyber forensics firm that received a one-year contract for $150,000 beginning in July 2015. That period included the time when Russian state hackers are believed to have penetrated the computers of the Democratic National Committee and tapped into the email of the chairman of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign.

              I'm not questioning the amounts themselves... if anything they are LOW. I work in this space, on a playing field similar to Crowdstrike, and the cost of licensing/software setup/analysis to conduct an investigation such as this should cost significantly more. Especially when you look at some of their other contracts that have been awarded.
             </p>
             <p>
              Did you actually read the resulting Crowdstrike report? The "evidence" of a hack? It was an embarrassment... I could have done a far better job making fabricated evidence look/sound better than they did for 20% of the contract amounts they were given. Nearly a total of $350,000 between the FBI/DNC to put a shitty PDF report out that focuses on generic security tips and some activity from a out-of-date Ukrainian exploit that left fingerprints all over the server?
             </p>
             <p>
              All the while, the FBI never found it prudent to look at the server themselves?

              Come on dude. Your skepticism is healthy, but, this stinks and you know it.

               And why do you find this odd?   Personally, to me it seems like some small expenses that a person can put on a company card and larger payments that are invoiced....notice how this theory ignores the dates of when the invoices were sent.

               If Crowdstrike's report was so bad, why did their competitors confirm it?  They had an opportunity to damage a rival company by undermining their research.

                No... my evidence comes from the fact that the FBI specifically admitted they paid Crowdstrike to handle this investigation for them. They've also openly admitted to not having looked at/interfaced with the DNC servers at any point in time. Your "argument" makes no sense.

                Again, you are wrong. The source of information on these articles and the payments themselves are being pulled from the government's own public repository of contracts and expenditures. That image is the full representation of monies paid to Crowdstrike via the DNC. The link I provided also provides the full payment list made from the FBI to Crowdstrike. There is no cherry picking being done.

                What work? The report was a pile of useless nonsense that any Comp Sci 101 student could have pulled out of their ass. It was garbage and there were just as many tech/IT firms that undermined the work and scrutinized it as being extremely amateurish/inaccurate - you think that these other tech firms (which also rely almost entirely on the public sector for revenue) are going to spit in the face of their #1 client?
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, are you just pretending that Assange is not offering up concrete evidence that Russia had no involvement with these "hacks"? Just like the media, the intel agencies and these IT firms - when the truth comes to light and we know that Russia did NOT hack the DNC, you are going to need to sit quietly on your side of this debate and absorb what actually happened. Then, once that sinks in, you'll need to ask yourself WHY this happened... and WHY there was such a coordinated effort behind obfuscating the details/truth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Until then, you could always send an email to your local representative and inquire as to why the FBI's own IT/Tech division failed to investigate the DNC servers for this topic that has completely engulfed the media with accusations and endless "guilty until proven innocent" verbiage.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think your skepticism, while appreciated, is not going to hold up on this one.

                 Also remember that the FBI reached out to the DNC in 2015 saying there was evidence they were hacked by the same Russian groups that Crowdstrike later identified.

                 Of course, I'm not wrong. I know what their source of information is and I know how to search the FEC website.
And when I search the FEC website, I see that the DNC made 17 payments to Crowdstrike in 2016.

                   Other high-tech companies have also won business from the FBI, including CrowdStrike, a cyber forensics firm that received a one-year contract for $150,000 beginning in July 2015. That period included the time when Russian state hackers are believed to have penetrated the computers of the Democratic National Committee and tapped into the email of the chairman of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The FBI‚Äôs role in the subsequent investigation came under fire after the DNC‚Äôs deputy communications director, Eric Walker, told the website BuzzFeed last month that FBI agents never came to examine the servers after the hacking, relying only on information from CrowdStrike, which was also under contract to the DNC.

                  I was 100% incorrect. My apologies. I attempted to modify the URL string to change the search parameters and got the same exact results depicted in the .png - there were more payments after all. That definitely dampens the "Cherry-picked" transactions to your point.

                  You really think Assange would offer the notion that he has concrete evidence that Russian DID NOT conduct the hack if he was lying? What would the end game be? He's got a lot more on the line then you or I do. It would be a terrible decision for him to flaunt that and do a bait and switch.

                   This is months before anyone talked about the DNC being hacked.  This is the point you are missing.  This is a different contract.  Don't you see that?

                   The FBI got their hands on the actual malware used in the Attack and were able to examine that.  That's why getting their hands on the servers weren't a big deal.

                    Time will tell my skeptical friend, time will tell. I've still yet to see any evidence, plus, under oath there has been nothing of admission that no evidence actually exists (well beyond 2015). There seems to be some serious gaps on both sides. With evidence promised on both sides.

                   <p>
                    You clearly have your money riding on the Russian hacks = Russian hacks.

                   <p>
                    If you are right, that raises some serious, serious questions regarding Russia. If the other links you provided re: collusion/business dealings are then tied to the Russian hacks, we're entering into impeachment mode.

             If these implications are true... and these large payments coincide with some kind of action (or inaction) related to Shawn Lucas and/or Seth Rich, that are made by the DNC. The payments were made before/after the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz by the way:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              7/10/16 = Date of Seth Rich's death
             </li>
             <li>
              7/11/16 = $98k paid to Crowdstrike for "Maintenance" via the DNC
             </li>
             <li>
              7/24/16 = D.W. Schultz resignation (I'd like to remind you that she maintained Imran Awan's employment until the day after he was arrested - 7/24/17 &amp; fired on 7/25/17)
             </li>
             <li>
              8/2/16 = Date of Shawn Lucas' death
             </li>
             <li>
              8/3/16 = $113k paid to Crowdstrike for "Maintenance" via the DNC
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Multiple email threads from the DNC leak implicate "Imran" (but no Awan... nor is he CC'ed on any emails) just before this timeline opened up. Indicating that Awan had access to at least Pelosi's and DWS's hardware:
            </p>
            <p>
             "On May 4, 2016, at 12:49 PM, Kroll, Amy wrote:

            </p>
            <p>
             "On Wed, May 4, 2016 at 3:45 PM, Kroll, Amy wrote:

            </p>
            <p>
             "Subject: Re: DWS MOVEMENTS - 5/12/2016

Thanks."
            </p>
            <p>
             Those are the most direct mentions of access/higher ups at the DNC working w/ Imran. Interesting that they don't just include him on the emails... no? If it's a security issue, then he clearly should not have had access to their hardware in the first place. Especially not if he is the only one on the chain that had their passwords!
            </p>
            <p>
             So... with all of the circumstances above, you're going to tell me that Crowdstrike completed the investigation to "determine" that the DNC hacks were of a Russian origin. And never bothered to interface with, interview, or meet Imran Awan - the highest paid IT staffer on their payroll?
            </p>
            <p>
             For putting so much faith into the Russian hacking narrative Crowdstrike was paid to weave, you clearly don't have much faith in their investigatory prowess if they didn't even have a discussion with Mr. Awan. He should have been one of the first people they met with.

              Is it that the FBI and now special council investigation, tasked with finding out the extent of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, isn't talking to Awan, who is involved in a separate investigation?

               Hey! Welcome to Voat/PG...
              </p>
              <p>
               Nope. That's not what I'm saying... I am simply painting a picture based on circumstance. The DNC leaks left a seemingly suspicious trail of bodies. Now we see payments made with chronological significant timestamps associated to some of these deaths. These payments were made to a specific IT firm, which was a key player in pushing the "Russian Hacking" narrative as a fact.
              </p>
              <p>
               My goal is to link Awan, to Crowdstrike, for additional "links" between multiple ongoing/unfolding topics. Considering the DNC leaks have overlapping persons of interest with the PizzaGate/Podesta leaks, I think that finding that smoking gun will allow this to potentially get accelerated into the public eye. More light = Less secrets.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the Special Counsel Investigation - they seem to be almost 100% focused on the communications/business dealings between anyone in Trump's admin (pre/post becoming POTUS) and therefore, I see the current Russian investigation to be somewhat unrelated based on public knowledge of where that case is heading.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, if the Podesta Group is totally embroiled and the current Special Council ends up diving deeper into the Russian hacking claims/Crowdstrike/Assange's evidence against this narrative - this could* all wind up being directly related. AND, members of Trump's administration could still* be held accountable for their own deals/communications, completely separate from what we are focused on.

               <p>
                I read your post several times looking for the link between Awan, pizzagate, crowdstrike or the grand jury investigation and I didn't see anything. 
Does it hinge on the days Crowdstrike was paid by the DNC? What evidence do you have to link the Awan investigation to Crowdstrike? And what would be the relevance if you did find a link?
               </p>
               <p>
                Are you attempting to discredit the Russian collusion investigation or linking this to pizzagate? I'm genuinely confused.

                 Sorry, my motive to link the DNC/Awan scandal to the Podesta/Pizzagate leaks is based on 3 observations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  The DNC and Podesta leaks are intrinsically linked together, with key players in both leaks/cases (Clinton/Podesta/Obama to name a handful @ the top)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  RussiaGate (with 0 evidence as of right now) is attempting to "explain away" the DNC leaks, while a coordinated media campaign was launched to discredit Pizzagate on the same timeline
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  Awan is a new vulnerability, particularly with the DNC and DWS... but other circumstantial evidence suggests that the Awan Network/Brotherhood may be involved in far more than just bank fraud and secret servers... the Awan rabbit hole may go much deeper than that. His number of properties/businesses/loans and diplomatic/political access may also* be allowing for significant movement of black market goods.
                  <em>
                   Potentially
                  </em>
                  including hot cars, drugs, weapons, art and [drum roll] human trafficking.
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 I'm desperately hoping that the Awan/DNC cases uncover more details. But, I have no hard evidence... shit. No one here has hard evidence of anything. If they did, they would be dead or on FoxNews right now.

                   Ok... if that's all you think this is, I'm sorry. You should spend some more time on here and the original Reddit/Chans. Do you deny that pedophilia exists in the political system? Do you deny that there have been massive, historical, cover-ups specifically related to pedos? Do you not even begin to question links to the occult that were found in the leaks? Do you not even begin to question the language/strange sentences in the leaks?

                   Yes. I do. First off, Don Jr.
                   <strong>
                    literally hands over emails
                   </strong>
                   ... voluntarily. And guess what? If you can avoid CNN's reporting, you would find out that what was promised in the email/meeting invite was not illegal. Unless someone can assign a value to political information on one's opponent and twist the law to fit "illegal campaign contributions" somehow... and if that happened, I'm sure the lawyers would spend a bit more time on Clinton's end of the spectrum.

                   Thanks! I think the confusion is stemming from the MSM talking points... I'm not calling you gullible, because some of it is certainly true. Will Trump and/or his admin get in some serious trouble for Russian involvement? Communications? Business deals? Yeah... maybe. But the entire investigation has gone off the rails and is just rolling down a hill until it hits anything that can get anyone in trouble. The Russian hacks (DNC), The Russians hacked Podesta, the Russians "weaponized" the info, the Russians "made up" the emails, the Russians interfered with votes, the Russians hacked the voter systems, the Russians are working with Assange, the Russians have jeopardized our democracy... etc... allllllll of these narratives were spun by the media over time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And now what? We're left w/ Don Jr. taking a meeting, some shady business dealings w/ Manafort (ironically implicating The Podesta Group and responsible for the unmasking scandal - which is far worse/more dangerous) and a handful of "Russian" Facebook accounts that even Mark Zuckerberg admitted "weren't that many"...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Seems a LOOOOONG way off from where the accusations began to me.

                    Don't give me names of websites, explain the evidence other than 4chan inventing a code for hacked email which started this bullshit. I do believe paedophilia is far too rampant  in all walks of life. There has also been cover ups for all kinds of things but that isn't evidence for this, as i'm sure you understand.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    i don't see links to the occult, neither do I see strange language, only the type of shorthand everyone uses with friends. It's funny because for all your denials you are admitting here it's all about the "strange languages" which the guys who gave you the grifter was happy to interpret.

                   <p>
                    As for Don jr he released the emals which the fake news already had and was about to release. But you're clearly a guy/gal who understands cryptology  so i'll leave you this to translate.

Rob Goldstone to Trump Jr
Emin [Agalarov, a Russian pop star represented by Goldstone] just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras [a Moscow-based developer who tried to partner with Trump in a hotel project] this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government‚Äôs support for Mr Trump ‚Äì helped along by Aras and Emin.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can also send this info to your father via Rhona [presumably Rhona Graff, Trump‚Äôs longtime executive assistant], but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
Thanks Rob I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it‚Äôs what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    6 June 2016
Goldstone to Trump Jr
Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary info ‚Äì you had mentioned early this week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day. Best to you and your family.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
Rob could we speak now?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Goldstone to Trump Jr
Let me track him down in Moscow. What number he could call?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
My cell.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Goldstone to Trump Jr
He‚Äôs on stage in Moscow but should be off within 20 minutes so I am sure can call.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
Rob thanks for the help.

                    7 June 2016
Goldstone to Trump Jr
Hope all is well. Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday. I believe you are aware of the meeting ‚Äì and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you? I assume it would be at your office.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
How about 3 at our offices? Thanks Rob appreciate you helping set it up.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Goldstone to Trump Jr
Perfect ... I won‚Äôt sit in on the meeting, but will bring them at 3pm and introduce you etc. I will send the names of the two people meeting with you for security when I have them later today.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
Great. It will likely be Paul Manafort (campaign boss) my brother in law [Jared Kushner] and me. 725 Fifth Ave 25th floor.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    8 June 2016
Goldstone to Trump Jr
Good morning. Would it be possible to move tomorrow meeting to 4pm as the Russian attorney is in court until 3 I was just informed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Trump Jr to Goldstone
Yes Rob I could do that unless they wanted to do 3 today instead ... just let me know and I‚Äôll lock it in either way.
                   </p>
