<p>&quot;Opium dens had been around in Washington, DC, for some time.

            Connection = Deutsche Bank = Paris Accords = Cap and Trade. Cap and Trade was never passed by congress but New England states , in particular those on the border of Canada, have it anyway. The money is in renewable energy credits...mainly for elite democratic insiders and corporations. In this case wind farms ..do not produce power but nevertheless are supposed to save us. From what? The dem. insiders, owning lots of shares in hedge funds which  built in upper state NY and ME are rahm emanuel and larry summers. Deutsche bank financed home loan and rental property for state legislator way out in the boonies , near me, The company which built here had bought out lots of enron assets and got middle management people. Their SEC report stated they don't have to produce power to make money. SO...electricity bills go up.......taxes pay for the monsters .......birds die ...people and animals get sick who live near one........and they don't even produce power .

             Deutsche Bank founder Ludwig Bamberger:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Bamberger was born in the wealthy Jewish Bamberger family in Mainz. After studying at Gießen, Heidelberg and Göttingen, he entered law.
When the revolution of 1848 broke out he took an active part as one of the leaders of the republican party in his native city, both as popular orator and as editor of the Mainzer Zeitung. In 1849 he took part in the republican rising in the Palatinate and Baden; on the restoration of order he was condemned to death, but he had escaped with other leading revolutionaries like Germain Metternich, Louis Blenker, and Franz Zitz to Switzerland. The next years he spent in exile, at first in London, then in the Netherlands; in 1852 he went to Paris, where, by means of private connections to the Bischoffsheim family, he received an appointment in the bank of Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt &amp; Cie, of which he became managing director, a post which he held till 1866. During these years he saved a competence and gained a thorough acquaintance with the theory and practice of finance. This he put to account when the amnesty of 1866 enabled him to return to Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was elected a member of the Reichstag, where he joined the National Liberal Party, for, like many other exiles, he was willing to accept the results of Otto von Bismarck’s work. Bamberger represented the electoral district of Bingen-Alzey and married Anna Belmont, a relative of the famous banker August Belmont, who had emigrated to the United States."

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             NOTE:  August Belmont was a Rothschild agent to America.
Was Deutsche Bank originally a Rothschild connected bank?

             "Founded in Berlin in 1870, Deutsche Bank played a major role in financing electrification and railway expansion in Germany as well as other countries. It continued to grow until Germany's defeat in the First World War and Allied demands for reparations put the country's banking system in a precarious position. To cope with the instability, Deutsche Bank merged with its main rival Disconto-Gesellschaft in 1929. The combined operation, now far and away the leading bank in Germany, weathered the Depression and ensured its political survival through the war years by providing financial support to the Nazi regime and removing the Jewish members of its board directors.
            </p>
            <p>
             After the war, Allied authorities determined that Deutsche Bank had not only actively supported the Nazi regime but had also maintained close ties to officials such as SS chief Heinrich Himmler and had been involved in appropriating assets of financial institutions in countries overrun by the Nazis. The occupying forces divided the bank first into ten and then three regional institutions, one each for the north, central, and southern regions of West Germany. In 1957, however, the operations were reunited and allowed to function under the Deutsche Bank name once again."

             "Back in 2016, I wrote an opinion piece recommending that all banks should measure their credit risk exposure to Deutsche Bank, because the globally systemically important bank was (and is) very interconnected with U.S. banks and other financial institutions (OFIs), often referred to as non-banks or shadow financial institutions. That same year, the International Monetary Fund emphasized that Deutsche Bank was a systemically important bank, meaning that if it fails, the repercussions will be felt widely and likely painfully.
What I find truly incredible is that Deutsche Bank has been allowed to operate in the U.S. as long as it has.  Deutsche Bank’s Board of Directors and senior executives have allowed the bank to be engulfed in numerous money laundering, weak controls, market manipulations, and fraud scandals. Deutsche Bank bankers’ greed has also blinded them from filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)."

               And who controls Deutsche Bank now?

              <p>
               After WW2, were the Nazi removed "Jewish members of its board directors" allowed back into the bank board? Did the Allies give original Jewish control back to the bank?

               "Although its leading representatives scarcely agreed with the ideology of National Socialism, they complied with
the racist goals of the regime from the outset, putting up no resistance; the feeling of impotence and feebleness instilled in them by the aftermath of the 1931 banking crisis and the anti-bank ideology of leading Nazis was simply too great. Adaptation and a willingness to compromise were in their view the order of the day. For instance, by 1934 the three members of the bank’s Management Board whom the new government defined as Jews had been banished from this body. Only on the Supervisory Board was a Jewish colleague tolerated as late as 1938."

              "Deutsche Bank was founded in Berlin in 1870 as a specialist bank for foreign trade.[8] The bank's statute was adopted on 22 January 1870, and on 10 March 1870 the Prussian government granted it a banking license. The statute laid great stress on foreign business: "The object of the company is to transact banking business of all kinds, in particular to promote and facilitate trade relations between Germany, other European countries and overseas markets."[9] The bank's first domestic branches, inaugurated in 1871 and 1872, were opened in Bremen[10] and Hamburg.[11] Its first foray overseas came shortly afterwards, in Shanghai[12] (1872) and London[13] (1873). Already, at this early stage, the bank was looking further afield, making investments in North and South America, Asia, and Turkey. Major projects in the early years of the bank included the Northern Pacific Railroad in the US[14] and the Baghdad Railway[15] (1888). In Germany, the bank was instrumental in the financing of bond offerings of steel company Krupp (1879) and introduced the chemical company Bayer to the Berlin stock market. "

             The East India Company, later Jardine Matheson, used opium to balance it's trade with China for silk and tea. Originally, they tried to use the American colonies, but after the Boston tea party, the opium strategy was used. The Jewish Sassoon family had fled Iraq and set up their opium empire in India. The Rothschild controlled East India Co. clandestinely shipped Sassoon opium to China to get the citizenry hooked. This is how they got the gold and silver to pay for the tea and silk and "balance" the trade. When China found out, they tried to outlaw it, but to no avail. The East India Co. by that time had such a bad reputation that they morphed into Jardine Matheson trading Company. Under their leadership, England was dragged into the Opium Wars against China, and prevailed. Hong Kong was established as a British trading port.
