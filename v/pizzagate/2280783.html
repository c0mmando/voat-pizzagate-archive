            Do you know this person? Someone sent me a harassing message on Thursday using her as a model. 
I was also sent the message "I ejaculate to dead children" and I was sent harassing messages from someone I believe to be Greg Chism with photos of a naked dead body in a pool of blood in a hospital bathroom, apparently doing a push up from Rigor Mortis.

             GOOD GOD!!!  This is as sick as it gets.  Do not recognize the girl.  Have you reported this to the FBI?  This to me is a definite threat, and I don't know how they could view it otherwise.

              Hell yes I reported it. It is a full time job now reporting them because their behavior is so bad and constant. Did you see the article claiming that the FBI said he's not under investigation and some Missouri PD that didn't know about his investigation two days before the article suddenly cleared Greg Chism of wrongdoing after supposedly investigating him? Funny as hell. Usually Trump likes to let people think they are off the hook right before they get arrested.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that child is not Lisa Irwin then Greg Chism and his friends must have been lying when John Tanko bragged about selling Lisa Irwin for $300. Perhaps the Kansas City PD knows something more than what they are saying. It can be difficult to take down pedo rings...

               This so much smacks of the LE protecting Chism.  There is a ring operating in that area and I believe there is also a large CP operation there as will, the one that replaced The Wonderland Club.  So of course I am sure they have protection in place.  They always do.  Also, I am sure Chism is hooked up with people that are involved in the most unsavory operations.  I also believe, as you must, that they would not lie about such a thing as the selling of Lisa.  They love bragging about their crimes.  I also think he has family in or near St. Charles.

                Yeah well he was already trying to delete his YouTube accounts as a precaution after he was sure I knew how they are communicating, at least partially. The Buzzfeed and Daily Mail articles are proof that he did it as a precaution, that was the exact quote. 
Freudian.slip should be its own domain.
               </p>
               <p>
                It would be full of quotes from Chism and his friends.
               </p>
               <p>
                When I was looking into the Lisa Irwin thing, if you type in addresses from the court website Missouricourts.gov, you can find facebook profiles of numerous people who live near Megan Wright or Angelica Chism and Lisa Bhaktiari and they are ALWAYS posting concern trolling photos of children who went missing. One of them was a 13 year old boy. They seem to operate mostly in the Kansas City and St. Louis Missouri area and then distribute the chlidren around. Often the comments on the YouTube videos would be actual addresses that would link back to either abandoned buildings or foreclosed houses. I imagine that they would easily break into these buildings to commit murders and rapes since they're low key places nobody will be looking. At least two other people I looked into were posting photos of abandoned buildings onto their instagram, as though it was a joke that it was scary. It is scary, when the person doing that has the perfect cover / beard going on.
               </p>
               <p>
                For example, go to the instagram for Doyle Mills and look for the abandoned building. Also look for the person referring to him as Daddy, her profile name withinthewires makes me think that they are using wiretaps or some other form of monitoring, unless it's referring to information being sent through wires like footage or something. Just weird.

             I'm sure its a fake account. Of course probably instigated by Greg. I get his little "joke" though. Richard and dick are the same. Dick is short for Richard. And "Dick es son" is probably something like "Dick his son" meaninging fucking kids and "fuck Jesus" because Jesus is the Son of God.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know if Baph is still in business over at 8chan or not. If they are they might dox this person and trace down where the threats are coming from. They don't do personal army stuff but maybe they hate pedos. Anonymous might dox them but who knows how to get hold of them? There are two other groups who work on stuff like this on the dark web but I don't remember their names.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is trying to scare you. I wish our law enforcement was not so corrupt. If they were half ass legit their cyber teams would be looking into all this pedo stuff and busting pervs. I pinged darkknight111 maybe dark knows some of those dox teams.

              First it was Richard Nesbit who lives somewhere near me, then Richard Dickeson, there was also a Sean Irish, who told me a bullet would be the cure (for me), and numerous other fake accounts in the past... some dude offering to trade me his Glock 21 for my Taylor guitar, his profile had a picture of a woman eating a baby as the profile picture or something. Creating fake accounts using other people's real photos seems to be how they get away with everything. At this point only Facebook and the FBI or CIA would be able to give us a real bit of info to track who's who and I think we know that ain't happening.

               One of the MSM articles on ToyFreaks mentioned that he moved to Missouri this year, probably to the bigger house pictured in some of the newer videos. I don't know the details but the rest of their articles basically took everything from all of my articles and put it in there minus the really bad stuff about child pornography and Pakistani human trafficking.

            Yea it's great to take pictures of them, they believe they have power as if they are super men or bat men, but catch them with a picture and they will leave and run away, you are doing good, if they attack you get used to it and keep doing good and don't get caught haha. Work on meditation and prayer, and one can use the energy power of love chi prana to send it to their hearts and since they may not have a heart, base chakra dwellers they can and do die from heart attacks. I never believed until in a bind I sent loving heart energy at two close abusers, they died within three days, both within the same week. Pretty bizarre but it was worth it. Are you depressed, have no energy??? perhaps you live around an ASSHOLE, by being away from that person or place, you feel better haha. Paid spies living their 007 fantasy, not glamourous.

              Yeah, that sounds like a great idea... send them loving energy. I notice when I post my favorite Christian artist on my Facebook or Twitter they kind of shut up, evil spirits don't like to be around someone singing praises to God.

            Hidden cams, trick them so the spooks open up, ex. tell them what will take for them to quit stalking you etc. Make sure you are alone, ie. no witnesses around you because they might react loudly to attract attention and call you crazy. Camera is your best friend.

            Sounds like shareblue attacking you.
Beat them at there own game and dox them with some insults as suggested by an exshareblue employee.

            " Just fight them at their own game, expose them for the shitbags they are, post memes with their pics, they fucking HATED that. This one girl Karla Towe was brought to tears because you found her pictures and spread them and her mom's pics. The biggest thing these people fear is to be brought into the spotlight, their flaws exposed for all. THIS IS HOW YOU BEAT THEM.

            Just like that "Nipplegate" thing, people have feelings and tapping into their basest emotions is what works best. Oliver's lisp. Angelo's chicken legs and affair with Brock. Etc."

             This is not only 100% correct, its effectiveness is astonishingly powerful.
Warfare strategists from Sun Tzu to Alinsky highlight how an enemy's biggest vulnerability us turning his tactics back towards him.
Work, people.
Read, learn, spread the word.
Shine the light on these motherfuckers.
And, really, that is all they actually are ... mere cowardly husks who are raping our children,
