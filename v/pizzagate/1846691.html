<p>Its only cause I come up with crazy/absurd realities that go with them. Some have recently asked me &quot;Do you believe everything Wikileaks publishes?&quot;</p>
<p>Well.. It\'s not wikileaks. It\'s straight from the horses mouth/emails.
I made this up for you! It\'s a story/poem/performing arts?</p>
<p>I have learned of many atrocities; You would be really surprised. If only you could notice all of &quot;Podesta.Co\'s&quot; lies</p>
<p>It\'s hidden in details, cleverly mixed in with ambition. It\'s a whole other world, when you start to see peoples intentions.</p>
<p>If you cant notice this... Please dont ask me. I don\'t know why. Some people are crazy and for sure some of us lie.</p>
<p>Some are all around us; Cleverly Hidden in disguise. I make no accusation. I could get end up in trouble with a group of some guys.</p>
<p>The things I\'ve read...</p>
<p>I hope you like(d) my poem and save it with a screen shot. Ive been working on this piece for a while. and yes... I did edit out the parts where they wink at you before everything.</p>
<p>Before I hand it off to the actual story tellers I feel i should say. FOCUS READ/LISTEN !! LEARN how to use your eye. ;)</p>
