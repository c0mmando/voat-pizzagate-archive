<p>&quot;Anti-network trolls are encouraging viewers to wrongly accuse CNN staffers of pedophilia and child pornography. There is also “tons of anti-Semitism.”</p>
<p>The article offers absolutely nothing in the way of examples as to how they\'ve been accused of pedophilia... so, in full agreement with the previous post referenced above, this seems totally out of left field and almost like a pre-baked defense. </p>
<p>However, I wanted to also focus on the seemingly unrelated anti-semitism. As I have warned time and time again, this anti-Jew rhetoric has been bubbling up here on Voat and just about everywhere. While there could certainly be some validity to the roots of all these issues and how it relates to some of the largest conspiracy theories out there, it is commonly paired with extremely unnecessary/violent verbiage that offers nothing constructive.

Now this is simply the next stage... take all of these &quot;dangerous&quot; outlets that are exercising free speech and tearing down the iron curtain, lump them all together and cite the hate speech/violence that THEY are intentionally injecting and use this as a method to further silence/censor us. </p>

            I think the shills use it against us, but I also suspect many are legitimate accounts. If your an antisemite this is one of few places left for you to speak. Same with other racists. Or people who think homophilia is degenerate. Or really anything controversial. This is what happens when you censor everything. The people affected the most simply gather elsewhere.

            And this is supposedly in the name of tolerance.

            Frankly they created anti semitism as a cover.  They use it whenever we get close to the truth......but the truth is the Jews are behind all this.  But they want you to fear going there because you grew up in a society that has hammered home over and over again the worst thing in the world is to think bad thoughts about Jews.   It really goes like this.....you need workers for your satanic shit....so you use the Jew.  The normal Jew knows nothing is up....the ruling Sabbetean Jew contols it all.....when some satanic shit gets uncovered the normal Jews get all the blame....but since they are not in the know they think they are being wrongfully persecuted....it makes them clannish and only trusting in other Jews....The Jew is really just the special shock troops for the Satanist.   Watch this video made by Jews for Jews.  The Sabbetean is desperate and calling out all the Jews to really get their shit together....http://www.connectedwisdom.org/jews-documentary/  watch that video and you will understand the Jew conspiracy is real....this is a video made by Jews for Jews.  This makes it perfectly clear how they think.

            Wow, you pissed off a lot of the antisemites. Good work, OP! Here’s the thing. “It’s the jews” is bullshit. It’s the jews, it’s the muslims, it’s the catholics, it’s the satanists. It’s in every religion, every school, every government. It has infiltrated every corner of our world. This is so much bigger than just the jews, and attempting to point the finger solely at them is idiotic.

             I truley believe, when the totaility of this Evil shit is exposed, those still asleep will never recover! The purely disgusting vile corrupt abusive Elite and all that trickles down from it, can not be "revealed" all at once. That is why those who know and have been letting bits and pieces come out have not just vomited the whole truth out all at once. No one who believes in God, will  ever be the same again.

             Who are you even quoting?

             You are calling the people that are suggesting a logical discourse "smug" and "ignorant" while supporting what would essentially amount to genocide. That makes total sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, and, for anyone else reading this... pay close attention. These hyper anti-semites that we are keeping track of are attempting to accomplish 2 things:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Drop these little "hate nuggets" to be referenced during any future events/attacks/criticisms to implicate various forum based sites like Voat
             </li>
             <li>
              Burn our time/lose focus on the topics at hand
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             I've had just about enough of goal #2. So, have a great life.

                      Never said you were Jewish.  Women lie with the same ease with which they breathe.  If you're not proactively researching, you're clogging the board, effectively shilling, so why don't you fuck off or just lurk

                       I research when I can... but, honestly, 99% of the comments on here are opinion based or interpretive. If Voat/PG was entirely posts/responses of purely proactive research (not including singular links posted from other sources to discuss/debate), there wouldn't be much on here.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Honestly, have you submitted any FOIA's? Conducted local investigations? Called/interviewed any potential witnesses or persons of interest? And then subsequently posted the new information that didn't exist elsewhere?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Maybe you have - it's a legit question. Not an attack.

                         Can you post one example of primary research you've done? Not just connecting the dots with existing links from other sources (we've all done that). I'm curious as to what/how you went about it... as I may have some time in the near future to add some solid findings and I live near an area of interest.

            100 Upvoats for you.  I couldn't have said it better myself.  Pizzagate is a non-sectarian investigation.  There is plenty of evidence of those involved represent every race:

           <p>
            Direct Pizzagate Influencers (not Deep State)
           </p>
           <p>
            Abedin, Jarrett, Obama: Muslim influence
           </p>
           <p>
            Jarrett, Obama, Rice, Waters, Brazille: Black influence
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis, Podestas, Palmeiri: Greek/Italian influence
           </p>
           <p>
            Wasserman-Schultz: Jewish
           </p>
           <p>
            Perez: Hispanic
           </p>
           <p>
            Who else is in the top echelon.  And for Hitler's Loser Table - Weiner isn't an influencer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The greatest common denominator is that all of the aforementioned are largely caucasian, and largely male.  And all of them have abandoned anything associated with what we would consider normal, moral behavior.

            To prevent "hate speech" is to prevent ALL speech. For when people are afraid to say something Hateful, people will say nothing at all.

             Fuck off idiot. I didn't suggest we censor hate speech you myopic prick. I suggested we delete comments that condone violence or suggest taking harm against others.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not a Jew. Nor a Jew sympathizer. I don't belong to any religious group. I don't have any strong political affiliations. I'm a mutt...
            </p>
            <p>
             Talk about Jews all you want. Talk about Russians. Talk about Catholics. Talk about blacks/hispanics... tell us how much you hate all of these groups. It will accomplish absolutely nothing. But I think a logical line in the sand is when violence is added to the mix given the current temperature and risk level associated with online discussions. We protect ourselves and what we are trying to do here if we can "weed out" that kind of threat.
            </p>

             Is that not logical?

            This is why shills like equineluvr have been posting this shit! Just look at what the shills are doing. It's a tell and give away as to what to expect.

             Really? It's not that hard to imagine... they planned the racial divide many months in advance, the Russian narrative, the Trump = White Power movement, etc.... this is a pretty shallow tactic IMO, and I can't seem to find the link, but someone claimed to have leaked the shill handbook. It went on to explain how the anti-Trump, pro-Hillary memes never worked, and to focus heavily on racism and anti-Semitic comments while questioning the knowledge of any non-shills.
            </p>
            <p>
             CNN isn't "behind" it, they are part of it. Following orders like the rest of the puppet brigade. They just so happened to be the most vocal, most two-faced and least trusted news outlet at this time. They dished it out and they can't take it back. They spawned "fake news" within 24 hours of the DNC/Podesta leaks hitting, and now they ARE proven to be the actual producers of Fake News... they are eroding from the inside out and trying to blame everyone around them as they collapse.
            </p>

              Accuse away. It will ruin them whether or not the accusation are true. And the Police don't care whether or not there are "false rumors" or whatever BS you Jews are trying to trick us with. They only care about the evidence, of which they've been using to take down soooo many pedophile Jews already.

               No, your downvoats stem exclusively from your low IQ an inability to approach this with any semblance of logic. It is not a BS narrative. It is something that has happened before.
              </p>
              <p>
               I agree with your 2nd point 100%... evidence is evidence. If we happen to find out that 99.9% of pedophiles are Jewish, my same sentiments apply. We take them down, hard. Capital punishment for ANYONE that intentionally harms/exploits children. No one here gives a SHIT who they are, where they're from or what religion they are... Muslim? Jew? Christian? Luciferian? Scientologist? WTF do I care?
              </p>
              <p>
               This needs to end. We need hard evidence. End of story.

            You are so right and bring up some good points. I hope everyone will check out this thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've got a really bad feeling that there will be an attack in the media soon. The recent escalation of the fake news and trump vs MSM narrative has gotten out of control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly... The hate speech needs to stop!!! It is NOT AT ALL helpful to our cause or helping children.
           </p>
           <p>
            TRUTH: There are pedofiles who are Jewish, Catholic, WASP, luciferian, atheist... Pedofiles can be men or women. Democrat, republican, or somewhere in between. Government officials, police officers, priests, politicians, entertainers.... our research has shown us that this is a very widespread problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF YOURE A PEDOFILE, I will fight with everything I have, but we must acknowledge that an entire group of people cannot all be pedofiles, just like they can not all be moral beings.
           </p>
           <p>
            A solution based in hate and prejudice will never work.

             Exactly... divide and conquer techniques will no longer work. They've been attempting these since pre-election. While the gullible folks that still follow the MSM will fall for anything and express outrage re: anything they are told to, the majority of us are not falling for it.

             This is a war against pedophilia and the exploitation of children... I don't care who you are, I don't care about your religion, your gender, your race or your background. I don't care if you are a security guard at the mall, a local politician, the pope or the most powerful CEO in the world... we need to hold these people accountable.

             I wouldn't count them out just yet. When this hollow shill strategy fails yet again, they probably have one or two tricks up their sleeve. Taking these guys down is like the final boss battle in an RPG where they keep coming back to life stronger and stronger. But we have numbers. Unless they literally shut down the internet as a final attack against us, they will never prevail.

              That's what I would worry about...is it worth spouting off to give them a reason to shut down our only avenue of connection?
I think the censorship we have already seen happen was their first attempt of doing just that.

               The censorship we originally saw was absolutely incredible. If you were on Reddit/PG or 4Chan while all of this was breaking in late 2016... I've never, ever witnessed such a panicked desperation to censor anything. And there was no time for this bullshit shilling back then, no strategy to blame Russia, no anti-Semitic BS... the only shills at that time were the ones saying "There is nothing here, this is all stupid, trust me - I'm an engineer. I'm getting sleepy. We should all go to sleep now" and then days later, a total blackout.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was censorship via the content itself originally (and still happens in some cases)... whereas now it seems like this has devolved into prepping for a false-flag where channels like this, Reddit, etc. will be indirectly blamed and there will be a call to action to shut everything down that isn't blessed and ordained by CNN/Facebook/AP.
              </p>

               As much as people like to throw Alex Jones under the bus... he was right about one thing all along. This is truly an information war and we are in the thick of it now.

                That is exactly what I think they are trying to do.
They see the strength we have in numbers...they will want to isolate us.
Everyone I know thinks they are trying to start civil unrest and even civil war.

                I'm just hoping that some very intelligent people are trying come up with a plan now for if the Internet actually gets locked up and censored.

                 Agreed... between the looming EMP threat (most severe), the Internet "killswitch" scenario (imagine returning to the 80's?!), or just a much easier-to-justify censorship en masse campaign (y = Snopes x Facebook x CNN to the NSA power)... our digital liberty and collective information capabilities are far more sensitive than I think we'd all like to believe.

                I was there as well.  I'm seeing next level censorship going on at Google, for example.  Try searching "independence day guns" and see what comes back.  Try doing it with any significant conservative topic.

                Personally, after the ongoing CNN debacle, not to mention their threats to the creator of the video, I think they are beyond desperate.  But like you said, "don't count them out" just yet.

                They have a shitton of $ behind them and they will hire resources to come after us however they can.  Stay vigilant.

             What does that even mean? Are you just blatantly admitting that any act of aggression can somehow be tied back to a meme? You realize how idiotic this is right? While the left is condoning drone strikes on the very people leaking information to help right the wrongs, staging effigies via MSM photo shoots, conducting plays where a likeness of the POTUS is stabbed, suggesting his son-in-law is murdered, all while threatening/censoring and endlessly shilling us... you think a humor-based fucking meme can somehow incite violence and that will "convince" people to legitimately do something?
            </p>
            <p>
             I bet you think the CPP shooting was caused by Alex Jones too, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why bring Webb into this? Your argument makes no sense.

             I'm a "Fucking loser"? Fine. I'll take that. You are a shill, pedo-apologist, Soros check-cashing pile of nonsense.

             <p>
              Think about all of the left wing Jews in the media, PR, campaign planning, etc.  It only makes sense to hire their own for shill work like this.  Not to mention, who better would know how to dig up the deepest knowledge of Talmudic law and the other random "history" nuggets.

                It makes sense to adults who have spent their life studying the illogical behavior of the liberal left.  The ones that go out and work a real job for a living.  The ones that have to deal with impudent, know-it-all dipshits like you.

                    My bad.  I forgot to give you another downvoat.  Why don't you knock it off for the evening and go enjoy a beer and a bag of dicks with PGI_Retard?  He's getting close to eating a bullet.  Well, he isn't man enough.  More likely to jump in front of the Metro.  Have a round of Blue Moon, or whatever you guys drink on me.

             Anti Jewish feelings is a normal as you uncover the Sabbetean Pedophile Empire.  But you have to get past that to realize the Jews who are not Jews are the real problem....it is the Satanist who are using the Jews as a power base and as cover that is at fault.  But it is normal to blame the Jew......because they are right at the center of the evil....but they are not the absolute reason.   That is the sabbetean.....

             I think we should delete/ban any violent rhetoric for sure... any hate speech/threats...etc. Have no place here. But,

              I see your point and it IS a good one. I do however have my concerns.

              These bastards can and WILL use any anti semite commentary as "planted evidence" (False Flag 101) against us to get us censored/shut down. If that shutdown happens, they win. This includes using non violent forms of anti semite commentary as "planted evidence".
             </p>
             <p>
              This means people like hookednosedjoo need to do the selfless thing (aka the right thing) and voluntarily keep their mouths shut regarding anti semite commentary for the greater good. If he does it voluntarily, then free speech is honored because it was his choice to "keep it to himself".
             </p>
             <p>
              Our enemy is a master of deception and false hood. That means any form of ammo they can use to frame us has to be destroyed so as to prevent them from succeeding.

            That's what I thought too. But I honestly think CNN was blind sided by the Trump v CNN memes. The guy that came up with that meme needs to be admitted into the Meme Hall of Fame immediately.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think CNN was straight up pissed off and lost their temper given that Trump v CNN meme is devastating for them. I think this is the beginning of the Deep State implosion we all bought that popcorn and soda for.

              I'm inclined to agree with you here. CNN gets to be the victim, Trump gets to be the hero and each side stays in their place. Obviously the liberals are beyond corrupt and useless but if the remaining 'semi intelligent' ones who still for some reason support Trump after his obvious allegiance to deepstate/globalists/rothchilds/israel/saudi would WAKE THE FUCK UP and stop idolizing and supporting Trump we may still have a chance at keeping our freedom. Seriously you people still on the train need to stop being so naive/gullible or willfully ignorant to his part in all this.

              You're probably right. If so only the top level brass would know that. The rank and file at CNN wouldn't know as evidenced by the fact they got so furious. Those memes make them look like incompetent fools.

             ... if this is just frustration and mud slinging, good! They deserve it. I love how they are acting like the victims now after having been caught pushing propaganda as a Deep State news outlet.

             However, the random inclusions that they are now starting to mention about pedo accusations and anti-Semitic language is beginning to seem a little too coincidental for my liking.
