             lol. Creepo Keith was shacked up with a 25 year old when he 50. Also after he was fired at age 52 he was spotted having dinner with a 20 year old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also dated Katy Tur when she was 24 and he 51.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vomit.  But at least not underage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chris M has always looked like a creepo pedo. Can't wait for him to get his.

            This doesn't fit with Jake Tapper does it?   He worked at ABC beforehand.   ABC doesn't "move" people to CNN.  CNN is a different company.  And Tapper's move to CNN was a promotion.  His career advanced.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds much more like to a person at MSNBC because NBC owns both.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually, it's not CDAN that describes it this way.   millennial_vulcan says "Was moved"   CDAN says the person left on their own, which makes sense.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A few years ago it seemed like a natural move for this network news anchorish type person to leave for a cable network. It turns out though, the network wanted him gone after an in house child porn investigation.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Also I find it hilarious that people think Jake Tapper is aware of the bands that play Comet Ping Pong.

             Do you shill for everyone, or are you Jake Tapper the pedophile? Hilarious that no one on Earth knows that news is often taped well beforehand, and anyone can type on someone else's twitter account when allowed. I will have to use that in court next time I rob a bank. "Judge I could not have been there, just look at my twitter account, and it clearly states I always wake up at 6:66 in the morning." Tapper was called out a while back, and has been in defence mode since.

             I'm just as surprised as you. I thought the blind fit Brian Wi.....more than Tapp.

              Which would mean that guilt by association that was attempted wouldn't apply to him and thus his being a regular at the restaurant provides no support for the child porn claims in any way.

                   My list is getting longer as to who should be taken down but Disney is for sure up there.  I can't decide who should go down first, but DG is close to winning.  next are 2.  Disney  3.  Steven S.  4. W Allen .  Although I hate SS for what he did to Heather  I think of all the dirt they pulled on us and our kids and still are doing damage with their subliminal garbage.  That one is a hard choice for me.  So, either one is fine for #2.  Yes, I think all the time about the child's soul.  Then I think that is how they create more like themselves.  Break the soul and mind and create another pedo. Remember the saying,  They must be stopped before they multiply?  Well they already have.  Stop them before they do any more damage.

                     I so agree with you.  That one is #1 with me too.  I want DG to be taken down first for he is the catalyst for so much in Pedowood, but SS is my next wish.  Then comes Disney.  Heather is on my mind almost every time I read a Blind.  But while on that subject, the place where the raping took place, the Studio that was the taping of Jeopardy, does that incriminate Alex Trebeck?  I have thought about this ever since reading the account of the rape.  It also drives me nuts now to see him on that Insurance Ad he does now.  It will not stop til I know.

                       I don't know really, for I did not really attend too many movies.  I am for sure convinced one was Steven S. there are a lot of old timers too.  Don't necessarily all have to be Prod. and Dir. they could have been actors too, but Rob Reiner comes to mind and so does Norman Lear come to mind, Rob Reiner for sure may be one of them.  Remember the kerfuffle recently about what happened at his charity?
