<p>If you don\'t like some of the names I have here, you can simply ignore the results which include them.</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>I went to each account and scrolled down until all follwers were in view, and then text copied them, and then processed the text to extract all the usernames. Then I ran a program I wrote to find the follows the above people had in common and group them.</p>
<p>I chose to take follows because that was the purest form of connection between them, the expression of interest in what another user has to say.</p>
<h3>Considerations:</h3>
<p>Obviously, it should be noted that following something is not deterministic of involvement.</p>
<p>Also, there were some accounts that I was interested in (such as outspoken Clinton supporter and spirit cooker Lady Gaga) who had too many follows to include. Others I was interested in, discussed here on voat, but could find no account.</p>
<p>Finally, it is understood that these users often have administrators manning their accounts.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>With all that said, here are my results: <a href="http://pastebin.com/MHxB667X">http://pastebin.com/MHxB667X</a></p>

            Have you seen THE BRAIN database from Gnostic Media? Jan Irvin, who wrote the program, has done quite a lot of Pizzagate investigation and plugged in a lot of info.

             I can't say that I have seen that, but I have noticed what is fueling Pizzagate is the accessibility of the information. So the more easy one makes it for the whole Internet to look through the more likely it is that the truth will be uncovered. That seems like the lesson of wikileaks.

             will do. I'm doing a second "broader" batch tonight. I put Tish on there. Just scrolling through her follows, I can see what you mean. Katy Perry has some bad ones too.

             Have you seen this artist, Yelle? Perry follows her:

             ...I don't know what her deal is but she chose a really bad time to go with a ping-pong theme for her music.
