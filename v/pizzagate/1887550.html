<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The [secret Russian] document, obtained by the FBI, was a piece of purported analysis by Russian intelligence, the people said. It referred to an email supposedly written by the then-chair of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), and sent to Leonard Benardo, an official with the Open Society Foundations, an organization founded by billionaire George Soros and dedicated to promoting democracy. The Russian document did not contain a copy of the email, but it described some of the contents of the purported message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bears a fascinating resemblance to a July 15, 2016 article which details a highly intriguing account of how Russian intelligence analysts uncovered unusually high cyber activity between the DNC and the Clinton Foundation and traced it to Seth Rich. They were concerned when they realized he had uncovered the Clinton\'s &quot;pay-for-play&quot; scheme and that his cell phone was being monitored by an assassination team.</p>
<p>Russian diplomats broke protocol to warn State Dept. that Seth\'s life was in danger but were immediately expelled from U.S. in response.</p>

            "I don't know how reliable this story is, or the website that posted it" is never a good look. go to the "other stories" tab/button and check other stories. If you see one unreliable story after another it is a shit source.

            AWD News regularly publishes unsourced hoax stories. One of their hoaxers refers to nonexistent articles in foreign language mainstream media. This one is different, it can easily be identified as a

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            No such report naturally exist, and if it did, Sorcha Faal would never have access to it. The other links on Sorcha Faal's posts are generally reliable and the conclusions and speculation "interesting".

             exactly
            </em>
            what I said would happen in your earlier posts. Here is what I wrote to you 4 days ago in your other thread when you first linked the awdnews article:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Because it isn't a source. There is no tracing the article back to a source. An obscure news site. Most smart researchers know when a seed is being planted for future use. This is one of them.

           </p>
           <p>
            So you planted the seed and now you are using it.
To all you intelligent Voaters, you decide what is going on here.

            "&gt; A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counterintelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
             Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named SETH RICH.
            </p>
            <p>
             What had drawn the concern of DNC official Seth Rich causing him to contact the Clinton Foundation, this report explains, was his discovery of a “pay-to-play” scheme that involved people seeking jobs with a new Hillary Clinton presidential administration to funnel money to the Clinton’s through their foundation with various US federal government positions being designated by the dollar amount it would cost to buy them.
TL;DR.: Seth Rich discovered a ”Pay to play” scheme where people basically pay for government positions.
            </p>
            <p>
             SVR analysts, while preparing to document the results of their 7 July probe into the Clinton Foundation concerns of DNC official Seth Rich, became alarmed when they discovered that his “micro computer system” (cell phone?) had become “infected/virused” by “killers/assassins” working for the Clinton’s—and who the SVR had previously documented as being involved in the assassination of the husband of the State of Georgia prosecutor investigating Bill Clinton for child sex crimes and the murder of American pop singer Christina Grimmie and massacre of nearly 50 gay pride celebrants. Fearing that the life of DNC official Seth Rich was in danger due to his being “tracked/targeted” by this known Clinton “hit team”, this report says, SVR Director Mikhail Fradkov authorized an emergency contact between his agency and the US State Department—but, and shockingly, when Russian diplomats presented the SVR findings to US authorities, on 7 July, they were immediately expelled from the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             The US State Department thanked Russia for the information stating that it would be “taken care of”, and then formally requested that the matter remain secret. Seth Rich died 24 hours later at 4:19 am"
