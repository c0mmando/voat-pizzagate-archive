            Out of the mouths of babes, as far as anyone knows these poor children are still in the UK CPS system!  Confirmation from Alisa who knows and has seen what happens first hand in her own words! - Pizzagate Keep children away from social services and CPS  -

            -  Thanks for bring this subject up again:  It needs to be exposed.
I am convinced that these children are 100% genuine. I have followed this since 2014 when I heard it.  WHY did they not check any of the TATTOOS on the adults and the '20 special children' this is the easiest way of disproving the children.  NO children can recall, enact and react this convincing when describing details.  This police officer is in on the cover up, he did everything to try and disprove these children even to the point of trying to manipulate the retractions.  I was totally convinced of the childrens authenticity when Gabriel was questioned at the end and the policeman (traitor cover upper) tries to get him to say that his dad does not kill babies, Gabriel trying to please him by saying no they don't kill babies, "just some" poor little boy, could not bring himself to lie fully for the police man/policeman putting words in Gabriels mouth (Fast forward to 2:13:50 )
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSJI_qfI-es&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLRCjasnDaGRVtKpJNPSOTrwnTQJ63KRbe">

            .............this is one of the worst cases I have seen or heard I cried my eyes out when I first came across it.  ALSO a child cannot describe and motion 'peeling skin off a baby' to use for making shoes (flipflops), and how it is translucent and and still 'sticky with blood' !!!!! These are 2 very intelligent, articulate children, I have worked with children for over 35 years, you know body language and when children are lying.
These are great proof videos if they are not taken off youtube, as many are!
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the 3 videos of the police (3rd interview is where the police officer attempts to get Gabriel to retract his accusations, but poor little Gabriel cannot, he tries to please the policeman but just cannot fully lie) :(

          <p>
           <p>
            back in the day, a guy who volunteered at our church was found to have abused one of the kids there and convicted - he was also very involved in some foster care program, and encouraged a lot of the members to take in foster kids; he himself had a decent amount of foster children, and I assume he would abuse the kids who were most susceptible
           </p>
           <p>
            my family even housed a foster kid for a few days to see if it would be something our family could handle - after all of this came out, everybody in the church was upset and on high alert, and my dad received a call from somebody in the church explaining that the kid staying with us had been victimized and so might have the tendency to abuse other kids (like me or my brother) .. my dad was obviously horrified after receiving the call, but luckily was able to keep us safe
           </p>
           <p>
            the fucked up part is that he said afterwards he called to complain to the foster care org for not informing him that this kid had a history with sexual abuse, especially considering he was being placed in a house with two young children - he remembers that phone call, and he says that it felt like the people there seemed very nonchalant about the whole ordeal, almost getting the impression that they just wanted him to get off the phone and leave the issue alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            so yeah pray for the kids in that system, but the foster care thing seems like it is fucked

            I have always wondered about the big brothers big sisters program. They hold a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code. There are six sixes in 36. International incorporated in 1970. 1997 President Bill Clinton holds Volunteer Summit in Philadelphia; Big Brothers Big Sisters plays key role. 1998 Big Brothers Big Sisters International is founded. 2000 Big Brothers Big Sisters in Schools becomes a core program. Partnerships with schools and volunteer-rich organizations such as churches, colleges, employers, and fraternities are emphasized. The Amachi Big Brothers Big Sisters program which matches children of prisoners with church congregants is piloted.
2001 The slogan "Little Moments, Big Magic" is introduced.  2013 Big Brothers Big Sisters moves its national office from Philadelphia to Irving, Texas.
2015 Big Brothers Big Sisters announced the relocation of its headquarters from Irving to Tampa, Florida. Why Irving then Tampa. Tampa is a deep water port with access to the Caribbean in my opinion. Big nasty city, too.

            Paul Ingram was an Olympia Kiwanis Member and was the chief civil deputy for the Thurston County Sheriffs office, in the late 1980s, (under Kiwanis member and Sheriff Gary Edwards). Paul Ingram was an OKBR board member and was charged with rape and with accusations of satanic rites, and sexual misconduct "beyond any known human behavior".
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1989, Paul Ingram, a deputy sheriff in Olympia, Wash., received a 20-year prison sentence for sexually abusing his two daughters in satanic rituals. The trial sparked widespread debate about "recovered memory syndrome," covered by Ethan Watters in Mother Jones (July/August 1991, Jan./Feb. 1993), and later in his book, co-authored by Richard Ofshe, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (New York: Scribners, 1994).
           </p>
           <p>
            Until Oct 1999, I believed that the Kiwanians and their friends were guilty of careless neglect or callous indifference. After hearing frightening audio depositions from some of the abused kids, I now believe that these Thur Co citizens were involved with an "active collaboration with evil." According to these depositioned kids, (which was not contradicted by Kiwanian attorney Don Miles), the OKBR staff was involved in long-term molestation and sadistic abuse of these helpless children. DSHS, Olympia, &amp; the Kiwanians criminally ignored the warning signs and then justified their inaction by claiming ignorance. Many of these inattentive judges, lawyers, &amp; politicians want your vote for re-election.

            Could this possibly be connected to Morning Star Boys Ranch? Sheriff connection DSHS Olympia Kiwanis Boys Ranch

            Mrs. Schaefer states that the financial motive for the State to legally kidnap children was put in place in 1974 by Walter Mondale with the “Adoption and Safe Families Act.” This was later expanded by President Bill Clinton in 1997 with The Adoption and Safe Families Act that gave states cash bonuses for every child adopted out of foster care. (Editor’s note: Bill Clinton signed this bill into law, but the bill was passed by the Republican-led House and Senate led by Newt Gingrich, so it was a bi-partisan effort initiated by a Republican majority in Congress.)

            I think releasing this information is what got Nancy Schaeffer and her husband murdered.  She exposed their whole set up.

            FBI sex trafficking bust recovers 168 kids, some never reported missing
            <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/07/30/fbi-sex-trafficking-bust-recovers-168-kids-some-never-reported-missing/">
             https://nypost.com/2014/07/30/fbi-sex-trafficking-bust-recovers-168-kids-some-never-reported-missing/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When FBI agents and police officers fanned out across the country last month in a weeklong effort to rescue child sex trafficking victims, they pulled minors as young as 11 from hotel rooms, truck stops and homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the 168 juveniles recovered was a population that child welfare advocates say especially concerns them: children who were never reported missing in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Advocates say the roundup reinforces the need for a standardized, nationwide approach to reporting children as missing, especially those absent from state foster care systems who are seen as most vulnerable to abuse
           </p>
           <p>
            Though states may have policies encouraging child welfare agencies to report missing children to law enforcement, most don’t have laws requiring that notification, according to the missing children center. That means children can disappear without police knowing they’re missing or being directed to look for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The missing children center says it received more than 57,000 missing-child reports between 2009 and 2013. The organization says two-thirds of the children reported missing last year who likely were sex trafficking victims were in the care of child welfare systems when they ran away.
           </p>
           <p>
            The difficulties aren’t limited to foster care. In the most recent action, called Operation Cross Country, far more children came from single-family homes than from families under state supervision, the FBI said. But experts say they’re concerned that children in foster care, who often come from more troubled backgrounds, are particularly vulnerable to being targeted by sex traffickers
           </p>
           <p>
            About one-third of the kids rescued in the most recent Operation Cross Country had been reported missing, Osborn said. Some of the others hadn’t been gone for long enough to raise concerns from their guardians.

             We need another descriptor for "elites".  HRC, Soros, Rothschilds, etc. - those are elites.  What do we call the scumbag pedos in a 78,435.00/yr county job in CPS?  Or the dirty cops, the dirty teachers and administrators, etc.
