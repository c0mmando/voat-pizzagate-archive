<p>Here are a few dots connected to one piece of a much larger puzzle.</p>
<p>Missing illegal immigrant children have been growing in number.

<p>According to the National Review 85,000 illegal immigrant children have been apprehended so far this year [2014].  This means around 47,000 illegal immigrant children are missing.&quot; 47,000 immigrant children were unaccounted for according to the 2014 report. </p>
<p>How many more now?</p>
<p>Going back to the Kay Griggs interviews, [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDy8HCo5iw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMDy8HCo5iw</a>] she says at the 10:00 minute mark of Part 1 of 4, &quot;This is what my husband [George Griggs] does for a living, is train mercenaries, YOUNG BOYS, from countries like Romania, Cuba, I mean Dominican Republic, Haiti, all these countries. They\'re training them to be murderers. And the taxpayers\' dollars are paying for this.&quot;</p>
<p>Are they also sexualizing girls and boys and training for them for blackmail and intelligence, in addition to assassinations? Are they used and then considered disposable, farmed out to certain buyers of their &quot;used goods&quot;?</p>
<p>If government is losing track of immigrant children, how can they be accounted for? </p>
<p>It\'s highly probable many of these children are being used by DynCorp, Stratfor &amp; Army intelligence special operations
for various functions. They\'re flown out of airports like Dover around the world, to be intel assets, child prostitutes for blackmail purposes, and killers. But what happens when they\'re used up?</p>',

            Greta Van Susteren formerly of Fox News and now on MSNBC ended her 1/23/17 show with a segment on an Orphanage she owns or is associated with in Haiti.  Hopefully someone can get the video.

             Gretta and her husband are also long time friends of the Clintons.  I wonder if there are any connections to the Clinton Foundation and her orphanage?  Although now that the CF has been shut down, those connections would probably be difficult to find.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thought:  I wonder if the shutting down of the Clinton Foundation is, at least in part, because of this pizzagate investigation?
