            Ever hear about those places the pedos have within national parks in Australia?  Check this place out on the border between Victoria and New South Wales.  It looks awfully difficult to get to unless you fly in to Malacoota and take the direct road to the pier where you can then take a leisurely cruise all the way to their private boat ramp...

             Upvoted.  Have you read the retired AFP anon's revelations on 4chan pol from a few years ago.  Your information aligns with his.  The geography of their properties is important.

              I probably did read it but I've seen so much shit from the chans and drunk myself retarded too many times to the point that it all blurs together.

              I've found a few more places like that in Australia as well as some really suss ones like a lone mountain with a very small place at the top with grid power connected to it in central Queensland but that one on the vic/nsw border really piqued my interest as it lined up with shit I've read on the chans and there's obviously been tens of millions invested in preparing and maintaining the site.

            What interests 60 minutes to do this story.  They have been taken over for years.  Think Leslie Stahl.  I am glad this is coming out and hope these men finally get justice after all these years.  Is this guy still alive and can they bring charges at this late date.  That is the REAL question. And people should be up in arms.  This is where there tax money is going.
