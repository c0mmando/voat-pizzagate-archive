<p>Seems people around the internet are trying to attach Murdoch to Comverse/Verint, involved in intelligence, and said to be Israeli. 
(Verint were responsible for the malfunctioned CCTV on July 7th). 
I certainly haven\'t seen any evidence that Comverse (Verint a related company) is an Israeli company. (Although maybe I have missed something). </p>
<p>Comverse is most certainly of the John Adam Street Gang/Committee of 300 as they are located in Adelphi House (1-11 John Adam St). This is stated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Comverse and Verint are registered at Companies House in the UK. </p>
<p>According to wiki: Founded in 1982, the company went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986.</p>
<p><strong>However, the documents at Companies House in the UK state that Comverse Kenan UK was incorporated in 1992, with the original name of Hackremco (No.764) Ltd (and hence one of the group of Hackremco shell companies, registered at Companies House, UK, most if not all having had one or more name changes).</strong> Verint Systems UK Ltd was incorporated in 1991 under the original name of Worldclass Technology Ltd. </p>
<p>So, some odd contradictions in this.  
And nothing (at least in the public domain found so far) which suggests that Murdoch has anything to do with these companies. </p>
<p>And nothing to suggest that Comverse/Verint has originated from Israel. It has not been possible to access Ministry of Justice Israel, Register of Companies; the link is currently inactive.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Verint Systems keeps a close eye on all sorts of data. Formerly Comverse Infosys, the company provides analytic software for communications interception, video surveillance, and business intelligence. </p>
<p><strong>and working hand in hand with British Telecom</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.northernandshell.co.uk/about">http://www.northernandshell.co.uk/about</a>
A media company which owns OK magazine, a number of tabloids, the Health Lottery and they are in the soft porn business too with Portland TV <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_TV">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_TV</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Portland TV is a British adult television company owned by Neon X. It broadcasts subscription and pay-per-view services to UK audiences on the Sky UK, Virgin TV and Freeview platforms. The company was established in London Docklands in 1995 as the adult broadcasting division of the British publishing group Northern &amp; Shell. </p>
<p>Television X was launched in 1995. A number of additional channels were subsequently launched as sub-brands of Television X, and the channel began Internet streaming content in 2007. Red Hot TV was launched in 2000 as a set of adult channels; the brand was renamed Xrated in 2017. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_</a>%26_Shell
In 1983, Northern and Shell obtained the licence to publish Penthouse in the United Kingdom which led to its publishing a range of adult titles,[3] Asian Babes among them.[4][5]These titles were later sold in 2004. It was the first company to move to the revamped Docklands and the Princess Royal opened the offices. When the company moved to the Northern &amp; Shell Tower, the Duke of Edinburgh opened the offices.
Northern &amp; Shell also publishes a wide range of magazines including the celebrity weekly, OK!, started as a monthly in 1993.</p>
<p>Northern &amp; Shell\'s &quot;portfolio&quot; of soft-porn magazines was offered for sale in 2001 in order to provide cash to invest in the then newly acquired Express Newspapers group. Some viewed the sale as an attempt to distance the company from the pornography business, but most analysts believed it to be only a financial move as The Fantasy Channel, Northern and Shell\'s adult cable channel, wasn\'t included in the sale.</p>

<p>Owner <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/dec/19/so-richard-desmond-did-see-david-cameron-after-all">Richard Desmond</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>New intelligence reaches me about that aborted meeting between the National Union of Journalists and Express Newspapers (see yesterday’s posting here).
It appears that the NUJ’s version of events was closer to the truth than I suggested because the newspapers’ owner, Richard Desmond, was indeed going off with his editorial director, Paul Ashford, to see the prime minister.</p>
<p>They were attending a meeting of the parliamentary group called the Conservative Friends of Israel (Cofi) at which <strong>David Cameron</strong> was the main speaker.</p>

            Portland TV is a British adult television company owned by Neon X. It broadcasts subscription and pay-per-view services to UK audiences on the Sky UK, Virgin TV and Freeview platforms. The company was established in London Docklands in 1995 as the adult broadcasting division of the British publishing group Northern &amp; Shell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Television X was launched in 1995. A number of additional channels were subsequently launched as sub-brands of Television X, and the channel began Internet streaming content in 2007. Red Hot TV was launched in 2000 as a set of adult channels; the brand was renamed Xrated in 2017.

In 1983, Northern and Shell obtained the licence to publish Penthouse in the United Kingdom which led to its publishing a range of adult titles,[3] Asian Babes among them.[4][5]These titles were later sold in 2004. It was the first company to move to the revamped Docklands and the Princess Royal opened the offices. When the company moved to the Northern &amp; Shell Tower, the Duke of Edinburgh opened the offices.
Northern &amp; Shell also publishes a wide range of magazines including the celebrity weekly, OK!, started as a monthly in 1993.
           </p>
           <p>
            Northern &amp; Shell's "portfolio" of soft-porn magazines was offered for sale in 2001 in order to provide cash to invest in the then newly acquired Express Newspapers group. Some viewed the sale as an attempt to distance the company from the pornography business, but most analysts believed it to be only a financial move as The Fantasy Channel, Northern and Shell's adult cable channel, wasn't included in the sale.

It appears that the NUJ’s version of events was closer to the truth than I suggested because the newspapers’ owner, Richard Desmond, was indeed going off with his editorial director, Paul Ashford, to see the prime minister.
