            It looks like you can buy "tags" for a tweet or message?  I am not a twitterer or a techie so please be kind.  But why would you need Shipping for that, I do not see any Twitter Shirts, Socks, Sweatshirts, etc. So what is up with the Shipping? Yes this should be explained.  We so many smart people on here, I am sure we will learn the answer.

             By "tags", you mean like a paid admission to a group who has similar "tag" interests? Sorta like hashtags, except VIP level views for like minded individuals who are willing to pay a few dollars to rise above the masses.
            </p>
            <p>
             I bet that a particular combination of tags could grant you further privileges if you knew the code. 🤔

Everything You Need to Know About Twitter Cards for Ecommerce
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter is once again upping its game for ecommerce brands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earlier this year they announced analytics for Twitter Cards which allow you to add images, videos and product descriptions to your tweets. This can significantly increase the amount of people who retweet your content, click your links and check out products on your website.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, HubSpot A/B testing found that tweets with images received a 36% increase in clicks, a 41% increase in retweets and a 55% increase in leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s take a look at how to use Twitter Cards to get more retweets, clicks and sales for your online store.
What Are Twitter Cards?
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter Cards allow you to add rich media to your tweets making them much more appealing and engaging. Here’s an example of what you’re probably used to seeing on Twitter:
           </p>
           <p>
            What Are Twitter Cards?
           </p>
           <p>
            And here is what the same tweet looks like when it’s enhanced with a Twitter Product Card:
           </p>
           <p>
            What Are Twitter Cards?
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to the regular tweet, you can now see an image of the T-shirt and a short description. Twitter allows up to 200 characters for product descriptions, which is a 43% increase in the amount of characters you can use in a regular tweet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter also lets you include up to two other pieces of information about your product – such as its price, availability or size. In this case, ModCloth has added the T-shirt’s customer star rating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ecommerce brands can get big benefits from Twitter Product Cards, as they give your followers an easy way to share your products with their followers, and allow them to view and share your latest deals and promotions without visiting your website.
5 Creative Ways Ecommerce Brands Can Use Twitter Cards
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to product cards, Twitter has a variety of other cards that can help you increase follower engagement. In addition to showcasing products, you can also use Twitter Cards to:
Promote Contests
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a cue from Urban Outfitters and feature your next contest on a Twitter Card. Adding images to your tweets can help you stand out from the crowd and attract more entrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Promote Contests
Introduce New Products
           </p>
           <p>
            Next time you have a new product to announce, spend a little extra time coming up with an attractive image to accompany your tweet. Not only will it make your tweet more noticeable in timelines but it will also make it more enticing by offering your followers a sneak peek at your new stuff.

            Introduce New Products
Share Resources
           </p>
           <p>
            Lowes used a Twitter Card to direct its followers to a guide on how to design a home gym. You can also use images to encourage followers to visit your website, read one of your blog posts or check out your latest resource.
           </p>
           <p>
            Share Resources
Piggyback on Current Events
           </p>
           <p>
            This tweet got “Orange is the New Black” over 12,000 retweets. It’s timely, funny and relates perfectly to the show. Although this example is from a TV show, retailers can also use this technique to drive follower engagement.

Share Videos
           </p>
           <p>
            Player Cards allow you to embed video and audio files in your tweets. This means your followers can view your educational videos, product demos or customer videos without leaving Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Share Videos
Generate Leads
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter now offers Lead Generation Cards, so you can collect email addresses directly from your tweets. According to Twitter, “When someone expands your Tweet, they see a description of the offer and a call to action. Their name,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/username">
             @username
            </a>
            , and email address are already pre-filled within the Card. The user simply clicks a button to send this information directly (and securely) to you.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s an example of how Dropwines is using a Lead Generation Card to get its Twitter followers to opt-in for its content. When a follower clicks the “Find out more” button, they will be added to Dropwine’s list.

How Much Do Twitter Cards Cost?
           </p>
           <p>
            Most Twitter Cards – including Product Cards – are free. However, Lead Generation Cards are part of Twitter’s advertising program and can only be used within Promoted Tweets. The cost depends on your advertising budget and how much you want to bid for each engagement. An “engagement” is an action someone takes after they view your Lead Generation Card, such as clicking a link, retweeting it or following you.
How to Get Started with Twitter Cards
           </p>
           <p>
            To start reaping the benefits of Product Cards, you need a product web page with an image that is at least 160 x 160 pixels and preferably square (odd-sized images can be cropped). Once you have an image, visit Twitter’s Developer site and check out the Product Card documentation. The documentation page contains the meta tags that you must include on your website.
           </p>
           <p>
            After you place the meta tags on your product page, check them against Twitter’s Card Validator tool and submit them for approval. According to Sylvain Carle, Developer Advocate at Twitter, it can take 5-10 days for Twitter to review and approve a Card if you implement it correctly. Plus, it could take another 5-10 days to get approval on a Product Card.
           </p>

             This is interesting, I think this is like adsense for twitter and visually looks like ads on FB. I've seen many commercial ads, I usually block that companies twitter account if I see an ad (I have virtually no ads on twitter) but it finds its way into your twitter feed even though you aren't friends with them. I think CARD is a nice way of saying "INVASIVE AD BOT", when you click on it, it most likely records interests and meta data for a 3rd party.
