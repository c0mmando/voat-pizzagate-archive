<p>&quot;Hi John, The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you\'re busy, so feel free not to respond if it\'s not yours or you don\'t want it. Susanna&quot;
&quot;I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black). I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Now let\'s assume the codes that set off this whole investigation are wrong, we still don\'t even know the source.</p>
<p>Replace &quot;pizza&quot; with &quot;intel&quot;, &quot;handkerchief&quot; with &quot;sheet of paper&quot;, &quot;map&quot; with image, &quot;white with black&quot; with &quot;photocopy&quot;, and &quot;pillows&quot; with &quot;diamonds&quot; (&quot;cushion cut&quot; is a popular diamond cut) and it reads:</p>
<p>&quot;Hi John, The <em>realtor</em> found a sheet of paper (I think it has an image/map that seems intel-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want. I know you\'re busy, so feel free not to respond if it\'s not yours or you don\'t want it. Susanna&quot;
&quot;I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth sheet of paper (photocopy). I also meant to inquire yesterday about the diamonds you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>The unknown keywords remain &quot;realtor&quot; (intermediary or client?), &quot;square cloth&quot; and &quot;field house&quot; (hideaway/headquarters?). I\'m assuming &quot;black and white&quot; could also be code for ISIS as it\'s the only &quot;state&quot; today whose flag has strictly those two colors.</p>
<p>The word &quot;pizza&quot; is known to have been used by Stratfor employees in an operation in Lebanon that went awry, when they got identified by the code word and kidnapped by Hezbollah:
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/11/pizza-cia/">https://www.wired.com/2011/11/pizza-cia/</a></p>
<p>There was also a bounty on the meaning of the codeword &quot;pizza&quot; put out by Gaddafi in connection to French bank Société Générale, before &quot;we came, we saw, he died&quot;:
<a href="https://uk.businessinsider.com/socgen-codewords-pizza-zorro-men-in-black-libyan-fund-2016-7">https://uk.businessinsider.com/socgen-codewords-pizza-zorro-men-in-black-libyan-fund-2016-7</a></p>
<p>Because of this general use, I think &quot;pizza&quot; simply means &quot;classified information&quot;, which is something they could never write in an email. Neither &quot;product&quot;.</p>
<p>This brings me to my next proposition:
What if the association with pedophiles is simply meant to steer any potential investigation in the wrong direction?</p>
<p>High treason is a far more serious allegation than pedophilia, and when a politician is accused of pedophilia, it\'s far more easy to discredit accusers than when accused of high treason and peddling of classified information.</p>
<p>By providing legal protection to pedophiles, you would gain not only an easy scapegoat in the case of an investigation, while maintaining plausible deniability for your other activities, but you would also gain highly dedicated and loyal pawns, as these people are terrified of being caught together with you. Not even prison is safe for their kind.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe there would be a market for child trafficking and child pornography comparable to the potential market for classified information, whose collection is funded by taxpayers and which would be distributed without regard for national security.</p>
<p>Let\'s say you are high-level government official with access to classified intel that will influence the development of the market for a certain group of stocks. You provide it to the highest bidder for a price, who must be a trader managing a substantial volume of money to make a profit that will compensate the price of the information, or the head of a corporation involved. Let\'s say that trader is George Soros, who is notorious for his short-term bets. Everything goes as planned, and in the end he pays you as a donation to your foundation which you can send into a third-world country and launder by whatever means necessary. Or as a donation to your campaign.</p>
<p>Let\'s say that country is Haiti, which has a 20 billion diamond mine:
<a href="https://www.mining.com/haiti-20-billion-untouched-mineral-wealth-to-help-the-country-out-of-poverty-46646/">https://www.mining.com/haiti-20-billion-untouched-mineral-wealth-to-help-the-country-out-of-poverty-46646/</a></p>
<p>Let\'s say your brother just scored a lucrative (gold) mining permit in said country:
<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2983112/Hillary-Clinton-s-brother-landed-lucrative-gold-mining-permit-Haiti-Bill-Clinton-helped-country-recover-earthquake-devastation.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2983112/Hillary-Clinton-s-brother-landed-lucrative-gold-mining-permit-Haiti-Bill-Clinton-helped-country-recover-earthquake-devastation.html</a></p>
<p>Let\'s say you bring over some kids from Haiti, for the pedos, just to grease the machine, but not as your primary source of income.</p>
<p>There is much more money to be made in other dealings, billions upon billions of dollars, than through human trafficking, with far less risk involved. At most an investigation will allow you to shed the outer layer, throw all responsibility on the pedos (because who cares about pay-for-play when the guy next door is raping kids) and continue to do the same.</p>
<p>The reason I personally do not think George Soros is anything other than a client is that he made 100 million in Brexit by betting against these people. Either the payout was too irresistible or he\'s really just using them for a price, or helping them make contacts with his own clients without getting his hands dirty. This is the rational approach.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the thread I started with so we can decrypt their communication lines, and let me know what you think about this theory.</p>',

            This is what made me think "pillows" could mean "diamonds", I agree it's still a sketchy interpretation, but "cushion cut diamonds" is a common term, I doubt these people would be getting payment in uncut diamonds as that would require them to procure a good cutter and there are only so many, also they are concentrated around Antwerp
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if we've found any Dutch/Belgian connections yet
           </p>
           <p>
            As for pedos, what throws me off the possibility that there is a big enough market to sustain a business like this is the costs involved in a "clean" operation, with other cases coming out in Belgium and Portugal I suspect they must have learned not to leave any witnesses
           </p>
           <p>
            So that requires acquisition, handling, transportation, storage, "use", disposal, protection, etc It would easily run into tens of thousands of dollars and very few people can afford to make that a "hobby"

            ehh. I think pizza gate is real but treason is involved as well. I mean we have information that clinton knew qatar and saudi arabia supplied isis and she sold them a record high amount of weapons. Isn't that treason in itself?

             Not directly, the word is out that she ousted Gaddafi for his weapon caches to be flown into Syria, that is more likely to be the source of the rebels' weapons

             Saudi Arabia is currently embroiled with a civil war in Yemen, that is most likely what those "white market" weapons are for
