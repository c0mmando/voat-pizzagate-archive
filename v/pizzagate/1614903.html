            Why wouldn't he give this as a reason though? If he provided some good honest data about the trafficking problem from these countries and how many children are victims, and the part immigration plays in that, then maybe people wouldn't be so upset about it. Although I suppose it's possible that it has something to do with the bigger picture of taking down this global network, like maybe somehow stopping trafficking from that region will flush out some certain people, or make others operating in the US easier to spot or something.

            I'm finding it all really distressing and confusing and anxiety-provoking, not knowing what to think, and it's been so hard trying to remain neutral while friends and family express their horror at Trump and this ban, when I say I'm withholding judgement until I know more I get shouted at, literally told I am a Nazi sympathiser and a fucking idiot, which doesn't feel very nice. I try to explain that I'm taking a stance these days of not accepting any narrative that's provided for me, and will look into things for myself and wait to see how situations unfold before forming an opinion. Apparently that makes me an idiot, and makes many people splutter and go red in the face as they try to figure out how I could
            <em>
             possibly
            </em>
            be so stupid as to not see that Trump is Hitler 2.0, especially as they know me for not being stupid. They never think to question the way
            <em>
             they're
            </em>
            approaching it though, so frustrating! And so hard to explain without coming across as patronising.

            It is part of it, I believe. Same with the wall/border security. I remember it being mentioned about the high numbers of those raped coming from Central America migrating to America. Majority of those likely are either killed or sold into slavery.

            I thought it was so get some border control so when the raids happen the pedophiles and organ harvesters can't get out of the country, but this is a good point, too.

            this thought has absolutely  crossed my mind. The countries on the list have a large number of refugee children. Many are trafficked into Europe, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar and never seen from again. which may be why the countries who are the biggest consumers of trafficking are not on the list.there are no refugees from the big oil states, they are the clients. the US/Canada/Europe, that's where they are going. Most people are extremely naive about human trafficking. They really dont think it happens here that often. I have to prove otherwise. they dont understand that a lot fo them are being shipped into Mexico and transported through the border or under the guise of charities.

             Lebanon is also really big into trafficking and has direct ties to Mexico in the form of Carlos Slim.  Hezbollah is using Mexican drug routes to smuggle people into the U.S. already.  This seems to have picked up after the Phalangist party made nice with Hezbollah.  Fun fact, Carlos Slim appears to be a product of two Lebanese dynastic families; the Gemayel family which is a part of the Franco-inspired Christian fascist Phalangist party and also the Helou family which is a prominent leader of the socialist party of Lebanon.  Talk about a fucked up combination.

             I think that the wall is actually much more useful for stopping human trafficking than the 90 day refugee ban.   That said, refugees are definitely considered easy prey to traffickers.

            All pedophiles (and their "friends" like the Clintons, Podestas, etc.) are for "open borders" and lax border controls.

           <p>
            But of course the Clintons have also big drug running connections, so that is the second reason why they hate Trump and the wall.

            THANK YOU!!! I've been wanting to bring this up for a week, but wasn't sure how to meet sub requirements. I lose my mind when I see all this public support for unchecked refugee immigration with ZERO mention of the human trafficking implications.
           </p>
           <p>
            Church leaders, including mine, are publishing letters to their congregations, encouraging them to reject Trump's immigration EO in the name of "love for humanity." The naivety of these people is flabbergasting. I'm fighting back on my own turf, but it's really hard to get through.
           </p>
           <p>
            How can our leaders in government NOT include human trafficking in ALL conversations about immigration??? I'll stop for now, before I start screaming and scare my dog. This sub needs to be upvoated and elaborated on.
