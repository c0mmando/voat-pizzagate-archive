<p>Middleman?</p>
<p>I think someone nailed the middleman.  Hezbollah. And guess what, you can now connect the dots to Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p>
<p>LOOK:</p>
<p>**Sorry for the length, but after so much lurking, I want to offer a few connections.</p>
<p>I\'m wondering, does this all connect to the recent revelations about Hezbollah, the Iran deal and the Obama admin?</p>
<p>I don\'t know who her new middleman is, but she is still doing it.</p>
<p>Could the middleman being mentioned be Hezbollah? They\'ve become one of the largest crime syndicates on the planet during the Obama years.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the Trump admin\'s focus on MS-13 is connected to all the Hezbollah infiltration into central and S America, and that MS-13 is in league with them, perhaps even responsible for child trafficking, which seems to be a big asset in the Middle East. </p>
<p>From what I have been seeing, child trafficking has increased substantially over the last decade. Could this be the pipeline?</p>
<p>The Politico article mentions an airplane weekly to and from Venezuela. In one direction went weapons and operatives, in the other went cash, drugs for Europe, and perhaps young people? If you have not read it, every citizen should, it\'s very long, but it\'s ugly. Our people are dying of drug overdoses because he wanted a legacy:</p>

<p>The other astonishing connecting point, at least to me, is that Imran Awan story.</p>
<p>This is the congressional IT guy that was arrested recently for bank fraud at Dulles airport trying to flee. He was caught smashing hard drives, and stealing data from congressional computers. His access was pulled, but guess who kept him on the payroll? Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Former head of the DNC.</p>
<p>In the Politico article, it\'s detailed that car dealerships were used as fronts to launder the drug money. Guess who owned one of these dealerships?</p>
<p>Imran Awan and his brother:</p>

His biggest fans are the clean up guys who follow his leads to destroy all evidence.

            Interesting post! Thanks, OP.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             from the Politico article:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ..after the Drug Enforcement Administration amassed evidence that Hezbollah had transformed itself from a Middle East-focused military and political organization into an international crime syndicate that some investigators believed was collecting $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article is really worthwhile reading. I think most people don't realize that Hisbollah isn't only a political organization, and that it is involved in criminal activities connected to the US.
