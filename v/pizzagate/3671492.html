<p>CREEDMOOR</p>
<p>The Creedmoor studies were begun in 1945 with the assignment of full-time personnel operating without service functions. The Institute for Psychobiologic Research was formally established five years later. During 1952-53 it operated on a budget of $82,000.</p>
<p>This unit has been particularly interested in the glandular secretions as they affect mental balance. In the past year work has been continued on histamine therapy in schizophrenia, which has attracted wide attention. </p>

<p><strong>During the year special emphasis was placed on the trial of this substance in cases of childhood schizophren ia as well as on broader psychological and psychiatric studies of this disorder.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased attention was givcn to the problems of geriatrics and a special study of the possible value of a protein diet supplement in older people was completed although with negative results.</p>
<p>Reporting on the research done at the Creedmoor Institute for Psychobiologic Studies, Dr; Mortimer D. Sackler, associateresearch scientist at the institute, reviewed the neuroendocrinologic theory of the cause of psychosis as proposed at Creedmoor three years ago. The theory attributes psychosis &quot;to a breakdown of the protein structure of the nerve cells resulting from hormonal imbalance.</p>
<p>In discussing the experiences of the institute with an outpatient clinic for the treatment of mental illness, Dr. Sackler commented on both the social and clinical lessons learned. One of the clinical lessons is that the incidence of schizophrenia is larger than has been supposed. Histamine biochemotherapy, he stated, has proved an effective, practicable treatment in such a clinic and he indicated. that future studies may lead to classification and subdivision of schizophrenics by objective physiological tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PROTEIN IM PORTANT</p>
<p>Recent research in nutrition has indicated that it is important to have an adequate daily supply of good quality protein fairly tqually distributed between the meals of the day. Meat, fish and poultry are major sources of high quality protein and, with eggs and milk, make up the bulk of protein foods in the more expensive dietary. These are actually secondary foods since they are pro- duced by feeding animals on plant materials and then using the fiesh or resulting product as food. This is an expensive way to provide the total amount of protein needed in the dietary and falls beyond the state budgetary limitations.</p>
<p>Primary foods, which are plant materials taken directly from the soil and used as food-cereals, grains and vegetables-may be valuable low cost sources of protein if used in proper proportions or in combination with meat, eggs, or milk products. In order to provide a good quality protein in the three daily meals for the pa- tients, within the 50 cents per day appropriated, it is economical to depend upon improved plmlt proteins to supplement the meat, eggs, and milk in order that other valuable foods may be purchased for the dietary.</p>
