<p>Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio no longer appear on several ads in Hollywood for <em>Once Upon a Time</em> , the new movie by Quentin Tarantino, as Sabo has swapped their images with those of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and film director Roman Polanski.</p>
<p>Beyond the billboard, there are ads at numerous bus stops, some on benches and others behind glass. Insiders say a street crew worked through the night to get the altered ads in place before the sun rose on Friday.</p>
<p>One bench ad uses an image of Woody Allen instead of Polanski, as Allen was accused of abusing his adoptive daughter, Dylan Farrow, when she was 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I felt they should all share a billboard to highlight a decades-old problem that has plagued Hollywood for decades: the abuse of children,” Sabo said.</p>

<p>The Venice film festival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190725205527/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/venice-film-fest-chief-alberto-barbera-defends-lack-women-directors-roman-polanski-inclusion-1226993">had announced</a> that Polanski\'s new film, <em>\'An Officer And A Spy\'</em>, will be shown at the festival, and will be part of the competition.</p>
<p><em>Venice chief Alberto Barbera spoke with The Hollywood Reporter in Rome on his decision to include Polanski’s new film.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: <strong>Do you expect anyone to protest his inclusion?</strong></p>
<p>A: I hope not. We are here to see works of art, not to judge the person behind it. I hope we can just discuss about the quality of the film and not about Polanski and the case with L.A. County.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What was your reaction to the Film Academy taking away his membership?</strong></p>
<p>A: He’s one of the last great European filmmakers, one of the last true artists from the classical period of 20th century cinema. I don’t think he deserved to be kicked out of the Academy. I don’t think it’s fair and more than that, I don’t think it’s right.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about the new accusations against him?</strong></p>
<p>A: I think we should always make a distinction between the artist and the man. The history or art is full of artists who were assassins, criminals, had extremely bad behavior. But they were big artists and their works remain. Caravaggio was a killer, but he’s one of the major painters of the Italian Baroque period. It’s not so different.</p>
<p>If someone commits a crime, you should put them in jail. Why not? But this doesn’t mean that we should forget that he is an artist and did some works of art that are part of our film history and cultural heritage.</p>

            Roman Polanski is sometime only elitists can love. Also I'm fine if every Caravaggio painting on the face of the earth burns in a bonfire. How's that idea grab you, Mr. Berta? 😎

            polanski is directly involved in the sharon tate murder i bet. it's not just childporn and sex slavery, people, it's blatant satanism. and they want to drink your childrens blood for this stuff called adrenochrome. and it also has dimethyl triptamine in it if it's consumed fresh. it's not joke or lie. this is seriously what they do. it's also not isolated incidents. it's the world's biggest conspiracy. it's the devil; religious or not.
