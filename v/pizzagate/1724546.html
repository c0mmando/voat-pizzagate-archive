            this doesn't look to be directly connected to elite pedophile rings, if you can find a connection, feel free to repost with the link and the explanation.

            A former Boy Scout leader from Vestal faces up to 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty Thursday to downloading child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nathan E. Boguhn, 50, admitted he downloaded videos depicting boys engaged in sexual acts over the internet through peer-to-peer file sharing networks, files that were later downloaded by an undercover FBI agent.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to court papers. Boguhn admitted he has had a sexual interest in boys ages 12 to 14 for "as long as he can remember."
           </p>
           <p>
            Boguhn pleaded guilty in Binghamton's federal courthouse to all three felony charges of an indictment: one count receipt of child pornography and two counts of distribution of child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            U.S. District Court Judge Thomas McAvoy will hand down the sentence July 18, with a prison range of at least five years and a maximum of 20 years up for consideration.
           </p>
           <p>
            While awaiting sentencing, Boguhn remains in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, though his defense lawyer George Hildebrandt made a pitch Thursday for his client to be placed on conditional release from jail or placed under home confinement.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr. Boguhn has never been in trouble in his life," Hildebrandt said in court.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assistant U.S. Attorney Miroslav Lovric says evidence that could have been presented in a trial would have shown Boguhn's computer contained child porn that was downloaded over the internet and when an undercover agent accessed that material via the file sharing program, the agent was able to access both video files.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boguhn was arrested at his apartment Oct. 28 by FBI agents and local police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Court papers say Boguhn stored videos of minors engaging in "sexually explicit conduct" on two laptops and those videos were made available over the internet on June 18 and July 24 in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Boguhn told the FBI that he had been downloading child pornography from the internet for approximately five years, and that it was his practice to ... keep it for a few days, then wipe it from his computer, deleting the peer-to-peer software as well," Lovric said in court papers. "Boguhn admitted that he repeated this routine throughout the course of the year."
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result of Boguhn deleting the child pornography he downloaded, in order to avoid detection by undercover law enforcement, Lovric says no significant child porn was recovered from the defendant's electronic devices.
           </p>
           <p>
            Previously denying bail for Boguhn, U.S. Magistrate Judge David Peebles said the defendant's actions "are indicative of a high degree of danger to segments of the community, and in particular young boys."
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result of the child porn conviction, Boguhn will also face at least five years of supervised release when he gets out of prison. He will also be required to register as a sex offender.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boguhn was previously employed by the Boy Scouts' Baden-Powell Council, which oversees Scouting in Broome, Chenango, Cortland, Tioga and Tompkins counties in New York, and Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It operates Camp Barton on Cayuga Lake, and Tuscarora Scout Reservation in Windsor.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has been dismissed, according to the council.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The behavior included in these allegations is unacceptable and runs counter to everything for which the Boy Scouts of America stands," Rick Christ, scout executive and CEO of the Baden-Powell Council, said in October, after the federal charges were made public.
           </p>
           <p>
            "While the allegations appear to be unrelated to Scouting, upon learning of these reports we took immediate action to remove this individual and preclude him from any further participation in the Scouting program, which includes serving as an employee of the BSA," Christ said.
