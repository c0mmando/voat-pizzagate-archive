<p>It wasn\'t easy to find, but after a few keyword combination searches and a lot of scrolling, I found something quite interesting and which brings to light not one but two Epstein/Maxwell connections to the Obama Administration and John Podesta.

<p>An article in the Harvard Crimson in 2003, during Summers\'s tenure as president, detailed a reportedly &quot;special connection&quot; between Summers and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[52] Epstein pledged to donate at least $25 million to Harvard during Summers\'s tenure to endow Harvard\'s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein was given an office at Harvard for his personal use.[53][54] Epstein otherwise had no formal connection to Harvard.[52] Summers\'s ties to Epstein reportedly began &quot;a number of years...before Summers became Harvard’s president and even before he was the Secretary of the Treasury.&quot;[52] A charity funded by Epstein also donated to the production of a PBS show hosted by Summers\'s wife and Harvard professor Elisa New.[55]</p>

<p>philstockworld.com - <em>Leaked Podesta Email Reveals Why Larry Summers Did Not Become Obama’s Treasury Secretary</em>: <a href="https://archive.is/O6h2l">https://archive.is/O6h2l</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to one of the Podesta emails released today, it appears that America was this close to having Larry Summers as the appointed replacement to Hank Paulson as Treasury Secretary by the Obama administration in 2009. However, that did not happen as a result of what may have been a letter from the late powerful corporate lawyer <strong><em>Bob Pirie</em></strong>, founder of Skadden Arps, who on November 7, 2008 wrote an email to John Podesta by way of Harold Ickes, explaining why Obama should pick Tim Geithner or Paul Volcker, and not Larry Summers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the above article links to the wrong email, I was able to find the correct one including Podesta\'s response and pledge to reach out to Pirie: <a href="https://archive.is/tBekq">https://archive.is/tBekq</a></p>
<pre><code>Dear John, Although still in a state of euphoria over the results on
Tuesday, I am concerned that the appointment for Treasury Secretary
offers either a great opportunity or a lost one or in one case would
create a future problem. The latter, obviously, is Larry Summers who is
an extra bright version of Donald Rumsfeld, arrogantly unpleasant to his
subordinates, dismissive to his equals and pandering to his superiors. I
spent some time with Neil Rudenstine on Wednesday, and he would use even
stronger terms and would be happy to talk to anyone on the subject. On a
positive note, I think the one person with global credibility is Paul
Volcker and credibility is as useful a currency as cash for addressing
our problems and perhaps even rarer. He was at my house for election eve
and did not object to my forwarding his name, but, properly, will not
seek it directly. The answer to the age issue, putting aside that he is
demonstrably very active, would be to appoint Tim Geithner as deputy
with the clear understanding, but not commitment, that he would succeed
in a year or two. Geithner was at my house for dinner last spring with
Paul, Felix, Henry Kissinger and a few others to discuss the situation
as it then existed, and I was impressed with him, but he seemed a little
young (that may be a reflection on me not him) so a few years of
seasoning would not be a bad thing. I have talked to John Whitehead,
Felix Rohatyn and Joe Flom about this, and they have authorized me to
say that they fully support it. If I can be of further help please give
me a ring at 212 982 0003 Bob
</code></pre>

<p>Ultimately, both Summers and Geithner would be appointed to financial/economic roles in the 2009-2013 Obama Administration: <a href="https://archive.is/DyR6h">https://archive.is/DyR6h</a></p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p><em>Note that Timothy Geithner is/was not only a CFR member (as was Epstein), but also has ties to the Epstein-linked Bear Stearns company; notably the bailout of said company which involved BlackRock: <a href="https://archive.is/UmaBU">https://archive.is/UmaBU</a></em></p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with Robert Maxwell? Well, referring back to the philstockworld.com/zeroehedge article, we find that <strong>the person who advised</strong> <strong><em>John Podesta</em></strong> <strong>on the appointment of Geithner,</strong> <strong><em>Robert (Bob) Pirie,</em></strong> <strong>has strong connections to</strong> <strong><em>Robert Maxwell</em></strong> <strong>through</strong> <strong><em>Rothschild, North America</em></strong> <strong>and worked in senior management for</strong> <strong><em>Bear Stearns:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Emphasis altered by me.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who was Bob Pirie and why did his opinion matter? “During the 1960s and early 1970s Pirie was associated with law firms in Boston. His work for the Harold Hughes election campaign during this time landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.” And some more from his NYT obituary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Mr. Pirie</em></strong> was a partner at [the powerful New York firm \'Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom\'] from 1973 until <strong>1982</strong>, when <strong>he was named president and chief executive of</strong> <strong><em>Rothschild Inc., the New York investment banking arm of the Rothschild family.</em></strong> <strong>Among the deals he was involved in at Rothschild were the media mogul</strong> <strong><em>Robert Maxwell’s</em></strong> <strong>takeover of the publishing company Macmillan</strong> and James Goldsmith’s of the paper giant Crown Zellerbach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="break"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Mr. Pirie</em></strong> <strong>later became senior managing director of</strong> <strong><em>Bear Stearns &amp; Company</em></strong> and vice chairman of investment banking at SG Cowen Securities.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than that though, according to at least one other source (<a href="https://archive.is/IPmx5#selection-649.4-655.141">apnews.com article</a> &amp; <a href="https://archive.is/btvnb#selection-2291.0-2297.138">latimes.com article</a> quoting The Financial Times), Pirie was Maxwell\'s principal investment banker: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Financial Times quotes Robert Pirie, president of Rothschild Inc. and Maxwell’s principal investment banker, as saying, ″Bob used to go swimming all the time without telling anybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wikipedia article for Robert S. Pirie is sparse, but I\'ll include it here anyway: <a href="https://archive.is/7nsFT">https://archive.is/7nsFT</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s Pirie was associated with law firms in Boston. His work for the Harold Hughes election campaign during this time landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.</p>
<p>He later practiced in New York City and then served in turn as Co-Chairman and CEO of Rothschild, North America, Senior Managing Director of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., and Vice-Chairman of Investment Banking at SG Cowen Securities Corporation. He died at the age of 80 in New York City in January 2015.</p>

            According to one of the Podesta emails released today, it appears that America was this close to having Larry Summers as the appointed replacement to Hank Paulson as Treasury Secretary by the Obama administration in 2009. However, that did not happen as a result of what may have been a letter from the late powerful corporate lawyer

            , founder of Skadden Arps, who on November 7, 2008 wrote an email to John Podesta by way of Harold Ickes, explaining why Obama should pick Tim Geithner or Paul Volcker, and not Larry Summers.

          <p>
           Although the above article links to the wrong email, I was able to find the correct one including Podesta's response and pledge to reach out to Pirie:

          <pre><code>Dear John, Although still in a state of euphoria over the results on
Tuesday, I am concerned that the appointment for Treasury Secretary
offers either a great opportunity or a lost one or in one case would
create a future problem. The latter, obviously, is Larry Summers who is
an extra bright version of Donald Rumsfeld, arrogantly unpleasant to his
subordinates, dismissive to his equals and pandering to his superiors. I
spent some time with Neil Rudenstine on Wednesday, and he would use even
stronger terms and would be happy to talk to anyone on the subject. On a
positive note, I think the one person with global credibility is Paul
Volcker and credibility is as useful a currency as cash for addressing
our problems and perhaps even rarer. He was at my house for election eve
and did not object to my forwarding his name, but, properly, will not
seek it directly. The answer to the age issue, putting aside that he is
demonstrably very active, would be to appoint Tim Geithner as deputy
with the clear understanding, but not commitment, that he would succeed
in a year or two. Geithner was at my house for dinner last spring with
Paul, Felix, Henry Kissinger and a few others to discuss the situation
as it then existed, and I was impressed with him, but he seemed a little
young (that may be a reflection on me not him) so a few years of
seasoning would not be a bad thing. I have talked to John Whitehead,
Felix Rohatyn and Joe Flom about this, and they have authorized me to
say that they fully support it. If I can be of further help please give
me a ring at 212 982 0003 Bob
</code></pre>
          <p>
           Ultimately, both Summers and Geithner would be appointed to financial/economic roles in the 2009-2013 Obama Administration:

            Note that Timothy Geithner is/was not only a CFR member (as was Epstein), but also has ties to the Epstein-linked Bear Stearns company; notably the bailout of said company which involved BlackRock:

           More than that though, according to at least one other source (
