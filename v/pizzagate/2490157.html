<p>The body appears to be that of an African American girl, but further tests will confirm if it\'s one of the missing children, Mendocino County Sheriff\'s Lt. Shannon Barney said in a statement. DNA tests could take several weeks, Barney said.</p>
<p>God this is awful.  I wish they had not found any child.  I don\'t know why they feature Devonte\'s picture when they say it appears to be a girl.  Confusion again.

            Why is my post count at 9 on the inside and on the front page it is 24?  Certainly something must be amiss. Odd indeed since I did not edit my post in any way.

               Did you see that part where PrinceRay at MCBA (mindcontrolblackassassins) made inference to Voodoo Donuts?  With their fascination with The Goonies, these pagan festivals, the entire thing seems like a quagmire of confusion to research through and gives me an interesting creepy feeling, like these women were part of this bigger pagan/hippie/lesbian evolution of 'Bohemian Hipster' like those that go to Burning Man... trust fundees with degrees that are working the streets for their luciferian credentials...

               I was crying almost the whole time reading it, thinking about how they were using those kids.  I was wondering if the children were really believing they were doing some good, dancing their hearts out.  Or were they being abused the whole time in order to be forced to perform.  I can't decide, but either way it is heartbreaking.  If those women are still alive they need to be outed.  They need to be found and paraded through the streets for flogging.

              Abigail, Sierra &amp; Hannah All  Appear to Have Their Teeth Knocked Out
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Neighbors Dana and Bruce DeKalb, who for 22 years have lived two miles from Interstate 5 on a winding, wooded road in remote Clark County, said they awoke at 1:30 a.m. one night to find Hannah on their doorstep covered in weeds. The child had jumped from a second story window to escape. Hannah had apparently tried to crawl through the blackberry bushes on the DeKalbs’ property to get to another house, the couple told reporters Wednesday. She gave up when she came across a fence and ended up pounding on their front door. Bruce answered. He thought Hannah was 7 or 8 because she was missing her two front teeth, he told reporters. Bruce was stunned to find out she was nearly a teenager. The DeKalbs told The Washington Post that Hannah Hart dashed inside the house and made her way upstairs after Bruce opened the door. She woke up Dana DeKalb, and the Hart Tribe soon came to look for the girl claiming that she was disturbed after her cat was killed. Hannah was crouching between the DeKalbs’ bed and a dresser.

               I know. I was thinking of threading it, but for what, it's so obscure that I don't want to use all my brain juice proving to half the retards here what those with the eyes to see can already see? I think it would be neat to follow the  trail and take a look at these alt-hippies, pagan and lesbian crews these women hung out with I'll bet thats where we will find some kind of child porn making ring.

                I completely agree.  These people and groups have been flying under the radar and need to be exposed.  This has nothing to do with being a lesbian, it has everything to do with being a lousy human being and getting away with using children to commit your evil deeds.  They used these kids to push their sexual propaganda through all their stupid festivals.  I also feel that there is some weird stuff going on behind the scenes of these events they sponsor.

              The DeKalbs said that Devonte made a daily habit of sneaking next door and asking for tortillas, cured meats, and non-perishable food items. He sometimes visited the neighbors multiple times a day and even around midnight. The DeKalbs said Devonte claimed his mothers didn’t feed him and “they would withhold food from him as a punishment.” Devonte pleaded with them to call child protective services.

             Yes, it is sad no matter who that child turns out to be.  I just think it is odd they put his picture up there and say it is a girl.  Just using his picture to get eyes on the article, it seems.

             I have a feeling they were.  When you have 2 LEOs formerly involved in running a Sex Swap Ring, how can you believe them.  One is the coroner as well.  How do we know who survived or whether anyone died.

            Of course there's a Pizza and Ice Cream Parlor in Mendocino county. Pizza and Ice Cream... the dynamic duo.

           <p>
            No, there are no swirls or blatant symbols... except the nipples on the ends of the giant phallus that surrounds the FRANKIE'S letters. But nothing compelling. 
Oh... but there's a pic of a goat. That's normal to post... for a pizza place. Right?

             Oh you are so right.  The symbols on the sign was a good catch.  Really, that was hard to catch.  Also the people in that Holloween Festival all look pretty weird.  Hiding in plain sight is one of their tricks, so nothing compelling is how they work.  And what a odd thing to have at a pizza and ice cream parlor, falafal.  Also THIS  We are supporters of many local organizations, groups, community programs and many of the local schools. For eight years we’ve hosted the Mendocino Middle School Art Exhibition in the spring. We’ve participated in Mendocino High School’s alternative education week offering students a place to learn and work; we are soccer team supporters with Coast Youth Soccer League as well as sponsors for Mendocino United and One Love Futball Club Samuri. We are sponsors of the Community Center of Mendocino, Mendocino Film Festival, Mendocino Theatre Company, KZYX/Z public radio stations, Mendocino Music Festival, the Mendocino Art Center, Caspar Creek Learning Community, Montessori Del Mar Learning Center, the Mendocino Coast Humane Society and the Eileen Hawthorne Fund for Animals and countless other organizations.   Notice all the children's teams and especially the Montessori Center soccer, futball and samuri are all connections to children.  Fort Bragg is another Red Flagg, since what we know that goes on at some bases.  Too many coincidences and we know there are no coincidences.

              Holy crap... wow! That's some good digging. I saw all that, but it's difficult for my brain to organize all of the details... you did such a good job. I see connections... everywhere! But I don't want to let myself see things that aren't really there, so I try to reign it in. But you're so right... I don't believe in coincidences. Especially, now, after all the pizzagate stuff. I don't trust ANY overarching community type organizations who focus their resources and money on children. And the fact that that county already has ties to so much corruption... uhh... yeah, no. Don't trust them one bit. They love to hide in plain sight.

               for he is the one that found the info on those two Officers.  Sheriff Barney forced the men that worked for him to have sex with his wife and that is how he controlled them.

              </p>
              <p>
               While in Covelo over a decade or more ending in 2007, Sergeant Shannon Barney and his wife Deanna habitually allegedly corrupted deputies in his command, effectively making them ongoing accomplices in his abuses of power.(Cox v. Mendocino County et al,#08-51220, Mendocino County Ukiah Courthouse).
              </p>
              <p>
               According to verified allegations in this action, Barney pandered her to them and demanded they pander their wives to him, thus forming a sex cult or tribe with himself as chief at night as well as sergeant by day.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2007, newly elected Sheriff Tom Allman, who had been Barney’s immediate superior during the period in question, brought him to Ukiah so he could “rebuild” the Covelo deputy residency. A year later, Allman appointed him Chief Deputy Sergeant Coroner, and subsequently, Coordinator of MCSO Emergency Services with command authority over all county resources in a declared state of emergency.
              </p>
              <p>
               In so doing, Sheriff Allman may have been within his administrative discretion. But in so doing he may have overlooked possible violations of the California Penal Code implicit in Barney’s and Deanna’s behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
               RAPE
 • By implicit or explicit threats of professional retaliation, Barney may have suborned statutory rape by his wife Deanna of his subordinate male deputies in that it was sex obtained from the deputies by Deanna under “duress” as defined in Penal Code Sec. 261 (2)(b), a felony punishable between 3-8 years in state prison.

            I wonder what an autopsy will show? Will she have an intact hymen? We know the rate of sexual abuse is extremely high among gay parents, so odds are at least one of the kids was molested, if not all.

              I post a lot in conspiracy subs. I judge a hypothesis on it's value based on how many down voats it gets. The more downvoats, the more valuable what i had to say was and more likely it is.

              There are tons  of studies and evidence out there to support my claim. People do not have to take my word for it, they can look this up themselves. The long time Goats will have seen these redpilling facts at least a dozen times a year here. No need for me to repeat this and spam up the boards.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway,
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact that they killed their kids and themselves is extremely worrying. These people were fanatical activists, on par with religious zealots.  I suspect that if we took a closer look at what the kids were dragged into, and who they were exposed to, we would find some disturbing connections. The pedo community is connected to the LGBT+(the +is for pedos and bestiality, along with everything else) and antifa. The antifa connections are buried in a bunch of san fransico based magazines and news paper articles from the last 20 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              So i am certain that these kids were hurt by people in the political activist communities.

              Yep. One my list of things to research, which is an ever growing list, is the number of missing children in other developed nations vs the US. We have a lot of missing kids here. It is not a new phenomenon, from pictures on the milk cartons to the pictures on the advertisements, tons of missing kids. There are so many missing kids that we now have cell phone alerts, and we had a TV show called America's Most Wanted because of a murdered child.
             </p>
             <p>
              So i have been wondering just how many kids disappear in the US vs in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan. Is there an international pattern? The problem is that this is a hard topic to find good relevant data on, and i have a million projects that i work on.

               You might be interested in how many kids go missing from the state of Virginia, alone. If I'm not mistaken, it's more than the state of California, per capita. 
800,000+ missing children in the U.S., every year. 
8 Million + worldwide, every year.
