            I grew up 30 miles outside of London; I've been fighting against this corruption all my life. Let me suggest that it's a mistake to focus on countries or cities. These are simply where the office buildings are located. There are many non-British nationals working in London, who have no morals in terms of what they do, to make money. In fact, most of the younger Rothschilds have gained Swiss nationality, because they know people like you will blame English people for this mess. So let's keep a balanced view.
           </p>
           <p>
            No matter what anybody claims to the contrary, Tavistock is very Jewish in origin. The actual decisions are often made on a golf course or somebody's private yacht (or island) on the other side of the world. Yes, London is a seat of corruption, but this is more to do with religious cults, crime syndicates, and the supranational organisations they set up. We need to expose and target the individuals who have power within these organisations. That's the key.
           </p>
           <p>
            Concentrating on London is a bit Alex Jonesy and it's not effective. If a particular function is removed from London, it will be shifted to Hong Kong, Singapore, Luxembourg or Zurich and continue there under another front. Focus on processes, connections, individuals and evidence trails.

             My ancestors came from right outside of London as well..many many of them.  ; but almost 400 years go.
            </p>
            <p>
             But we got ourselves a Bill of Rights. And now it's taken away by bullshit machinations that yes, come from abroad. We've been sold out. Don't suggest to me on what I should think or say.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should say "City of London" which is a financial seat. Also the English "Royals" as the focus of my ire. Not the ordinary Londoner nor British.
            </p>
            <p>
             And they 've done the same here. Our Admin are people who are not native born and who have no alligence to this country. So we are in the "same boat."
            </p>
            <p>
             The Royals are behind it and likely are not real Jews, but "crypto - Jews" - I ve studied a bit of the falsification of history. The perps are two - faced, so you can't tag them to any religion or ethnicity, as you mention.
            </p>
            <p>

             </a>
             English and the Dutch "Royals" and the German.. They are all the same "family."
            </p>
            <p>
             Three of my grandparents trace our family back to the original non - conformists who fucking left that rotting isle - But the assholes followed us here ie the non - conformist migration.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm passionately anti - royalty even though some of my ancestors are said to be royalty! I possibly have more ancient royal ancestry than those fucking cuckolded frauds over there now living in castles they stole.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that "richest woman in the world" has the nerve to come here and claim a memorial site - which was land that allegedly used to  belonged to her...family, near "Big Lie Hole" - lay a wreath there. For victims that she and the BBC helped to kill so they could have their money making wars. Site, here in NYC.. a park she re-claimed downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
             But we supposedly won it and used to celebrate the fucking British leaving here. Until WW1 came and we were told "Don't unset the English"
            </p>
            <p>
             How dare Liz come and claim land here?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't like the Pope coming here either and addressing Congress and chiding our people for hurting the Indigenous peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
             As if.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pope's institution wasn't behind the biggest blood bath of indigenous of all? And the non - conformists were anti - war and wanted peace and to live as one with the indigenous peoples. But we were fucked since the Royalty of that time only sent over, after the first 10 years, people who were loyal to themselves and who worked for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past any politician of the U.S. who shook hands with a Royal would be OUT.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't help it if the fucking English haven't gotten rid of their in-bred shameful, crippled, lying "Royalty." But that's not my business.
            </p>
            <p>
             I truly despise "Alex Jones" as well, and he ass - kisses the British  and brags how much money he has to them privately while he's over there, and on the radio there, meanwhile pretending to be anti -royal .. "Jones" is a two - faced liar. He and his handler "Booth"
            </p>
            <p>
             My family left there. They were going to get their heads chopped off for non - conformity, so don't tell me it's not the Royal Houses of Europe who camp out all over , you are right;  But who have a main nest for centuries right in miserable London
