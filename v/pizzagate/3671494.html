<p>CREEDMOOR</p>
<p>The Creedmoor studies were begun in 1945 with the assignment of full-time personnel operating without service functions. The Institute for Psychobiologic Research was formally established five years later. During 1952-53 it operated on a budget of $82,000.</p>
<p>This unit has been particularly interested in the glandular secretions as they affect mental balance. In the past year work has been continued on histamine therapy in schizophrenia, which has attracted wide attention. </p>
<p><strong>H I S T A M I N E T H E R A P Y IS USED O N YOUNG S C H I Z O P H R E N IA P A T I E N T</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>During the year special emphasis was placed on the trial of this substance in cases of childhood schizophren ia as well as on broader psychological and psychiatric studies of this disorder.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased attention was givcn to the problems of geriatrics and a special study of the possible value of a protein diet supplement in older people was completed although with negative results.</p>
<p>Reporting on the research done at the Creedmoor Institute for Psychobiologic Studies, Dr; Mortimer D. Sackler, associateresearch scientist at the institute, reviewed the neuroendocrinologic theory of the cause of psychosis as proposed at Creedmoor three years ago. The theory attributes psychosis &quot;to a breakdown of the protein structure of the nerve cells resulting from hormonal imbalance.</p>
<p>In discussing the experiences of the institute with an outpatient clinic for the treatment of mental illness, Dr. Sackler commented on both the social and clinical lessons learned. One of the clinical lessons is that the incidence of schizophrenia is larger than has been supposed. Histamine biochemotherapy, he stated, has proved an effective, practicable treatment in such a clinic and he indicated. that future studies may lead to classification and subdivision of schizophrenics by objective physiological tests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PROTEIN IM PORTANT</p>
<p>Recent research in nutrition has indicated that it is important to have an adequate daily supply of good quality protein fairly tqually distributed between the meals of the day. Meat, fish and poultry are major sources of high quality protein and, with eggs and milk, make up the bulk of protein foods in the more expensive dietary. These are actually secondary foods since they are pro- duced by feeding animals on plant materials and then using the fiesh or resulting product as food. This is an expensive way to provide the total amount of protein needed in the dietary and falls beyond the state budgetary limitations.</p>
<p>Primary foods, which are plant materials taken directly from the soil and used as food-cereals, grains and vegetables-may be valuable low cost sources of protein if used in proper proportions or in combination with meat, eggs, or milk products. In order to provide a good quality protein in the three daily meals for the pa- tients, within the 50 cents per day appropriated, it is economical to depend upon improved plmlt proteins to supplement the meat, eggs, and milk in order that other valuable foods may be purchased for the dietary.</p>

            No wonder they are putting soy in everything. Someone told me not to eat too much of it. I basically eat plain foods. Homemade. I Don’t use a microwave either. Lots of my friends don’t either.

            They have been hiding it in food for the last 50 years. Suddenly in the 70s you needed to be told what foods to eat and in what portions. Suddenly the average calories requirement went to 2,000 calories a day (a big jump from the 1200/1800 from the 40s).
           </p>
           <p>
            This research was probably used in those first TV dinners.

             In the Minnesota Starvation Project, the experimenters fed the male subjects what was considered stable diets at the time of 3,200 calories a day. They then cut their calories in half to 1,600 and observed that this left them hungry, fired, agitated, prone to anger, and obsessed with food. People in the 40s ate a lot more than 1,200 calories a day unless they were poor or subjected to wartime rationing.

              <p>
               Thankyou for posting, I am so proud and thankful for Peter. Heart breaking and close to home. I was threatened with being put in a psych ward throughout treatment and I was heavily medicated for 3years under the description psychosis.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was immediately medicated or the hospital said if my mother did not Medicate me the hospital now has control over me and will send me to the hospital.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had actually just been sexually abused by my brother again. At first it was when I was 5 &amp; 6 and then I was in heavy therapy until 13. I continued to grow up with him and it made my whole life so weird. Especially since I was doing the therapy and then going home to be around him. My family believed me everyone knew it happened... But at 15 when I woke up to him in my bed ... Noone believes me . He cries and says he would never. Child porn was found on his computer 4 or more years earlier... But he said that was his friends.
              </p>
              <p>
               After not being believed and still he was around I hung out with my older friends and got drunk for the first time. My mum found out, called the police, and they brought me home. I was locked in my room and I was not allowed out to pee. It was at this moment I took a razor blade and cut small cuts all over my body. I was in pain. And I reacted so. I was not crazy. They were. The whole damn time. I made it my mission at 7 to understand the problem and find a solution to pedophillia, incest. And provide a solution. At 27 now I actually have come pretty far as to an answer . For the person like me who was hurtinf and couldn't make sense out of my feelings. I have the answer for myself now I believe. I plan on writing the shortest book ever on this. Deliberately short. We have overcomplicated therapy so much.
              </p>
              <p>
               The ****ing doctors and associates make me sick. I went very far a few years ago in understanding how I could gain access to my own medical records, realised that if I took the next step that they would just blank everything out or loose things. All of my files are in gaps in systems. All compartmentalized. I saw so many different doctors.
              </p>
              <p>
               I quit cold turkey at 19 and got off all the medication, anti psychotics, anti depressants, sleeping pills. It made my mind hurt. And everyday I was against taking these pills and I was doing it 3times daily. I was afraid from 15 that I would be locked away in one of the mental Wards. My aunty has schizophrenia but low and be hold she was abused by family members and not believed.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am seeing connections that I hadn't seen before. To do with money, politics and evil.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was 15 when I met with a doctor via video link in a rural town in Australia, who told me that I don't have schizophrenia but he will say that I do so that my mother can get more money to pay for my hefty medication fee.
              </p>
              <p>
               How messed up is that. I spent so many nights wondering if I'm crazy Ann's what's going on. Plus I have had to repair my brain. I have increased awareness and through various ways of thinking i have been able to kind of... Well I can feel it, and I certainly could feel the disconnections and mixes up stuff for years after the medications. My mum was abused as a child. And then her first child abused her only daughter. My father also left us when I was 7. He was also abused as a child, heavily... And recently finished his court case and his stepfather is in prison.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm seeing that these doctors want money... I didn't see it in this way before..
              </p>
              <p>
               How he had that courage amazes me. I was shy and cried all the time. Blindly obedient and also heavily heavily focused on healing my family. At 7. My early 20s were just the worst in ways.. afraid all the time of being locked up, being crazy... And I had thoughts of what would happen to me... after watching this I feel like
              </p>
              <p>
               Ah ha... It's making sense... But I have so many more questions.
              </p>
              <p>
               I cried for days and weeks when pizzagate was uncovered. It killed me. I wanted a solution pedophilia and this exists....

            Let me point out that "childhood schizophrenia" is the older term for what is now autism. These are children with toxic brains, for various reasons. Soy, unless fermented, is considered inedible by the Chinese. It is very bad for humans AND animals.

             Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are distinct disorders with unique characteristics, but they share similarities in social dysfunction. ... And individuals who have schizophrenia often experience hallucinations and delusional thoughts, which are far less common in individuals with ASD
