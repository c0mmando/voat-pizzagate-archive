<h1>Well done pizzagoats! I bet you had a hand in this: PeaceSeeker speculates Putt\'s cryptic &quot;powerful people&quot; are international bankers</h1>
<p>I\'m pasting his post below. You can find the original with comments, <a href="https://voat.co/v/OneTruePutt/2308745">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h1>On the recent announcement</h1>
<p>Putt touched on some neat stuff in his recent announcement, so let\'s discuss some of what was said. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>First off, I want to point out that the <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/1330806">Canary</a> was updated when the announcement was made, just like I\'ve been saying it would be to all those who were worried the Canary had died. Let this help lessen our future worries somewhat; the Canary is updated when submissions are made to <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements">/v/announcements</a>, and at almost no other time. Not every month, not whenever Putt makes a submission -- only when he makes an announcement. (There is at least one example of the Canary being updated without an announcement, but never has the reverse been the case, and it is to announcements we must look when concerning the Canary). </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>The words in Putt\'s announcement which seemed to catch the most attention were: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>you guys piss a lot of powerful people off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and understandably so; it\'s a fascinating revelation...though not really a surprising one. We can all understand the danger of freedom of speech to those who seek to control narratives with falsity. I <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/1946021">made a post</a> about this some time ago, highlighting how seemingly every financial power in the world was doing everything they could to destroy us through that route -- to no avail. There is no question at all at this point that Voat, as it stands, is a platform for Truth and therefore a danger to the lying elite.</p>
<p>I wasn\'t going to call attention to <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2306193/11442606/10#11442606">this thread</a>, but a number of others already drew attention to it and Putt is sufficiently obscure here that it probably doesn\'t matter. In it he ranks the &quot;interestingness&quot; of the DDOS attackers (who were most active during the first attempt at the database Port) at 8-9 out of 10. Now, &quot;interestingness&quot; is anything but an objective measure and only so much can be read from this, but since the context of powerful people is provided in the announcement, my mind can\'t help but leap to interesting / influential on a worldly scale, and for <em>that</em> scale I would consider a 9 to be along the lines of International / Central Banks. Considering what has happened in the past with respect to Voat\'s Credit Card processor ending its relationship with Voat, I can only conclude that it is <em>possible</em> that those behind the (very severe) DDOS attacks against Voat a few months ago may have been directly affiliated with the International Banks. For the Banks (or some derivative of the Banks) to attack Voat directly is truly interesting, I would say. This is all just speculation, of course, but what we must take from this is that Voat is certainly a platform where Truth can thrive, and is a threat to those with the most power. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Putt also mentions one of the big changes that may arrive for Voat in the New Year. He refers only to the &quot;democratization&quot; of Voat. Some people in the comments were concerned about what this might mean. However, Putt was <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2306193/11442483/10#11442483">careful to highlight</a> that he will not push any changes without community feedback, so we\'ll all get a chance to experiment with the change and decide whether or not it suits Voat. <sub>Everyone is also capable of prowling the <a href="https://preview.voat.co/">preview site</a> to find the probable prototype of the very change Putt is proposing. </sub></p>
<h1></h1>
<p>As a sidenote, Theo <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2308584">made a thread</a> proposing doxxing as a possible explanation for NeedleStack\'s disappearance. I mention this here despite it not having to do with the announcement because I mentioned Needle in a recent overview post, and doxxing Voat\'s perhaps most well-known user is yet another sign that powerful forces are willing to go to great lengths to suppress the discussions we have here. If Needle was doxxed, let her story be a warning to us all. Be careful of what you post, and know that what we do here is no small business, is no mere game. The Truth spreads on. </p>

             Thanks!  As I feared, once a post has been removed, all markup formatting and embedded hyperlink addresses are lost. This means that it is a true burden for those who take the time to make complicated submissions to repost. Removing such threads solely due to an inadequate headline that can't be edited is going to unnecessarily antagonize people and dampen research.
