Hi
I am a citizen  reporter  and  after reading  one  of  your articles I wanted  to take a  look  at  your  staff,
you  made a  curious  reference to \'satanism&quot; and I wanted  to read  more about  your philosophy and wondered  if  you have a  personal blog/website I could take  a  look  at,
Thank you

<p>to me
Hi, thanks for taking a look at the material. I started out with the Vagabond so thats the only place i have anything currently. But i have taken a hiatus from the site to focus on my own work and a non fiction novel. I am shopping it around to publishers right now, about occultism and psychoanalysis, something like a Jungian grimoire. But that\'s all i can say on it. Once i figure that out i will be setting up my own website, et cetera. So keep that in mind, but i have nothing for you right now sadly.</p>
<p>I think most people would consider me a Satanist and i don\'t mind, but i don\'t consider myself one. La Vey was as bad as Hubbard, but i do appreciate the technical details in the works of Crowley and Waite. So i would say I am Luciferian in the Gnostic sense, but not Satanist. Anyway, thanks for reaching out. Feel free to send other questions</p>
<p>to Anthony.tyler
Interesting,
  Are  you  aware  of the  convergence of Crawley, pedophilia, Military/mind control/MkUltra including the rape/terrorizing of children for mind programming?

            Hey guys, My name is Ryan Cristián, and I am the Founder and Editor of TLAV. I was sent this link from a reader, so I made an account to be able to discuss this, or answer any questions/accusations you may have.  (Verification:
            <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DL-ryan.jpg">
             http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DL-ryan.jpg)
            </a>
            )  For the record, Anthony was only a writer for us, as we have many writers with wildly varying views, so his personal views and responses should not represent the entirety of TLAV, and after seeing the way he was responding to you in this thread, I have spoken with him, and he has chosen to part ways with TLAV, for this among other reasons. However, I stand behind his work which we have published, not as a complete representation of what we are, but simply as coverage of an interesting topic with ties to much on what goes on today. I do not find Anthony to be anything other than a researcher, and writer who covers these topics, yet anything is possible. So, feel free to ask me anything, as I want to dispel this notion that we are somehow controlled op, because I take this job very seriously, and very personally. We do our best to always bring what we see to be the most current, accurate and up to date info out there, yet, especially in today's manipulatable world, we can all be deceived, yet it always comes back to intent, and I feel that I can demonstrate to you here that our, that MY, intent in genuine.

             That  is a  reasonable response,
I was simply inquiring about your website, 
I am sure you would agree for a writer  to claim  he  is a "Satanist" is  worthy of further  investigation of an information source,
I brought  up MkUltra, Intelligence mind  programming, the sexual abuse of children in this  process (which  is  beyond question among researchers, including documented court  cases and  police  investigations etc.) , this shouldn't be a  taboo subject for  a website that  is  reporting on the  topics  that you do, of course  your writer  instantly  dismissed me as a "lunatic" among other choice descriptions.
    I am  sure you  can  understand every researcher's  need to vet  any information  source, a  simple  inquiry is certainly  in  order,
I do  understand that sometimes a  writer  may  not represent the point  of view of the  Editor,
Thank you for your reply

               Fair enough. I was working on the site when this link was sent to me, and I care about how we are perceived, so I jumped right over and commented. But a healthy amount of skepticism is necessary today, so I know where you are coming from.

              Absolutely. I actually greatly appreciate your desire to do so, and welcome the scrutiny, as there are far too many out there looking to deceive. I do not want to disparage Anthony in any way, as I know him to be a good man, regardless of whatever beliefs he may hold, but I do agree that such a stance may appear to be contradictory to what we cover to some degree, which is why it is likely for the best that we parted ways. I am open to any questions you or anyone else may have...

            I had this exact same thought the last couple days - good post OP. Shills have definitely had an impact on the level of skepticism which seemed to be present in the earlier days of Voat//PG Awareness. Further mudding the waters the last few months has been the emergence of so many "alt-media" sites and forums, with many of these organizations declaring others "fake news".

            This is not to say I have not found articles of value in this specific source as well but there are definitely much more opinion-based articles without the left wing skew bias you see in MSM outlets such as the notorious CNN.

             I  haven't  made  any  decisions about TLAV, I was simply inquiring  about a  writer  who claimed  he was a satanist, which I  think is reasonable! After bringing  up the correlation  between Crowley, Intelligence  operations, MkUltra, with child rape being a  part of this  bizarre  mind  programming  technique which  is well  documented  among the  highest  levels  of  Government  &amp; power I (and  the Voat community} were dismissed  as "Lunatics" and more  of that ilk-hence I  put the  question of this  site's  veracity  before  the  Voat community
