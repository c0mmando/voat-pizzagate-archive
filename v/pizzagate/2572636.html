<p>Now we now.</p>
<p>Now that we know the extent of sexual abuse at CPS (Chicago Public Schools)  it\'s on us to demand change </p>
<p>On Friday, the Tribune released the results of an investigation into Chicago Public Schools’ handling of sexual abuse and assault cases, drawing on police data, public and confidential records, and interviews with students and parents.</p>
<p>It’s rage-inducing.</p>
<p>Now we know that CPS students have been sexually abused and raped at jaw-dropping numbers — police investigated 523 reports during a 10-year period, or an average of one report each week.</p>
<p>Now we know that students have been sharing their school buildings with educators and staff who have criminal convictions and arrests for sex crimes against children, despite mandatory background checks for all potential school staff, volunteers and contract workers.</p>
<p>“At least nine of the 72 Chicago school workers identified by the Tribune as being accused of abusing students since 2008 had prior arrests related to alleged sexual offenses involving children, or drug, weapons, assault or theft allegations that signaled they could be a threat to children,” my colleagues report.</p>
<p>Now we know that when students disclosed abuse to their teachers or principals, those teachers and principals sometimes failed to call child welfare investigators or police, even though state law requires them to do so.</p>
<p>Now we know that sex between a student and a teacher is legal in Illinois, as long as the student is over age 17 and no force is involved. “In some states,” my colleagues report, “having sex with a student is a crime regardless of age because the power held by teachers makes it difficult for young adults to freely consent or decline.”</p>
<p>Now we know this scourge knows no neighborhood boundaries. “CPS employees sexually violated students in schools ranging from sports powerhouse Simeon to selective-enrollment Payton College Prep high school, police and school records show,” my colleagues report.</p>
<p>“The adults involved,” they report, “included award-winning teachers, lunchroom aides, counselors and coaches, security officers and two deans.”</p>
<p>Now we know.</p>
<p>Now it’s on us to demand change.</p>
<p>Parents, citizens, taxpayers — all of us ought to be outraged by this report. I’ve got two kids at CPS. They deserve better. Every child does.</p>
<p>These are our children. Mine, yours, Chicago’s. The ones who sweat and toil to make it into top schools, to make it onto cutthroat teams, to make their way, in far too many cases, through dangerous streets to arrive in their classrooms.</p>
<p>We need them to succeed. They need us to help them.</p>
<p>We should be flooding our local school council meetings. We should be flooding our principals’ inboxes. We should be demanding answers from Gov. Bruce Rauner to Mayor Rahm Emanuel to schools chief Janice Jackson on down.</p>
<p>Now what, leaders? What are you doing — at individual schools and districtwide — to clean up this mess? What are you doing to protect the children entrusted in your care?</p>
<p>Who hasn’t been background-checked? Why? When will they be? What is your policy for investigating abuse allegations? Does every student, parent, staff member and volunteer know that policy? Where is it in writing? How can I be sure child welfare investigators and/or police are immediately notified about abuse allegations? Whom do I call when these policies aren’t being followed? Why are some school employees still working if they have a criminal history?</p>
<p>That’s just a start.</p>
<p>The Tribune report reveals an absolutely unacceptable environment. Now we know. And now we’re not going to shut up until it’s fixed.</p>

<p>Please do not get confused like I did.  Please note that CPS is not Child Protective Services.  In this case it means Chicago Public Schools</p>
<p>There are so many things to be discussed in here but IMO, whether to Call Child Welfare Investigators or Police is first on My List.</p>',

             Yeah by Emanuel I take it to mean Rahm Emanel of Chicago?  His father was a member of Irgun a Terrorist Group in Israel that bombed the King David Hotel.  He is now working in Chicago as a Pediatrician still.  There is info, just get it before it is scrubbed.

               Good on you.  I found it about 2 yrs. ago.  I would not want to meet him and his henchmen in a dark alley.  His henchmen are probably MS-13.   Trump should have sent the National Guard.  But I believe the Pres. offers and can only send if the mayor or gov. agrees.  This would end the problem if done right.

            It's the same in all the DC suburbs.  Constant admin/educator + student scandals.  Counties are always moving the principals around, covering up.  I have watched it happen first hand to some creeps who deserved a lot more than getting busted down from principal and out the backdoor 8 years and about as many more incidents with this scumbag.  And I think he was doing shit to his daughter too.

            I hate to have to say this, but there is probably a pedo network of some form in every town with more than 2,000 people.  Daily, there are articles of  "8 Florida Men" or "East Asian Men (aka Muslims)"  mugshots in a little town in the middle of nowhere.  Those are probably the lower pieces in the little networks.  Then scale that to metropolis size....staggering.

            This too has been going on for years. We were told the schools wouldn’t report rapes because the children were minors. They always have excuses like national security or they are minors.

               My friend in Chicago says people are so sick of Rahm but she is afraid either he will win again or his puppet will win while he pulls the strings.  She says there are so many people running it will water down the vote.  I told her this is what they do and then they work their Election Fraud to help get their guy in.  It works like a charm.  They can control the electronic voting machines from their car out in the parking lot.  There is software for this in the machine

             Only meant to confuse us, I agree.  Also judges never protect these kids either under either CPS or DCFS.  Kids are no longer protected.  Parents need to get after these Principals.

            This is indeed rage inducing, but at the same time, I cannot understand the reason for distinguishing between the two meanings of CPS. After all, isn't is a school's duty to administer protection to a child hence child protective services, just not the official governmental agency? I see no difference here and how many times were things reported to the actual CPS agency and they did nothing. If we dig deeper, I'm sure we'll find them all over this, too. Great thread!

             Yeah, well she was recommending to call the DCFS of Chicago or Police.  We know that many times they are not going to do what is best for the child, that sometimes they are part of the problem.  Yes CPS in most states is Child Protective Services.  In Chicago it is the Chicago Public Schools.  Confusing.  Anyway being that Chicago has so many problems it really makes us wonder if they are at all interested in help their children.

           </p>
           <p>
            Phillips was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin and spent most of his early years in Racine, Wisconsin.[4] From 2006 through August 2008, he appeared frequently on At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper, first as one of numerous guest critics filling in for Roger Ebert while he was on medical leave, and becoming a semipermanent cohost with Richard Roeper in the months before Roeper and Ebert ended their association with the series. On August 5, 2009, Phillips was hired along with New York Times critic A.O. Scott to replace hosts Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz.

            Well.  RACINE.  Hmm and a Film Critic.  Could mean nothing.  But Hmm.

            Congratulations to the Tribune for pulling this report together and pledging not to shut up until this horrendous problem is fixed.  I suggest starting with the unions who run interference for these freaks.

             Yes, they do.  I remember when we were researching the Seth Rich Murder that  there was info about SEIU doing their Dirty Work.  Also that someone volunteered that Jan Schakowsky was in charge of the Union.  Her husband was or still is the infamous Bob Creamer.  God, my memory is really woke tonight.

            The burb where I live outside of Chi is just as fucked up as the ones in the city.  I refer to it all the time as the Educational Industrial Complex. My district drives me completely apeshit.

             The reason I wanted to post this is I think this is what is happening all over the country.  I know that we have had many articles here about school teachers, coaches,  and other school employees accused of horrid sexual abuse.  This is the reason we have this problem.  The are NOT doing their job.  Is this a spotty situation or is this all over.  Is this their plan?  Do they want to just purposely Mess Up Our Kids?  I sure hope not.  I looked it up and in Chicago it is DCFS for Child Welfare.   I am hoping this writer Means Business.

              Don’t even get me started on the DCFS/school issue around here. I’ve gone through pure hell where I live. About to hit the sack so I’ll fill you guys in tomorrow. Carmencita, once I tell you the demographics of where I live it’ll all make sense, trust me.

              Great post Carm. Chi is a goddamn mess. Remember when Trump threatened to flood the city with National Guard? That was exactly what was needed but of course Rahm EVILuel was all like 'no, you're good' and noone dare a bad word abut double amputee Mother Teresa Sen. Duckworth even though she abused Veterans and quietly settled lawsuits.
             </p>

              Of course its Project Mess Up Our Kids". Happening everywhere Carm, not just IL. Honestly I think Cali + NY are worse. Not to mention DC, Baltimore.... FLORIDA! Buddy of mine is public middle school teacher in ghettoville NY (Bronx area) and the stories would send you to an early grave.  Im deadly seriously.

              one 12 yr old boy was opening bragging about having sex with his 4 year old sister. Was caught in class pulling down his pants and stimulating sex with his chair to show his buddies what he did to his sister every night. My buddy who's the teacher had to call CPS, was a total shitshow with the parents who of course were welfare losers, drugs, 5 kids by different fathers etc. And this is just ONE story. There are many hundred similar stories on a a daily basis.
