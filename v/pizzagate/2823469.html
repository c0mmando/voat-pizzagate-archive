            The Sacred Spiral is a very ancient occult symbol. This is what it ultimately refers to. Regeneration, Transcendence, Growth, Change. Tramsformation. Etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The six-pointed star has a similar meaning in occultism, but is more dialectical. Transformation through opposites. Think Hegel.

            I have thought it to be a perverted modern version of a much more ancient symbol. (also see :
           </p>
           <p>
            Labyris – the Double Axe (and the Butterfly Goddess)  Yes, female moon gods are often depicted holding snakes in both hands, even if they are just possibly depictions of the priestesses of the cult.  The serpent is most often related to sexual energies, which can be harnessed for spiritual purposes, or when abused, can overwhelm the spirit. Serpents depicted symbolically on a vertical axis nearly always represent sexual energy- the twin serpents of the caduceus, the kundalini serpents, the alchemical crucified serpent, and the serpent of Genesis are all symbols of the sexual nature of man. In the Judeo-Christian allegorical story of Adam and Eve, the serpent represents the dual nature of sexual energy, which can either entrap or release the spirit. It is this serpent who guards the mythical tree of life and immortality featured in mythology the world over, where it serves as both a protector of the aspirant and an obstacle to the uninitiated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cadeceus, or wand of HermesUraeus, symbol of divine powerIshtar, with serpents
Kundalini serpentsAdam, Eve, and the serpentMesopotamian forerunner to the CadeceusAlchemical serpents- look familiar?
One of the most recognizable serpent symbols is the Ouroboros. The ouroboros is found in alchemy, in ancient Egyptian, Greek and Gnostic texts, in Norse mythology, and even Aztec icons. The ouroboros is a serpent swallowing its own tail, and usually describes a circle, although a lemniscate shape is also common. It is a symbol of eternity, rebirth, and resurrection. It is often colored dark and light to illustrate the victory of the spiritual nature over the material.
           </p>
           <p>
            A meaning only commonly known to upper cult members. Sin begat Inanna/Tanit/Ishtar. Sin has the upward crescent moon as his symbol, which can only be viewed from certain latitudes. His daughter, also known as Venus, has as her symbol the second brightest object in the night sky. "Even in Catalhöyuk do we see reliefs of figures that appear with upraised arms. Mellaart and Gimbutas believed they were goddesses, since they perceived that there were traces of breasts and circular patterns on their bellies." Fertility, new life ... children. It is a perversion of something good and natural. Astoreth is the female version and Astoroth is the male. Astarte is the Hellenized version. Isis Egyptian. If I keep babbling on we will get to that city soon.

            It is a reference to the golden mean. (Golden measure, mithra, meter, metre, etc.)

            Early in pizzagate, a group tried to correlate court masons with phree masons and obscure the real investigation with occult knowledge. A mis-construction as a form of obfuscation. Basically the intel agencies also began actively recruiting from within these psyops as a means of both finding loose canons and also finding worthy citizens. But we know they're corrupt, too, unfortunately.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in PG, religious fanatics like Christians, Baptists (some of the worse types on these boards), Catholics (not entirely shocked by pedophile and child raping), Moslems (most of which have no knowledge about this shit outside of their Sufis and Sacred Geometry) as the scapegoat, and Jews running the blitz on the population all started to infuse their bullshit religious views into everything.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Jews worship the square
            </li>
            <li>
             Egyptians worship the triangle (as it should be)
            </li>
            <li>
             And asians worship the circle
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            The triangle swirl is the ONLY symbol identified by the FBI. The swirl is sacred, found in many cultures from Scotland to Africa.

            There is so much subconscious programming of the brain. Disney has it figures a long time ago. The technology put into screen images, and sound used altering councoiusness is vast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its mind control. Using one side of the brain more than the other, activating brain centers, influenced dormancy, restrictive encoding.

             You nailed it.  There's definitely a mass mind programming going on.

             When you mentioned activating brain centers that reminded me of the movie "Lawnmower Man", in which they used symbols, sigils, spirals, and the keys of solomon to activate certain regions of the brain with a VR headset.
            </p>
            <p>
             Images and sound frequencies are how they control the masses and with the advent of 4k TV and high refresh rates the images should have a greater effect.
            </p>
            <p>
             On another note about images and sound frequencies, the techno scene is under heavy attack, especially since ecstasy, lsd, and other drugs will be used at those events like Tomorrowland music festival.

            When making a pizza, the sauce is put in the center of the crust, and then spread out in a spiral shape. Of course it's then hidden beneath the cheese. topped if necessary, and then baked. Cheese Pizza = Child Porn and the spiral is a reference of the same.

            Found more info.  Something kept going through my head.  I remembered about Hermaphrodite and the sea shell
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite">

            </a>
            and the sea shell.
           </p>
           <p>
            In biology, a hermaphrodite (/hɜːrˈmæfrədaɪt/) is an organism that has complete or partial reproductive organs and produces gametes normally associated with both male and female sexes.[1] Many taxonomic groups of animals (mostly invertebrates) do not have separate sexes.[2] In these groups, hermaphroditism is a normal condition, enabling a form of sexual reproduction in which either partner can act as the "female" or "male". For example, the great majority of tunicates, pulmonate snails, opisthobranch snails, earthworms and slugs are hermaphrodites. Hermaphroditism is also found in some fish species and to a lesser degree in other vertebrates. Most plants are also hermaphrodites.
           </p>
           <p>
            Historically, the term hermaphrodite has also been used to describe ambiguous genitalia and gonadal mosaicism in individuals of gonochoristic species, especially human beings. The word intersex has come into preferred usage for humans, since the word hermaphrodite is considered to be misleading and stigmatizing,[3][4] as well as "scientifically specious and clinically problematic".[5]
           </p>
           <p>
            A rough estimate of the number of hermaphroditic animal species is 65,000.[6] Since the estimated total number of animal species is 8.6 million, the percentage of animal species that are hermaphroditic is about 0.7%. Arthropods are the phylum with the largest number of species. Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self-fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals is similar to that of plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the Greek Angle
           </p>
           <p>
            The term derives from the Latin: hermaphroditus, from Ancient Greek: ἑρμαφρόδιτος, translit. hermaphroditos,[7] which derives from Hermaphroditus (Ἑρμαφρόδιτος), the son of Hermes and Aphrodite in Greek mythology. According to Ovid, he fused with the nymph Salmacis resulting in one individual possessing physical traits of male and female sexes;[8] according to the earlier Diodorus Siculus, he was born with a physical body combining male and female sexes.[9] The word hermaphrodite entered the English lexicon as early as the late fourteenth century.[10] Alexander ab Alexandro stated, using the term hermaphrodite, that the people who bore the sexes of both man and woman were regarded by the Athenians and the Romans as monsters, and thrown into the sea at Athens and into the Tiber at Rome.[11]
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know what I am getting at here?  The two sexes?  What have they been pushing lately?  Trannys.  Also self-fertilization.  Is this what they are planning for the human race?  I read yesterday that some doctor was able to make it possible for a lesbian couple to both carry the same child.  I kid you not.  This worries me a great deal.

             Very interesting and a lot to absorb,  I'm glad you mentioned the hermaphrodite angle, because that led to thinking about how this may be connected to the satanic baphomet, which is androgynous and how that may be connected to the tranny agenda and self fertilization.

             The sea shells and snails also remind me of the Fibonacci Sequence

             I was shocked when you mentioned the lesbian couple interchangebly carrying the baby for pregnancy
             <a href="https://www.health.com/infertility/same-sex-couple-carry-same-baby">
              https://www.health.com/infertility/same-sex-couple-carry-same-baby
             </a>
             .  I'm wondering if  the genetic dna is transferred when they swap the baby and I also wonder how it will affect the child in the long run, somehow making the child more androgynous.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's definitely something sinister going on and they may indeed maybe trying to program us for androgyny (kind of sounds like android).  I'll will definitely dig deeper into this and I appreciate your info, so keep me posted if you find more info &amp; connections.

              I am getting a really sick feeling.  The spiral is extremely important I feel.  Look at this, it is mentioned in here again, the shell.

              Fibonacci sequences appear in biological settings,[11] in two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, such as branching in trees, arrangement of leaves on a stem, the fruitlets of a pineapple,[12] the flowering of artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone,[13] and the family tree of honeybees.[64] However, numerous poorly substantiated claims of Fibonacci numbers or golden sections in nature are found in popular sources, e.g., relating to the breeding of rabbits in Fibonacci's own unrealistic example, the seeds on a sunflower, the spirals of shells, and the curve of waves.[65]

            It is representative of the intellectual and emotional journey outward or inward while also indicating the shape of the galaxy we live in and alluding to the expansion of consciousness and perception from the most minuscule possible to the most maximum possible. Knowledge is power and all that. The spiral is found in the oldest religious sites known to man, like in Malta. Awe and wonder is hypnotizing, along with many other things. It is better to be the hypnotizer than the hypnotized because that is how power works in human systems.

             Of course these animals are descendants of neanderthal and not Adam they're not human. I read they rape kids bc they think they'll get occult powers from it. Sick freaks.
