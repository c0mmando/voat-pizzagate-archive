I won\'t go into a whole lot of back story but I will try and answer all your questions. I will start off by saying that I have never done anything that would be considered inappropriate to a child. Also, I personally hate that word so you will not find me using it here. </p>
<p>I have always been attracted to young girls, and weather anyone believes it or not I believe I was born this way because I cannot remember a time in my life where this was not the case. </p>
<p>Anyhow, fast forward to the mid 1990\'s until the mid 2000\'s and I found internet forums. I had been looking at and for CP from the time I got my first computer in 1994. We used to swap images in AOL chat-rooms, Hotwire, Napster, Scour and UseNet but I never actually had any kind of relationship with others like me until 1999 I found a forum called lilgirl forum which was run by a guy from England who went by the name Mystwr. ( I am only giving this information that could possibly expose me because there may be someone out there who can verify that I am not BSing here and I want to do whatever I can to help bring these fuckers down. You all might hate me, and that\'s fine I\'m not here to discuss the morality of pedophilia, I\'m just here to help expose these sick fucks hurting children. ) </p>
<p>I had found a place with people just like me. We would talk together about girls and our attractions and stuff like that, most of us were very strict about not acting out our desires and using each other as support. </p>
<p>Myself, Mystwr, and I would say 99% of the people there (and there were thousands many famous people, judges, lawyers, musicians, politicians, athletes and regularJoes, even women..) were 100% against ANY mistreatment of children and we were active in going so far as to report to law enforcement people whom we found to be an actual threat to children. I am not trying to say we were saints, we all watched CP we traded it etc. and I know at some level that was contributing to the problem and that is a part of the reason I eventually left the community. We had meetups we would travel across the country in some cases to meet up with other people from the forum and chat and just have a good time knowing we could talk to another human being about things we dare never speak aloud. When I first met another person like me I think we cried for a good half hour together it was just a huge emotional release. Several of our members ended up killing themselves and we ran a support system to prevent suicide of others like us. </p>
<p>Let me explain that this was a time in my life where I absolutely hated myself for how I felt and like a horrible human being. I knew I would never hurt anyone but the repressed feelings were impossible to withhold and watching CP is how I dealt with that. Meeting others like me and just being able to talk to them was more satisfying that any amount of CP and it eventually helped me to deal with these feelings to the point where I hardly notice them anymore. It was a long, difficult road but I am glad I found the people I did. </p>
<p>Anyhow, fast forward a few years I had become so active in the forums that I ended up running them. Mywsr had been busted for CP and was locked up and many others were busted in stings around the world. I started several of my own forums and became somewhat of a celebrity among the community. People respected me and respected my hard stance on things like torture, rape, exploitation etc. I admit that back then I had a whole lot of different views than I have now. I was an advocate of free love no matter age and my stance on that has changed drastically since then. </p>
<p>Anyhow, I ended up leaving the community, it became too much of a burden people were getting locked up and it turned into a place I could no longer associate with. Shortly after I gave up CP completely and can proudly say that I haven\'t looked back. I am still attracted to young girls and I am sure I always will be. </p>
<p>That all being said I\'m writing this because I do have knowledge that is unique to this situation so I thought I could answer some questions for you guys because what is being done is horrible and these people need to be locked up. I doubt that my knowledge will be of a lot of help but whatever I can do to help put these fuckers away I will do.</p>',

            If I had to speculate I would say that they are most likely all personally connected. I seriously doubt they got together online or something like traditional people do. Also, with their resources I would imagine that they have their own servers and whatnot and we will have no idea how or where they communicate online until their caught. If they were smart they would just hide a private site inside another unassuming site like
            <a href="http://www.hpj.cc/">
             http://www.hpj.cc/
            </a>
            which is a secret torrent tracking website. Just by looking at it you would never know what it is but people in the know know how to access it. If I had their resources and was into doing what their doing this is what I would do.

            In your time, had anyone in your communities used compression or algorithmic converting techniques to distribute CP? It is thought that this is how CP material is now being spread without detection. For reference please see this thread on items found at a suspect website:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1442652">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1442652
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing how to detect this could aid in our efforts to investigate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I must commend you for opening up like this. It is very much appreciated.

            If I had to guess I would say that it has to do with BDSM not entirely sure it has to do specifically with children. Like I said before I imagine these people were involved in all kinds of sexual madness. Including but not exclusively children.

            Cheese Pizza is absolutely CP child porn.  Pizza being used for a little girl i've never heard it used in that context. Nor have I ever heard hotdog used in that context. That being said, it's been quite a few years since I was involved so things could have changed. There was no facebook, instagram, stuff like that when I was involved. And I have absolutely no desire to get re-involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the symbols I know them all. I actually helped design this one
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/FBI-pedophile-symbols-417.JPG">

            </a>
            . I flew to Britain to meet with Lindsay Ashford and the guy who ran a website called "Butterfly Kisses" which was a website dedicated to female pedophiles. Me Linsday, and a few other people got high and discussed the CLogo and and sketched it out on a coffee table.
           </p>
           <p>
            It says in that article that it was used for pedophiles without preference but that's not true it was intended as a way for us to know each other. We used to send out buttons, shirts, stickers that we would put in places to meet others. The Glogo is the triangle thing and I think that was started by Girlchat (annabelleigh.net) and the BLogo was done by their sister site for people who like boys.

             Any other logo's or designs that we can be looking out for, that are commonly used?
            </p>
            <p>
             Any organizations, forums, or groups, that you guys openly frowned upon?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you guys always report individuals who you knew or suspect, where hurting/abusing children? How where you able to distinguish if the CP you attained, wasn't created by the individuals in the support system?

            Elafantis, Christopher Boutlier and other Comet linked people made a lot of very strange comments on Instagram.   Alongside pictures of children and babies they would say things like "hotard," "must have", "chickenlovers," "why does daddy like it in the butt?" "someone should put her on a menu", "yum...baby" etc. etc.   Skeptics have tried to claim that these were either "dark jokes" or the product of gays being more "feminine".    Does that strike you as plausible?   Is there any doubt in your mind what's going on here?

             I would say it's more inside jokes between him and his fellow criminals I don't know of any of those terms specifically. If I had to guess I would say that these people were involved in a lot more than just children. I would say that they probably got together and had anything goes orgies and shit like that I don't think it was all about children. Basically just an elite underground sex den. BDSM, torture, rape, snuff even who knows. Child molestion most certianly but I would say that they had adults involved as well. Basically the worst parts of the movie 8mm IRL.

            How common is attraction to babies?   I didn't even know such a thing existed before the Ian Watkins case.    Wouldn't attraction to babies necessarily be sadistic?   I can't think of any other rationale.

             It's not uncommon at all. My best friend as a matter of fact was attracted to infants as young as 1 year old. My AOA was much older so I couldn't really understand the attraction. 
He was and is a great person who would never harm anyone ever. He, like myself, is no longer part of that world and is the only person I still talk to from back then. When we met he was deathly afraid that he could never have a normal relationship and even talked about killing himself. Since then he's been married twice and is living a very normal life.

             Thank you. It's not easy believe it or not. I really don't like reliving all this and there is a lot of paranoia involved... I regret a lot of what I said and did back then but I was a very confused person.

             Absolutely, there were some fucked up people. 
I never had anything to do with them but I have known and seen people who get off on torturing and humiliating children. 
They absolutely exist, and pizzagate sounds a whole lot like the sick shit they do. The Satanic ritual sacrifice shit I have a hard time believing.

               Well, given the scope of the matter I think they just got arrogant thinking they were untouchable. Any normal pedo is on a different level completely, we try and keep a VERY low profile. There are literal books on how to download, consume and distribute child porn without getting caught some written by cops. I would guarantee, with 100% certainty that you know at least a few pedophiles and probably see them every day. Most are only found out when they offend, or get caught with CP and those are most of the time people who are 1. completely stupid and careless, 2. Just stumbled upon some CP took an interest because it's taboo and got themselves caught or 3. very rarely they will catch someone who is actually a producer of the cp that is consumed by pedophiles. Otherwise you most likely will never have any clue.  My belief is that these people thought they were untouchable and we're basically just flaunting it. I mean if the POTUS and SOS we're in on it would you be worried?

            Are these high level people into this or is it a way to show their loyalty that they will not expose each other? Is it a one time thing for them just to prove they are loyal? Do you believe the whole trafficking thing and eating them and all that satanic ritual stuff?

             The high level people rarely let themselves known to people whom they are not intimately involved. Meaning, they have shared "originals" with them. (i.e. home made, original CP.) This way everyone involved is equally indictable.
            </p>
            <p>
             I used to run the website, I was somewhat of a public figure everyone knew me. I was also involved in the creation of CLogo so people knew they could trust me. 
So, I am the barer or a lot of awful secrets.

             The Satanic stuff, I have never seen or heard anything like that at all. It's the most difficult part for me to believe. However, I am 100% convinced that they are talking about children but, no, I seriously doubt the Satanic murder and shit like that. Nothing I have read or heard leads me to believe in any of the occult stuff.

              The satanic stuff may be more of an elite niche thing.   They certainly do engage in occult ceremonies like Bohemian Grove, regardless of how many of them believe in it.   Another theory is that they do the Satanic stuff to make kids look crazy if they ever come forward.

            So, does what we think looks like pedo activity, actually seem legit? I'm guessing it must, if you want it stopped. What, specifically, have been red flags to someone familiar with that sort of activity?

            Are the symbols correct? What symbols look real, which are coincides?

             The slang is on par but different than what we used back in the day. Some of the key words words we used were PT, (Pre-teen) Kinder, (5 and under)  Cake,(A little girls parts)  Wine, (a vintage wine was an older girl (meaning over the age of 12) i.e. "7yo vintage red/blonde/brown etc. stuff like that) CL, (child love) KL, (Kinder love)  KG (KG is also slang for CP there was a very famous set of images and videos called "Kinder", LG (Little Girl), LGL, (little Girl Lover) other words were used "Inga" was a word we used for Russian girls. (Inga was also one of the stars of a child porn series called KG or Kindergarten she was a 5 year old girl from Russia. ( I was never into boys so I don't have a lot to offer as far as boy keywords.)  of course CP,  or

            <p>
             Wow, It's been a long time... I am honestly kind of weary about doing this and bringing up all these memories but I suppose circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyhow,  AOA is "Age of Attraction" is how we used to determine what people were into. "What's your AOA?" LGL 5-10. or "I like littler girls from the ages 5-10) The biggest difference I've seen is that the buzwords have gotten a lot more cryptic over the years. HC (Hard core, or PTHTC which is Pre-Teen Hurt-core which was despicable, horrible shit like beatings mutilations and shit like that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back then we were pretty easy to figure out.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, the buz words are not the same as they were back then but the way they are used it's clear as a bell what they are talking about. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind what they were talking about.
