<p>so dam interesting. here is Hollywood connecte even more to pizzagate</p>
<p>I\'m going to tell you exactly what\'s happening with this pay to play, college cheating scheme. 
The whole thing from the beginning seemed fishy to me. Not only does it not make sense, but....there\'s more to the underlying story.
These elites were not paying to get their kids into Ivy league Universities. These elite universities and celebrates and coaches, were running a human trafficking ring. 
They don\'t need to pay big bucks to get their kids into Ivy league schools...they\'re already elite, they have an open invitation.
Remember the scandal with Penn State\'s football team? Sandusky.....was, and many others were abusing underage, under privilege kids. And everyone knew and did nothing or were involved. Well, these Ivy league schools are involved in child trafficking. The elites were paying for kids. And using the admission into schools, as a front. 
What you also have to understand.....is these indictments on money laundering.....are the easiest way to take down child predictors. It\'s much, much harder to trace the trafficking, and much harder to prove. But money laundering....is a much easier and more fail proof way, of taking them down. 
Plus, it breaks it to the public, much easier. 
You\'ve got elite schools (pedo havens), you got Hwood (pedo haven), you\'ve got elite sport\'s coaches (pedos).... Remember, pedos run in rings. If a pedo is running an Ivy league school, you better believe, they\'re bringing on staff and coaches, that have the same preferences. 
ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
&quot;Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were among more than four dozen people charged in a nationwide college admissions cheating scandal that involved wealthy individuals purportedly paying up to $6.5 million to place their children into elite universities, say court records released Tuesday.&quot;
This doesn\'t even make sense^^^^
It makes no sense, that they would be paying over 6 million dollars, to get their kids into an Ivy league school. What were they really paying for? Kids. 
ðŸ’¥Yale- runs a program of underprivileged children and youth.
ðŸ’¥Georgetown- runs programs for underprivileged children and youth.
ðŸ’¥Stanford- runs programs for underprivileged youth.
ðŸ’¥University of Southern California-
ðŸ’¥UCLA- runs programs for underprivileged youth. 
ðŸ’¥University of Texas- runs programs for underprivileged youth. 
So....... What we\'ve just seen busted up, was a massive child trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Moochie Obahma\'s private tennis couch was another one arrested.</p>

After that, you'll have to repost. Remember: you can always post there and drop a headline and a link to the post here as a comment in any thread.
