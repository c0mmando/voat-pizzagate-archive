            Just to be clear, sex trafficking doesn't always involve kidnapping. As disgusting as it may seem, parents and guardians are often complicit and lend their kids out on an ongoing basis. Thus, even the number of missing children each year is not necessarily a good indication of how many children may be involved.

            Would u please research Illuminati?  This has been going on since 1700's, online documents explain thoroughly what is happening here. Pizzagate is a brick in a pyramid. Illuminati IS the pyramid. I suspect pizza ovens are convenient burn pits. Wouldn't it be hideous if they are feeding remains to everyone. This IS Satan - this is God vs Satan on earth. No joke. Pray.

            The victims are everywhere, oftentimes in plain site. Some are murdered, some are disabled to the point of becoming non-functioning, or medicated to the point of not being credible. Some live despite every effort made to silence them. These are few.
I am writing everything out of first hand knowledge and personal experience. Read on and I will explain below.

            There is a complex network of those involved, and it includes: Judges, attorneys, psychiatrists, police, reporters, teachers, social workers, politicians, and more. They are not only used by pedophila rings, but by entire black markets involving the multi-trillion dollar business of drug trafficking and human trafficking. For everyone who is now learning about Pizzagate, there is a forest amongst all these trees. Pizzagate is a small corner of this disgusting world; it is however important because those involved are heavy-hitters, and shot callers.
           </p>
           <p>
            How they destroy victims:
Victims can be medicated either because they show signs of remembering (they are often drugged when the abuse occurs) or as a preventative measure. A pretext is set, such as a divorce or fighting of the parents is used (sometimes one spouse is involved, and the other doesn't know it). Another pretext could also be a violent attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            The victims will be target for a violent attack or traumatic event to send them "down the rabbit hole." They will seek counseling, or attorney representation. Great effort will be made to make sure their inner circle is either controlled or made up of others who are involved. Anyone not "with the program" will be pushed out. I have seen the tentacles go so deep, that victims will turn to certain people they trust, not knowing that person is in on it, or a perp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Victims will often be put on medication, with some sort of mechanism to put them under the care of a psychiatrist who is able to prescribe them medication. The psychiatrist will be "one of them" and their purpose will be twofold:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             To discredit the victim by continuing and augmenting their medication schedule. (Also leads to drug addiction).
            </li>
            <li>
             To serve as a credible witness against the victim. (They have significant power in the court of law).
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            I've seen it start as innocently as prescribing an anti-anxiety, depression, or hyperactivity medication, which then progresses to harder and more serious medication. Once the victim is on medication, they will have a nearly impossible time coming forward. Their testimony will be tainted and they will be labeled as "on medication" AKA a psych case. If they contact police to report a crime, one of the first questions asked will be "are you on any medication?" The psychiatrist can then blame the medication for the victim acting out. It's a really sick game. There are a network of "trusted" psychiatrists that the pedophile rings use.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also seem to be aware of one another and operate in tight knit groups. Reason being to back each other up. If a victim goes from psychiatrist to psychiatrist being told he needs medication or that his story is impossible, they will eventually believe the psychiatrists. It only takes two doctors to 5150 someone. The victim will be taken against their will by law enforcement to the hospital or rehabilitation center. Victim will then be taken to a hospital and restrained, drugged. What happens beyond that is up to whose care they are in, but I have seen groups of doctors working for the pedophiles repeatedly drug the victim and put them through torture. I will write more about this later, the important thing is HOW they are able to CONVERT a VICTIM SPEAKING OUT into a CRIMINAL. I've seen parents do it to their own children when the children start remembering or telling on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen totally normal children and adults who are victims, go from totally normal to being made into medicated zombies, or suffering from traumatic head injuries and becoming vegetables. Once victims are on medication, it is too easy for them to murder them and frame it as a suicide. They will almost always stage it as a suicide, either as a suicide via overdose of medication, or drugs. Some victims are told if they don't do it (suicide, sometimes a note thrown in for authenticity), their family members will be killed instead. Some murders are reported as natural deaths since their are no signs of foul play. The doctors in the group have perfected this art. The coroner is none the wiser. There is always a cover story, witnesses to tell a certain story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same goes for attorneys. There is a group of attorneys that will deal with such cases, and many are involved in the group. They will work to sabotage the victim in every way possible, all the while acting as if they are the savior. The good lawyers will often be threatened or murdered if a case involves a VIP, or gets to far in court. THEY DO NOT PLAY.
           </p>
           <p>
            How does the enemy remain cohesive? How do they know each other?
They have "events" or "parties" where they are introduced to other "VIPs." They know each other. They know if a certain attorney comes to their court room they must let that attorney prevail. A psychiatrist is referred a patient by a certain attorney, and they know what they have to do. Some police officers are invited into this group (surprise, many involved in child crime investigation units). 
They are also rewarded with vacations, money, and sexual favors. They often get blackmailed themselves and some are initiated using blackmail. Some of these "events" involve raping and torturing victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know of many of the conspiring psychiatrists, doctors, and attorneys, including murdered attorneys who were speaking out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a victim.
They have attempted to murder me more times than I can count. I have had family members murdered. I have had attorneys murdered. 
It was my own family member who brought me into the child trafficking / child pornography ring to be used for his own profit. I could not escape it no matter how hard I tried. The police always hit a brick wall, they could not help me. Teachers who tried to were silenced. Strangers who tried to help me were hurt or killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the course of all this, I saw many things, witnessed many perpetrators, and many victims. Many of the people involved are public figures. 
I went after one of the perpetrators in court. Several of my attorneys were murdered. Not one. Not two. Several. 
Witnesses were threatened or murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have had to go to great lengths to "disappear." Before I was able to disappear, I was stalked and threatened without end. They infiltrated my work. If I moved, they followed me. Changed jobs, they found me. When they found me, they kidnapped and tortured me and my family members. These tortures lasted days. Deprived of food, beaten, tasered, sadistically made to watch as my family members were tortured and screaming for their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            They stole from me. They stole my home, my money. Threatened my friends from school; many avoid talking to one another after seeing what happens when they do. They are VERY powerful. They are in many positions of power. They have almost unlimited funds due to their multi-trillion dollar drug and human trafficking businesses. Again, they are public figures. People you see on TV are doing this.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have tried to kill me, but by the grace of Jesus Christ and his followers I have survived. I shouldn't be alive given everything they have done to try and murder me. But I believe I've survived so I can tell, and so others can be saved. I will provide all the information I can to help piece this together without endangering anyone. I am an educated person, ask me and I will do my best to tell.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I first heard about #Pizzagate online, I ignored it. When I saw how MSM was working so hard to cover it up, my interest was piqued. When I went on Youtube and looked it up, I was in literal shock. I saw things that were familiar. It started to make sense. 
I always promised myself when I was being abused, that I would NEVER let them get away with it. I beg of you all to please keep up the good fight. People can be saved if this criminal enterprise is exposed!

            Very few of the victims survive to have their story heard. It's sadly also common for the victims' to have some form of blackmail on them once they've been recruited. This usually involves the victim being filmed in a very humiliating manner, such as participating in acts of bestiality. 
Others are too ashamed and embarrassed to come forward.

            Sadly, I don't think they let the Haitian, Iraqi victims live to tell the tale. The others are probably part of the cult.

            Afraid to come forward because they fear people won't believe them. Look how hard a time pizzagate is having making some believe.  Also many suffer from DID, CPTSD and want the situation to go away. To many of them talking about it triggers their emotions, splitting, nausea and so on.  As shitty as it may sound this is almost the perfect crime. Get the victim at an age where they are malleable. Young children don't reason well and will believe threats even as fantastic as they may be. Sometimes the abusers wear police or other uniforms to train the kid that anyone could hurt them.

            Psychologists treating these people would have to speak out... with permission... until they mysteriously die by nail gun or car explosions. Aka the DA in the Sandusky case.

            We have to realize there is a possibility that this pedo thread runs through every aspect of civil society. Corporations, police departments, doctors colluded with Savile. It's a viral infestation.  The more the public believes and is willing to support these victims, the more will come out.

            I have a theory, but it might be stupid:
           </p>
           <p>
            This people is organized. This has been going on for too long, they know how to hide. They use the mind control the teach the kids how to lie and then they fake families. Is like those kids in London, they said that the cult only would take the kids of the parents willing to participate and be part and members of the whole satanic thing. Thats how they kept the secret. Thats how it is kept today.
           </p>
           <p>
            The kids they stole for 3rd world countries,i am afraid they are the so called nobodys childrend. The nobodys children are those meant to be sacrificed. Either by satanic methods or in the slavary/organ market.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are brainwhasing the kids they rape and torture so we cant spot them. Theyve been doing it from many many years. Read Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue. This things wasnt born in the new era, the new era was made up to uncover all this while they try to normalize it, to make it 'legal' literally.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we dont stop this at time, there would be a day in wich we would be considered as traitors or even worse just for been against this kind of things.

             They are VERY organized. More so than the common person, and to the extent of almost operating like a military. They have ranks, meetings, training, localized networks.
            </p>
            <p>
             The cult thing is a sub-set of the larger picture. In actuality it's probably less than half.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children are obtained by: child care centers, babysitters, schools, after school activities, kids sports teams etc.
In my case, I was taken by a parent to a meeting point in most cases, often a public place, to be picked up by the child molester / pornographer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kids can be "borrowed" or are also stolen here in the United States, not just 3rd world countries. Social Services and adoption programs are prime sources. Sometimes neighbors are involved. The common denominator is all these people involved are evil to the core, and often involved in Satanic rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
             The brainwashing is very real. They can brainwash kids so they don't even remember anything. Brainwashing, drugs, etc. 
Agreed, this needs to be exposed in its entirety.

            Considering nobody knows who these people are and they communicate through encrypted networks, disposing of a body is probably a breeze. Watched a doc on Dutroux from Belgium and he was burying bodies of his victims 15 ft down, behind his house. He was not in a rural neighborhood and the houses were in close proximity to each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            If previous cases prove anything it's that these pedos are well connected, secretive, elite predators with extensive blackmail. Gaining access to a cremation oven, secluded property, rural property etc wouldn't be difficult to attain. It's disturbing to say the least but it's a reality. Disposing of a body wouldn't be as difficult if you have multiple individuals working together. If it was one person with a shovel panicked, yes it would be very easy to be discovered but these groups would and will go to great lengths to protect themselves.
