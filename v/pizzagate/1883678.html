<blockquote>
<p>I KNOW THAT SETCH RICH WAS INVOLVED IN THE DNC LEAK.
I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the Internet Party in the United States. He called himself Panda. I now know that Panda was Seth Rich.</p>
<p>Panda advised me that he was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the Internet Party may find helpful.</p>
<p>I communicated with Panda on a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.</p>
<p>“He wanted to change that from the inside.”
I was referring to what I knew when I did an interview with Bloomberg in New Zealand in May 2015. In that interview I hinted that Julian Assange and Wikileaks would release information about Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>The Rich family has reached out to me to ask that I be sensitive to their loss in my public comments. That request is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>I have consulted with my lawyers. I accept that my full statement should be provided to the authorities and I am prepared to do that so that there can be a full investigation. My lawyers will speak with the authorities regarding the proper process.</p>
<p>If my evidence is required to be given in the United States I would be prepared to do so if appropriate arrangements are made. I would need a guarantee from Special Counsel Mueller, on behalf of the United States, of safe passage from New Zealand to the United States and back. In the coming days we will be communicating with the appropriate authorities to make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, I will make no further comment.</p>

            This is much bigger than Podesta - he is expendable. They might throw Skippy under the bus just to make citizen journalists stop investigating further - they know how deep it goes! I was anticipating something like this. Remember that exposure of Dennis Hasterd did not do anything in terms of stopping pedophile rings in DC.

            Why not release the info to Wikileaks? Why not release the info like Wikileaks? Why ask to testify under conditions that will never be granted to him? This was all tantalization and self-promotion. If he really saw Seth Rich as a hero, he needs to put up or shut up. He's filthy rich, has hackers at his disposal, and he has to wait on his lawyers? Give me a break.

            Smart. He held back at the request of his lawyer(s). That is what the DNC was fearing the most. That he actually has something. Since he held back, they now have no choice but to place a few phone calls, influence, and character assassinate in hopes that will be enough

            Just remember Kim is personal friends with Assange, I feel this is very plausible.. Hes an egomaniac but I believe him. This is real. He has plenty of experience dealing with the authorities so he knows what hes doing in that regards.
 The uk attack distraction is working. No mention of Seth Rich today.. Yesterday Seth was mentioned on national news here in new zealand. Today so far nothing.
Also I feel Seths family have been threatened.. I feel Kim also sees now how dangerous this is. He may have taken a step back. 
He may also realise 19 people died in the uk to distract from this story which I feel is no coincidence.
            <br/>
            His latest tweet confirms my suspicions.. He also mentions Aaron attack on him..

            Yeah, not too impressed with this. It's not about patience. It's the faith I'm supposed to have in our utterly corrupt and fucked system.
            <br/>
            As someone pointed out, he gave a condition that in likelihood won't be met- safe passage to the US to testify against our corrupt government. So he's off the hook if the corrupt government doesn't play ball.
            <br/>
            Why couldn't he release his evidence himself, or through WikiLeaks? Why not do it anonymously rather then needing to self promote? Why... too many whys. 
Some of you, and the optimist in me, will say, well, Trump has fixed things so he can go through the traditional channels to let the authorities handle it. So we'll see. But I can't help but expect any evidence he may actually have go through "the proper channels" to  never see the light of day.
            <br/>
            TLDR: Why go to the authorities with this? We've gotten this far by having info just released into the wild.

            Absolutely it's about Seth and disproves and negates the Russian narrative so completely as to be catastrophic to the Cannibal Elite. Pedosta better find a nice cave to hide in ... oh, that's right! He has those underground dungeons .... perfect.

            I'm sure his lawyers told him that he can't get specific on how he knows for sure about the Wikileaks connection until he gets some sort of immunity.  The government still wants to prosecute Assange, remember, and they could go after Kim.  They have before.  More info is coming out and Kim gave all the Seth Rich emails out so others can find the info too.

            We all waited anxiously for nothing. Kim drops a dud. U.S. authorities have done nothing so Kim can forget about it. They won't be asking anything from him or anybody else.

            He's trying to bargain. He's in the middle of a extradition case himself - he's going to try and trade this info for a drop of a different set of charges. This is Kim submitting a request to play ball and seeing,if they will take him up on the offer.

            Unfortunately, we need to give this reasonable time. It may be that Kim DotCom sometimes bullshits, but is sometimes real. He's hard to gauge completely. It is also reasonable that he has been persuaded to follow official channels. This may or may not be the correct decision, but it's not easy for somebody in his shoes to know, and given that he has made his claim public already he is in a position in which he should have a real fear of power coming down on him. So, he may be making his moves in hopes that the information will be received by people who will do something with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be noted that he always has the opportunity to change his mind and he has no doubt vaulted any real information he has for backup.
           </p>
           <p>
            As usual, reserve at least some of your judgment for real humans making difficult decisions.

            I disagree. If true, this is ASTONISHING! It's not just him ... IF THIS IS TRUE, then there are communications that will be able to be traced back to Seth Rich. There have to be footprints. And IF HE WAS IN CONTACT WITH RICH'S PARENTS, then that also shows he demonstrated that this is not a newly-concocted lie.

            No, this s not nothing ... this is a big something ... but again, it hinges on it being true! KimDotCom delivered!

             KimDotCom must know about Skippy and the horrors and wants to put his life on the line to save the kids, and if they won't nail Skippy for pizza emails then they might nail him for ordering 'wetworks' on Seth Rich. Perhaps it was not such a good idea to troll PG community via WP after all.

              Well, there'd have to be more than the pizza emails ... and that's the problem. No one investigated if there was more because of Comey and key people in position to stop/not order investigations. I mean, they actually got enough steam to start a Russian investigation, but not one to investigate what was going on in the swimming pool? Or on Evie's Crib? Or why the Pedosta's ugy mugs are on Wanted posters in connection with little Madeleine McCann being abducted? KimDotCom just opened up a new avenue to prove it was Seth Rich. I just hope he has the goods ...

              The mocking might be being done by shills or paid shills Crowdstrike. They may be trying to not make this a big deal ... but it is HUGE! They also might be trying to goad him, but that ain't gonna happen. KimDotCom isn't stupid. Hope he gave copies of that evidence to people he trusts.

             I agree. He states that he is willing to
             <strong>
              testify and provide evidence
             </strong>
             if guaranteed
             <strong>
              safe passage

             . That's great imho.

              "If guaranteed" and he won't be, so will he just sit on this supposed information? I was really hoping he'd drop a bombshell, but instead just reiterated what we already knew. You had to scroll past his stupid ads on his website to get to the Seth Rich bit. Why not make that the very first thing on the website? What a joke.

              Exactly. He can't show the evidence to everyone. If he did, he'd probably get others involved, and the Cannibal Elite would have time to cover up the evidence. This goes back to 2014, you have no idea what they might have said in those emails.

             Agree people reee over not getting instant gratification, but over the long run Kim is usually right. Shit he knew about the leaks nealry two years before they happened, not too shabby

              Exactly. The fact he's holding back the real evidence rings true. People need to understand that it fills in that back story ... gives pertinent details about Panda getting involved and mobilizing a plan to get the intel out there. Seth was actively involved in spearheading a sort of "Truth in Government" coalition to expose the Cannibal Queen and her scummy minions. Pedosta and others must be shitting in their pants right now.

               If this dates back to 2014, which as I go through his old tweets and interviews, it appears to be, then this is massive. We already got a view that Seth was more than just a disgruntled employee, this is a smoking gun. Seth was plotting something like this for years before it happened

                Exactly! 2014! There's no telling what's in those emails. If he was upset, there had to be pretty incriminating stuff. This is definitely a smoking gun. The WikiLeaks isn't a one time occurrence. This was deliberate. Seth Rich wanted to the truth out there.

            I hope he has physical evidence, because this statement is
            <strong>
             extremely problematic
            </strong>
            particularly coming from an attention-whore bullshit artist.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) He's given a condition that the deep state will never agree to (guaranteeing him safe passage to the US to testify) so he'll never have to deliver the goods.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Additionally, we have no idea if he really talked to the parents or not. Even if he thinks he's being 100% truthful, maybe it was the "family spokesman" that was reaching out to him and he got hoodwinked somehow.
           </p>
           <p>
            I sincerely hope he gives multiple backup copies to trusted friends. Who in the mainstream media would question it if he keels over from a heart attack 3 weeks from now at a quiet moment?
