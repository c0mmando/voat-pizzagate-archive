<li>Do not, for the love of fuck, bring up past conspiracies or use the term &quot;False Flag&quot; at all. That will you make you out to be nuts.

<p>Should we fail to establish our presence on a global scale, they will bury us, slaughter us just like they did with Gamergate. We cannot allow that to happen. We must stay with them at all costs.
