            This is as big as a wikileaks email with pizza in it because it confirms the meaning of "pizza."

            Instead of being viral so that we redpill the public (only thing that will ever out pedophilia to public) the cult of Trump is jamming the airwaves retweeting his every move.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Some incredibly naive people, and probably some zionist shills, are co-opting pizzagate and turning it into a Republican cheer leading club.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Add to your resume: "we had a chance, but we trusted a political party, and we blew it."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The cult of Trump is NOT redpilling anybody or training young new pizzagaters for the future. In order for pizzagate to survive it has to have young new members to continue it's future. The cult of Trump is training our new members to be Republican cheerleaders.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The pedophile cult is smiling from ear to ear, because the Republican party is full of blackmailed pedos too. All these politicians are Freemasons and THEY TAKE AN OATH not to harm their fellow Freemasons. This why they don't go to jail. They are forbidden to harm one another.
           </p>

              I do what I can but there is a concerted effort to co-opt pizzagate. Our sub is becoming a source of poison to the pizzagate community because of the sticky threads at the top of the page. I feel like its a losing battle but I try none the less. I worked for over 20 years to bring awareness to this point and it looks like a hand full of people are going to fuck it up for everybody before this is over.

            so... they're supposed to be underage? I couldn't tell. And if some fucking whore shows up at my door with her pizza out and wants me to eat it I'll fuckin eat it, because fuck rules. There's a huge difference between a 14 year old you're trying to coerce and some primed to fuck 17 year old slut that's gonna go fuck a random nig on the street if it's not you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus I just read a comment that says the whores blackmail him, and in that clip the whores are talking about previous sex. What's the problem here? someone explain this shit.

             Spoilers from what I can remember
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically two girls knock on his door while his wife and kids are out for the weekend. He lets them in to use his phone and warm up or something and they seduce him and record him screwing them. And then they tell his they're underage so he wont go to the cops or tell anyone. Then they proceed to trash his house and torture him. They even go so far as to kill some guy delivering something there. At the end I think they buried him up to his neck right before his wife got home and then told him they were actually of age and left.

              Yea I gathered most of that from the preview. Not something I would ever bother watching.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just think it's so funny how these people are obsessed with pizza now. As if any reasonable person who watched this would blame Keanus character for anything other than cheating on his wife. You know what? if pizza, or two underaged whores showed up at my spot right now, I'd fkn eat both. When I was 11 years old girls were trash whores trying to get fucked by anything with a pulse. You think I'm gonna get mad at some guy who nails some 17 year old who's begging for it? fuck no. get that shit. I don't give a FUCK. Women who allow themselves to get fucked for power too. I'd never use the power play on a woman, but do I care if some guy does and the female goes along with it? fuck no. Lots of actresses just said fuck no. They deserve the respect, not the stupid whores.

            Damn Keanu in all these pizza related things. Matrix, "follow the white rabbit"
then in Neon Demon, he's the motel owner renting to starlets knowing they're getting fk'd
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was the guy in the green shirt in the clip who said 'this is like something no guy is able to resist so you kind of feel bad for him. its like if somebody comes to your door with free pizza, you're going to take the free pizza'?
