            Here's the deal: Alefantis has big guns like the Podesta Group using big legal muscle to get those files deleted. I've been monitoring how many show up in Google searches and every day it's fewer and fewer.

            The best thing now is to lay low on the images and not spread about known links to them.

            If anyone has them, upload them to a free Dropbox and save them on SD cards and such like and then we can keep bringing them out over time and reposting them in various places.

             i more and more get the idea that dispersion of information only works if there is a level of organization as well. the formation of a faction with well thought out and formulated goals can make a big difference. As long as they are integer.

              I've seen tons of info, since I was monitoring this from the beginning. And I wish I had started a spread sheet or something. Because now great info is gone, forgotten or deleted and well meaning people are "discovering" things that were already known.

               I realized that too  and coming to realize that every day there is no evidence that pizza gate actually does anything. People spread information, and don't expect to reach anything by doing so. It's nearly pointless.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why when I first came to investigate what this pizzagate thing is at all last week (very late, so had to catch up) I immediately started a thread looking for a wiki, thinking there was none. There was one, but is wasn't functional, just a placeholder basically. Now we get at least a thousand views a day. We also deal with attacks, and we barely have time to both search for viable informatoin, make edits, and delete spam.
              </p>
              <p>
               My first thought when I discovered pizzagate is why havent anyone gone there and did something. It's too late, CIA is the culprit and they're orchestrating the course of events. Trump is not a target: if he gets killed, it would be the start of WW3 which means no guarantee the pedophiles can keep slaughtering children.
              </p>
              <p>
               The real incriminating evidence, they say is still not out there. It can't be physically exposed by vigilants anymore, it's too late for that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wikileaks is being murdered, and they say the dead man switch for the really big stuff (that would make previous leaks bleak in comparison), in case "something" would happen (Assange is missing), was hacked or manipulated or something . I might have got some technicalities wrong, but this is what I understand of the current situation, which is incredibly tense.
              </p>
              <p>
               They're decoding the blockchain, whatever that means.

               I appreciate your concern, but archived screenshots will not have embedded images. If you are deliberately attempting to scare people away from sharing the requested information with your rhetoric, please stop.

               I'm specifically asking if the .zip of Alefantis' Instagram pictures and Comet Ping Pong related videos linked in my original post are uploaded or hosted anywhere else.

                I'm just telling you why I didn't save any myself.

                As far as your question goes, there is a ton of stuff from 8chan archived if you feel like digging for it.

                Personally, I'd like as many photos from Alefantis IG out there. But at the same time, I know they are being deleted when found.

                It's a catch 22.

                 Fair enough. Can never be too sure. I plan on looking for it but I wanted see if anyone had downloaded the .zip and hosted it elsewhere before digging. My intention was to keep updating links for more and more people to download. They can only delete download links so quickly :)
