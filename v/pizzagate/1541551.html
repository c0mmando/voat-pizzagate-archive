            Thanks, Link fixed. I have more leads connecting haiti and bain capital activities to the catholic diocese. Just give me some time to put it together I'm quite tired. If you speak spanish I need help finding the source article that links the diocese with the hotel rented for laura silsby in the dominican republic.
