<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — A U.S. jury found a Christian missionary from Oregon guilty Wednesday of multiple sex abuse charges for molesting children living at an unlicensed Cambodian orphanage that he operated in Phnom Penh over a period of years.</p>
<p>Daniel Stephen Johnson, 40, was convicted of six counts of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place and one count each of travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and aggravated sexual assault with children.

<p>“The despicable nature of this defendant’s conduct is beyond understanding,” said Billy Williams, U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon.</p>

            I believe many many monsters hide in churches and not just the Catholic Church. Most churches run kids programs, youth events ect and it draws the pervs.

Bella Dodd was right they weaseled in I've seen enough they warped doctrines, watered down beliefs inverted them disallowed traditional teaching. Fuck we have been subverted, time for some counter striking.

            Johnson last Monday completed a one-year prison sentence in Cambodia for sexually abusing five boys who were in his care at an orphanage he had operated there, according to multiple media reports and the anti-pedophile group Action pour les Enfants, which is based in

            More than a decade ago, Johnson was accused in Oregon of molesting three children in his sister’s care. But Lincoln County prosecutors dismissed sexual abuse and sodomy charges in the case after investigators began to doubt the alleged victims’ statements, according to a 2003 article in the Yamhill Valley News-Register. The article described Johnson as a part-time missionary and said he was arrested at an airport upon returning from a trip to Asia.

             was talking about. Oregon is morally bankrupt. They can get up in arms about calling thugs that will kill/torture anything that movies, but pedos? Hey, just give them a Get Out of Jail Free pass! I'm only surprised that the prosecutor in that first case didn't blame the children for coming onto Johnson and saying the sex was consensual.

              Oregon has a very interesting history. Thomas Jefferson planned with German jewish immigrant fur trader John Jacob Astor to develop Northwest trade ports first, in order to establish a China trade (including opium) with America. The central U.S. regions would be developed later. The original plans to establish a major trading post in Oregon was a bit of a failure, however, Astor's men managed to establish the beginnings of a trade port which was named Astoria in his honor. It still exists today. Astor planned and directed the operation from New York and hired two crews: one would follow an overland trail all the way to the coast, and the other would sail around South America all the way up to the meeting place now called Astoria. The overland team followed some of Lewis and Clark's trails, but they forged some of there own to get to the Oregon coast. This became known as the Oregon Trail, and many East Coasters were encouraged to settle there. This land was wild and far from the morals of the established church. Many involved in the China trade also were slave traders. I am sure this early foundation has contributed to the current corrupt culture. Here is an interesting and related article:
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              I highly recommend this book on the founding of Astoria, Oregon:
Astoria: John Jacob Astor and Thomas Jefferson's Lost Pacific Empire: A Story of Wealth, Ambition, and Survival
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, Jacob Astor managed to make a fortune selling West Coast sea otter pelts to the Chinese. He parlayed this fortune into real estate and became a land baron/developer of Manhattan Is. His grandson, John Jacob Astor lll, owned the property under the Empire State building. His son Waldorf used some of his inherited property to build the Waldorf Hotel. His cousin, not to be outdone, built the Astoria hotel next door. In order to increase profits, they decided to merge the hotels into the iconic Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Cousin John Jacob Astor lV went down on the Titanic while returning from a European honeymoon with his new second wife. Many conspiracy theories surround this event. He supposedly was funding Nikola Teslas work on free wireless energy. J.P. Morgan, who was also trying to control Tesla's work, had personally invited Astor to sail on the Titanic's maiden voyage. There is much more on the Astor family. Worth researching.

              Agreed, and Oregon is a beautiful place, which leads me to another pattern. Why is it that all of these disgusting individuals seem to settle in the most beautiful places such as Florida, California, etc. Is this part of the plan? To make the most beautiful places as disgusting as they are? It truly seems this is the case. They want to ruin every part of God's creation that is serene, beautiful, and innocent with their disgusting acts. They are hell bent on making everything a cess pool, visually, emotionally, and figuratively.
             </p>
             <p>
              Plus, to call them animals is an insult to all animals. I know for a fact that daddy rabbits will not mount their young and will herd them to safety if danger lurks.
             </p>
             <p>
              What we're dealing with are subhumans, monsters, and parasites. The lowest of low. Animals are so above them, it's incomprehensible.

             <p>
              I read a letter from an abused daughter, who was abused by her grandfather.  The mother never forgave the daughter for snitching on her grandfather.  So why would these kids want to
             </p>
             <p>
              snitch on their relative knowing probably no one would believe them.  It would take a lot for those kids to come forward with this. People need to stop blaming kids for the crimes of adults.

               Totally agree.

               You know, now that I'm thinking about this, it just occurred to me why they're pushing all that inappropriate sexual education at way too young age. It's because the biggest advantage for children coming forward was their age. A common remark to a child describing explicit details was that a five-year-old wouldn't know these things. But if the schools compel children to learn these details, then the story can be brushed aside because the child really could have known details and made up a story to include them.

              <p>
               But really, in the McMartin cae and Aquino case, children weren't believed even though they had venereal diseases. I mean .. WHAT? Let's face it, there's a war going on for our children. We have to keep fighting to keep them safe.

                Good deduction!  They are always a few steps ahead with the most perverted plans and ideas.  Always trying to corrupt the minds of Our Little Ones.  So Sad.

                 Yes, they are. And those hormone blockers ... so dangerous. And if anyone has doubts about what child molestation can do, look at Whitney Houston. Everybody always wondered why she was destroying herself with drugs, and now? Now we have the answer, but she's gone!

                 They can invent all these fantasies that they want in how it isn't harmful, but reality shows something markedly different. I worked with a guy who'd been sexually abused by his father and he was so messed up. Nicest guy, but it really did destroy him.

                  I don't know anyone, at least no one has opened up about it.  Except of course our SRA Survivor on here.  I write her at least 4 sometimes 5 times a week.  But no one near me.  Very hard to deal with.  I don't know how people cope.  There must be some serious help for these children.  They can grown up being perpetrators.

                   They can, but in the cases I know of, they're mainly screwed up. It's really horrible to see. You just wish you could put a hand on their shoulder and tell them it's all right and they're all right, but, of course, it isn't, and they're not.

                    It's so very awful, isn't it?  We who read about this so many times a week and day even when we try to console could never feel or understand the horror these children have gone through.  And then the horror they continue going through all their lives.  Thank God for trained therapists.

                     But remember, these pervs have infiltrated the trained professionals designed to help so parents have to be careful about who their children are seeing and if the therapist/professional is getting their child even sicker. In other words, the swamp is deep.

                        Yeah, everyday is Halloween.  They don their suits and attempt to fool us, but no more.  We are waking up to these fakesters.  They are in for a rude awakening.  The trials in Pa.  will expose many of them and people will have to face the truth.  People have had their heads in the sand.  No more.

              Like Alaska, Oregon is renowned for miles of sprawling forests and high mountains. It has another thing in common with Alaska: its high number of missing persons. This includes a “ridiculous” number of missing kids

              One particular eerie spot in Oregon is Crater Lake, located in the Cascade Range of Southwest Oregon. Made up of pure rainwater lying in the crater of a dormant volcano, the lake and surrounding area are known to be a hotbed for bizarre disappearances. One such case was that of 8-year-old Samuel Boehlke on Oct. 14, 2006. The boy, who had mild autism, walked away from his father at a scenic overlook and

               Well, then he did go to Asia to exploit children.

              <p>
               As for the missing children, what is going on there? There was that disturbing picture from Seattle I think. I have no idea if anyone actually followed up on it to see if the girl was in harm's way. Probably not, but as for the little boy, there was a thread on Voat a while back of all the children that had disappeared from campsites/wilderness hikes, etc. It was ridiculously scary.

              I know missionaries come in different flavors, but the two denominations that come to mind are Catholic and Mormon churches... Both well known for protecting abusers.

            In some states it is a crime when you are a person of power as a priest, policeman, nun, teacher, etc when committing these crimes.  I hope they tack it on if there is.  I will be amazed if he goes to jail since Oregon is turning into a cesspool.  Let Us Pray.

             Yeah, my heart sank when I saw Oregon. Probably will commute the sentence to an overnight stay ... and then give him an apology to boot.

             I love the idea of tacking on time for being in an authoritative position and using that position to commit these types of crimes.

              Very much agree.  Maybe he will get a trip on a slow boat to China.  On a yacht.  I need to see some severe punishment coming out of Oregon.

                Yes  I think things are getting so wild in Cali the natives will revolt pretty soon.  Of course there are the that have been in a transcendental fog, but we still have most of the state that will not keep putting up with the moron stuff and will be making their own county laws. Stuff  that Jerry Brown!

                 And I keep waiting for that CDAN story about Don Henley to be revealed. Enty lawyer has been pretty accurate ... waiting ... waiting ... waiting ... was supposed to come out a month before primaries ... where is it?

                  Yeah, I thought about Henley the other day and that girl.  And her husband.  Wonder who he is.   Someone that is in office now and is suppose to have some leverage.  Waiting is hard.

                   Oh, someone told me. It was a pretty good guess, too. Let me try to find it ... yes, found it! The guess was that it's John Cox. Married to Sarah Cox.

                   I believe her age fit the profile. That's why his name was suggested.

                    Well they should get the ball rolling.  It seems everything we are hopeful for always seems to drag.  I was thinking June or July so maybe a month or two.  I can't even imagine what's going on behind the scenes.  Guards, Bullet Vests are all in order, imo.

                     I know. June or July sounds doable, though. And now with a search warrant for Weiner's laptop unsealed ... maybe we'll have an early Christmas!
