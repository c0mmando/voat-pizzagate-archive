There is almost too much revealed in the videos I uploaded this morning, 11 of them. Listen: what if I told you that I could show you that DiVinci\'s Last Supper revealed a black mass of cannibalism and that the symbol for pizza is directly related to the rosicruceans symbol of the rose ??? That pizzagate is actually the tip of an iceberg, which is actually the largest story in the history of man ??? Listen, I\'m not the best film maker, but follow the argument, it is all there. You have no idea who it truly is that you are dealing with. You are here reading which means that you are either an ethicist or a shill. I am not wasting your time. You may not get it at first. Listen, I reveal a whole crap load of stuff. Its all new. New evidence, new way of looking at things. Everything is connected. You don\'t understand at all. Its all there. Its in our history. Its in our art. You won\'t believe it. Not at first. But the evidence is overwhelming. And truly strangly, it was the pizza itself which has come to reveal the rose, and yet it is the rose which again reveals the pizza. They reveal each other. The story is being revealed in art. Follow the link, deal with me a little, trust me... I have written 5 books by the name Khepri Rising. I was studying pizzagate long before they called it pizzagate and long before I knew that that was what I was studying. Years ago, I broke Star Wars down... a gnostic interpretation. Essentially, Star Wars, I believe can be used by either white hat witches and black hatters alike. There is a benevolent tree of life and an evil tree called a qlippoth. How do I convey this information to you ? I made 11 videos so far, if I were found dead at this point because of these videos you really should be able to make most of the lines yourself to finish the picture. I know, you don\'t get it right? Listen: what if I could show you pizzagate within the works of Picasso and Chagall and Gertrude Stein and Sam Mendes and Allan Ginsberg ??? Among many many others. Fact is, this new evidence from culture itself seems to imply that this has been going on since the brothers of the rosy cross in the 1400s. Right now as we speak, we are living in a purge, it is the purge of saturnalia that exists every year between Dec 17 and Dec 25. I think that everyone in the pizzagate subverse is potentially a target for elimination in roman legalized purge, legal killings. I am leaving the first link, there are 11 videos under the title &quot;the Rosetta Files&quot; on youtube. Everything is revealed in movies and art. Everything has been there. We weren\'t paying attention and we didn\'t have the right paradigm to decode the works until now. Listen you want proof right? I\'ll give it too you. The gold statue in Tony Podesta\'s house. Its a rainbow. Its gold because it is the end of the rainbow. The rainbow represents our covenant with God, and his promise never to flood us again. The rainbow is revered by occultists because it leaves in both world, parallel universes. The parallel universes have to do with a covenant to God and a covenant to god &quot;satan&quot;. The rainbow shows that magic can live side by side with man. This is the duality of Picasso\'s cubist movement. He went from blue period to &quot;rose period&quot;. The rose of yesteryear has been cracked by me through pizzagate, and yet it will reveal to our generation the true nature of pizzagate. James Joyce had Poldy Bloom eating different organs in every chapter of Ulysses. Cannibalism. I am going to leave two links. This is the video series, &quot;the rosetta files&quot; : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UduJTlYSnEEYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UduJTlYSnEEYouTube</a> This is how I cracked Kubrick a couple of weeks ago, there is a special cut, in a slower version of Eyes Wide Shut that happens at exactly 1:30:00 on slower version. I have slower version on Kubricks Kube youtube channel, so I know it exists. Kubrick hid a code, many codes in fact, in the Shining and in Eyes Wide Shut especially. One of the links have been broken, but the slower version of Eyes Wide Shut is out there. Not link you need it to see the movie, but Kubrick was actually telling us to cut the movie half way through at a precise point and to play the movie twice, once starting at 0:00 and the other at 1:30:00 in the slower version which is 3 hours and 15 minutes and change. Ginsberg was talking about Pizzagate in Howl. Chagall, the murders are in Chagall and Picasso and Dali and Blake and others. YB Yeats. &quot;To the Rose upon the Rood of Time&quot;. The father time is Saturn or SATAN. The rose was always on Christ, is was his crown of thorns. They are killing people are a rite of passage into a covenant with SATAN. The rainbow. Here is the first of 5 pieces I put out on Kubrick couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ej5ht/i_saw_the_original_kubrick_eyes_wide_shut_with_an/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ej5ht/i_saw_the_original_kubrick_eyes_wide_shut_with_an/</a> This is not a divergence of your energy, you need to understand this to understand what is going on and why. Its a fertility cult associated with bees, Diana and Melissa, stemming from Knossos and the minoan civilization and even before in Sumerian times, stemming itself from the need to relate to sacrificial killings as related to the domestication and animal husbandry of animals which began perhaps 8000 to 10000 years ago. Its a black mass. The are practicing Christianity by killing Christ again and again and again. The rose was a symbol associated with those who had worn the &quot;rosy cross&quot;. Pizza is complex, but at its most fundamental symbolic level, it is the pepperoni which symbolizes &quot;the rose&quot;, and yet even with no pepperoni, it is made with flour &quot;flower&quot; from &quot;florence&quot;. Biljana\'s fleur de lis is florentine Di Medici. Kubrick identified DiMedici renaissance with this cannibalism. That\'s why Tom Cruise plays the doctor. Del Medico = the doctor. Everything goes back to Di Medici, and before that the Templars. Rosy Cross in its earliest incantation can be seen on the shields in the crusades, the red cross, that is the origin of pizza. Trust me, I know my shit. Follow along, you\'ll get it.</p>',

            thank you, I feel overwhelmed. I put out 10 hours of video. It demonstrates what I am saying better than words can. People need to see the images on a visceral level and relate to them. I probably should not have timelined for 20 minutes in first episode, but I am trying to do the best I can. The pizza is the rose of old. The pizza has literally opened up the rose.

            Whoa man, did you just accuse James Joyce of promoting cannibalism? I gotta say, I'm not really able to follow any of that, but that little bit caught my attention. "Ulysses" is a fine novel.

             I don't really see any cannibalism in "Ulysses" or "Eyes Wide Shut" for that matter, and most of this post is just nonsense... now relating the pizza to the "rosy cross" is an inspired bit of insanity there at the end though.

            You're getting buried because your posts are nigh impossible to read due to rant style language and insanely poor formatting. I literally don't want to read this even if it is good information just because it's a bigass block of text. If I had to make any suggestion to you it would be to get rid of the personal feelings parts of stuff and separate all of your ideas. Maybe make more than one post because there's about 3 different ideas in your block.
            <br/>
            I've reported the post anyways so that you maybe get motivated to think out how to more properly convey the message you're trying to get across.

              My only other criticisms are to try to make a synopsis of your information. You're (I know not purposefully) making your information hard to digest by ranting around it. Try not to make appeals to your reader begging them to believe you as well, this is a waste of your time and ours. If the information is good it will be received.
              <br/>
              For future videos as well come up with a script before hand and try to follow the suggestions I've made about your writing. Keep your visual helpers to as few things as possible and only use things that help you get your point across. Inundating people with information just makes them want to stop reading.
              <br/>
              edit: also look into these two things how to write a research paper and how to write a persuasive paper

            What you are saying exactly lines up with what I have been saying forever. Saturn = Satan = Chronos = Isis (Egyptian Goddess) = Moloch.

           <p>
            The Templars will take you back to Venice/Switzerland, which then takes you back to Rome, then to Phoenicia, and lastly back to Egypt. These guys trace their power lineage straight back to the brotherhood/priesthood of Amon Ra.

            Their current name/organization is the Vatican/Freemasons.

             OK. That is a good and confirming link to some occult stuff that I am talking about, however, the links I provided are the iceberg. He brings you to Egypt, which is a dead end of understanding all the entire culture around you. Through my works, the rosetta files, previously misunderstood works like Picasso, Chagall, American Beauty, the Departed are now understood through pizzagate, and they illuminate pizzagate... through the rose. This is the fucking iceberg my friends. Don't mind the shills, could get a little shillary around here.
