<p>True Pundit: &quot;<a href="https://archive.ph/XJDU7">Jeffrey Epstein’s Private Banker at Deutsche &amp; Citi Found Swinging From a Rope; Executive ‘Suicide’ Before FBI Questioned Him</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The first four stories note Bowers, who left Deutsch Bank in 2015, ran the division Trump\'s personal banker worked in, but make no mention of Epstein. Moore, who has claimed in the past to have sources within the FBI and NYPD, says he &quot;previously headed anti-money laundering for a major Citigroup division during the time frame Citi commenced large loans to Epstein.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bowers headed the private wealth banking division for Deutsche Bank and signed off on millions in loans to Epstein. Bowers, prior to taking over the private banking arm at Deutsche Bank, served in the same top position at Citibank, as the head of the bank’s private wealth arm. Citigroup also made massive loans to Epstein, according to records and banking sources who spoke to True Pundit...</p>
<p>“The loans to Epstein were personal and commercial,” Paine confirmed. “The Citi loans I can confirm were for more than $25 million. Some were secured, some were not.”</p>
<p>Did Citi bend its lending rules for Epstein? Paine said that appears “quite likely,” with Bowers and other Citi executives he later recruited to work for him at Deutsche all working to secure the approvals regardless of compliance-related red flags.</p>
<p>And sources said Citi loaned Epstein much more money, eclipsing $100 million and also allowed Epstein to use the bank to send thousands of wire transfers from his accounts. Bowers, who turned up dead just days ago, brokered the loans for Epstein, sources said.</p>
<p>Bowers was the chief of Deutsche Bank’s Private Wealth Management division and worked from the bank’s Park Avenue offices in New York City. At Citi, Bowers served as the chief of the The Citi Private Bank and previously ran Citigroup’s Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses.</p>
<p>And when Bowers left Citi for Deutsche Bank, Epstein followed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Epstein stopped making payments on his millions in outstanding Citi loans. But that mattered little because Bowers approved new high-risk loans and credit lines from Deutsche Bank, sources said.</p>
<p>And that relationship with Epstein continued until Bowers left Deutsche Bank in 2015.  By that time, Epstein had chalked up untold millions in loans with the help of Bowers who recruited many of his top private wealth top bankers from Citi to Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>The FBI who was interested in interviewing Bowers, sources confirm. The FBI subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in May for all loans and accounts linked to Epstein and there were many unanswered questions. Deutsche Bank closed out Epstein’s accounts weeks after the bank was served federal subpoenas.</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement officials said the FBI planned to interview all Wall Street wealth fund managers who worked for Epstein. Bowers included...</p>
<p>One banking executive said Bowers had visited Epstein on his private island at least once. Bowers had also visited Epstein in New York and attended social events at his mansion. Federal law enforcement sources did not comment about these new revelations. However, Citi executives who worked with Bowers said the bank executive maintained an active night life and enjoyed the party circuit.</p>
<p>Epstein also helped bring in a plethora of new business from wealthy associates to Bowers at both Deutsche Bank and Citi, sources said.</p>
<p>“Epstein made Bowers and his financial institutions hundreds of millions of dollars,” one executive said. “It really didn’t even matter that Epstein stiffed Citi for $30 million in defaults because he brought so much new money, new blood in. Citi made far more than it lost.”</p>
<p>Seems like a pattern. The <em>American Banker</em> reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Epstein brought lucrative clients into JPMorgan’s private-banking unit and was close to former head Jes Staley, who visited Epstein’s private island as recently as 2015. Leon Black, Apollo Global Management’s billionaire chairman, met with the financier from time to time at the company’s New York offices, and used Epstein for tax and philanthropic advice.</em></p>

            There were two other Deutsche Bank employees who committed suicide - I remember one case, it was someone who left a bunch of papers next to his body, his son went to the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Iirc, he was also involved with giving loans to Trump - does anyone recall his name - thanks.

            Meanwhile, I read the tweets  about 'Epstein' and 'Bowers', and to me, it looks as if Thomas Paine tries to deflect from the Bowers - Trump connection.

             You mean blackmailed Bowers because he laundered money for Epstein?
            </p>
            <p>
             According to what I read, Deutsche Bank loved Epstein because he brought them so much business -- way more than they had to write off as bad debt when he was arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             I look at it a different way. I think Epstein was working for Deutsche Bank. I think they've always been part of the Cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't forget, Epstein originally got his sweetheart deal from Acosta supposedly because he gave information about the 2009 financial crisis. If I'm remembering that right.

             Isn't it interesting that she did not look under any rocks to find and report on it? The woman who has made her career investigating Epstein. Now, why would that be? TP's story is all over Twitter if you search for "Bowers Epstein". All she had to do was confirm the lead herself with a few phone calls. But nope, all we get is her Cover-Your-Ass tweet.
            </p>
            <p>
             They keep trying to pin Epstein to Trump, and they keep failing. If you search Twitter for "Thomas Bowers" you will see hundreds of tweets and retweets -- not on the obvious theme of Clinton Kill List -- but on Trump Kill List, which has never even been a thing. Look at this one:

              She is currently busy writing a series for the Miami Herald about the abuse of prison inmates in Florida, so: no, not really imo.

              And since noone = no credible source has confirmed what Thomas Paine writes, she might be hesitant to push the story.

              Why would he be on the Clinton Kill List, and why couldn't there be a Trump Kill List? It seems highly likely *'-s  that Trump was involved in money laundering with Deutsche Bank, isn't.

              LOL. He is in Epstein's Black Book with 14 phone numbers, and Ivanka, Ivana and Melania with two each. Ivana used to socialize with sex trafficker and child rapist Ghislaine Maxwell.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was a friend of Epstein, and knew what Epstein was doing, and he kept his mouth shut until they fell apart over a real estate deal. Then he retaliated, as usual.

               Laundering money from what, exactly?  Unlike Epstein, Trump actually creates businesses and sells products. He could launder his own money, were he so inclined, simply by buying nice sheets and gold toilet seats for his hotels. And if this money laundering evidence exists why haven't they used it against him? Why are they dicking around with fake whistleblowers and phoney "impeachment inquiries"?  Why didn't they roll this stuff out in 2016, before he won? When have you ever heard, before now, any intimation that Trump murdered his enemies? Come on. I want to see some older articles on that.

            Black is in Epstein's Little Black Book iirc, but not in the flight manifsts. He's an old buddy of Trump, and was the only one who felt like giving a loan to Kushner some years ago. (Fun fact - he went with Trump to Moscow on Trump's first trip to Russia, there are pics).
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time, he was very close to Epstein and even employed him as a manager of his foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further proof that there isn't such a thing as a strict globalists-nationalists devide (and Trump donated to the Clinton Foundation anyway, and invited them to his third wedding.)
           </p>

            I wonder whether someone can corroborate Thomas Paine's claims, since he unfortunately is not a reliable source and has posted disinfo in the past.

            The anti-money laundering story is very funny. Deutsche Bank is infamous for their money laundering activities.

           <p>
            Imo the money laundering thing might be Trump's downfall one day.
