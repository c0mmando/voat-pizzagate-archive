              WARNING: Please be advised, everyone, that PayPal and the Silicon Valley cabal might just be doing many of these things in order to probe their networks to better profile their users for activism ratings. When you see them make such a blatant and arrogant move, wait a few days, and then reverse their actions, it may not be that they reassessed their actions, it might have been a deliberate operation to probe reactions. Did Twitter, Alphabet, and Facebook, just commission PayPal for a psy-op?

            This is Silicon Valley; they make the majority of their income collating, analyzing, and delivering data on their users, to government agencies and private companies. Ad revenue is secondary to this function. The only way to collect profiling data on your users, is to deliberately agitate them to provoke a response, so that you can record and study the responses of each user. Profiling requires an active Hegelian dialectic ... kind of like performing a mass psychological test on a large group of people without having to get each person onto the couch of a shrink.

            </strong>
            It's right in our faces. This particular program is actually the core program of the Tavistock Institute (Stanford Research Institute in the United States), and the CIA and U.K., Military Intelligence simply outsource their social engineering programs to these research organizations. Tavistock in Britain has been directly tied to Satanic/Thelemic pedophile rings.

             With the CIA and National Security Council firmly established, the first in a series of covert brain-washing programs was initiated by the Navy in the fall of 1947. Project CHATTER was developed in response to the Soviets successes through the use of truth drugs. This rationale, however was simply a cover story if the program were to be exposed. The research focused on the identification and testing of such drugs for use in interrogations and the recruitment of agents. The project was officially terminated in 1953.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA decided to expand their efforts in the area of behavior modification, with the advent of Project BLUEBIRD, approved by director Allen Dulles in 1950. Its objectives were to; (1) discover a means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorized extraction of information from them by known means, (2) investigate the possibility of control of an individual by application of special interrogation techniques, (3) investigate memory enhancement and (4) establish defensive means for preventing hostile control of agency personnel. In August 1951, Project BLUE BIRD was renamed Project ARTICHOKE, which evaluated offensive uses of interrogation techniques, including hypnosis and drugs The program ceased in 1956.  Three years prior to the halt of Project ARTICHOKE, Project MKULTRA came into existence on April 13, 1953 along the lines proposed by Richard Helms, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI) with the rationale of establishing a special funding mechanism of extreme sensitivity.

               The most advanced among the brutal practitioners of the new industrial psychology was Dr. John Rawlings Rees. Rees discovered that an unreal real could be created: the social group. An individual is made to transfer his or her identity to the group, wherein they become subjected to the most intense forms of suggestion. Provided the individual's inner sense of real identity is destroyed, he can be manipulated like a child.

               M. Minnicino in an article titled "Low Intensity Operations" explains: "A skilled group leader can use the group to create a powerful, albeit artificial, "family" environment. Once this environment is induced, a therapist can manipulate a member of the group, not by direct attack, but by subtly manipulating the other members of the group, for example through suggestion. If the victim has been sucked into thinking of the group as something helpful (motherly), then, when that environment has been manipulated to turn against him, it will tend to have the impact of deep motherly rejection."

            Now, just think about the recent election, with hoards of Twitter indoctrinated left-wing millennials crying and raging in the streets (still doing it now), because their social egregore, their
            <strong>
             <em>
              GROUP MOTHER SHILLARY,
             </em>

            created solely by the MSM, had been rejected by their group mind ... the group mind they thought they were part of, but were back-stabbed by that annoying little thing called Electoral College dynamics (lol). It was like a mass mind control malfunction, and a red light must have been flashing over at the Tavistock, with the elite panicking that their long invested in artificial bubble was about to pop!
           </p>
           <p>
            They had literally created a mother figure to represent the comatose social justice mentality of the weak hoards of Proles they were programming. This is why Twitter had to eject Milo, because he was upsetting the program, and he couldn't be categorized and ostracized as a
            <em>
             'right wing conservative',
            </em>
            because he is a non-racist homosexual. I guess you could call him an

            in their Matrix. This is also why Twitter has been vacillating about whether to ban Trump from Twitter, because he is using their platform, to destroy the mind control of their platform, which is super funny to watch.
           </p>

            What just happened to Seaman is simply part of what the Tavistock calls

            Where they condition the public to self censor, yes, but more importantly, they are studying the reactions by members of the social groups that they are creating and manipulating, in order to engineer more sophisticated stimuli for future operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            YouTube de-monetization, giving strikes to people, leaning on them using PayPal banning, is all these people have left to maintain their mind control empire, but they also use these as Tavistock psy-op$.

             Wow, thanks for this.  To make a mega impact, people would have to drop the social platforms, which just won't happen.   Maybe one day when people realize that social media is a trap, basically owned by the elites, they will start to look around, take a breath, start talking to one another face to face again and questioning what is happening in their world.

              I think the big solution is for people to diversify their platform usage away from the big boys. Once there is substantial competition, reform will occur from the inside in these corporations, because at the end of the day they all answer to the same boss - the Almighty Dollar.

             Thank you for a fucking awesome contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
             I encourage anyone here unfamiliar - (especially Leftists) to youtube Milo Yianopoulos (gay conservative) Reality Calls (Vegan conservative) and Blaire White (Transgender conservative).
            </p>
            <p>
             The Left has its head so up its arse at the moment that it cannot see the Humanist woods for the Politically Correct trees - and this actually means that the space it has deserted - that it now ascribes to the 'Alt Right' - is one where Right wing people are actually capable of having a better Humanist pedigree than Leftists. SJW's cherry-pick humanist aspirations and drive them with zealotry that does damage to other humanist aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Examples:  given the mass sexual assaults and islamic influence on marriage laws in northern europe, how can you be both pro-feminist and pro-migration simultaneously? You cant.
Why is emotional resilience not a valid humanist aspiration just as physical health is? So when you tell a SJW 'harden the fuck up' you are being a humanist
When the global elite tried to persuade middle class (or the formerly middle class) america to continue to trust Globalism - middle america smelled a rat and knew it would be the continued decimation of their local economies. Preventing further economic depravation is - you guessed it - a humanist aspiration
            </p>
            <p>
             This is what 2016 election MEANS, my friends. Not that 'America gave in to racism'. It means THE TORCH OF COMPASSION AND HUMANISM HAS PASSED TO THE RIGHT
            </p>
            <p>
             Best case in point: who, knowing what they know of the Clinton Foundation's activities, could possibly call themselves a Humanist while voting for Hillary?
THIS is why our victory is inevitable - if it takes until 21 january 2017 or 21 january 2117 - the protection of children is the absolute, ultimate Humanist aspiration

              Personally, I'm a Christian conservative, and I have qualms with social libertinism, but I understand the rights of others to choose freely their own associations, just like the Garden of Eden analogy; this is what Leftists don't understand. They have co-opted the word 'liberal' to identify with a selective Social Grouping, even though true libertarianism is in fact Individualistic, rather than Collectivist. They are authoritarians that have constructed an us-and-them mentality, and are using their faux-virtue construct, to shame conservatives or individualists, who create their own us-an-them mentalities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Us-and-them mentalities are vital to culture. They define cultural groupings, and allow groups to control their own development without governments forcing them to bend the minds of their children to artificial ideologies that are anti-human (like leftist psychoanalysis cults, or social utopian communes which attempt to deconstruct the Man+Woman+Child = healthy biological family unit). The left would have us all believe that ALL cultures and ideologies can be merged into one living space, whilst maintaining their own integrity, and not leading to conflict (reality check: Syria).
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know if 'Humanism' is collectivist or not, I guess it depends on the individuals own interpretation, but I will defend even a leftists right to practice 'freedom of association' ... this is why even Milo cannot agree with them, because he has stated that he fully respects the rights of others to--within their own social group--disagree with his lifestyle, and choose not to associate with him. He's like the antithesis of the gay-Mafia (rather entrenched in Hollywood and Silicon Valley), and they hate him for it, because he cannot be labelled; regardless of whether I agree with his lifestyle or not on health or moral grounds.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had a close relative who underwent 'gender reassignment surgery' (exacerbating a psychological problem, genital mutilation, and unhealthy promises of a life where he would be accepted as a woman). He still has a Y-Chromosome, and people will still see him in a marginalized light, because he is NOT a woman, and everyone knows, that he is a man. I have strong opinions on this, but what pisses me off with the 'liberal' left, is their intolerance of the concern of others, even like myself, whose own lives have been adversely affected by an unhealthy lie, being sold now to even very small children, whose parents are not allowed to even control what they are taught in preschool about 'gender'. Bringing up the fact that the suicide rate of transgender is many times the average, is somehow 'bigotted'??? How long before Medical Schools are banned from admitting that human sexes are biologically different, without having the Social Studies section of the Uni in revolt against the Human Biology sections? Its f'kn mad ... totally insane ... and their crying at Shillary losing, and wearing safety pins, is, well, f'kn insane, and scary, because deep down inside I know they have been brainwashed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Leftists are social engineers and control freaks, and Bluebird was just the moment in time that they decided to get industrial about it.

            Pretty sure the conspiracy behind this one is not on PayPal's part. It's the fact that because of David's speaking out about pizzagate he is being trolled and people are trying to break into his Paypal. of course also because they know he has money on it. When you try to enter your password too many times from a strange IP address your PayPal will get frozen until they hear from you and verify that it's you and try to straighten that out. in his recent video he had called the PayPal lady on camera and you could tell it was a password related issue. she kept mentioning the password. so they were helping him out by freezing the account so nobody could take the money until they heard from him. Now who was trying to break into his account is the real question.

             Interesting take on it. It could however be a smokescreen to protect them from litigation? Make it seem like they were trying to help him, whilst they actually triggered it at company level?

             It doesn't seem to me to be a very customer friendly service to freeze a persons account, because of such a hack trigger, without an automated email being sent to the user at least to notify them of what they need to do to regain access to functional service.

             Either way ... someone was screwing with him.

            Don't care about David Seaman. His videos on PG are poor, as someone all ready said; barely any new leads or content and rants about unrelated topics. I am not a fan of Zionists who cannot accept critique of Israel or the obvious connection to child abuse. Do your own research and see for yourselves. Titus frost and others have made much better content.

            A few minutes of woe is me. The next 15 min. of Bitcoin. No Pizzagate material. No leads. For days... Zionist sympathizer. Not saying he's a shill, just saying he may have run his course for Pizzagate.

             The Seaman narrative of late has been a few minutes of "PG is real, Podesta is a pedo", then 10 minutes of bitcoin and silver, and the rest of the time on pot legalization. Of late it's the "woe is me" tirade, again, he's a talking head and has not put forth anything to the research community to work with unlike Webb, who's got a wealth of information to share, tons of leads, resources for researchers, angles to take, people to watch, and salient points linking the whole thing beyond just PG.
            </p>
            <p>
             I followed Seaman early on, and whilst I can understand the problems he's facing with the erasing of his public record, I'm just a little disappointed that he's now falling back to the oft-left position of "woe is me".

                 His stated goal was $3000 a month. And I think that is to cover his living expenses (since YouTube is demonetizing his accounts) so it's not all that much. Remember this is what he does for a living. But I'd like to see him now stop posting about his own persecution and start posting some actual research.

             I think that's what I am going to do, I would do it right now, but I am at the office, so I'll have to get that info tonight, then try again tomorrow. Its going to be difficult to provide images showing the reason, because all image hosting sites are blocked here at my office. So providing a verifiable source for the information that I will provide will have to be trusted for what it is. Unfortunately.

            I have left comments on the other threads mentioning the freezing of his account. I work w/ Pay Pal Credit, and have access to some information, but I need his email to find his actual PayPal account, and I might be able to find out the reason why it was frozen.
