<p>What was Joe Capone posting on his fb page around the time Seth was murdered, and before he cleaned his page up after the Seth Rich murder blew up ?</p>
<p>It appears that Joe Capone has 3 daughters, Allie, Lacey and ?Maria, and one son, Michael.</p>
<p>From Allie Capone\'s fb page Joe Capone\'s page was found, which appears to have been set up by his daughter Lacey (see comment at the foot) - <a href="https://archive.fo/iehI8">https://archive.fo/iehI8</a></p>
<p>Joe is obviously, from his page, not a fb guy, which makes it strange that he posted so frequently in the week of SR\'s death and just afterwards. These posts must have had meaning to Joe.</p>
<p>Four days prior to SR, on July 5, 2016, Joe posted about the trip he made to the White House - &quot;White House trip today with kids&quot; - <a href="https://archive.fo/J5pXv">https://archive.fo/J5pXv</a>  &amp;  <a href="https://archive.fo/J5pXv">https://archive.fo/J5pXv</a></p>
<p>Afterwards on July 5th, he enjoyed a ball game with his family - <a href="https://archive.fo/fngij">https://archive.fo/fngij</a></p>
<p>The day after Seth died, on July 11, 2016, Joe was fishing with his son - <a href="https://archive.fo/1dc0A">https://archive.fo/1dc0A</a></p>
<p>This begs the question, what time did Joe learn of SR\'s death?  It seems that week he was very busy with his family. Was he even at the bar the previous evening at ?2 am?  Did he go fishing early in the am, or late in the day?  
</p>
<p>On July 12, 2016, Joe shared this link of Hillary making a speech in remembrance of Seth Rich - <a href="https://archive.fo/7UnWJ">https://archive.fo/7UnWJ</a></p>
<p>On the morning of July 13, 2016, Joe was heading to Regan National Airport in D.C. It\'s apparent that he doesn’t drive to the airport often. What got him leaving town? - <a href="https://archive.fo/jnE4m">https://archive.fo/jnE4m</a></p>
<p>On August 4, 2016, Joe posted this link about the D.C. Police investigation of SR\'s murder - <a href="https://archive.fo/LQfrr">https://archive.fo/LQfrr</a></p>

           It appears that Joe Capone has 3 daughters, Allie, Lacey and ?Maria, and one son, Michael.
