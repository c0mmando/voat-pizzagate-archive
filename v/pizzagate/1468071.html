            We cannot predict what Trump and his team will do. Many of us have hopes of course, but until he is in office, you cannot play God and know the future. Both of your posts sound arrogant.

            The FBI has told us through its twitter account that Trump has been an FBI asset for decades. FBIAnon said that Trump thinks the Clintons are disgusting animals and FBIAnon has a 100% track record so far. Trump has played 4D chess for years now. He has everything in hand, including Anthony Weiner's laptop.

            Remember the Al Smith dinner where Trump did a brief joking speech? I think he did a fuck you right to the child traffickers in plain sight there where he subtly implied about them taking a number of villages/kids. You can google for the transcript but he said: "Which is – everyone knows, of course, Hillary’s belief that it takes a village, which only makes sense after all in places like Haiti, where she’s taken a number of them."
           </p>
           <p>
            Would the establishment have gone so completely ape-shit bonkers over Trump if he was part of their Pedo club and could be easily controlled and blackmailed? There have been many political smear jobs before in US politics, but we've never seen the level of desperate apoplectic rage we've witnessed in the last year. These people weren't just fighting for 4-8 years of political influence, they seemed to be fighting for their lives (which are effectively over if Pizzagate is exposed).
           </p>
           <p>
            If Trump isn't a genuine outsider, it would be the greatest acting performance of all time from all involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does that mean he can go after Pizzagate and bring down the ring? I trust Trump at the moment about as much as any politician (not much, but a bit) but would the shadow government even let him do this? That's my big concern here: not Trump's motives.

            Some facts about Trump:
Flew on jeffrey epstein plane to visit his island. 
Publicly defended epstein even though he knew he liked very young girls.
           </p>
           <p>

            Why would he expose the whole world to the corrupt politicians/media and then just ignore the problems when he gets into power? He will then lose all his trust, the left(the establishment) already hates him and so does the majority of hillary voters. If he turns out to be a mix of "George bush and Mussolini" the alt-right movement and the right will be disgusted by him. If he doesnt live up to what he is saying he will be hanged by the people and another pedophile will take his place.

            I said this in another thread and got called a shill. Trump has already shown he will lie (lock her up/ special prosecutor) to get what he wants. If pizzagate goes to the top elite there is no way Trump isn't in it with them anyway. He doesn't care about us.

             I wonder if its possible that he is only downplaying the "lock her up" out of pure strategy. I mean think about it. If he keeps saying lock her up, Obama will definitely pardon her. And that's the worst outcome you could hope for.

              He has already said he would not pursue it any further. That isn't downplaying that's going back on a promise he made. This wasn't going to happen until Trump was in office so Obama has nothing to do with it.

               OK. Then answer this. If you were Trump's advisor right now, how would you suggest that he prevent Obama from pardoning her?
I don't think there is any good answer for this, so I'm looking forward to your response to this.
Plus, I'll add a recent story that shows Trump clearly using strategy:
Everyone knows that Trump was meeting with Mitt Romney. Then suddenly, Kellyanne Conway starts saying that Trump's supporters feel betrayed. Now people are saying that Kellyanne has "gone rogue" and is only looking out for herself. And Trump told journalists that he's mad at her for speaking out. Then it comes out that Trump set the whole thing up. It was all part of his strategy.
Now based on this, I believe that he could just as easily, tell the media that he doesn't want Clinton investigated, and then privately tell his attorney general to go after her. The AG will then "go rogue".

                Seeing as how the FBI said they stand by their finding that found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and there would be no prosecution there is nothing for Obama to pardon her for. So without Trump's "special prosecutor" it's over , she's home free.

                 No. That's actually not what happened. What happened was that James Comey broke typical FBI protocol in a manner that is unprecedented in the FBI, to make an announcement that even though Hillary did break the law, he decided that it would be too difficult to prove intent in court. (Even though proving it in court is NOT his job or his responsibility to comment on)
And he did this after facing enormous pressure from the DOJ to squash the case.
And this was actually the smaller case against Clinton. There is still a larger investigation against the Clinton Foundation that supposedly has much better evidence. That case is not closed. The only thing holding the FBI back is the White house and the Department of (In)Justice
