            In all the articles on Seth, it says that he had accepted a job to work with Hillary's  presidential campaign. I always questioned that, and after seeing the vid....https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1921322, I ask myself where it came from. Seth would not have accepted if he indeed was offered a job. Is this some BS that was passed to Seth's parents?  Brazile?  Wasserman?

            ok let me relay two things I know
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I had a friend 20 years ago who in a state of depression shot himself in the chest.  A second friend of mine found him and called an ambulance.  Captain (thats what we called him because he was such an avid fisherman) immediately regretted shooting himself and he was awake and talking when the ambulance took him away.  He later died by the time they got tot the hospital. So people can seem somewhat stable and be talkative and die a few hours later
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             I know also from accounts of first responders that they can't declare someone dead.  That usually someone is transported to the hospital before the declaration of death by a doctor.  Or in the case of a murder, a medical examiner has to come out and declare the time of death.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            .  
Seth Rich very well could have been alive and talking and died at the hospital later just from the original wounds.  Then again he could have stabilized and then someone was sent in to finish him off.  I mean he already had gun shot wounds.  If he died from an injection to stop his heart, would anyone even be suspicious or catch  it?  Anyway, Im just saying the crudest form of murder (pillow over the head or injection of a drug)  might be missed on a gun shot victim.

              yeah I fixed it.  I think I just conflated Marc Rich with Seth Rich because I had been looking into Bill Clinton pardoning Marc Rich and James Comey being the prosecuting attorney that decided not to pursue Bill Clinton for pay for play pardon

            Thank you for posting this over here too.  This is such an eye opening article!  There is so much proof that they are lying or hiding evidence.  They refuse to give answers and are protecting those that are responsible for his attempted murder on the corner and his final killing later. I believe when they came to pick him up they discovered he was still alive and decided to take him to MedStar  where they took his organs. I believe MedStar is also one of the hospitals that is used by the Organ Harvesters.  There are many of these set ups as we all know across the country.  I believe the hospital was chosen for these operations because of the trauma center and other useful conditions. Why would you take a Priority 1 patient to a non trauma center when one was so close.  To me this just seems like a no brainer.

             Medstar has a trauma center.. he was likely taken there.

              Yes that is what I said.  Sorry if that is not clear.  I am convinced it was MedStar.  They are trying to make a mystery out of this when it is a no brainer.  Why not take a Priority 1 patient to a trauma center.  He said a little more than 6 min?  I am not a driver but I have a brain.  It would take only about half that time to go 3 blocks at that time of the morning.  With an alarm blaring and going faster than other cars (which there were little to none).  They are not fooling the researchers on here, no siree.

            SR was either:
           </p>
           <p>
            1- Killed in the hospital he was transported to.
           </p>

            OR
           </p>
           <p>
            2-Transported from that hospital somewhere else, and from there:
           </p>
           <p>
            2a - He was transported outside the US or is in a witness protection program
           </p>
           <p>
            OR
           </p>
           <p>
            2b - He was Tortured and killed to get more info out of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            To find out what really happened to him in the hospital is not going to be easy, because due to HIPPA privacy laws and security systems, any Hospital worker trying to look into his record, without good reason, will be automatically flagged and fired on the spot., or worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chances are, his records have been already purged out of the hospital system.

           <p>
            Whatever info we get from now on, is going to be plagued with conjecture and doubt.. unless an insider decides to blow the whistle.

             Did you see the post from the anon ER nurse who claimed to be on duty that night?  The nurse (supposedly) helped with his surgery, after which the doctors considered him stable enough to wait for a second surgery in the morning, then the nurse ended their shift.  When the nurse came back in the next day, his room was swarmed with agents.
            </p>
            <p>
             If this account was factual, then ask yourself why do you swarm a room in agents just to kill a guy in his bed?  You don't.  One good operative is all it takes for that.  Whoever the agents were, they were interested in him for some reason.  When you think it through, this means that those agents must have represented an entirely different group than the people who wanted him shot in the streets.  I think they must have already had him on their radar anyway to get to him so fast in the hospital.

              Yes i did see it.
It wasn't a nurse, it was an ER doctor doing his rotation.

             </p>
             <p>
              This is why i included the possibility that the guy was isolated and transported to another location, to be healed and enrolled in a witness protection program or to be tortured to get info out of him.
             </p>
             <p>
              BUT, how do we know the ER doctor story is true?
             </p>
             <p>
              how do we know it wasn't planted to make us believe SR wasn't killed and he is still alive?
             </p>
             <p>
              We don't, so this is why all possibilities have to be considered.
