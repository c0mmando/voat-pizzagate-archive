<p>As many of you may know, Lawrence E. King, alleged high-powered child trafficker and abuser from “Franklin Scandal” infamy, was allegedly (or may still be?) employed as some kind of executive assistant at the Rolls Royce Dealership in Sterling, VA, owned by entrepreneur Thomas Moorehead. Here and here are two previous posts a Voat user did digging up current whereabouts on Larry King. <strong>Worth pointing out that Sterling, VA is a DC suburb only about a half hour drive from CIA HQ in Langley, VA</strong>.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, if you dig into the background of Larry King’s boss, Thomas Moorehead, you will quickly find that back in the 80s he went through General Motor’s extremely selective dealership training program, which trains new dealership owners. In 1987, Moorehead opened his first car dealership, selling Buicks, in of all places (you guessed it)…. <strong>Omaha, Nebraska</strong>. Omaha is of course the epicenter of the Franklin Scandal child abuse allegations. By all accounts, Moorehead was an extremely successful car dealer, rapidly opening more dealerships after his initial one in Omaha. In 2002, he moved to Virginia to open a new BMW dealership in Sterling VA and went on to open a Rolls Royce Dealership right across the street. (<a href="http://washingtonlife.com/2015/12/08/profile-thomas-moorehead/">Link</a> to Moorehead’s profile in “Washington Life” Magazine)</p>
<p>According to the Washington Life article, Moorehead is very very concerned about providing the utmost customer service to his wealthy clients at his Rolls Royce dealership in Sterling. Apparently, he will even send “…homemade coffee cakes to clients whenever the dealership makes even a minor error.” </p>
<p><strong>Using basic common sense, if a guy like Thomas Moorehead is so obsessed with “customer service” that he is baking coffee cakes in response to minor customer errors, does anyone really think he would ever hire someone at his dealership without performing the most thorough background check possible?</strong> Seeing all the horrible info about Lawrence E King that is out there on the internet without even needing to pay for a background check, obviously there is much more at play then meets the eye. In a radio interview, Franklin Scandal author Nick Bryant said that Larry King had gotten a “no-show job” at a car dealership in Virginia, and that clearly King was keeping his mouth shut and being rewarded for it. </p>
<p><strong>Doug Valentine and The Phoenix Program</strong></p>
<p>As bizarre as it is to see Larry King working at some random auto dealership in the DC suburbs, it made a lot more sense to me when I read author Doug Valentine’s 2017 book, “The CIA as Organized Crime: How Illegal Operations Corrupt America and the World.” Doug Valentine is a long-time researcher of the CIA, he is best known for his book “The Phoenix Program,” where he really exposed the Phoenix Program, a CIA-run assassination program during the Vietnam War that specifically targeted and sowed terror amongst the civilian population. </p>
<p>As Valentine documents, through the Phoenix Program the CIA operated torture centers all over South Vietnam, and assassination teams of Vietnamese mercenaries (many of them hardcore criminals) led by CIA paramilitary officers, were unleashed on the civilian population to wreak havok. Mass slaughter of civilians was commonplace, and apparently, some of these CIA kill teams were so depraved, members would actually “devour their enemies’ vital organs” after killing them. </p>
<p><strong>Very much worth pointing out that a 1973 article in the Omaha Sun says that Larry King served as an Air Force “Information Specialist” in Thailand during the Vietnam war, and that he handled “top secret” military communications (from Nick Bryant’s “Franklin Scandal”)</strong>.  Considering this shadowy military intelligence background, definitely have to seriously wonder what, if any, connection Larry King may have had with the Phoenix Program. Also worth pointing out that David McGowan, in his book “Programmed to Kill,” speculated that the Phoenix Program, with all of its organized brutality, could have been an MKULTRA-spawned “breeding pool” of sorts for the “supposedly” random serial killers that began popping up in America in the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>Getting back to Doug Valentine: In the 1980s, Valentine was in the process of writing “The Phoenix Program,” and he had managed to establish contacts with a number of “former” CIA officers who were leaking him bits of info about the Phoenix Program.  Apparently, the reason Valentine was able to get a “foot in the door” to talk to some of these CIA men was because of a book he had written about his father’s experiences in World War 2, called “The Hotel Tacloban” (I highly recommend it). Valentine’s father was a US military veteran who was captured by the Japanese and held in a POW camp in the Philippines during the war, that held mostly Australian enlisted men and British officers. He was part of a full-on mutiny by enlisted men in the POW camp, after the Australian enlisted men found out a British officer in the camp ratted out two attempted escapees who were then publicly executed by the Japanese prison guards in the camp (beheaded on Christmas day). In response, there was a riot in the camp and the British officer was murdered by the enlisted men. After the POW camp was freed at the end of the war, Valentine’s father’s military records were altered, and he was ordered never to speak of the mutiny, under pain of being court marshalled and shot (hell of a story to say the least). </p>
<p>In the 1980s, Valentine sent a copy of “The Hotel Tacloban” to William Colby, then-Director of the CIA. Apparently, Colby was impressed by the book and what his father went through during the war and granted Doug Valentine an interview. Colby himself was a WW2 veteran, he served as an OSS Paratrooper (OSS was the predecessor to the CIA). He himself was also a major architect of the Phoenix Program during the Vietnam War. For whatever reason, Colby was willing to divulge some info about the Phoenix Program to Valentine, and other CIA agents followed suit, divulging info about some other aspects of CIA operations. <strong>Worth pointing out that there is speculation that William Colby, who officially drowned in a “canoeing” accident, may have been working to expose, or at least trying to put to an end, CIA abuse of children, and that he was killed because of it.</strong></p>',
