            Try Occams Razor. They don't exist. Case solved.

           <p>
            Your scenario involves kidnapping hundreds of wounded people and their families. Where is the video selfies from all the wounded victims? It does not exist because the whole thing is bullshit. This is a simple story. Its a hoax.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there are hundreds of kidnapped wounded people. Include their families and you are talking about thousands of people who had to be drug from their homes in that one night and it didn't happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Use common sense.

            is a very plausible explanation from an anon on 8chan. I'm not saying it's true but it's certainly plausible and does explain practically every strange thing about the incident in one go.

            It's beyond bizarre. The removing of Paddock's brain ... the faked photos of Campos off the
            <a href="http://spfpa.org">
             http://spfpa.org
            </a>
            website ... and that call. Evidently, it's reporting Campos being shot and yet we hear a woman saying, "Be safe Steve." WTF is she? Then the caller clearly says the 32nd floor and yet securty is sent to the 31st floor. It shows that in the transcript.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every single thing in there is weird, but we don't know the complete agenda. I also read about Campos renting houses in the area and not staying in them? The Airbnb account has been scrubbed.
