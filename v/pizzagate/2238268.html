<h1>UPDATE: Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW</h1>
<p>Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.</p>
<p>Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.</p>
<p>One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”</p>
<p>“Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”</p>

<p>UPDATE: </p>
<p>I posted in another thread about a woman who was allegedly being approached and bribed to report a FAKE story about Roy Moore!!! Well, it seems that story appears to have grown legs!!! Yup, the woman is going public about it and has a PHOTO of the reporter name BETH who offered the bribe AND a recording! This would be HUGE if true!!!! </p>
<p>I sniff charges in the air against the accusers and this reporter named BETH!!!! </p>

            Proves that pizzagate investigators are not too overboard in a witch hunt to attack everyone that has claims made against them, even if they are a politician. I was suspicious at the timing, right before he was going to win. McCain spouting off was a second clue that something was not right. Then no actual sex was involved, because that could lead to a court case, and no false accuser wants to go through that scrutiny.

             This. Excellent point.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other way this MAJORLY deviates from the PedoWood allegations is that Moore acted appropriately with three of the accusers. There's not even a story there. He hugged and twice kissed a seventeen-year-old after going out with her for three months after receiving permission from the mother? But then there's one glaringly pedo accusation. It's the fourteen-year-old that this all hinges on. Moore is swearing up and down that his investigative team has found collusion. Then there's the woman who was bribed by "BETH" to make a false accusation for $$$$.

             Michelle could be one of those rare people who have both sexes. That might be up Barry's lane too, and then she/he would not exactly be a tranny. That still does not take away from the fact that this is most likely a compete fabrication on the part of Moore's detractors.

             Then why re you asking a question? Go do your own fucking research if you don't trust sources. I'm posting a legitimate link that backs up the allegation. It's been tweeted and picked up by other conservative sites. Why not go and ask WaPo if it's true?

            <p>
             Asked if he remembers dating teenage women when he was older than 30, Moore said, "Not generally, no."   "I don't remember dating any girl without the permission of her mother," he said. He later pointed to The Post's story and said, "These two young girls actually said their mothers encouraged them to be friends with me."  After a commercial break, Moore became more forceful in his denials of dating teenagers. He said doing so "would be out of my customary behavior" and that he "never" would have dated a teen without her mother's permission.

            Sounding as weasily as Bill Clinton's "depends on what the meaning of the word is is".  By his admission he dated teenagers when he was 30 which wasn't unusual or prohibited.  He probably went a bit too far with at least one which frankly happens with a lot of dating and I don't think qualifies as pedophilia in this case.  It may be that Moore's attempts to deny will do more harm than the accusations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Per Alabama law this gets confusing as to whether it will benefits Dems or Repubs.  Reading this I no longer suspect this is a ploy by Roy Moore.  I think this case is just what it appears to be, young women who felt an older man took a bit of advantage of them are tired of him acting like he is some big moral crusader.  They didn't know Alabama election law and came forward too late to get him to legally step down.  If done by political operatives they really didn't do their homework.  A few months earlier and Luther Strange would have been on the ticket.  Now its a total mess.  So either political operatives are slipping or this is just what the women say it is.  But I think this whole thing doesn't belong on the Pizzagate thread as it doesn't represent a case of true pedophilia, just an acknowledgement that Christians in the deep south at the time didn't have a big problem with teenagers dating older men.

             He's trying to be honest. Maybe you're used to the firm lie that the Clintons made famous. "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."

            <p>
             Funny, were you outraged when thirty-nine-year-old Jerry Seinfeld hit on the seventeen-year-old high schooler Shoshanna Gruss? I'm guessing you didn't bat an eye nor did you fake moral outrage. Here's the brunt of what this "seventeen-year-old" Deborah Gibson said about the relationship:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.redstate.com/sarah-rumpf/2017/11/11/tone-deaf-attempt-discrediting-one-roy-moores-accusers/">
               https://www.redstate.com/sarah-rumpf/2017/11/11/tone-deaf-attempt-discrediting-one-roy-moores-accusers/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Gibson told the Washington Post that she dated Moore when she was 17 and he was a 34-year-old assistant district attorney in Etowah County who came and spoke at her high school civics class, and then asked her out on a date. Gibson says that they dated for two or three months, never progressing beyond kissing.
             </p>
             <p>
              While she admits that at the time she was thrilled to be dating the “hometown boy made good,” she now views their relationship as inappropriate.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And this article doesn't mention how many times they kissed. Twice. That's what this little douchebag states. We're after sexual predators here!!!! Not someone that clearly wasn't grooming a young girl for inappropriate sexual activity! Kissing after three months doesn't even deserve a mention since nothing is illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
             And you definitely are a shill. Jerry Seinfeld is not a Christian, but you get paid to be idiot which comes quite naturally. So to dump dating young girls on Christians is ridiculous. What about David Cross and the brain dead zombie Amber Tamblyn who's obsessed with suicide?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-james-woods-armie-hammer-underage-amber-1505230735-htmlstory.html">
               http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-james-woods-armie-hammer-underage-amber-1505230735-htmlstory.html
              </a>
              Tamblyn and the 53-year-old Cross are, of course, conscious of their own age difference. At a comedy show in 2012, they shared how they met in 2007 on an airplane, and made fun of the 19 years that separate them.
             </p>
             <p>
              “I was slow to make any moves because of our age difference, and also because she was a fan [of 'Arrested Development,']” Cross said, according to the Huffington Post.
             </p>
             <p>
              “If anyone’s wondering, I’m 14!," joked Tamblyn, who was in her mid-20s when they first perused the SkyMall catalog together. She and Cross got married in 2012 and have a daughter together.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Yup! There she is! Making fun of being only 14!!!! Did she used to dress up in diapers for this pig that she married?
            </p>
            <p>
             The point here is whether the women accusing Roy Moore are credible. Gibson is a fucking idiot who only realized dating a man that she was thrilled to date, and a man who didn't take advantage of her, was a mistake after the brainwashing. Further, what are the chances that both these women work for The Clintons of The Kenyan family? And since you're so wise (NOT), why don't you explain  to me how a woman with a penis and nutsack that swings in the breeze can give birth to two children?

             But Alabama law prohibits a candidate from withdrawing within 76 days before the election. The runoff between Moore, who beat incumbent Luther Strange in the Republican primary, and Democrat Doug Jones is scheduled for December 12. And Moore’s name will be on the ballot.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So any campaign to dislodge Moore should have come a bit sooner eh?  Bad planning?  Or proof that this was actually a woman who finally got sick enough of seeing Moore acting so holier than thou and decided to come forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alabama is a strange state legally with a constitution like no other.  " 2 times longer than the average state constitution, 44 times longer than the U.S. Constitution, and is the longest[2] and most amended[3] constitution still operative anywhere in the world. The English version of the Constitution of India, the longest national constitution, is about 117,369 words long, a third of the length of Alabama's."
           </p>
           <p>
            So one can suspect that getting someone elected other than Roy Moore will be no easy matter.

            The options presented in this article muddy the waters as to whether Republicans or Dems might be behind it.  Which makes me wonder if the timing is actually something Roy Moore pulled off to get his name in the news.  He can't be forced off the ballot and if he does remove himself from the race its not clear whether the Republicans or Democrats could salvage for their party.  His supporters apparently from the comments on this site would easily forgive him for something that they wouldn't forgive others.  He has a long history of pulling stunts to get his name in the news and this whole thing may be another carefully timed stunt by Mr. Moore himself.  But most likely it is just a woman tired of seeing his face in the news when she knows what he did to her.

            Hi,  Gateway Pushes fake shit all the time. During the Ferguson protests, they took a medical photo, cropped off the information identifying the photo and tried to push it as the actual x-ray of police officer Darren Wilson showing he had a broken eye socket.   We then saw Darren Wilson's photo the day of the event and, of course, he had zero broken bones and Gateway Pundit was lying.

            Have you also noticed that all the Republicans that are speaking out against him and ask him to pull out are ones that are ones that are on our pedo list?  Edit:  I think this is an orchestrated operation by the Pedo Cabal to get rid of this guy.  Evidently he can't be blackmailed.

              Exactly.  Either way, I think they have tried to take advantage of his past, hoping it will grab just enough votes to make a difference.  This is how Hillary works.

              Yeah, well even if he is guilty of creating his own crazy publicity, that is the perfect way for them to take the reins and run with this cockamamy story.  I wonder how many more ladies they will bring forth.  I think this story is about as far as it will go.  At this point you either believe him or not. If they come out with too many it will really look even more made up.  I am surprised Trump is asking him to pull out.

              As the article I linked to above points out, if he steps out he stays on the ballot and the Democrat wins as his votes aren't counted.  It seems like the Republicans would rather have a Republican than a Democrat in regardless of who it is so they can retain control of the Senate.  If he steps out and a write in campaign for Luther Strange is worked up, the polls are still so close that a Dem might get in.  So it is hard to see how this works for the Republicans.  OTOH it is a risky campaign for the Dems too as Strange polled almost as well as Moore in the primaries so a write in might work.  All this would have gone more smoothly for either party if it was done earlier so that Moore could legally be removed from the ballot.  So either all the Republican or Democratic operatives are ignorant fools, or Moore himself did it (he has previously shown a liking for being in the limelight regardless of consequences and thus got removed from the supreme court twice) or this is just a woman, ignorant of the law, finally speaking up.
