<p>Let\'s look @ the Co.</p>
<p>1999 Winamax.com LTD is founded by former executives of Havas Interactive .</p>
<p>Havas= Vivendi</p>
<p><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi">https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi</a></p>
<p>Edgar Bronfman Jr., became chief of the new company, Vivendi Universal, but the Seagram company effectively lost control of its entertainment businesses. </p>
<p>In December 2001, Bronfman announced he was stepping down from an executive capacity at Vivendi Universal, but remaining as vice chair of the board.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Jr">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Jr</a>.</p>
<p>Now to how Winamax was set up </p>
<p><a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03877821/filing-history?page=4">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03877821/filing-history?page=4</a></p>
<p>I havent gone through all the papers, PDF that have to be downloaded are pains </p>
<p>But 2 entities set it up in 1999</p>
<p>A1 Company and Temple Secretaries Limited</p>
<p>Let\'s look into them</p>
<p>It is first necessary to determine an outer shell, our first Russian doll that serves as a lynchpin holding tight the gordian knot of subterfuge. When entered into a internet search engine, ‘2 Woodberry Grove’ directs hits to a company called A1 Company Services, registered by Mrs Barbara Kahan in April 2003.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Winamax was set up in 1999, hmmmm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Temple was at same address as A1 and representing them was Keith Kahan</p>
<p>Finish it off with a witness signature of Anna Kahan, hmmmm</p>
<p>Incorporation documents revealed that 788–790 Finchley Road was, in 2003, the registered premises of the long-term acting company secretary for A1 Company Services, Temple Secretaries Limited. Barbara and Keith Kahan were listed as company directors. Until its recent acquisition, the entire share capital of A1 CompanyServices was held by an offshore entity called Tripodia Ltd, registered to a P.O. Box at the address of the Trident Trust Company (BVI) Ltd in the British Virgin Islands. </p>

            You guys do great work. The only reason I took French was to communicate with the totally American Cajuns,(coon asses), so it helps now to not really need search engine to translate much. Who helped out the drowning idiots in New Orleans? The Cajun Navy and the Amish. Them's the facts.Lots of stuff making fun of the Amish, but no one wants to do that with the Cajun Navy. Reason why, is they are too closely knit as a community.Been there for 400 years or so.

             This is excellent.  Will have to follow up later.  I was following some leads re Comet Trust on Twitter which took me to a number of tech companies.  Remember Google went into the Christ Church School in Hampstead to do a project?  That was never fully explained  just what they were doing there.  That's one massive rabbit hole in itself.  Right, I have to stop posting and go start that diagram.

            Who we are ?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Prime is an art agency based in Paris. Dancers and stage artists, we found ourselves around a common desire to make you discover our passion for dance and night artists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our wish is to help you find talented artists, but also to introduce you to the origins and history of the various styles of dance.
           </p>
           <p>
            So we came together to create a vast network of over 2000 artists and professionals. To allow you to stand out and surprise your guests, we are always looking for new trends and ensure the originality of the show.

            So..........Nicole Junkermann actually connects to Edgar Bronfman Jr. The brother of Sara Bronfman, who has been all over the news due to NXIVM and Keith Raniere? That alone is notable and interesting.

            Great work. I look forward to the next part.

              If you run into anything about business between Junkermann and companies she has a hand in, it likely will tie into the crazy patents Raniere had.
             </p>
             <p>
              His patents, many would be very useful not only to cult systems but community policing tactics.
             </p>
             <p>
              Owning a satelite company that allows for third person apps, such as Junkermann does, would also allow systems of hers, Carbyne to be weaponized and tailored against single individuals

               I call that targeting, which has now been around for years. Anyone that could potentially expose the bad guys, they hire a service(like Black Cube, which Weinstein hired) and they have specialists that follow a target, let the target know that they are being followed, break in any resident they are living in or hiding out in,  spread false rumors and cripple the target financially. Then after all this, accuse the target of being paranoid or a schizophrenic and presto....the smear is i n place

                Yup. Cointel pro, silent dagger, organized stalking, gang stalking, community policing.............all the same stuff.
               </p>
               <p>
                I know the Infragard and fusion centers are part of the FBI doing it to people, but anyone with time and money can stage the stuff. It only takes a handful of knowing perps to destroy a life. Perps know how to seed minds and outsource flash mobs to crowd-sourcing agencies. Street theater is easy to find a useful idiot to do as well. Knowing a handful of criminals isn't outside of most peoples lives, if they took time to watch around themselves, so again, yup I agree fully with you. Pettiness and trying to not hold oneself accountable to karma are just two reasons it's done to someones life.

               Correct.  I was going to do a post about that and decided just to get on with a damn flow chart about how all this connects.

               Yep. The 911 app created by Carbyne is very similar to the app Erik Prince created for the Chinese government for monitoring the Uighurs, the Muslim minority.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Let's not forget that Carbyne seems to be a Mossad front company.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               So basically, all data collected about a US citizen who uses the 911 app might will end up in the Mossad data collection.
              </p>
              <p>
               The two apps and the Mossad connection are explained in this video:

                Then all over the media people in congress saying we have to pass the bill to know whats in the bill.And many in the media kept chanting the same mantra, "the devil's in the details". They was overtly weaving Hollyweird magic into minds of the people. Casting "spells" so to speak and most involved were useful idiots.

                   With all of this type of info and trying to "waken" people, it's damn near futile and even detrimental to try mentioning magic unless you know enough psychology to explain the intended purpose of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I began learning what philosophies our world leaders follow, many decades ago. Moloch is a reach in the dark and it took me into various forms of magic and crap and I took to learning all the sciences behind "magic". From psychology to magnetism to harmonics, etc, etc, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I know others believe things I may not and I can not ignore that fact, even if it contradicts my own ideology.
