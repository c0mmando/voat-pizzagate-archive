            well well looks like the String puullers are gaining ground on pizzagate narrative. When you have the users of a forum with the most Pizzagate info on the web bitching about shiate like this well....way to go. Thing is the people who are truly trying to expose and then end this ancient cult WILL NOT be fed anymore shit from world leaders. Those types are actually doing shit in their day to day lives to change this world . Yes posting all day on the web about the Cult is a start....but the most important part of exposing and learning about the way this world is being ran by a Dark Cult is talking to Humans FACE to FACE

            My thinking is that all this is a red herring and something else far more nefarious is going on, like installing the capability to black out every single phone in the U.S. if they want to. With this system you CANNOT OPT OUT which means they could possibly turn it on, leave it on, and keep your phone jammed as long as they please. They might even be able to do it selectively to any single person they desire. I feel pretty sure this is all about giving the government a universal way to intercept, interrupt, all phones at anytime for any reason. Microphones and cameras can already be activated on the sneak and maybe this makes a process like that a streamline universal system or something?

            So far the Voat posting community, most people anyway, have been polite enough not to trash up this sub and make it meaningless, even though you

            </a>
            are totally prepared to let it happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            That says a lot of good things about the Voat posting community. What it says about you

            is that you are not very bright and possibly you should consider retiring. I don't know what your motives are but your ass fell out on the floor in this thread. Disgraceful.

             behaviorism at its finest. Train the cult member to expect some type of prophecy fulfillment and eventual reward for their faithfulness. 
once you know that you have obedience through behavioral manipulation you can pretty much do anything without being questioned. I was looking for the disorientation techniques of MK Ultra that I read a few days ago when I realized I was speaking about Satanic cult indoctrination. The sad thing is that some people promoting Q have a history of Satanist activities that people aren't totally aware of.

              Eric's behavior is pitiful and I don't know why its allowed. Vindicator's willingness to dilute the sub with Q is perplexing or maybe its not depending on why he does it. think- is the only mod left with sound judgement and I agree with you on that. Trump's history speaks for itself. The Rothschilds bailed him out of bankruptcy. Soros is invested in Trump Tower. Sheldon Adelson bankrolled his campaign. He gave Jerusalem to the Talmud child molesters.

              He is gung ho to attack Iran. He just passed a law that opens up the taxpayers to give Israel unlimited funds for their wars. His son in law Jared Kushner comes from a Zionist crime family and is affiliated with Chabad. His buddy Jeffrey Epstein. He already praised HIllary and said "she has had enough" and that he won't be putting her in jail. The list is endless. But "muh Qanon." Pitiful

               Eric needs to go. His constant attacks towards users shouldn't be tolerated. But it's crazy because I've never actually seen a mod step in and stand up for a user that's being berated by a mod. It really makes it seem like the mods don't care about the users, and that is definitely going to (and probably already has) push people away. Vindicator, at a minimum, needs to sharpen up his critical thinking skills. A lot.

               Q is a Trump psyop. That's why you see Q promoting Trump ideals and why Trump confirms Q in his speeches, tweets, whatever. Qtards think that confirms his legitimacy when in reality, the only thing it confirms is his link to Trump. It doesn't disprove the idea that Q is a Trump psyop.

                I've not yet seen a legitimate user, or one that doesn't deserve to be attacked, treated unfairly.  Nobody seems to want to ping me to the instances of it happening, so all I have to go on are the words of usernames I know to either be sockpuppets of known subversives and trolls, and JIDF

                  Maybe if you weren't full of shit, you wouldn't be treated like shit?  Try acting like a legitimate user, though I know that's impossible for you.

                     And crensch chases off about four or five more long time members of this sub in one day. The membership of this sub has almost totally turned over compared to a year ago. Very few of the original investigators/members are still here. YOU are largely responsible for that. Welcome to failure. Over the last year you chased away the best investigators/researchers thsi sub had. With this latest tyrade of yours you have chased away another three or four members that have been here for over a year. Congratulations crensch. Every SINGLE TIME you get involved good people leave.

                Q is a deep state psy op for sure. Where Trump stands on it is the only question left in my mind. Everyone who publicly promotes Q on their channels needs to disavow. It's game over.

            This post saddens me. We’re supposed to fight elite pedophilia, but then a post like this comes along telling the whole world that we’re mere delusional morons. These kinds of posts do us a great disservice. I’m confused as to why they aren’t flaired and deleted.

             It's because they thought it was going to be a huge announcement from the President. When it wasn't they searched for other reasons. You can't break someone out of a trance by showing them they're wrong if they're still in a trance. Only the hypnotists's voice will awaken them.

              This post saddens me. We’re supposed to fight elite pedophilia, but then a post like this comes along telling the whole world that we’re mere delusional morons. These kinds of posts do us a great disservice. I’m confused as to why they aren’t flaired and deleted.

             Thanx for having the guts to speak up in spite of our lead mod. Trust me you are not the only one. My PM box is FULL of people thanking me for speaking up and trying to protect this sub and keep it pure. I wish to hell I could just sit here and post them all but of course I won't do that. More people should speak out if they want to protect this sub.

            Hi gamepwn. I see Esoteric and his downvoat brigade have targeted this post. Funny how they never seem to care about hitting any topics but Q. Seth Rich? Nope. Random pedo logos with little evidence? Nope.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me just spell out for our fake outrage trolls: this is pizzagate related because one of Q's first claims was that Trump would use the Emergency Broadcast System to bypass the MSM and other controlled channels. Q, as is well known, has made many statements that confirm Pizzagate is real, and claims it's much worse than we've even been able to outline, such that "The truth would put 99% of Americans, the world, in the hospital." Hence, if Trump uses the EBS, it's another direct confirmation that Q is not a LARP and is leaking true information.

              This post falls within our definition of pizzagate, whether you like it or not, especially when examined in light of Voat's "mods are not gods" "let the votes decide" free speech expectations. Isn't it ironic that you are trying to paint me as a bad mod for allowing free discussion, and that never happens with any other topic than Q. Noted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please, do take this up with the larger Voat community. I suspect they will react the same way

               How? How does this post have anything to do with elite child sex trafficking? It doesn't. You're deflecting like crazy and it's obvious. If you were actually letting the votes decide, you would see this post shouldn't stay up. Read through the comments. It's plain as fucking day but yet you don't see it.
              </p>
              <p>
               You keep egging me on to make a post attacking you but I'm not going to, Vindicator. It's not worth my time. It's clear to anyone who reads through your comments here.

                That's not really how "letting the votes decide" works on Voat, TM. This is not Reddit.

                 I wouldn't know how Reddit works, considering it's been a couple of years since I last lurked over there. And if letting the votes decide doesn't involve actually looking at what is being upvoted the most (and downvoted the most), then how do you define it?
                </p>
                <p>
                 And by all means, keep trying to get me to make a post about you. It won't happen. Like I said, not worth the time. If you're so into making posts about people, you are more than welcome to start one up yourself.

WHO says this broadcast system will announce something directly related to the sexual abuse of children tomorrow? Still waiting....you just making yourself look bad now.

             I don't have a voting brigade but tell me HOW this post about an emergency broadcast system announcement sources DIRECTLY to pizzagate? Go ahead, i'll wait....NOBODY has ever tied this emergency broadcast system directly to pizzagate.

            <p>
             I see you are still willing to break the posting rules and clutter up our sub with stuff that isn't pizzagate related. Simply saying "Q" does not source directly to pizzagate just because once upon a time Q made a reference to pizzagate. THIS POST does not track back to pizzagate in any way. Please stop breaking our posting rules for your own personal preferences. Most of us don't like it but most won't speak up because YOU are willing to break the rules and call people out.

               Each post must stand or fall on its own merit. Each post either fits the rules or it does not. There is zero reason to believe the broadcast will be about pizzagate and you still can't tie THIS POST to ANYTHING that indicates it will be pizzagate related.

               Because I poured the last 20 years of my soul into pizzagate before the word "pizzagate" was even invented. I watched it go from not being discussed at all, to a trickle, to an avalanche of awareness by the public, and now down to censorship. I have been part of every minute of it for 20 years and I paid a HEAVY price for it.
              </p>
              <p>
               PIzzagate is the the largest and most pure archive of what I poured my soul into for the last 20 years and I don't want to see it get spoiled and I guard it because its necessary. You guys would let it get spoiled with endless speculation and false information from the Q community if you had your way. And thats a damn shame. YOU should be more protective about letting it get in here.

                 Fine. 95% of the topics Q talks about are pure politics and not pizzagate related. If its really pizzagate related I don't bitch about the Q posts. THIS POST you still have not shown me how its directly tied to pizzagate. What is your source for THIS POST.

                 You are just being goofy now. I have asked you five times why you think the broadcast tomorrow will be pizzagate related and you still can't do it. You just want argue about "whether Q is legit or not" and if you notice I didn't take that bait.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My focus is &gt;&gt;&gt; what indicates that the broadcast tommorrow will be pizzagate related? You can't come up with anything and already admitted that "we don't know what it will be about." Well no shit, nobody does.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is a one in a million chance it will be pizzagate related. But for some reason THIS POST fits the rules? I don't give a fuck if Q is legit or not right this minute. I am arguing the merits of THIS POST.

                  LMAO. You "didn't take the bait" because you are pushing your straw man argument so hard you are going to give yourself apoplexy. This is current breaking news directly related by Q to the same people censoring POTUS as censored pizzagate -- all of which fall squarely under the sidebar definition of Pizzagate relevance. Even if all it turns out to be is a generic message from Trump that says "MAGA".

                  It's relevant the same way news about Podesta or Hillary is relevant, even if they don't mention pizzagate.

                   At least you admitted it, finally. I would guess that one percent or less of Q's posts are directly related to pizzagate, but because he made a reference to it a few times anything that has Q attached to it is magically related to pizzagate? No the fuck its not and thats why you would absolutely trash this fucking place with your judgement. THIS POST cannot be tied directly to pizzagate but for some reason that magic Q marker make it related? Thats wrong and you know it.

                      You can literally cite NO example of me exercising bad judgement, let alone bias in "grand fashion". I flaired a deficient Q post just this afternoon -- which you claimed I didn't do.

                       Back when I was posting more I posted to more than one pizzagate related sub. That is spamming? Point out alllllll those spam posts of mine. You can't do it because I have not posted a bunch of spam. You get rather vindictive when you get called out on your bias.

                       Until half of Washington D.C. gets rounded up, sent to Gito by military tribunal, you will always be wrong and I will always be correct. You Q followers, about a year ago, were ready to by batteries and canned food because you were convinced that Marshall Law was only two weeks away, and two weeks away, and two weeks away. I felt sorry for you guys way back then I still feel sorry for you today.

                       Until it happens you will be wrong and I will be right. Since it will never happen you will always be wrong. When Cicado 3301 was acting as Q at least it sort of "looked like" intel drops. Now its nothing more than a mainstream news parrot than always ends with a group of people torturing it into some seriously crazy shit.

It has burned millions of hours of peoples time and brain space power. The F-35 has been the most notoriously technically fucked up jet fighter in modern history. Its had more problems than any modern fighter I can think of which is why they didn't put it into service long ago.

I'm through talking to you about it because all you want to do is turn these little fiascos into a finger pointing contest like a five year old kid. YOU NEVER did point out how THIS POST indicates that the broadcast tomorrow will be related to pizzagate because you can't. So you tried to turn it into a little bitch fight.

If you fuck up this sub there will be a lot of people that will never forgive you for it. Please don't do it out of spite. I"m done with you. I"m going to bed.

                 Fine. 95% of the topics Q talks about are pure politics and not pizzagate related. If its really pizzagate related I don't bitch about the Q posts. THIS POST you still have not shown me how its directly tied to pizzagate. What is your source for THIS POST.

                 You are just being goofy now. I have asked you five times why you think the broadcast tomorrow will be pizzagate related and you still can't do it. You just want argue about "whether Q is legit or not" and if you notice I didn't take that bait.

                <p>
                 My focus is &gt;&gt;&gt; what indicates that the broadcast tommorrow will be pizzagate related? You can't come up with anything and already admitted that "we don't know what it will be about." Well no shit, nobody does.

                 There is a one in a million chance it will be pizzagate related. But for some reason THIS POST fits the rules? I don't give a fuck if Q is legit or not right this minute. I am arguing the merits of THIS POST.

                 If indeed the mods continue drinking the Qool Aid. It can only get worse as Q implodes. Nothing a little opium trafficking won't fix, right frozencobra666?

               I understand. But each post must stand or fall on it's own merit. There is a thousand things Trump could say tomorrow and there is zero indication or reason to believe that it will be related to pizzagate. Maybe it will, maybe it won't be. I am a staunch advocate of keeping this sub pure and free from the endless speculation and false information that comes from the Q community. This is the largest and most pure archive of pizzagate material in the world and I want it to stay that way.

               OK mod, do your job and show us where this emergency broadcast system sources DIRECTLY to the sexual abuse of children. Go ahead, i'll wait....you can't, because it does not, so it does not fit the rules. But you are willing to break the rules for your own personal preferences.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 this is pizzagate related because one of Q's first claims was that Trump would use the Emergency Broadcast System to bypass the MSM and other controlled channels. Q, as is well known, has made many statements that confirm Pizzagate is real, and claims it's much worse than we've even been able to outline, such that "The truth would put 99% of Americans, the world, in the hospital." Hence, if Trump uses the EBS, it's another direct confirmation that Q is not a LARP and is leaking true information.

                    Are you asking me to make a megathread spelling out all the different times Q has referenced the sexual abuse of kids, ES? We don't know what the broadcast will include. We do know that it confirms Q is legit, who has posted numerous times about the sexual abuse of kids and promised Trump and whitehats are putting a stop to it and will be arresting those involved. He has asked researchers to track the number of sealed indictments, and asked people to prepare their friends and family because the full revelation of the truth is going to be very very traumatic for many.

                     Each post must stand or fall on its own merits as to whether it fits the rules. Tell me how that indicates tomorrow's broadcast will be pizzagate related. If the broadcast is about pizzagate I will be more delighted than most. That has nothing to do with THIS POST.

                     I'm sick and tired of hearing about those "indictments." Let me repeat this for the 100th time. There is NOT 55,000 sealed indictments, there are 55,000 sealed DOCUMENTS. A small percentage will be related to indictments and most will be miscellaneous court actions that have nothing to do with pizzagate.

                     Someties you can be really paranoid. I"m trying to keep our sub from becoming endless pages of useless speculation that go nowhere but into rabbit holes. Right now our archives are pretty damn clean considering how heavily invaded we were for a while.

                     Goddamn bro, there are three fucking Q subs. Can't we just have this one for pizzagate without you turning this one into a Q speculation, and decode center? It doesn't matter if we believe Q is legit or not. Each post either fits the rules or it doesn't. This one DOES NOT.

                      Sorry. That excuse won't work. You didn't bitch about it for a whole year before Q ever showed up. You did not go into attack mode until Q arrived, and you only bitch about him.

                       Those subs churn out more baseless guesses and speculation than any other subs. I don't want us to be invaded by it. Damn right I don't. If the Q posts are LEGIT tied to pizzagate I don't bitch.

                         Thats pretty sad when your only defense against being disagreed with is to call somebody a sock puppet. Poor optics too. Easy way to avoid a question isn't it....lame bro.

               This isn't litter. Just because some are convinced he's real or fake or a phyop is not the point. If we just ignore all posts we are censoring. I know you think Q is a phyop. I've already said I'm on the fence several times. However he reported this many times, that they the EBS will be used to alert the nation if shit hits the fan and the POTUS needs to talk to the people and bypass everything. Now MSM is involved and even trying to stop this and it's being spoken about everywhere. It's important to at least analyze even if you don't believe ESOTERICshade

                 A valid point, although the lines blur a bit here.  To play Baal's advocate:.
                 <em>
                  IF
                 </em>
                 one allows for the possibility that Trump is at minimum fighting for a different faction than those who control most MSM, this system could be his only means to communicate directly to the people.  If this alert system is intended to convey points regarding ((those)) who are ravaging and manipulating the world's children, this could be very important indeed, and they would love for us to ignore or dismiss it as we do all Qtardation.  Also, I really can't read any of the Q boards without wanting to vomit at how easily manipulated all these sheep who think they're goats are, yet I find this one of the most interesting and telling developments of late.  The mods allow much less relevant things to stay up regularly.

                  I suppose that is a possibility but me thinks if Trump started sending messages the cabal didn't like they would just interrupt the phone services in some manner to stop him. I doubt he could send messages at will without them having a way to shut him down.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My thinking is that all this is a red herring and something else far more nefarious is going on, like installing the capability to black out every single phone in the U.S. if they want to. With this system you CANNOT OPT OUT which means they could turn it on, leave it on, and keep your phone jammed as long as they please. They might even be able to do it selectively to any single person they desire. I feel pretty sure this is all about giving the government a universal way to intercept, interrupt, all phones at anytime for any reason.

                   From a tech standpoint, your second point doesn't make sense (through no fault of your own, I only know for professional reasons), as they already have sufficient backdoors and complete control &amp; cooperation from the providers &amp;manufacturers to do exactly what you described and more.  We already can't opt out of certain alerts anyway, and the only difference between this system and those is the ALLEGED source of the alerts: the president.  I wish I could pinpoint what it is about it that seems pertinent, but it's just my gut ATM, I'll concede.

                   well could be disinformation, or a red herring, as you put it, though.  Like I said, just playing devil's advocate.  Rereading the thread, I am a bit perturbed by the company my hypothetical argument seems to put me in.

                    You are probably right. I doubt they built a whole new system. And like you said "supposedly" the President can now access it on his own, which also seems like it might be hokey. This whole thing is probably a stunt that has been engineered for reasons we might not be able to understand yet.
