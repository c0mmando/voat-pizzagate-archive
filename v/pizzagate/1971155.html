            Some interesting things on this thread. However, I kind of doubt the kill room in the Viper Room story.  With all the private estates that these pedo/satanists have all over the LA area, why would they choose a public place as the Viper Room to be conducting sacrifices?  I have friends that have seen Satanic stuff at parties in the Hollywood Hills and Malibu, but it was all private residences.  Seems quite a risk to set up a kill room and conduct sacrifices at such a small, public place.  I never went there, but had friends that went there that were not VIPs.

             Those who use ridicule as an argument, have no argument. Disinfo tactic that will out you every time. A person who did not believe anything about PG, and still was a fixture in here daily, if such a person exist, would at least attempt to debate why they think certain facts didn't mean anything. You simply are here daily, to call names and make snide remarks. An odd desperate character if you are not a disinfo troll.

              What would you call those whose argument is entirely fantasies and fiction?  I would say they don't have an argument worth considering.

              I'm here because I know some folks on here are trying to keep one foot in reality.  And they appreciate a critical point of view that makes check their logic and make sure they aren't fooling themselves or letting  emotions, get in the way of thinkibg. I know this because they have told me this.

            Another strange fact. River Pheonix died on Haloween of 1993  at the Viper room. If the wild story about Houston setting up his sacrifice has any truth, Haloween might be a day a satanist would find symbolic. Just throwing that in there. And then there is the fact that the former part owner Anthony Fox dissapeared and was never heard from again.  He had a revolver and a briefcase that dissapeared as well. He was suing 5 people involved with the club, including Depp who was accused of withholding millions in profits from him. How was Depp not suspected? Perhpas the usual case of the cabal being above the law. You would think at least an investigation would be automatic.The entire thing is bizarre.

            I cant believe this. This is my first and ONLY account and you idiots mark me -1. The only guy with FACTS on the little secret room !!!!! Jeeez! I have nothing to gain. I am reporting FACTS. And the laughter I reported is NOT in ANY recorded written books , newspapers, articles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why -1 the only good post of FACTS in this thread! Who the hell are you guys to censor the TRUTH with downvotes!

           <p>
            That was my first and only post from first and only account. Now I will not bother helping out voat. Its filled with censoring fools.

            NOT A KILL ROOM. FACT! I have been in the room, it is merely a single table and small bar staffed by a Bar Tender. It is merely "the private room". I had several different connections (strong invites by owners, managers, ex girlfriends of owners, and headliner act band members) to the Viper Room in the late 90s. The upstairs had merely 6 tables and room for about 60 people standing. It is a very very very exclusive club. I also got tables for me and my gal (two people) on one of the precious 6. I sometimes let other strangers share my table. The people at the tables typically were all A and B list celebs and their dates or sometimes record industry execs on a signing night for a new artist. There was no way to convert that bar into an "alter" it is merely a short normal alcohol bar. And only one staircase up and down. And a closed circuit TV of the action happening upstairs. Like every other bar with a back room in LA, celebs went into it to smoke. Sometimes a celeb would have a person be a temp extra doorman bouncer and declare the entire club or bar " a private party" and everyone would pull out cigarettes and light up, as it was no longer a "public" bar. Hypocrisy. Anyway. The room is very unknown, very very very exclusive, (getting into the viper club upstairs itself is impossible for most people without special invites). Even PARKING near the viper club on a PUBLIC STREET will get your car towed if your are not special because the cops will deem your tires not "turned enough toward the curb" after a doorman snitches and summons The Man to take away the riff raff. I was a friend of a person standing over River as he choked and died on the street OUTSIDE the viper club, while some laughed. The laughter might have been nervous style laughter, or evil, or a mix. But all people remember the laughter and those ACCUSED of laughter later by other witnesses strongly denied it and insisted that THEY did not smirk of laugh as he died. My first and only VOAT post. I have no desire to coverup anything in life, or mislead. I live for facts and truth. I mostly believe in Pizzagate since week one.

             So there is a secret room under the Bar. Now we are getting somewhere. No room to put an altar? That is your argument that it is impossible that bad things happen there? How many people can fit dfown there? Your argument is odd. And I will ask a second time, where is your older account? Your account you are posting under had only been around for 45 minutes when I read your post.

            NOT A KILL ROOM. FACT! I have been in the room, it is merely a single table and small bar staffed by a Bar Tender. It is merely "the private room". I had several different connections (strong invites by owners, managers, ex girlfriends of owners, and headliner act band members) to the Viper Room in the late 90s. The upstairs had merely 6 tables and room for about 60 people standing. It is a very very very exclusive club. I also got tables for me and my gal (two people) on one of the precious 6. I sometimes let other strangers share my table. The people at the tables typically were all A and B list celebs and their dates or sometimes record industry execs on a signing night for a new artist. There was no way to convert that bar into an "alter" it is merely a short normal alcohol bar. And only one staircase up and down. And a closed circuit TV of the action happening upstairs. Like every other bar with a back room in LA, celebs went into it to smoke. Sometimes a celeb would have a person be a temp extra doorman bouncer and declare the entire club or bar " a private party" and everyone would pull out cigarettes and light up, as it was no longer a "public" bar. Hypocrisy. Anyway. The room is very unknown, very very very exclusive, (getting into the viper club upstairs itself is impossible for most people without special invites). Even PARKING near the viper club on a PUBLIC STREET  will get your car towed if your are not special because the cops will deem your tires not "turned enough toward the curb" after a doorman snitches and summons The Man to take away the riff raff. I was a friend of a person standing over River as he choked and died on the street OUTSIDE the viper club, while some laughed. The laughter might have been nervous style laughter, or evil, or a mix. But all people remember the laughter and those ACCUSED of laughter later by other witnesses strongly denied it and insisted that THEY did not smirk of laugh as he died. My first and only VOAT post. I have no desire to coverup anything in life, or mislead. I live for facts and truth. I mostly believe in Pizzagate since week one.

            BUT I DO NOT WANT PEOPLE TO LIE about the ridiculously tiny uber-exlusive single table micro-lounge underneath the Viper Room. Its just a very private very protected very secret little room.

             "very private very protected secret little room'  sounds just like what you would want a 'kill room' to be.

             Also, you said you have followed PG since week one, yet your account is 44 minutes old. Where is your older account? I call bullshit for this and the reason I mentioned below.  Nice try however. You adding in nuggets about how some laughed when he was dying was an attempt to gain trust that you new there were things being covered up. Your game won't work here. You are no "viperguy".

             You said you believe in PG since week one, yet you seem to not even know what a "kill room" is. A Kill room might be a secret basement. So how would you know there was none? Did you tap on all the floors and look listen for hollow sounds? did you search the walls for hidden doors? Did you check to see that nothing in there could be moved to reveal a secret entrance? Your story was interesting, but what are you going on about? You know there was no secret room, how exactly?

            Upvoting this...outing the Hollywood SRA, pedophilia, and all the related bullshit will begin to break down the "discernment" wall...we all need to get better at recognizing this caca!  Do you think when these "stars" make their "deal" (and they all do BTW..) they become more luminous (somehow??) to us?  Seems right, so just about anyone who we would deem "famous" needs high levels of scrutiny..just sayin'..

            I've read some of this before like Hunter Thompson making snuff films but some of these comments are insane!
           </p>
           <p>
            "Thompson was also writing a book about 9/11 right before he died, which supposedly exposed the dark shadowy world of the elite who prey on the weak."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Jeff Gannon killed Hunter S Thompson to keep him quiet"
           </p>
           <p>
            "I hate my friend Johnny Depp"
           </p>
           <p>
            "What about the witnesses that saw Johnny Depp parachuting over Astoria milliseconds before the first plane hit on 9/11"
           </p>
           <p>
            "My cousin's ex-husband was LAPD, on the Ritual Abuse task force, which basically functions to cover up the ritual abuse in crime, so as not to panic the public, so they claim. Bunch of bullshit. It's to protect the elite ritual abusers"
           </p>
           <p>
            They have a Ritual Abuse task force?!
           </p>
           <p>
            "Just check out the only Bush pardon from a death sentence. A fucking totally demented Satanic serial killer! Henry Lee Lucas."
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the basement part
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A friend of mine in another L.A. cabal told me in the late 90s that River's death was a sacrifice ordered by Anjelica Huston to consolidate her power when she was taking over the world leadership of the group. They had been working on it for some time and Depp was the designated facilitator.
            </p>
            <p>
             The entire Viper Club set-up was created for such purposes. I can't tell you how many people disappeared from the place over the years. My friend told me they had a kill room in the basement - a chapel, really, with a stone table or platform. Phoenix originally was supposed to be put down as part of a ceremony - they had been cultivating his drug habit - but they got the final dose wrong. He realized something was up and tried to escape, but once on the street one of them delivered a quick injection and they did a fast impromptu sealing to secure the juju.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huston, who was down in the chapel, was livid and had four of the staff taken out right then and there. If you check the news stories from the week after you'll read about the four "unidentified" bodies found in the desert. Depp was off the hook because she decided it wasn't his fault, but he had a huge pay-back debt he had to work off, which explains the films he's been in ever since. Huston had approval on every one of his projects and she ensured every one was something dank and, ultimately, satanic.

             I haven't been posting my experiences for quite a while - I had heard someone was figuring out who I was. But I saw this thread and had to say something. I really like River - he was a sweet kid. Keanu never got over it, you know.

              This has all types of info Even info saying Wikipedia is not allowing certain info and that we should boycott them and tell them to print it.   I have been told by some people that they are not a good source of info anymore because anyone can add whatever.  Hmm.  Where do we go then.

              Hollywood (or Wall Street, Washington, Rome, etc. for that matter) is filled with secret religions, clubs, and societies which give their members a heightened feeling of power and superiority.

              "We are better than the common folks, because we know the truth how the world really works while all those public and easy accessable religions and beliefs are just decoys to keep the stupid masses busy."

              The high elite gets the better drugs than the common people.

             <p>
              The insiders have the freedom to do whatever they want, because they know that things like guilt, consciousness, fear, etc. are tools to keep the outsiders from becoming insiders. And what good is a secret society when all the "riff-raff" is getting in?

                Indeed. They say he brings wannabe models at regular parties back to his studio and within minutes it's a porn shoot starring him and her and the assistant snapping photos. It's over quickly and he takes her back to the party shellshocked.

            Here's the reply:
A friend of mine in another L.A. cabal told me in the late 90s that River's death was a sacrifice ordered by Anjelica Huston to consolidate her power when she was taking over the world leadership of the group. They had been working on it for some time and Depp was the designated facilitator.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire Viper Club set-up was created for such purposes. I can't tell you how many people disappeared from the place over the years. My friend told me they had a kill room in the basement - a chapel, really, with a stone table or platform. Phoenix originally was supposed to be put down as part of a ceremony - they had been cultivating his drug habit - but they got the final dose wrong. He realized something was up and tried to escape, but once on the street one of them delivered a quick injection and they did a fast impromptu sealing to secure the juju.
           </p>
           <p>
            Huston, who was down in the chapel, was livid and had four of the staff taken out right then and there. If you check the news stories from the week after you'll read about the four "unidentified" bodies found in the desert. Depp was off the hook because she decided it wasn't his fault, but he had a huge pay-back debt he had to work off, which explains the films he's been in ever since. Huston had approval on every one of his projects and she ensured every one was something dank and, ultimately, satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't been posting my experiences for quite a while - I had heard someone was figuring out who I was. But I saw this thread and had to say something. I really like River - he was a sweet kid. Keanu never got over it, you know.

             Angelica Huston's father was a pedophile.  One of his victim's committed suicide.  The victim was also a victim of bill Cosby and possibly high Hefner.  She told her roommate she was about to commit suicide- showed her where and how and everything but the stupid roommate blew her off.

             Dr George Hodel was a good friend of John Huston's, Angelica's father's. Hodel also married John Huston's ex wife. Hodel raped his daughter, Tamar.  Tamar says she escaped a predatory situation with John Huston - her stepmothers ex husband and Angelica's father.  When tamar told her stepmother of the incest, she rushed her into hiding.
            </p>
            <p>
             Quote from an article:
Tamar’s sophistication had a grotesque basis. In her father’s home—where she had often “uncomfortably” posed nude, she recalls, for “dirty-old-man” Man Ray and had once wriggled free from a predatory John Huston—George Hodel had committed incest with her. “When I was 11, my father taught me to perform oral sex on him. I was terrified, I was gagging, and I was embarrassed that I had ‘failed’ him,” Tamar says, telling her version of her long-misreported adolescence. George plied her with erotic books, grooming her for what he touted as their transcendent union. (Tamar says that she told her mother what George had done, and that, when confronted, George denied it.) He had intercourse with Tamar when she was 14. To the girl’s horror, she became pregnant; to her greater horror, she says, “my father wanted me to have his baby.” After a friend took her to get an abortion, an angry George—jealous, Tamar says, of some boys who’d come to see her—struck her on the head with his pistol. Her stepmother, Dorero (who was John Huston’s ex-wife), rushed her into hiding.

             Tamar also happens to be the childhood best friend of Michelle Phillips.  Mackenzie Phillips claims her father molested her, but Michelle doesn't believe it though she has always know Tamar was a victim of abuse.

             Hodel, by his son's account, is said to be the the black dahlia killer.

             So yeh, it's safe to say that Angelica was surrounded by pedophiles.  She dated jack Nicholson for many years too and before dating him she dated a 50 year old when she was 19.  Jack was closer to her age I think - but there is talk of him being a pedo.  And He was buddies with Polanski.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it's possible Angelica is a witch of some sort as this person claimed in their comment about river Phoenix

              Pretty amazing how closely this information about Huston reads like CHINATOWN, which Roman Polanski directed, John Huston starred as the pedophile rapist that impregnated his own daughter, and which won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Oh... Nicholson was the main star of the movie, too.

               And Huston had no beef about playing the part, almost like his way of admitting who he his. And I remember hearing the name Man Ray as a suspect in the black dahlia murders, I guess a misdirect away from Hodel
