<p>From Wikipedia:  
</p>
<p>&quot;Individuals involved in YouTube Poops sometimes make efforts to take their videos down due to the mature and defamatory content prevalent in them, especially if they have a large audience of children watching their work. Children\'s poet Michael Rosen (who claims to have &quot;become a cult&quot; among YouTube Poopers) initially attempted to take his videos down, but after a few frank discussions with YouTube Poopers, he decided to allow the videos to stay online.  Rosen issued a warning on his website, saying that:
“Quite a few people have fun taking my videos and making new versions of them, known as \'poops\' or \'YTPs\'. Many of these are not suitable for young children. I am not responsible for either the words or pictures of these.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>This wouldn\'t account for the &quot;original content&quot; of videos produced by the likes of Greg Chism at ToyFreaks, but I imagine he was inspired by the popularity of YouTube Poops.

              YTP is re-cut footage and is meant to be as random and meme-filled as possible. Elsagate is original videos.

            Oh my God .  WTH are we going to do about this?  It's an  Epidemic.  At least this guy says it is not suitable.  But that will make curious kids watch it all the more.  You know, the Forbidden Fruit.  Parents are lazy and lax and do not screen anymore. I heard on my news that Nielsen was going to rate YT and some others.  Maybe that will help, but we'll see who's side they are on.

             Unfortunately, I believe Nielsen just rates the numbers of viewers rather than the quality of the content.  It seems to me that parenting and children's advocacy groups need to step up and mount a massive public education campaign--assuming there are some of these groups that aren't working for the dark side.  They could also publicize rating sites that are legitimately screening and recommending good kids' videos.  If such a campaign was successful in getting the public's attention, YouTube might finally feel the pressure to proactively block this filth.

              Sad.  There is a Parents Assoc.  I believe and also a Physicians Assoc.  that have come out before against children younger than 2 watching TV.  They would be someone parents would listen to.  Unfortunately we are the only ones coming out with this. Although a couple of small media stations reported it. One was actually Chicago.  Moms Blogs would be a good place to spread it.  I think if people on here are on Blogs they should make people aware. Moms are great communicators.
