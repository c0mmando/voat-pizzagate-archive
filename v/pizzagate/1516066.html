<p>Watermelon and pedophilia keep coming up together. Either the pedophiles were related to the watermelon, there\'s an interesting quip about Russians being &quot;seedless watermelon&quot; (meaning they\'re infertile cucks, basically, but still... pink interior with worthless seeds when it\'s still immature), some a lot of racism related topics, and... more stories that keep associating pedophiles and eating watermelon and spitting out seeds.</p>
