             they didn't just live across the street from each other, that's the whole point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cosby and Epstein both bought those two places the same year as each other. 1989. They both put extensive money into extensive, modernizing, and luxurious renovations before moving in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both of those places ended up with heated sidewalks , which is mentioned in the article as being FREAKISHLY luxurious and unique .
            </p>
            <p>
             Which leads to the obvious assumption that Cosby and Epstein knew each other as neighbors and most probably had their renovations done by the same people.
uh....yeah, the same contracting firm handled both upgrades, which is why they both ended up with  those weird heated side walks....yeah, that's what I meant.
            </p>
            <p>
             yeah , that's why I posted the links.
            </p>
            <p>
             and  yes , the Egyptian obelisk , the masonic Cleopatra's Needle. is a five minute walk up the street from there in Central Park, and it was imported from Egypt. A priceless masonic occult artifact. and the whole neighborhood around Central Park is teeming with occultists.
            </p>
            <p>
             and yes Epstein has an Egyptian Temple on his island near Puerto Rico. and yes Cosby was a good friend of his Puerto Rican mentor, Church of Satan member Sammy Davis Jr., yes the same Sammy Davis who was a good friend of Q. Elizabeth's and who  was also member of Q. Elizabeth's British Templar masonic order The Knights of MAlta.
Any bets that Cosby has been to that island near Puerto Rico?
            </p>
            <p>
             so this is looking like Cosby and Epstein may be part of an ancient Templar cult linked to sex rituals , etc.

            Bill Cosby also lived right across the street from Jeffrey Epstein:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...When asked how long Mr. Wexner had occupied the property, Jeffrey Epstein, his protege and one of his financial advisers, replied, "Les never spent more than two months there." Thus the prorated cost of Mr. Wexner's sejours would appear to have been in excess of a million dollars a day.
            </p>
            <p>
             Visitors described a bathroom reminiscent of James Bond movies: hidden beneath a stairway, lined with lead to provide shelter from attack and supplied with closed-circuit television screens and a telephone, both concealed in a cabinet beneath the sink. The house also has a heated sidewalk, a luxurious provision that explains why, while snow blankets the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, the Wexner house
             <strong>
              (and Bill Cosby's house across the street)
             </strong>
             remains opulently snow-free, much to the delight of neighborhood dogs...
            </p>
            <p>
             Reached in Florida last week, Mr. Epstein said that the house was now his.

             Cosby was in tight with the Rat Pack and Queen Elizabeth's little coven of black boyfriends like Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis Jr.. Harry Belafonte,  and Sidney Poitier. She even created the careers of Jimmy Hendrix, Stevie Wonder and countless other black musicians.
             <br/>
             She knighted Sidney Poitier. She's got a fetish for black doctors . Had Poitier play the star role as the black doctor who forces himself onto the parents of his white wife who don't want her to marry him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Had Cosby play the role of a fucking** gynecologist** in his long running sitcom as the central character Dr. Huxtable.
She is the one behind all the 1970s Saturday Morning Cartoons obsession with The Cosby Kids   and The Jackson Five and Muhammed Ali etc. and all the preachy 1970s  sitcoms like 'All in the Family' and other creepo PC bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             She's been the one behind the OBSESSION with pushing interracial sex, black music, pushing radical feminism in the schools, all of it.
Swear to god once I start digging I will find out that the Royals created the NBA from the ground up, from scratch. 
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD I WILL FIND THE EVIDENCE if I put my  mind to it.

            actually Cosby apprenticed in the navy as a medic for U.S. Navy medical ships, and did his stint training at Bethesda Naval Hospital in D.C. (Maryland, same thing)
this is the same place that president Reagan had surgery
           </p>
           <p>
            probably means Cosby was a spook himself, military intel, he was in the CIA based spook TV Drama 'I Spy' as a top CIA spook. 
He was only about 17 when he joined the navy and started in with his medical training. Means he was around all those perverted feminists in a medical setting, was trained to administer injections and put people under , ie knock them out for surgery etc.

              Cosby was a randy 18 year old kid working at a hospital being trained to work with female patients, many of whom were probably unconscious or drugged to oblivion. Doubtless part of his work was to train as an orderly which means changing patient's clothes for them , bathing them, etc.
Put two and two together as to how he almost certainly lost 'his virginity' , and developed his lifelong fetish for unconscious women.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cosby even boasted in a speech, when he was made an honorary officer of the U.S. navy years later, in his acceptance speech he boasted that he was 'allowed to roam the hospital freely' when he was supposed to apprenticing as a naval hospital corpsman. He was surely living in residence there. So he had clearance to sneak around there all night.

            So Cosby's raping women was an open secret. Like they didn't know and cover things up for that POS. And then they turn him into a professorial authoritative figure for the masses. What a joke! And speaking of Milo, look how the hypocrites lauded Cosby and refused to condemn him from raping scores of women. Wasn't that rapey-rapey enough for Ms. Goldberg and her friends?

             Cosby may have been in child sacrifice cult linked to ancient Jewish king, King Ahab, who in the Old Testament sacrificed is first born son to Baal.
             <br/>
             Cannibal word etymology  is Canaan and Baal together to form cannibal.
Canaan Baal = cannibal
            </p>
            <p>
             So King Ahab was possibly a cannibal.

             Rosemary's Baby was filmed in actor Robert Ryan's real-life apartment in The Dakota. In the film , an upcoming actor aspiring to Hollywood stardom sacrifices his first born child to the sex cult in the Dakota, and in the film the sex cult is said to use the blood and flesh of babies ritually. Rosemary is KNOCKED OUT with a drug placed in her chocolate pudding and raped. She gets pregnant In the end of the film, the cult gets Rosemary's Baby.
The links place Cosby in the same apartment where that movie was filmed! 
Duh, does anyone even FUCKING GET THIS? Knocked out. Raped. Maybe I should speak a bit more slowly and spell it out.
             <br/>
             COSBY drugged women, raped dem, too,  duh.....
the links show that Cosby and Sir Sidney Poitier were members of AHAB, which met in that apartment!
            </p>
            <p>
             oh, still a bit of a fucking fluoride head, I see.   King Ahab sacrificed his baby in the The Old Testament. Dat's da bible, kidz.
Dat's sort of like sounding like... AHAB, da cult which Cosby an Poitier wuz in.....and that was REAL LIFE, kiddies.
 In real life there was an organization named AHAB.
            </p>
            <p>
             In real life there were JEwish cults who sacrificed babies to Baal.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the movie Rosemary's Baby, there was a baby sacrificed, and the film strongly implied a Jewish cult linked to the elite of show business, and it was filmed in the REAL LIFE APARTMENT of Robert Ryan,
who created the real life organization AHAB.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK. if you don't get it at this point I should give up.
In real life, that whole area around Robert Ryans three-story, block-long, mansion-sized 'suite'  atop The Dakota is full of satanists. 
So Rosemary's Baby was hinting at real life events. 
Someone didn't really like what was going on there with Bill Cosby and the rest of it, obviously. 
So the film was made in an effort to expose it. 
It only took retarded America 50 fucking years to figure it out. A tad too late , I fear.
            </p>
            <p>
             btw, the unspoken part here is that whoever owns that suite is the kingpin of that entire building.
Its the crown jewel of that entire place. Guess who bought it after Robert Ryan's wife died inside
the place and Ryan wanted to move out? John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Both of them rabid occultists.

              Makes sense why there is so much child trafficking reported in the region, even inside Israeli media.

              It's always been my contention that it's what happened to Sharon Tate's child. No way they killed that baby. I just wonder where that child is.

               And guess who was the husband of Sharon Tate - Roman Polanski, the convicted rapist. Did he have something to do with it?
I would recommend a movie by Roman Polanski - Bitter Moon(1991) starring Hugh Grant. It is a dark romance drama with, disturbing and perverted. Glimpse inside director's mind.

                Thanks. Will check it out. Definitely. I believe he definitely had something to do with it. He allegedly was doing the same thing Manson was in videoing porn and was supposed to have a lot of stars caught engaging in deviant acts. They allegedly disappeared which was probably what they were after. But Tate was also targeted. Did you read about "the dream" she had about Manson that wasn't a dream? This was before she met him and was similar to one in Rosemary's Baby in that she discovered it wasn't a dream. It leads me to believe she'd been drugged.

               seriously , if you really want to know the truth, follow every link in the following thread and then scroll down and read the entire thread. It's absolutely a cut and dried , verified fact that the Tate murder was a psy-op, a fake murder hoax which was pinned on 'anti war hippies' to make war opponents look horrific by association, part of the larger "Operation Chaos' which also featured the intentionally faked deaths of 'anti-war hippie rockers'.
              </p>
              <p>
               The '27 Club' deaths were all faked.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Charles Manson murders were faked
              </p>

              <p>
               you might ask why they faked the 27 Club deaths in the late 1960s?
they did it to scare the shit out of parents , basically,
              </p>
              <p>
               Parents who were scared shit-less of having their young sons drafted to fight and die in Vietnam. Operation Chaos made it look like it was just as dangerous to stay in America , and get your mind shattered on LSD or worse, die like all the 'big hippie leaders' were dying, or even worse get killed by a fake serial killer like  Zodiac or Bundy (both fakes) or worse end up in a satanic cult with Manson or Anton LaVey, it was all FAKE.
              </p>
              <p>
               So there's the reason for faking the deaths of some of the big rockers of the time. Son is safer going to Nam.

                 he hasn't even been in jail . There's pic after pic of him posed in his mugshots , pretending to be an inmate, with this incredible dark tan on his face, and the younger ones and interviews etc. where he's 56 and his hair is jet black, dyed, while his beard is normally greying. 
Any man over 50 knows thats impossible.

                 Any one who has been in prison knows you don't kill the richest most famous in the world and then get to do TV interviews  as a celebrity and have tanned face and dyed hair and run around threatening violence uncuffed during interviews.

                <p>
                 you can see his tan again here:

                 notice they cobbled together 'oh , but Manson IS in jail , a couple of  years ago when the news broke 
that Manson had been a psy op. that he wasn't in jail.  Suddenly we were shown the first pics of Manson
as an actual inmate in about thirty years.

                 note that Manson is darker INSIDE JAIL than his OUT OF JAIL California girlfriend!
and take a close look at that girlfriend of his, look familiar? the hair, the facial expression?

                 He is nothing but an actor. Actually , not true . There is an emerging suspicion that he may have been a prolific song-writer behind the scenes for Laurel Canyon bands. 
personally I think he may really be from  Vancouver and may have written the song 'Horse with No NAme' which was released by the band 'America'.

                 there's nothing retarded about it at all . There was a massive glut of fake crap which parents were being bombarded with in the late sixties and early seventies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 LSD festivals destroying the minds of their teenaged kids ( created by the govt., read up on The Merry Pranksters, the CIA ,  and Operation Chaos spiking the punch at Monterey and Woodstock)
the faked rocker deaths, the fake stabbing at Altamont, the fake shooting of students at Kent State...
and yes, Manson and the Zodiac killings were faked to scare the hell out of Americans , throw everything into disarray.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Plus there was the fake Apollo shit , timed to make everyone ADMIRE the pongos, the ex Korean War pilots who became glorious Apollo astronauts...it was all timed to contrast with the UGLINESS of the hippies, who were created by the government from the very start.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Parents were made to think that having their sons stay in America was unpatriotic and that their sons might fall into the bad influence of the 'flower power' movement if they stayed.
The Manson thing was incredibly forceful and powerful on a direct local level.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In 1968, public support for the war in Vietnam was at an all-time low, even among
upper-echelon military brass and politicians feeling the pressure to end American
involvement. The reason things became so heated at The Presidio base was because the army 'dissidents' against the war had established significant political support and had some
powerful people ready to back them. (not everyone in the game had a stake or incentive to help out the 'war effort', ie:they did not have a heroin cartel to protect from asian (Vietnamese) competition, or have an opium/coffee bean/cocoa bean plantation planned or a coffee op planned or slave op or whatever you want to call it. The pro-war forces were losing the battle for the support of the American public, which means they were losing even the support of the politicians and the military unless they pulled off something dramatic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The key to finally piecing all of this together is to understand exactly what their
successfully faked murder of Sharon Tate achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                 First a quick review of who was involved and why:
                </p>
                <p>
                 The manson cult was fake. Sharon Tate's father was Colonel Paul Tate, who worked at the Presidio army base with Colonel Michael Aquino and ACIO Major Peter Folger. Colonel Michael Aquino also worked with Anton LaVey in The Presidio's psychological warfare operations for the U.S. Military. LaVeys' Church of Satan headquarters was virtually
located at The Presidio, two blocks south of the base itself in North San Francisco.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Purported 'blood-drinking Manson girl' Susan Atkins was repeatedly photographed with Anton LeVay when she was a regular actress/stripper/dancer in the occult-themed soft porn plays he would put on in San Francisco, in 1966, only a couple of years before the big events at Tate's home on Cielo Dr.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sharon Tate's friend who purportedly was killed with her, Abigail Folger? HER (Abigail Folger's ) father was ALSO a military intelligence officer, Major Peter Folger, who also lived in San Francisco region, and also worked in same Pacific-theater military-intelligence operations that Col. Aquino and Col. Tate worked in.
                </p>

                 Abigail Folgers family are coffee barons with interests in the low cost production of coffee grown on slave plantations in Vietnam. The Vietnam War was partially about keeping the Chinese govt. or anyone else, from upholding human rights and meddling in their planned coffee/cocoa/opium slave plantations which the big boys were planning for Vietnam.﻿

                 Colonel Paul Tate, Sharon Tate's father, had been one of the top brass at The Presidio base when there was almost a mass mutiny and armed insurrection against them there at a time when America was a powder-keg of displeasure against the military agenda and the forced draft.
A large contingent of several hundred active-duty and reserve servicemen marched at the front of the anti-war parade, which started downtown and ended at the gates outside The Presidio army base.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After the 6th Army Psychological Operations Unit at the Presidio faked the murders of Colonel Tates and Major Folgers daughters (using actors like Susan Atkins Lynette Fromme, and professional songwriter Charles Manson)they used the HEarst newspaper giant to get the fake story out nationwide, and claimed that the murders had been done by 'anti-draft hippies'. Who knows what was done to the dissident soldiers as 'reprisal' for what Col. Tate , Folger, et al had claimed, falsely, was done to their daughters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Manson hoax worked perfectly and achieved its purpose perfectly, its purpose being to
offend America with heinous gruesome crime, to create public outrage, and to sway public opinion against the anti-draft 'counterculture' implicated for it. It was also calculated to give Colonel Paul Tate and Major Peter Folger the moral impetus to , lividly, mount a brutal crackdown on dissent at The Presidio as the purported 'vengeance for their daughters', and stop the anti-war uprising.

                 Just use your imagination on what might have happened to those soldiers who had dared oppose the war? Sent straight to the front lines in 'Nam or sent there and railroaded into military prison or 'fragged'/accidentally shot' by members of their own troop?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The American public having been told that these men had indirectly caused the torture/murder of Sharon Tate/Abigail Folger. Maybe dissent became unpopular at that point.

                 btw, consider too the fact that Americans were being BOMBARDED with pro-war movies and pro-war TV series, dramas, documentaries, books, even comic books during those years, movies designed to 'honor Americas' glorious war past' etc.
It was FUCKING HEROIC , AN ADVENTURE , etc. to go prove your manliness in war.
that was people were constantly told.

                 conversely parents were told that people who stayed home were druggie, lazy beach bums with long hair, pacifist weaklings like John Lennon etc.

                    So an aunt of Izette, Abigail Folger, was a Tate murder victim. A. Folger donated money to the Height-Ashbury clinic which is credited with distributing psychadelic during San Francisco's "Summer of Love". She was an acquaintance of Manson who is exposed as a MKUltra asset in many documents online. There are many conspiracy theories about Manson that paint more of a CIA op than a murder conspiracy. But that's old news. Izette best friend is Carol Joynt. Carol's claim to fame is that she and Charlie Rose won the national Emmy Award for "Best Interview" for a one-hour prison interview with Charles Manson.

                   a bit of followup reveals no evidence that Abigail Folger was Izette Folger's Aunt. 
They are without a doubt related the same bloodline which leads to Benjamin Franklin though.
the names Lee and Abigail and Folger are both present way back to Benjamin Franklin's mother.
I tried hard to find any ancestry of Lee M. Folger, he is a prominent D.C. philanthropist and finance executive, that's all I have so far.

                   but the Izette connection to Manson is fascinating.

               Princess Diana lived two buildings over from where John Lennon had lived, at the Dakota, right beside Central Park , on Central Park West, after Diana separated from Charles. She was being hounded by the global paparazzi during her marital trouble scandal with Charles. She was living with Dodi Fayed at the San Remo, which is just down the block from The Dakota. Which means her window had a view of the Dakota from Dodi Fayed's apt in the San Remo. If Diana knew that Lennon's death had been faked outside the Dakota (and there is a good chance that she did know, as the Beatles are well known to have been virtual royalty in England) then she would have recalled that Lennon's death was faked to allow Lennon to escape the paparazzi which hounded his separation from Yoko Ono. Anyone recall the 'Diana-mania!' media craze of the 1980s? Where Diana's every move and breath were stalked by the media for years on end, and how her falling out with Charles was tabloid gold? DIana was a Beatle, in a sense.Her breakup with Charles was played by the tabloids even more viciously than Lennons break with Yoko. The papparazi stalking of Diana in NY was worse than the height of Beatlemania .All of the research now indicates that Diana' death, too, was faked. Cobain's death was faked like Princess Dianas death was, and now everyone knows why it appears that there some sort of 'cover up' going on in so many of these weird deaths, including that of Jim Morrison. Not because there was murder involved. Because there were fake deaths involved.﻿

              <p>
               It's almost a certainty that many if not all of these buildings connect via undergound tunnel system, either the ones bordering each other , at least the four , The Majestic, The Dakota, The Langham and The San Remo, or more. There are SO many occultist celebs and celebrity co-ops literally bordering Central Park that you've got to think they may all connect to something beneath Central Park. Bowies building, Annie Lennox's building, Keith Moon's building, Stings building, Madonnas building, the Grateful Deads building, Woody Allens buildig, Yoko's, Diana's sons building (the Carlyle), they ALL frigging border Central Park , I kid you not, and those are just the ones I have found with limited time/motive for research, No ones getting paid for this on my end. They surely MAY connect together to something underground. The Big Apple is the secret, it is what is underneath Central Park , whatever it is. It may predate known history, whatever it is.

               Dodi Fayed lived in the San Remo with Diana before her death was faked, that entire Central Park region is crammed with satanists.Just up the street from the San Remo was the house on the NW corner of Central Park where Aleister Crowley conducted some of his orgies and seances and rituals. The San Remo was the building in which rich Dr.Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife (Nicole Kidman) lived in Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick set their apartment in the San Remo in Eyes Wide Shut :

               Kubrick originally wanted to make his film Eyes Wide Shut in 1968, but shelved the project for thirty years (possibly bought himself an extra 30 years of life, because he 'died' four days after releasing the producers cut of Eyes Wide Shut to Warner Brothers in 1999).

               Eyes Wide Shut was almost made the same year that the film Rosemary's Baby was created, and both films were about young couples living smack beside central park and getting caught up in the sex rituals of the NY elite. The San Remo And The Dakota were in both films, and those buildings are part of the same four building housing co-op which includes The Majestic, The Langham , the Dakota, and The San Remo.
Both films feature a woman drugged for sex (Dr. Harford is summoned upstairs to help revive a nude woman who Ziegler has just fucked while unconscious, and of course in Rosemary's Baby  Rosemary is drugged unconscious by the cult and raped )Eyes Wide Shut featured a mask and buildings which have been linked to virtual British royalty (Rothschilds) in Buckinghamshire. (note how evocative that is of Buckingham Palace), and in reality Diana lived at one point in the San Remo, where part of Eyes Wide Shut was set. Dodi Fayed family is Egyptian royalty and Aleister Crowley was famous for conducting research and rituals in Egypt and using ancient Egyptian texts for his occult practices. He was recreating ancient Egyptian rites. Crowley lived just down the street from THe San Remo, and Central Park is home to Cleopatra's Needle, an ancient Egyptian obelisk which is part of the NY Metropolitan Museum, located in Central Park, which houses a real Egyptian temple which was relocated along with the Obelisk from Egypt to Central Park.

               Aleister Crowley was famously part of 'Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Mia Farrow (Me a Pharoah) was in Purple Rose of Cairo, and Sting is famous for his obsession with Crowley's tarot deck, tantric ritual sex, and for living just down the street, smack beside Central Park , from The Majestic and The Dakota. Frank Sinatra was married to Mia Farrow when Rosemary's Baby was filmed in The Dakota, and some of Sinatra's mafia pals lived in The Majestic, which was known to be a mafia building. Sinatra's parents were from Sicily, Sinatra is Sicilian mafia bloodline, and Sicily is smack beside Malta, in fact Malta is really a tiny satellite island off of Sicily, its part of Sicily really, and Malta has been a British colony for EONS. The Knights of Malta are ancient British Templars. Sammy Davis Jr. was a member of the Knights of Malta and a member of the Church of Satan, so he knew lesbian Aquino and Atkins and likely was in on the entire Manson psy-op. Sammy Davis Jr. was in Britain with Queen Elizabeth , at Wimbledon, in 1957, when his friend and presumable occultist black lesbian tennis player Althea Gibson won Britain's Wimbledon tennis title. Musician 'Prince' Roger Nelson was born in 1958, a year after Elizabeth was with Sammy Davis in London. Prince Nelson was 5'3" tall and famously clothed himself in Royal Purple all his life. Sammy Davis Jr. was all of 5'2" tall and Elizabeth George, the occultist bitch who was crowned a Queen in 1953) was also 5'2" tall. Do the math. Queen Elizabeth knighted black actor Sidney Poitier who was from The Bahamas, her colony, (she is still Queen of the Bahamas to this very day) and launched a new era of interracial white masochism with her extreme liberal agenda and ramming Poitier's career to the forefront of 1960s culture with the film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, about a black doctor who marries a white woman against the wishes of her parents.

               Queen Elizabeth has been obsessed with guaranteeing the massive success of the likes of Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, the Jackson Five, Prince, Whitney Houston and financing the whole gamut of Motown and hiphop onto her CIA radio network all her life. Sumner Redstone was a founding member of her CIA, itself an offshoot of Mi6, paid to mainly spy on America FOR Britain, and to this very day he runs MTV for her. 'I want my MTV, sang Gordon Sumner, aka 'Sting', the British occultist' . He got his MTV , and more.He got right up into Central Parks's satanic Big Apple high society, along with Egyptian kabala accolyte Madonna , both of them lived nearby each other at Central Park, along with Joan Rivers. Sammy Davis Jr. was part Puerto Rican and a good friend of Bahamian Sidney Poitier. So Elizabeth seems to have inherited a fetish for sex with the slaves. And probably ROUGH sex by all indications, when you look at the massive Haitian and Jamaican and French Louisiana pimping networks which she has set up in all of her colonies, Quebec included. Perverse masochistic 'white slave to black master' torture involving whippings with heated wire coat hangers, multiple news stories of forcible confinement, gang insignia branding marks burnt into skin. rape with a hot curling iron in one case, etc.) This is what it sounds like..when Doves (white) cry.

               Elizabeth Installing Mugabe and Mandela and Obama to power. Then watching the fun,. Same pattern everywhere, now , feminists in authority appointing blacks to positions of power and control over the 'uppity' white underclass. With the constant hurling of desensitizing imagery into faces. "this is just the way it is, the way it is going to always be, resistance is futile," etc. Psychological warfare on an unimaginable scale. The counterculture reigns supreme.
Papa dont preach, she's keepin da babeh. oooooh, ooooh.

              Something to do with the rumored black Egyptian bloodlines. going on here? occultist Crowleyites? . The radio waves are licensed and governed to this day under military security protocols established a century ago. David Bowie lived near Sting and Madonna at Central Park, a block from Joan Rivers and Bill Cosby. gay Bowie married another bloodline type in Iman, his Somalian queen fashion model wife. probably more a convenience to Mi6 intel ops in N. Africa than a marriage, considering that he was a hardcore gay gender dissociative transsexual. The entire royal setlist is 100% interracial occult, due to Queen Elizabeths masochistic sexual obsession. She's obsessed with breeding some sort of N.African/Egyptian one world is enough global hybrid race of slaves
