<p>Two years ago, a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh considered filing a racketeering lawsuit against a Roman Catholic diocese over its handling of child sex-abuse complaints, but left office before he could make the bold move.</p>
<p>However, a colleague in Philadelphia is now taking aim at the church this month, sending grand jury subpoenas to dioceses throughout Pennsylvania as he tries to build a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney William McSwain of Philadelphia has a head start on the work, given the sweeping state grand jury report released this summer, which found that 301 priests molested more than 1,000 children over seven decades. McSwain, a Harvard Law School graduate and former Marine sniper platoon commander, was appointed by President Trump and took office just four months ago.</p>
<p>All but one of the state’s eight dioceses confirmed Thursday that they have received the federal subpoenas sent last week, and largely sounded willing to comply.</p>
<p>McSwain, among other things, wants to know if any priests took children across state lines for sex; viewed child pornography; reassigned predators; or used church funds or assets to cover up sexual misconduct. He has demanded the church turn over files from any “Secret Archives,” along with financial, personnel and treatment records. And he expects to take testimony from church leaders.</p>
<p>McSwain also demanded that bishops turn over any evidence that anyone in their ranks instructed anyone not to contact police. The subpoenas seek documents related to the dioceses’ organizational charts, finances, insurance and clergy assignments.</p>
<p>Two Eastern Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania — the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia and the Byzantine Archeparchy of Pittsburgh — also acknowledged they are under investigation.</p>
<p>While the subpoenas hint at possible charges of sexual exploitation of minors and fraud, legal experts said that if federal prosecutors can show that church leaders systematically covered up for child-molesting priests in the past five years, dioceses could also be charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, the law originally passed to bring down the Mafia.</p>
<p>The nearly 900-page Pennsylvania grand jury report found that church leaders had engaged in a systematic cover-up by shuffling accused priests around to different parishes and in some cases working to prevent police investigations. Most of the complaints were decades old, and because of the statute of limitations, only two priests were charged as a result of the investigation. Many other priests are dead.</p>

             Excellent links.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for sharing.  Ridiculous how these perpetrators are allowed to continue their abuse under the cloak of  "they will be supervised" and false front of not being exposed to children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time and time again it has been documented that these priests have been allowed to violate again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Horrific crimes, horrific abuse should require punishment.  Only a diabolical institution would continue to sweep these crimes under the carpet while relocating these priests continuing their evil pattern and predatory activities upon these innocent children.
