<p>Two years ago, a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh considered filing a racketeering lawsuit against a Roman Catholic diocese over its handling of child sex-abuse complaints, but left office before he could make the bold move.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney William McSwain of Philadelphia has a head start on the work, given the sweeping state grand jury report released this summer, which found that 301 priests molested more than 1,000 children over seven decades. McSwain, a Harvard Law School graduate and former Marine sniper platoon commander, was appointed by President Trump and took office just four months ago.</p>
<p>All but one of the state’s eight dioceses confirmed Thursday that they have received the federal subpoenas sent last week, and largely sounded willing to comply.</p>
<p>McSwain, among other things, wants to know if any priests took children across state lines for sex; viewed child pornography; reassigned predators; or used church funds or assets to cover up sexual misconduct. He has demanded the church turn over files from any “Secret Archives,” along with financial, personnel and treatment records. And he expects to take testimony from church leaders.</p>
<p>McSwain also demanded that bishops turn over any evidence that anyone in their ranks instructed anyone not to contact police. The subpoenas seek documents related to the dioceses’ organizational charts, finances, insurance and clergy assignments.</p>

<p>The nearly 900-page Pennsylvania grand jury report found that church leaders had engaged in a systematic cover-up by shuffling accused priests around to different parishes and in some cases working to prevent police investigations.

             Excellent links.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for sharing.  Ridiculous how these perpetrators are allowed to continue their abuse under the cloak of  "they will be supervised" and false front of not being exposed to children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time and time again it has been documented that these priests have been allowed to violate again and again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Horrific crimes, horrific abuse should require punishment.  Only a diabolical institution would continue to sweep these crimes under the carpet while relocating these priests continuing their evil pattern and predatory activities upon these innocent children.
