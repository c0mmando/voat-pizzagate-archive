<p>Former Jeb Bush campaign staffer Tim Miller was responsible for giving anti-Roy Moore information to the Washington Post, according to text messages obtained by Big League Politics.</p>
<p>Tim Miller is the co-founder of America Rising super PAC, which was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece by the Republican National Committee and the Senate Leadership Fund during the 2016 campaign cycle. Miller now works for Definers, which is a major vendor to America Rising. He served on the Bush campaign in a communications role and has since established himself as an anti-Trump Republican lauded by the anti-Trump left for his opposition to the Republican president.</p>

             Moore went through hell for political expediency. It's bad enough taking on an opponent, but when members of your own party actively work against you to construct an elaborate lie that will not only ruin your chances, but your good name, it must be a bitter pill to swallow!

             And they're still not giving up. Yeah, Nelson admitted to adding notes to the yearbook, but she didn't forge the signature? Come on! Of course, it's forged! Looks nothing like his signature!
            </p>
            <p>
             Figures it would lead back to the scummy Bushes. They might as well change their name to Clinton. And I feel the same way. I had a feeling it was all a pack of lies, and, man, am I gonna rub this it!

              I don't know if I am going to agree with Moore's politics if he is elected, but what is fair is fair.  I am a huge supporter of Clean Elections.  Not sure I would like his opponent's politics either.  But what is fair is fair.  Besides the Bushes and Clintons need to be outed as Partners In Crime not Enemies.
