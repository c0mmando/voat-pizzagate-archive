<p>The Chinese Communist Regime has surveilled every church and Christian in China via cameras, registration, membership, social credit system, public data imprints and espionage. People’s bio-metric data of face, voice and health information has been extracted through cameras, smart phones, apps, medical records and new bio-metric AI systems that detect health status. Megvii Face++, Sensetime and Huawei are companies that have facial and body recognition apparatus that can scan a face or body for skin, and vital organ health. </p>
<p>House Christians as Key Targets</p>
<p>Although Christians are scanned and their bio-metric data put in government data bases, the main victims are often House Christians who do not sign membership rosters or adhere to praying and worshiping their government leaders in the domain of their Church. Presently, many churches that are government approved have the picture of Chairman Xi pinned up. Xi is in Charge of a Socialist Regime, that has yet to arrive at full Communism according to China’s government. They run a similar socialist platform with Islamic characteristics. In China, they are attempting to replace the symbol of Jesus (Yeshua) with Socialist leader Xi,  in the same plane of respect with Christ. The Chinese Regime uses symbolism to weaken the drive and will of Tibetans, Uyghurs, Falun Dafa Practitioners, Christians and many other ethnic minorities in China. Those who resist and do not comply with the indoctrination, social credit system or AI based tech mandates, are tagged by the system and put in a dynamic organ donation system.</p>
<p>By default of non-compliance  resistors are subject to arrest, torture, rape, imprisonment, and medical testing for health and character evaluations. China since the 1980’s has been executing prisoners for their organs, including political decedents. </p>
<p>Matas and Kilgour reported 60,000 to 100,000 transplants a year for over 15 years are unaccounted for, and numerous inmates blood tested around the country. The inmates included Christian, Falun Dafa, Tibetan, Democracy activists and Uighur adherents. China has a dynamic organ procurement process by default. This default mainly lies in availability of target faith groups, slander and inhuman propaganda against them as sub-human, and greed for up to a million dollars per human body organ harvested. This includes hearts, livers, kidneys, corneas and other crucial elements in a human body. Through the variables, a dynamic process just operates behind the scenes under the nose of the police, military and the Chinese Communist leaders, in a country of 1.5 Billion people. Under the nose, means they are complicit, in the know, or involved and make money or favor. </p>

            Yes this has been going on for a long time in China. About five years ago I recall reading a very well sourced research page by a truther from Canada who stated the Chinese own a couple of hospitals in Canada and they do their organ transplants in Canada for big money and no one really knows where the organs are coming from as people are just getting them done. The Falun Gong are peaceful political protesters who the communist government loves to jail to use as donors because they do not smoke or drink and are very healthy with their body. In addition, there was a young girl under 10 years old from Toronto where rapper Drake is from who needed a donor as she was dying and she was on the wait list. Drake apparently heard about the story and surprised her in the hospital and told her they had the organ donation. This was on the news a couple years ago. Drakes logo is the owl Moloch which he puts all over his brand, he’s Kabbalah and heavily into the occult. How could a musician come up with a rare organ just like that? Well, he’s got a shit ton of money for one. Disturbing and sad.

             Kevin Annett , a former Anglican priest in Canada , has done a lot of work with Canadian Indigenous people. He has found out through talking with them over 50% of the children sent to their boarding schools have died. Lately on his website, he is telling of missing women and children on the west coast of Canada.....where they are drilling for oil. Chinese are  one of the groups drilling.They have dug up some of the missing women who had been  buried. MISSING ORGANS. His website is murderbydecree.

            I was hoping someone would post what’s going on over there. But I had no idea it had included organ harvesting. They are going underground to pray and bibles have been confiscated. And where is the pope on this? Just as quiet as a mouse. It’s just fine with him. We have heard before that they want to push Islam and here we have them replacing Christ with Xi. Just recently Jorge replaced one of the Italian recipes with halal. All that for only the 2 people that showed up.

            Don’t think it’s just going on in China bChristians are being maimed and murdered by Muslims who covet the death of pregnant Mothers. This could turn into a Rawanda they say if not stopped.
