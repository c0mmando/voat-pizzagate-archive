<p>But I went to Grotto Pizza today and alarm bells started going off for me. </p>
<p>I grew up in the Rehoboth area, and actually have eaten Grotto Pizza my whole life, but today I saw their logo on display all over one of their locations.</p>
<p>The logo is this: <a href="https://twitter.com/GrottoPizzaDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">https://twitter.com/GrottoPizzaDE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></p>
<p>Grotto is known for famously &quot;swirling&quot; their sauce but now this has a whole other meaning to me. </p>
<p>Having grown up and worked in Rehoboth I can offer some first-hand account on the probable connection to pizzagate, which had occurred to me well before noticing the Grotto logo. </p>
<p>The town is well-known as a gay friendly town, with many unofficially gay bars, restaurants, and beaches. Most of the gay vacationers are from DC. Not everyone may know but DC also has a huge gay community that is also well tied-in to politics. We all know now that David Brock owned an expensive home in Rehoboth. </p>
<p>I actually have a connection to a former Rehoboth Beach Patrol lifeguard, and have it on very good authority that strange men are frequently found at the beach photographing young children in their swimsuits, and the police have to be called several times a summer to deal with this, but these incidents never show up in the newspaper. </p>
<p>Moreover, I and a couple of friends had experiences where we were oggled and catcalled by gay guys in Rehoboth when we were 14-15 years old. My friend even had his ass grabbed as a gay man passed him on the street. </p>
<p>And believe it or not, I actually went to high school with the children of Earl Bradley, the worst pedophile in American history. I never met him myself, but I was in classes and athletics with his kids, who believe it or not are actually all very smart, well-adjusted, lovely people. Ask anyone in my town. That\'s what made the whole thing a total mind fuck when it came out. </p>
<p>I know this might sound too on the nose for some people, but I really did grow up in this beach area, which is a relatively small town for year round locals. I\'m not sure Earl Bradley has anything to do with pizzagate, unless he was selling his filmed material to these people, and Biden had something to do with keeping that under wraps. </p>
<p>But my main take away is that it is very very possible that there is this pedo mafia/gay mafia/ DC connection that is going on in Rehoboth.</p>',

            Definitely on to something, thanks for sharing this. Just the name "grotto" - it's the name used by the stupid "church of satan" or whatever by that little short jew LaVey. Kind of like a wtiches' coven, but they call it a grotto.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's disgusting that Rehoboth, which used to be a nice family beach, is now a cesspool of jew pedo faggots. I hope it gets cleaned up soon, with automatic rifle fire.

            Brock got his start in Dem politics through disgraced former Congressman Barney Frank (see pic above of a much younger Brock in a leather collar standing next to Frank in the maroon shirt). Why disgraced?
            <strong>
             Frank was caught up in a sex scandal back in the late 80s which involved allegations that a male prostitution ring was being run out of his DC apartment. This one ran all the way up the chain to the White House.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words,  it rounds about to... GWB and his own (black) boy lover rumor in... THE FRANKLIN SCANDAL.

             Brock got his start in Dem politics through disgraced former Congressman Barney Frank (see pic above of a much younger Brock in a leather collar standing next to Frank in the maroon shirt). Why disgraced?
             <strong>
              Frank was caught up in a sex scandal back in the late 80s which involved allegations that a male prostitution ring was being run out of his DC apartment. This one ran all the way up the chain to the White House.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words,  it rounds about to... GWB and his own (black) boy lover rumor in... THE FRANKLIN SCANDAL.

            I thought of a Rehoboth connection for similar reasons but did not know of the Grotto's logo. We should dig as there is HUGE overlap with the gay community of Rehoboth and the DC elite.

            Regarding Bradley, I always suspected some type of connection to Beau Biden's very untimely death after he spent so much time prosecuting him.  That dude, bradley, was majorly sick, but could there have been a larger group in the background that Biden wanted to do something about?  (doubtful given his pa, but was strange).  Follownig link just hits the topic generally

            awe man. i hope not - i love grotto pizza - worked in rehoboth and lived in dewey in college.  Yeah Rehoboth draws from Philly (where Bradley is from) and Baltimore too.  Definitely a lot of homosexuals with $ there (ala Alefantis at one time) and would be surprised if there wasn't PG connections to Rehoboth generally.   As for Grotto, is that a newish logo?  I havent actually been in about 2 years but I drive by every now and again and I thought the logo was a little different before

            Brock's home was bought and immediately demolished by Vardell Realty. Apparently it was an old inn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vardell Realty also bought and demolished another historic inn, against vociferous protests from Rehoboth inhabitants.

            , do you know this place, and have any info what might have gone on there? This urge by Vardell to demolish historic buildings in Rehoboth seems a bit strange no?

             That part of town is purely residential, so I have maybe driven past this place one but it isn't famous or anything. Maybe it was an old inn, but big deal. Real estate is huge in this area, and buildings are constantly being repurposed, renovated, rebuilt etc to get more money for a more modern house or hotel.

              Well it used to be a restaurant. Had some pretty rowdy parties. I was curious why such a building, like Brock's, would have to be demolished, and by the same agency too.

               People pay upwards in value for the entire house to have old colonials in that area to be restored, not demolished. Shit happened in that house and there has to be someone that still knows.

            Thanks for sharing your story. i think the real life experiences are very rewarding and help move the research along. That being said was there anything else about the shop that might make you feel there is more there besides the swirl? the pedo swirl is usually blue and more squared.

             There are actually many of these Grotto shops around the area, its like a network of them centered in Rehoboth DE.

            <p>
             The are also sort of known for hiring lots of Russians during the summer. Lots of seasonal towns have seasonal migrant workers, and there are actually agencies that specialize in bringing in people from eastern europe and russia during the summer, which sort of has a human trafficking vibe to it, but also is a pretty common practice as i understand.
            </p>

             Using the swirl as the logo and seeing it all over the shop struck me as a new thing though, I don't remember them using it a couple years ago, or maybe I just wouldn't have noticed.
