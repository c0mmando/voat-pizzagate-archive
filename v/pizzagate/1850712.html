            hurray!  Posts on Voat are getting good again, for a while it was so much re-hashed stuff.  I was thinking about the same about the pool party - what a coincidence.  Really well laid out, thanks and upvote, upvote!

            Actually, now that I've had some time to ponder, I think the shills may have blown this one. You keep up this shoddy work and you're going to get suicided, guys!
           </p>
           <p>
            This story has been out in the news for 9-10 hours, and yet there was no separate mocking shill thread about it until five minutes after I posted my explanation for the timing. Why? What was so threatening about what I said? There were a dozen threads about the Comey firing, hundreds of comments, stuff about Assange, stuff about McCain, just a whole lot of trigger words, but once I posted, they swung into action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, here's something. Could be coincidence, but I'm thinking it's not. In the Wikileaks dump of Podesta's emails do you remember the notorious pool party email from "Bonnie," with the three girls aged 11, 9, and almost 7? Of course you do!
           </p>
           <p>
            Turns out, that
            <a href="https://gumshoenews.com/2017/02/04/pizzagate-in-bite-size-pieces/">
             among the addressees was Laurie Rubiner
            </a>
            , a staffer working for CT Senator Richard Blumenthal.
            <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=78394">
             Rubiner is Blumenthal's chief of staff
            </a>
            . Before she became chief of staff to Blumenthal in 2010, she was a senior exec at Planned Parenthood. And before that, she was legislative director to then-Senator Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            So our secret word of the day is "Blumenthal"! He seems to be a current favorite of the Podestas. In 2016 they gave him $7,400, which puts him seventh after Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Kamala Harris, and three others. Since they give money to nearly half of Congress, this is significant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voaters have already had a look at Connecticut,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1621426">
             which has high levels of child sex trafficking
            </a>
            . I think a closer look at the Senator, his chief of staff, and his state are all warranted.
           </p>
           <p>
            How about it, shills? Am I getting warm?

              Turns out, that among the addressees was Laurie Rubiner, a staffer working for CT Senator Richard Blumenthal. Rubiner is Blumenthal's chief of staff. Before she became chief of staff to Blumenthal in 2010, she was a senior exec at Planned Parenthood. And before that, she was legislative director to then-Senator Hillary Clinton.

             , you should make this a separate post to draw attention to it. This certainly deserves it!

              Make sure you provide the link to the actual Wikileak Podesta email. Articles that fail to provide links to the original sources are immediately suspect, especially when that source is Wikileaks. To easy to be Fake News when you can't verify.
