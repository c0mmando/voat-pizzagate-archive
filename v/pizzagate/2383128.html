            Trump has been mobbed up since his teen years. He is in big with the Felix Sater and all the major traffickers.

            Trump knew very well what Epstein did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump supporters always say he threw Epstein out of his Florida club - that's right, but only because another member,  a father of a girl Epstein got interested in, complained.
           </p>
           <p>
            He socialized with Epstein, and even flew to Epstein's Island once. Not saying that he necessarily raped girls there, but he knew what Epstein did.

            You know that Israel has one of the worst records when it comes to child sex slavery, right? (

            ) Really, it is like people are trying to bury their heads in the sand as deeply as they can when it comes to Trump.  Trump is NOT draining the swamp.  Not even close.  You can't appoint the people that he has appointed (Goldman Sachs people, for starters) and get rid of the corruption.  They ARE the corruption.  Trust me, I would LOVE to think that Trump is on the up and up (since Clinton clearly has ties to child sex trafficking and is a sell out to Goldman Sachs, and is a major Zionist to boot) -- but just look at who he surrounds himself with.  Trump is a hardcore Zionist.  That is why he is moving the Embassy to Jerusalem.  He has sold out to Israel -- not made a "deal" with them.  The Mossad actually makes our CIA look like choir boys in the ethics and morality department.  Israel has one of the worst records when it comes to human trafficking (and yes that includes sex trafficking, even children) and organ trafficking.  Do you really  think that the Mossad is going to go after any tribe members to clean up that swamp?  Nope.  Not going to happen.  You don't make a deal with the devil and expect an angelic outcome.  If he did make a deal with the Mossad -- he is either a traitor or he really is the massive idiot that his critics claim he is.

             There's also the theory that Trump's embassy move was a cynical and calculated ploy to shore up his support among his brain-dead right-wing Evangelical "Christian" base.

            sounds legit.  Sounds like the wealthy elite were doing their own thing and caught up with world domination fantasies and Israel just wants safety and prosperity as a state.  The mossad would only want the same, but there would be those in the mossad who are mercenaries.  All we have to do is convince them through enough deeds to that end that we will pay better than the frozen assets of their soon to be dead puppet masters anyway....

              Not for the Khazars and I need no man to do the deed of gathering me up to go to Israel.  This israel is an imposter in will be invaded by the organized world of muslims under their Mahdi who is the Biblical antichrist.  Mid invasion Jesus will set foot down on the Mt of Olives and deal with the remnant of Baal worshipers there FIRST before setting out to take care of all of the Muslim nations.
