<p>Intro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corey Dale “Coraline Ada” Ehmke is a software developer. At a 2013 conference, “Ehmke was among a group of people who announced the creation of a community for LGBT technologists called LGBTech. During this announcement, she also came out publicly as transgender.”</p>
<p>Ehmke has become a notorious SJW (“social justice warrior”) and habitually accuses his/“her” critics of “transphobia” and “misogyny.” One of the things that SJWs seek to prohibit as “hate speech,” for example, is the practice of “dead-naming,” i.e., referring to transgender people by their birth names. In many cases, however, this prohibition is intended to enable deception, particularly in terms of concealing possible important information about a person’s past. Convicted sex offenders may use a transgender identity in an attempt to conceal their criminal record.</p>
<p>In the case of Corey/“Coraline” Ehmke, however, perhaps his/“her” involvement in the occult is what he/“she” is trying to hide. Under the pseudonym “Corey Bantik,” Ehmke has spent 20 years promoting himself/”herself“ as a practitioner of “Egyptian Ritual Magick”:</p>
<p>The Reverend Doctor Corey Bantik has been actively pursuing his esoteric studies for almost twenty years. His earliest experiments involved what he called “natural magick”, but his interest soon turned to the study and practice of western esoteric traditions and ceremonial magick. He began the study of Qabala in 1989, investigating traditional Judaic sources as well as the more readily available European interpretations. Rev. Bantik founded and led a small Golden Dawn study group in the mountains of Virginia, and for several years thereafter immersed himself in the works of Aleister Crowley, A. E. Waite, Eliphas Levi and Kenneth Grant.
In the early 1990s, Rev. Bantik became an active member of the small but tight-knit community of online occultists that interacted through the alt.magick Usenet groups and IRC channels like #thelema. This is the community that pioneered such concepts as real-time multi-user virtual ritual spaces and later went on to create Nutmeg, the organization of occultists, mystics, and persons of “alternative spiritualities” organized to explore the community-building potential of the then-new Internet. Rev. Bantik served on the Board of Directors of Nutmeg for several years and helped coordinate the annual gathering of its members from across the world.</p>
<p>The historic association between the satanic Crowley and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is well-known. The reference by Ehmke/“Bantik” to creating “a small Golden Dawn study group in the mountains of Virginia” evidently refers to Ehmke’s time as a student at Radford University, where he dropped out after his freshman year.</p>
<p>Ehmke is a psychiatric basket case, on medication for “bipolar depression and anxiety.” However, his/“her” mental illness has not prevented Ehmke from trying to tell other people what they are allowed to think:</p>
<p>Ehmke is known for the creation of the “Contributor Covenant,” a list of behavioural rules intended to govern the behaviour of coders working on open source projects. Among the behaviours banned by the covenant are “insulting/derogatory comments,” “public or private harassment,” and “other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.”
Crucially, contributors to open source projects — who are typically unpaid, freely volunteering their time and skills to improve open source software — are expected to follow the code within open-source communities and everywhere else on the web.
For example, if a coder makes an “insulting/derogatory comment” on Twitter that’s entirely unconnected to their coding work, they are still liable to be kicked out of their open source project if the project is governed by the Contributor Code. It’s a recipe for policing the behaviour of the entire open source community across the whole of the world wide web.</p>
<p>In other words, if you have an opinion that someone else deems “inappropriate” or “derogatory,” you can be banned from a project, even if the subject never comes up in the context of the project. You once said something “inappropriate” on Twitter? Banned!</p>
<p>To understand how this works, consider the so-called “Opalgate” case. ..</p>

<p>Censored within 30 mins from 4chan by the kiwifarms pedo admins, last time I was there a year ago. All youtube videos on that link censored from jewtube because you got to respect pedo cults.</p>

<p>I can\'t update ticket\'s anymore. freedesktop\'s social justice warriors found out I\'m an anti-pedophilia activist on IRC and said if you disrespect pedosexuals away from freedesktop infrastructure we will ban you on it proactively - because we can\'t have any programmers that don\'t like sex with children  or anyone that doesn\'t respect pedophiles talking to our programmers.</p>
<p><a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106625">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106625</a> &lt;- and banned for proving the head of social justice policy enforcement wrong on 3x technical issues.</p>
<p>They have a policy that all sexual preference including pedosexuals be respected, and since pedophilia is a &quot;sexual preference&quot; according to the DSM-IV / DSM-V thanks to the work of James Cantor in Canada and his pedo love gang or MAP (Minor Attracted Persons) groups combined with Freedesktop Code of conduct, you must love sex with children to be an open source developer or work with them!</p>
<p>&quot;Our Pledge</p>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

<p>If you want to see who the SOB james Cantor is, you can see him come on with CNN\'s gay child rape victim Don Lemon just after he said Jerry Sandusky was a nice guy on these Huffington Post hosted videos:</p>

<p>&amp; here\'s someone elses research on this OTO Thelemite tranny gay dad pedophilia normalization activist:</p>
<p>&quot;Coraline Ada&quot;, who was recently fired from GitHub and then wrote an article about how wrong they were to fire her ( archive.is/FPMUF ), was hired for $240k/yr from GitHub despite being unable to hold down a job longer than 1 year for 5 consecutive years ( twitter.com/AntisocialJW2/status/884589627268407297 ).</p>
<p>So recently the woman who hired Coraline, Nicole Sanchez, &quot;resigned&quot; and &quot;financial pressure&quot; was cited as a contributing factor ( archive.fo/jEcXb#selection-2435.406-2441.60 ). It\'s BuzzFeed, so &quot;financial pressure&quot; must be how they summarize &quot;she gave unqualified political allies senior positions for $240,000 a year.&quot;</p>
<p>So it turns out there is one woman who kicked off this diversity in tech shit at GitHub, Julie Ann Horvath. And it turns out this token hire had the expected opinions on the Milo at Berkeley Riots which caused over $500,000 in property damage: &quot;I would also like to remind you that property is not more important than human rights.&quot; ( twitter.com/nrrrdcore/status/827041779044093952 )</p>
<p>This woman, who seems to be no stranger to getting positions she\'s unqualified for due to political allies, has some very interesting opinions on the undue damage that ANTIFA rioters caused to private business owners.</p>
<p>This is insensitive and inhumane. Cartoonishly so. And hence, this woman has provided the perfect inspiration for the movie villain or anti-hero of your choice: twitter.com/SiO2Doper/status/886414598139760640</p>

           Intro:

          <blockquote>
           <p>

           Censored within 30 mins from 4chan by the kiwifarms pedo admins, last time I was there a year ago. All youtube videos on that link censored from jewtube because you got to respect pedo cults.

           I can't update ticket's anymore. freedesktop's social justice warriors found out I'm an anti-pedophilia activist on IRC and said if you disrespect pedosexuals away from freedesktop infrastructure we will ban you on it proactively - because we can't have any programmers that don't like sex with children  or anyone that doesn't respect pedophiles talking to our programmers.

           They have a policy that all sexual preference including pedosexuals be respected, and since pedophilia is a "sexual preference" according to the DSM-IV / DSM-V thanks to the work of James Cantor in Canada and his pedo love gang or MAP (Minor Attracted Persons) groups combined with Freedesktop Code of conduct, you must love sex with children to be an open source developer or work with them!

           If you want to see who the SOB james Cantor is, you can see him come on with CNN's gay child rape victim Don Lemon just after he said Jerry Sandusky was a nice guy on these Huffington Post hosted videos:

           &amp; here's someone elses research on this OTO Thelemite tranny gay dad pedophilia normalization activist:
          </p>
          <p>
           "Coraline Ada", who was recently fired from GitHub and then wrote an article about how wrong they were to fire her ( archive.is/FPMUF ), was hired for $240k/yr from GitHub despite being unable to hold down a job longer than 1 year for 5 consecutive years ( twitter.com/AntisocialJW2/status/884589627268407297 ).
          </p>
          <p>
           So recently the woman who hired Coraline, Nicole Sanchez, "resigned" and "financial pressure" was cited as a contributing factor ( archive.fo/jEcXb#selection-2435.406-2441.60 ). It's BuzzFeed, so "financial pressure" must be how they summarize "she gave unqualified political allies senior positions for $240,000 a year."
          </p>
          <p>
           So it turns out there is one woman who kicked off this diversity in tech shit at GitHub, Julie Ann Horvath. And it turns out this token hire had the expected opinions on the Milo at Berkeley Riots which caused over $500,000 in property damage: "I would also like to remind you that property is not more important than human rights." ( twitter.com/nrrrdcore/status/827041779044093952 )
          </p>
          <p>
           This woman, who seems to be no stranger to getting positions she's unqualified for due to political allies, has some very interesting opinions on the undue damage that ANTIFA rioters caused to private business owners.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is insensitive and inhumane. Cartoonishly so. And hence, this woman has provided the perfect inspiration for the movie villain or anti-hero of your choice: twitter.com/SiO2Doper/status/886414598139760640

            Ehmke has become a notorious SJW (“social justice warrior”) and habitually accuses his/“her” critics of “transphobia” and “misogyny.” One of the things that SJWs seek to prohibit as “hate speech,” for example, is the practice of “dead-naming,” i.e., referring to transgender people by their birth names. In many cases, however, this prohibition is intended to enable deception, particularly in terms of concealing possible important information about a person’s past. Convicted sex offenders may use a transgender identity in an attempt to conceal their criminal record.

             It appears the SRS/SBBH pedo downvote gang was here. I have more success putting it on my own subverse. I wonder how i was unbanned without notification by the pedomods?

              Yeah, I noticed the downvoats  Pedo supporters for sure if there is mention of how to avoid the sex offender registries.  Wouldn't they just love that.  They were out in full force yesterday too in the post on the Child Trafficking Camp in Az.  Not surprising though and it usually goes with the territory.
