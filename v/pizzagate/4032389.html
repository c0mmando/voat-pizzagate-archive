Had 20 hard drives of CP, one of them  a 4-terrabyte hard drive. Seems like a large scale long term operation that won\'t be fully investigated, like Jerry Sandusky\'s network. The local PD turned over evidence to local FBI, which essentially guarantees further investigation gets quashed. Krampf had &quot;transported images&quot; nationally and internationally and had been &quot;at it a long time.&quot; So who were his contacts?</p>
<p>Likely never to be known. From the bio on his website it says, in 1997 he was visiting as many as 180 schools a year which gave him plenty of opportunities to develop the hobby of nature photography in the Everglades and Florida\'s wetlands. Doesn\'t even say he had a BS degree let alone MS. Weird.  Was he getting blackmail material on other scientists and getting jobs that way?</p>

            If Krampf is Mormon, the investigation will be quashed.

            If he is not Mormon, they'll bury him alive.

            Even the FBI in Utah is controlled by the Mormon church.
