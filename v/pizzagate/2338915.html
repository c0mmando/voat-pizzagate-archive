            Yes, it is happening, but the pushback is also intensifying.
MSM attacks on Trump have reached frenzied levels and tens of millions of gullible Americans are eating that stuff up.
The Shareblue shitheads are massively invading sites - including this one - all over the internet.
Good hearted people need to up their efforts and engage by talking with colleagues, relatives who seem uneasy about this craziness all around us.
Learn yourselves and be ready to steer people to readily grasped sources to further this ongoing awakening.
It IS happening, but it sure ain't over yet.

            <p>
             Great summary.  Hear me out on this as i would like your advice.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know this story (and any "conspiracy" in general) is a big puzzle.  One individual piece does not allow a person to see WHAT the picture is,  but once all (or at least most) of the pieces are laid out and in place the picture becomes very clear.  This is how I see the pizzagate story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now,  getting normies to see the "big picture" in this massive puzzle that is pizzagate requires showing them most of the pieces.  This normally takes hours and hours as it requires to woke person to search and compile all the info in real time while the normie is trying to get learned up on this story. What if someone put together a comprehensive, objective and fully sourced PowerPoint presentation which would serve as an official "Box" for all the puzzle pieces?  Do you think that would be helpful to wake  up normies?  It would save so much time in having to track down links and sources while explaining what this whole thing is....

            The Pentagon audit is theater. The majority of people still use MSM. Sheeple outnumber us at least 100 to 1.  Most the alternative media is limited hangout, it has been subverted. Russian- US relations are not decided by political actors, it is decided by the banking cartel who control the money supply and contorl the countries themselves. I like Ed from the OutteR light, but he doesn't put things together very often and he apologizes after every theory of what he thinks is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing is happenig in our favor. Agenda 21 is live. The USA is not a government. It was abolished decades ago, we are part of the UN Charter. We are not taxed by our government, we are taxed by foreign entities and our politicians know this. We have been brainwashed, robbed, cheated and enslaved. And we like it. Or most of you do anyhow. Wake up. Rothschilds owns our water supply, CIA is taking control of food distribution and the law says in emergencies they also can seize fuel sources. The courts are a sham, elections are phony, FBI,CIA,NSA, NASA, IRS all work for the controllers, not the USA. We are a corporation owned by Bank of England, Vatican, Crown and other elite bankers. Your days are numbered. Including the shills, They are useful idiots that will be discarded as well when the time comes. I would advise listeing to Eustic Mullins. Then you need to take in the info that Deborah Tavares is laying out about agenda 21. It is already started.

             Trump has been blocking the NWO agenda like Paris and TPP.

              its super easy to edit your post and more people will actually read it if you do.
             </p>
             <p>
              just a small tip if you want more people to read your posts. break it up into paragraphs.

            I also believe it's finally happening, I think they call it the snowball effect, it starts small  then runs and runs until it's completely out of anyone's control. This is possibly the most dangerous time in history. I can't see them just rolling over, but they also know that their age old plans can be left in tatters from this awakening. Now is the time to stand up and be counted. Believe me millions are already fully awake and red pilled.
