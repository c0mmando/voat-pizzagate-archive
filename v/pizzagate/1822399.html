            I wondered if the effects of the Great Depression rendered the 1930s audiences oblivious to Miss Temple's not-so-veiled sexuality.  Evidently not.
           </p>
           <p>
            A perverted critic wound up being sued (successfully) and almost jailed for his review of her movie, "Wee Willie Winkie" -
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is part speculation, and part absolute truth, but in 1937, Shirley Temple starred in a film called Wee Willie Winkie directed by John Ford. Keep in mind that,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              in 1937, Shirley Temple was nine years old, but that didn’t stop literary master Graham Greene — in a film review for the magazine Night and Day — from making some very strange, very unseemly suggestions about Temple, her perception, and the kind of dirty old men that were allegedly fond of her “well-shaped and desirable little body
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .”
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the Graham Greene review, which went as far as to call Temple a “totsy,” ultimately got him and his magazine sued by Shirley Temple’s guardians and 20th Century Fox. In the suit, Temple and the studio won £3,500 for the defamatory review of Wee Willie Winkie, and the magazine shut down
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The speculation part is that Graham Greene apparently fled to Mexico that year in order to avoid criminal prosecution for the film review. According to the autobiography of Greene’s close friend, the cinema pioneer Alberto Cavalcanti, papers were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but Greene was never arrested
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            In either rate, he did go to Mexico, and that’s where he wrote his masterpiece, The Power and the Glory, so something positive came out of the scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the review? It’d get Greene ran out on a rail in 2014. While it probably wouldn’t result in a libel suit, Graham would certainly be fired for it. It is … wrong. In fact, it almost sounds like a tongue-in-cheek review from The Onion.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              The owners of a child star are like leaseholders — their property diminishes in value every year. Time’s chariot is at their backs: before them acres of anonymity
             </strong>
            </strong>
            . What is Jackie Coogan now but a matrimonial squabble?
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Miss Shirley Temple’s case, though, has peculiar interest: infancy with her is a disguise, her appeal is more secret and more adult. Already two years ago she was a fancy little piece — real childhood, I think, went out after The Littlest Rebel). In Captain January she wore trousers with the mature suggestiveness of a Dietrich: her neat and well-developed rump twisted in the tap-dance: her eyes had a sidelong searching coquetry. Now in Wee Willie Winkie, wearing short kilts, she is a complete totsy. Watch her swaggering stride across the Indian barrack-square: hear the gasp of excited expectation from her antique audience when the sergeant’s palm is raised: watch the way she measures a man with agile studio eyes, with dimpled depravity. Adult emotions of love and grief glissade across the mask of childhood, a childhood skin-deep
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              It is clever but it cannot last — middle aged men and clergymen — respond to her dubious coquetry, to the sight of her well-shaped and desirable little body, packed with enormous vitality, only because the safety curtain of story and dialogue drops between their intelligence and their desire
             </strong>
            </strong>
            . “Why are you making my Mummy cry?” - what could be purer than that? And the scene when dressed in a white nightdress she begs grandpa to take Mummy to a dance - what could be more virginal? On those lines in her new picture, made by John Ford, who directed The Informer, is horrifyingly competent. It isn’t hard to stay to the last prattle and the last sob. The story — about an Afghan robber converted by Wee Willie Winkie to the British Raj — is a long way after Kipling. But we needn’t be sour about that. Both stories are awful, but on the whole Hollywood’s is the better.”

            Ted Danson appeared in a TV movie which featured some of the "Shirtley Temple" footage . . . 
as an excuse?  Not sure.  As the link indicates very clearly this was a terrible movie which let
the father/abuser off the hook completely.  Only therapy was required
            <a href="https://www.datalounge.com/thread/12173284-something-about-amelia">
             https://www.datalounge.com/thread/12173284-something-about-amelia
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Glenn Close was also in it playing the mother.  Very odd movie, indeed!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Another part of this Shirley Temple thing that bothers me is what it was teaching other
young children -- i.e., that it was a good thing to dress that way and behave that way.
            <br/>
            Maybe even that it made you lovable?
           </p>
           <p>
            EDITED to add two comments --
           </p>
           <p>
            First, that the very name of the TV movie "Something about Amelia" suggests to me that the
intention was to place the blame for the sexual abuse on the young daughter, Amelia.
As I pointed out above, the movie seemed to be trying to provide excuses for the abuse.
Blaming the victim is very common in these sexual assaults.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, that in reading about pedophiles, it becomes very clear that pedophiles can be created by generational sexual abuse/torture.
            <br/>
            And, as a by-product of this torture/sexual abuse can produce alternate personalities in some of the victims through "disassociation."
The host/victim can be completely unaware of the other personalities or how they are being programmed or used.
And that our CIA's/MKULTRA used these tactics of torture/sexual abuse to do just that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the victims were used as homosexual prostitutes, as drug runners, and as spies/espionage for blackmail.
Some were programmed with new language abilities and other "talents" to complete their missions.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Another point about these sexual abusers is that they are males and that they are heterosexual males according to studies.
According to studies, pedophiles are not described as having a "gender orientation."
However, heterosexual males as described in the "Amelia" story are described as
            <strong>
             "situational pedophiles"
            </strong>
            which means that while they may prefer women, when a woman is not available to them, they will sexually assault a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted the study which shows that heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male ...
but if anyone would like the details, I'll be happy to repeat it.

              A lot of Hollywood people Scientologists... so believe in God, or believe that he was a hologram created by aliens. Just don't be a normal Atheist.

               I've read about Scientology and had the pleasure of living in an area where they operated. They're obviously a cult but what's funny that nobody really seems to care. You have an actual cult with "powerful" celebrities in it and nobody bats an eye. Scientology pulled

               Now when it's theorized that some of our politicians and rich citizenry may be cult members such as Luciferians or Satanists you get called a crazy.

South Korea isn't the third world and is propped up by the US, I don't understand why people don't think this shit happens here. It's really laughable.
