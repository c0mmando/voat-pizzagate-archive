<li>&quot;If you are an aspiring CIA lawyer living in the Southwest, and this boys town in Omaha had been exposed, and you could no longer have a spot because of the increased attention in Boys town, you might pick another place, maybe a city in Texas and that\'s all I\'ll say about that.  And you might keep the kids there.  And then you might have the Stringers, the people who are finding kids and bringing those kids to that Texas town.  And that\'s why you have a lot of people with automatic weapons there and that\'s why you have this kind of harem situation.  Now if a couple of people living there, like the beta males not the alpha males the stringers going and getting these kids, but a couple of beta males are saying, &quot;hey this is sex trafficking&quot;, then if you have a problem.

            You want to connect Pizzagate with the Franklin Scandal? Here you go: GOP presidential candidate and current political commentator (who, coincidentally, is  NATIONAL PIZZA CHAIN ENTREPRENEUR) is tied to Franklin.

             No doubt.  The root problem of the Franklin Scandal never went away.  Pedophilia in government has persisted for decades.

            I think George Webb (in the above clip) is referring to the massacre in Waco, Texas, where US officials were attempting to cover up their high crimes of trafficking of drugs, guns and kidnapped children.:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Two of the Branch Davidian village members had been able to hack into the Pentagon/CIA/FBI Black Ops databases, and discovered that the CIA, utilizing Buffalo Airlines, were transferring Cocaine, laundered money, special operations agents,
            <strong>
             kidnapped children for CIA pedophile programs
            </strong>
            , and arms at the World War Two runway bordering the Branch Davidian Village.
           </p>
           <p>
            "CIA's Buffalo Airlines activities were tied directly to George Bush Sr., and his direct involvement with CIA, the Mafia, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru, and other locations, including the global elites' intelligence and banking operations, drug and arms transfers, child pedophile kidnapping and transfers, aircraft refueling, and global money laundering network.”

             For clarity: when things fell apart at Boys' Town in Nebraska (Franklin Scandal implicating elite pedophiles in the US government), the kids had to be moved. Webb implies that they were moved to a town in Texas where harems and automatic weapons eventually came into play. (this can only mean WACO).
            </p>
            <p>
             Boys' Town did officially open a chapter in San Antonio in the late 80's, but I doubt that's the scenario Webb was referring to.
