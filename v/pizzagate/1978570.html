            The agents mentioned are from NY as well as the US District Attorney. The NYPD commissioner was also there. This was all in Michigan. This special agent was told to stand down by McCabe in the Clinton Investigation and the US attorney (Obama &amp; Clintonite connected to Comey) who was handling the case refused to resign under AG Sessions so Trump called him personally and fired him. Shortly after Weiner is swept into court and convicted. Possibly a grand jury is happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: As has now been filled in with more evidence and I spoke of 5 hours ago this raid happened as a result of NY FBI field office agents who were told to stand down by Deputy Director McCabe (who took $700,000 dollars from HRC buddy Gov. Terry Mcaullife) during email investigation. And was under investigation for his treatment of another counterterroism agent that then DIA General Michael Flynn took a stand for and was subsequently fired after telling the Obama/Clinton team to stop funding ISIS.
           </p>
           <p>
            McCabe personally went after Gen. Flynn with the fake Russia story even though he was required to recuse himself, he also never recused himself from HRC investigation. He &amp; Comey and Mueller are close buddies along with the US Attorney I hinted at earlier that was in charge of the Clinton Foundation. Preet Baharra was that attorney holding back the investigation. He was asked to resign by AG Jeff Sessions and refused forcing Trumps hand to fire him personally. He had the nerve to show up at Comey's Senate testimony with a reserved seat from D-Chuck Shumer sitting right behind him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once these guys were removed the NY FBI field office could act on Eric Braverman's information and the US Attorney that replaced Preet took charge and search warrants started flying.
This is why all the NY agents were there. They scooped up Weiner, indicted him, probably turned him and now it is on. Yes Huma is connected to Hezbollah. If you only knew. There is a doctor practicing right now in an exclusive plastic surgery clinic who was indicted for massive Medicare fraud and sexual crimes against his patients. He fled to Iraq for the past few years and is directly linked to Hezbollah. He re-entered the US under Obama admin kept his medical liscense and is practising medicine in an exclusive area now. You would be shocked to know his name and history or has he still maintains a medical liscence. I called his office as follow up to investigation and was told he was working in clinic that day and would I like to schedule an appointment with him!

             Giant jigsaw puzzle involving our entire planet.  I cannot point you to  an exact article, phrase, or video. 
The sudden raid in Dearborn was poorly reported by MSM, no big surprise, with the famous endings of we will keep you updated.  Bull shit with that.  There will be no updates. 
It happened, boxes were removed, some asshole was arrested, who owned the house, will we ever know ANYTHING about this actual residence, who owned it, was it a shell for another organization.  With all of our endless hours spent with research and reporting on the hundreds of subparts that we refer to as "pizzagate," they all interact and interweave.
It is a web of evil that interconnects with each and every subpart.  I have no definitive answers, but I do  believe this puzzle is 75% done, and it must not be completed.  It has to be dismantled.  I am 64 years of age, and if I am fortunate enough to live another 5 years, I see our nation, America, in ruins.  Thinking of the exquisite mandelas the Buddhist monks create from sand, spending endess, meaningful hours creating their work of art, and once it's completed, the monks destroy it.  Such an important lesson.

             Oh fuck AreWeSure, Eric Braverman contacted the FBI Field Office in addition to NBC:

             What's that? You forgot who Eric Braverman is? Really? Ok, I'll play along. Eric Braverman is the former head of the Clinton Foundation who quit out of the blue, contact a reporter at NBC and said "Follow the money.". Here's a quick refresher:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/meet-man-who-can-expose-real-hillary-clinton-scandal">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             What's that? He said "Follow de Money". He was in a hurry and left out the "Count". Got it.
            </p>
            <p>
             So he meant
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db3e8Qw9hhs">
              "Follow Count de Money".
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, it's so obvious now. You're always right. What was I thinking.

               1) Was Justin Cooper an informant?

              </p>
              <p>
               What's that? It's Comey and Mueller's word against the FBI field office? Ok, time to break out the crayons again.
              </p>
              <p>
               Comey's been caught lying to Congress. And Mueller has already gang raped the rules demanding his impartiality as he "investigates" the Russian Hacking

            Then it's got nothing nefarious about it. Huma Abedin works for Hillary &amp; Co. They invented ISIS along with Israel and the Saudis to fight Assad and Iran's Hezbollah in Syria.

            It's impossible for anyone so closely related to Huma Abedin to be fucking around with Hillary &amp; Co enough to warrant an FBI Raid. It would be insane actually.
