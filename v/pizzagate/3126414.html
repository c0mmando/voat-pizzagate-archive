<p>This is what it\'s all about here folks, pure <strong>Satanic/Luciferian ritual magick</strong> and <strong>Hollywood</strong>...</p>
<p>In an interesting development matriculating <em>this month</em> that could become <strong><em>world news</em></strong> is the  <strong>FERVENT ACCUSATION</strong> by <strong>Queensland, Australia</strong> recording artist <strong>Zheani</strong> against  the <strong>Australian &quot;Zef&quot; band Die Antwoord</strong> and it\'s frontman <strong>Watkin Tudor &quot;Ninja&quot; Jones and Anri &quot;Yolandi Visser&quot; du Toit</strong> in everything from <strong>drugging, demonic rape, to sex trafficking.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Antwoord">Die Antwoord</a> came on the scene in 2009 with their rap anthems for the South African &quot;countercultural&quot; movement called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zef">&quot;Zef&quot;</a> who claim to be <strong>&quot;Buddhist Vegans&quot;</strong> who would not harm a soul. But <strong>Zheani</strong> has a very different version of events and outlines <em>more than a few</em> <strong><em>very horrific incidents</em></strong> with <strong>&quot;Ninja&quot;</strong> which included a night out in the Australian desert on mushrooms where he <strong><em>pretended to morph into a demon and violently rape her</em></strong>, all backed up by text messages and screen shots of all her emails and texts. She describes this horrific abuse through a <strong>MUSIC VIDEO</strong> in response to a cease and desist from Jones and his lawyers.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot address of every correspondence between <strong><em>Ninja and Zheani</em></strong> from her video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY6hCE2D-cc&amp;t=2s">&quot;The Question&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>The corresponding texts supporting this womans accusations are <em>horrific and very graphic and could be triggering</em> to some individuals:</p>

<p>What makes this <strong><em>much more interesting</em></strong> and <em>potentially connected to the entire saga</em> around <strong>PIZZAGATE</strong> is that during some of this texting and correspondence with <strong>Die Antwoords Ninja</strong> he was discussing an upcoming movie project about them and told <strong>Zheani</strong> that he would probably have to <strong><em>HAVE SEX WITH JAMES FRANCO AT SOME STAGE</em></strong>. (Third screenshot down from video <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CgMMgqu">https://imgur.com/a/CgMMgqu</a></p>
<p>Now, we all have an idea through <strong>Crazy Days and Nights</strong> that <strong>James Franco</strong> is highly connected in Hollywood not only to <strong>David Geffen and Glee\'s Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuck</strong>, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2348105">Mark Salling and Haitian Child Porn</a> and of course, <strong>The Clintons</strong>, leading us back full circle to <strong>PIZZAGATE</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2328750">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2328750</a></p>
<p>This guy <strong>Ninja</strong> says some <strong>UNBELIEVABLE stuff about &quot;gushing</strong>  and <strong>RITUAL MAGICK</strong>, that his <strong>Hollywood Execs are real mafia dogs</strong>, and claims to have initiated contact with this <strong>Zheani because she was a Stoner WITCH that could help him access other dimensions.</strong> (Which is an actual occult aim of why the elite molest children).</p>
<p>This saga is about to blow up, and once again, <strong><em>voat pizzagate</em></strong> is on top off it. <strong><em>I knew there was something WAY OFF about this group from the very beginning.</em></strong></p>',

            I watched the music video and read the texts in it. The Ninja guy seemed to be attracted to her in particular because she identified as a witch. I wonder what being a witch meant to her.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also the part where he brands her with "witch" during a ceremony. That reminds me of the Nexium (sp) cult people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've heard about the idea of reaching other dimensions by raping children before. From what I remember in one lecture, the guy said they rape the kid to access the Tunnels of Typhon. By doing that it lets them access another dimension where they are a god, and suck energy from that other dimension. I've also heard they think it will steal some youth from the kid and make themselves live forever.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if they actually believe that stuff, or if it's just an excuse to molest kids. Either way, it's the darkest of dark behavior.

             Yes, it's called transuphian magick or some crap (can't even begin to know how to spell this nonsense). It was spoken about by Bill Schnoebelen. He does an expose of Freemasonry. You can choose to believe or disbelieve him, but he was speaking of some sick magical practice Crowley was into. Raping little boys to access other universes/dimensions to rule over. Gross.

            I read everything and I'm not trying to agitate, but I'm not seeing it. He talked about throat fucking and assfucking her slowly to gangsta rap and she absolutely was down. 
Also, I read the texts and she says "We drank it an hour ago" while he was in
            <strong>
             another country
            </strong>
            but then she claimed she was "still hallucinating" days later? 
Last, "this ain't no metoo shit"? And she wants to be famous?
           </p>
           <p>
            Too many ifs here. I am open to changing my mind but this doesn't seem true, although he definitely has a sick incest fetish but that's not illegal, even if it's gross.

            He has some interesting things to say about her as well like making satanic porn for chinese businessmen, looks like these two might

             He is lying so bad. It’s beyond obvious. DA is one hell of a fucked up mix and they certainly are nowhere near being “vegan Buddhist’s” and if he wanted to distance himself so bad why did he even think to allow her to become their personal assistant bringing them vegan meals. Further, her giving the rapper her number within “10 seconds of meeting” is ridiculous. Imagine meeting someone and count ten seconds NO sorry she may have later on to work with him or whatever but this idiot is exaggerating so bad and keeps distancing himself from her calling her a star fucker. Riiiiiiiight.

             Watch this dirtbag Ninja try to defend his position here. It is simply an admission of guilt saying that all those "prostitutes" that were throwing the pussy at him are out for his money, yeah, yeah , yeah we've heard it a million times until a woman of worth and power says no to your dirty tricks to get the pussy fast and easy then toss it away. Pretending to turn into a demon and ravaging a woman in a confused state of consent is still rape and this is one of the wickedest stories I've ever heard. It really sounds like this guy is taking most of his plays right from Aleister Crowley.

            Die Antwoord, you say?  The Hoaxtead crew used one of their videos to push their 'Hampstead was a hoax' narrative; here:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/zRJND5SjnKQ">
             ELLA dRAPER CHILD ABUSE CULT............ THE BEGINNING
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple of months back I asked PGIssDumb5 how they could use a music video without being struck my a copyright warning from Youtube.  Then I found out that Aphex Twin worked with Antwoord on their album and he is suspected of working with the CIA.  Notice that comments have now been disabled on the video, coincidentally since I posted my comment.  You can see it here:

             When you say "practicing witch", well, that can mean a lot of things. Wiccan. Satanist. Harry Potter fanatic. Even if she was sacrificing animals to the devil, she's still a rape victim by law if her tales are true. And the ritual nature of the abuse makes this a tie in, to my mind.

             Yes, while I do understand this victim was of age during the offense you are right there was definitely rape and abuse. The main focus on this thread is the ritual elements and the connections he talks about making in Hollywood. There IS an element of pedophilia in there, Researchers have suggested that the ranch ol Waddy started his Zed culture had a serial pervert on the grounds that had tried to ply Vi$$er with drugs and alcohol that did the same to a number of young girls.

             "Ninja" also has a sick fetishization with incest play which may or may not imply something much more sinister.

              I was talking about the TEXTS OF THE ACCUSED themselves, not your post. Try calming down and not being so butt hurt. Why bring up something I posted on a separate board that had nothing to do with pg? That's just low imho. Does having issues and personal trials make a person dumb? Do I need to view you as the same caliber as Schlongkeyhote? Next you'll be insulting me for being female.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not going to contribute if i nothing to add. I'm not a researcher, just someone who cares a lot and can't help but be wrapped up in it. My best contribution to this place is my skepticism. A lot of pg contributors don't possess an ounce of it.

                Well, it was obvious to me. This Ninja person writes like his brain is fried by drugs. I actually don't know how someone so dumb can tie his own shoes, much less kidnap somebody.

                 The song above is a rap song written by that Zheani
                 <em>
                  about
                 </em>
                 Ninja and what he did to her. I know, it is disjointed and hard to read but the reason I posted it was how it matches what is expressed in the texts and messages she posts in the video. This bitch came out guns a blazin with proof of the kind of crazy shit this freak does to his fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The video I just posted of Nija trying to defend his position is simply an admission of guilt saying that all those "prostitutes" that were throwing the pussy at him are out for his money, yeah, yeah , yeah we've heard it a million times ntil a woman of worth and power says no to your dirty tricks to get the pussy fast and easy then toss it away. Pretending to turn into a demon and ravaging a woman in a confused state of consent is still rape and this is one of the wickedest stories I've ever heard. It really sounds like this guy is taking most of his plays right from Aleister Crowley.

                  Yeah, it wasn't her rap that had confused me, that was more or less clear, it was the texts they were sending. I was like "wtf is this shit, I can't read this"
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm sorry for her pain. Nobody deserves that. And I know exactly what you mean by confused consent. Nobody expects to be treated like that and it probably takes the brain a bit to register what's happening. And by that point you're restrained or drugged and it's too late.
