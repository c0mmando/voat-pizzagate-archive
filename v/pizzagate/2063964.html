She told me that the people who bought our horse ranch from us (a pastor and his wife) have parents who have been helping around in Haiti since even before the big earthquake happened, and so he knows a lot about the area.
He told my mom that when he went there once with his parents, that Bill Clinton has a very obviously seen PALACE (way to rub it in their poor faces, jerk) and that all day you can see women entering and leaving. Teens - young adults (early 20s) are seen constantly leaving, and half of them are prostitutes.

I can\'t believe people can buy into the fact that him and Hillary are good people, when they\'re prostituting young women in a beautiful palace-type house while all the others are suffering in Haiti.

            : Thanks for posting this important item.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a great piece of information that others may be able to confirm further and use in their own research.

            Another way to get this out without being hassled by the mods is to post it over on

            It's sad that the anal retentives in this sub do so much to censor important raw news from actual users.

            Commenting to say that tomorrow I will try to find a link, sleeping now and just checked the thread. Not sure if I will find one as this is the word of my mom and the pastor. I do know he is a genuinely good person (not the typical pastor who gives you the creeps and hangs around kids) and my mom did tell me that the next time she talks to him, she'll ask him if he knows about child trafficking there. I'll now ask her to ask if he also knows about WHERE in Haiti that he saw it.

            : Please add a link to this submission to satisfy Rule 2 of our submission guidelines. Because this is important info, I'm going to leave this up for now so you can add it. A link to the location in Google Maps would be best. If you don't have that, however, any related link would be fine. Otherwise we will have to remove your post in order to administer the rules consistently. Thanks!

            This relates to a Pizzagate because everything does and you all know it. Haiti, the Clinton Foundation, HRC covering for state department child trafficking. NBC has even reported this.

            If Silsby was trafficking children in Haiti/DR and the Clintons and foundation were involved, why would a little thing like prostitutes bother them?  How can you have an ounce of morality and be involved in that?  He was seen by a witness as a frequent visitor to Epstein's island and his name is on the jet logs.  These people are simply evil and have no limits or problems with doing horrendous things.

             There's zero evidence the Clintons or the Clinton Foundation were involved with Silsby crimes.  There's clear evidence that nobody at the State Department knew who the 10 Americans who were arrested at the time they were arrested.  They had to google the name of the group to find out who these people were.  That would be the first time they heard Silsby's name.

                Huma Abedin was constantly forwarding Hillary articles on Silsby's organization and its status leading up to the event:

              <p>
               It is false that that the State Department was involved in this "leading up to the event."   We know exactly when the State Department learned that Laura Silsby and her group existed.  It was after they were arrested.  The email cited by the Pizzagate Wiki is literally months after she got arrested.  I don't know why they think that is "leading" up to the event.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's  is the email when the State Department learns something happened with Silsby Group.  Read up from the bottom. Literally someone in the Hatian embassy got a call a bunch of people got arrested.  And then Embassy staff try to learn who they are.

              <p>
               The reason Hillary Clinton was involved is the State Department Consular Services are available to any American arrested overseas.  Please read this link.  Protecting the rights of Americans arrested overseas guilty or not is one of the highest priorities of the State Department.

              </p>
              <p>
               Hillary Clinton got involved because it is the job of the State Department to be involved and they would have been involved if the crime was different or the people who committed crime were different.   This was an international incident.  These 10 Baptist would be missionaries were denounced by the Chief of the Haitian Police and Haitian Prime Minister.   Three President of the Southern Baptist Convention asked Obama to intervene.  There were headlines around world about this incident.    US newspapers were running sympathetic stories about these 10 Baptists in hot dirty jails cells.
              </p>
              <p>
               The pizzagate Wiki has Bill Cinton's intervention incorrect as well. Silsby did not get off.   Silsby was left to stand trial. 8 of the other missionaries were freed.  This is is because everone agreed they were just volunteers and Silsby was the leader and in charge of making all arrangements and getting the proper documents.  Silsby still had to go to trial in Haiti.  The original charges of kidnapping were lessened, but this was still the decision of the Haitian court.   One possible reason for the lesser charge is we now know that Silsby didn't steal kids.  She convinced parents to hand them over. (Perhaps you could say she was deceiving the parents, but the reality was the kids were not orphans and were handed over by their parents because the parents thought they would have better lives.)  She was convicted and sentenced by a Haitian court.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Pizzagate Wiki and most of the Pizzagate community has the facts on this completely wrong.  The pizzagate wiki is also wrong about this
*Friends of the Orphans, *the charity Laura Silsby was given children from while in Haiti.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because that is not where Silsby got the kids.   I'm going to have a post on that soon.

                For Christ's sake AreWeSure did you not watch the Jeffrey Sachs interview where he explains "everything is blurred" in regard to where the Clinton Foundation stopped and the State Department started.

                 If you actually want to talk about the facts of Clinton and Silsby's group, you can't use the Pizzagate Wiki, it's poorly written and has several things that are flat out false* like this.

                 I do not read this as talking about Silsby's trial.  I read this about Silsby going to Haiti to get kids.  Look at what the Wiki says.

                 If they are talking about Hillary getting updates THEN Bill arriving in Haiti in February, then you are not talking about Silsby's trial.  I think they chose that email because people know Huma is close to the Hillary.

                 This is incorrect, this could not have happened in February.  What happened shortly after Bill Clinton arrrived in Haiti in February is the other 8 Baptists were let go by the judge.  Silsby was not.  Silsby was left to stand trial.  Huma Abedin's email that the pizzagate wiki points to is from May 13, 2010, and it's about the first day of Silsby's trial, so these are two separate events months apart.  Silsby had not "already served time" in February when Bill Clinton went there, she hadn't even been convicted yet.  Wikipedia is a much better source on the timeline that the Pizzagate Wiki: "On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial."

                 As an example of how poorly written the Pizzagate Wiki is, see this section. Is Puello connected to the Clintons?  It doesn't give any evidence of that, so why is he in this section?

                  I proved that the claim that Hillary Clinton knew about Silsby from 2001 is false in this thread below.  I also have a lot more info on the topic we are discused.  The document that used to claim Clinton followed Silsby from 2001 was actually written in 2010 after the Haitian earthquake.  It's mislabeled in the Wikileaks system as being from 2001.
