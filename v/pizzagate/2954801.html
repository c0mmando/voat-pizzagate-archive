<p>It does not surprise me that massage parlors are used for such activities, one used to be able to see ads for sexual conduct via massage parlors all the time on Craiglist.

I was a cashier who worked not too far away from the building where the parlor was located. I was over 18 at the time but too socially inept to gather from her hints what she fully meant, and also not wanting any trouble, I avoided it. I would say women are just as likely to be pedophiles or otherwise &quot;creeps&quot; as men are based on this experience and many others. They\'re just more subtle about it. But you can disagree with me, this is just my opinion.</p>',

            the research on female pedophiles and sex abusers is slowly starting. People don't want to be believe it which is why it's not widely studied. Just like with males they can be parents to their victims and obviously have even more unfettered access to children. Psychologically speaking it is pretty much the most damaging thing that can happen to not just be sexually be abused but by your own mother or a trusted female figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know of a female abuser in my family that abused her siblings and it was blown off because she was a victim herself and a female. At her age a male abuser would have likely been charged as an adult. She considers all incest as "sexual experimenting" and is openly defensive about news stories of teenage predators and unsurprisingly ignored her own children's out cries of abuse many years later. None of them speak to her and it always makes me wonder.. Like many pedophiles she openly believes society makes abuse traumatizing, not the abuse itself. She also thinks its a sin likened to adultery and "not worth tearing a family apart for"/ "it happens in most families." She is so enabled by the religion and our extended family I have had to essentially cut off the entire family to protect my own children because I know I cannot rely on them to protect them from her as they frequently leave their own children with her as the "fun goofy aunt." It's horrifying and would never be viewed the same if she were male. I know she has been diagnosed as borderline personality (and hospitalized multiple times) but frankly I think she is a plain old psychopath. She's also a C level executive at an international company. It's absurd when I actually write it all down here.  When I shared this information with my husband before we had kids he was just floored. His reaction validated my creeped out factor and helped me find courage to get away from them all for good.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with you though, female predators are real. I know they exist and I think there are way more than we realize. It a n=1 observation but the most disturbing and telling thing is to watch the lack of action from so many people who know EXACTLY what she has done.

            Had one down the street from me when I lived in Texas. They posted provocative pictures, (apparently?) probably not of minors, but all of the subjects were East Asian and my poor age evaluation skills get even poorer with ethnicities who look younger than they are. The police shut it down pretty quick due to neighborhood outrage over what was suspected to be going on there, but another parlor opened in the exact same location under a different name. Who knows what's going on there now

             I used to go there (from 2006. 2010, before things got hot in other NoVA places I discovered) for a good massage and a predictable ending. After it went downhill and my attention went elsewhere. The new owner (young mamasan) was trying to turn it around with younger girls and a decent but low-key level of service.
            </p>
            <p>
             One interesting tidbit she shared, she said the young girls work new to the country and worked as part of a crew (which had darker implications) but all the older women were working off gambling debts. She said they were all gambling addicts, and were in the AMP trade because they couldn't pay them off an other way, but essentially were there by choice (I. E, it was fast money, but they weren't compelled in an human-trafficking sense.)

            I'd go further than that and say that women are more likely to be pedophiles / traffickers due to the disarming nature that society has placed on women in general. Instead of putting them (justly) into the same conversation as men in regards to cruelty, psychopathic behaviors...they're put on a pedestal where only a woman's achievements are topics of discussion (not their behaviors, personalities, etc) .
