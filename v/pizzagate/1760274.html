<p>HE MET A RUSSIAN WOMAN AT A SPY HOSTED DINNER!!!  the HORROR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>....Flynn’s erratic conduct had troubled US intelligence officials for some time, multiple sources have told the Guardian.</p>
<p>One concern involved an encounter with a Russian-British graduate student, Svetlana Lokhova, whom Flynn met on a trip to Cambridge in February 2014.</p>
<p>At the time, Flynn was one of the top US spies and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which provides information to the Pentagon about the military strengths and intentions of other states and terrorist groups.</p>
<p>A historian and a leading expert on Soviet espionage, Lokhova has claimed to have unique access to previously classified Soviet-era material in Moscow. She says her forthcoming book makes groundbreaking revelations about Soviet military intelligence operations run by the GRU – Russia’s military spy agency.</p>
<p>Western historians say access to intelligence agency records in Moscow has been severely restricted under Vladimir Putin. One Russian historian who has written extensively on Russian intelligence said the situation with the GRU was “a complete disaster”.</p>
<p>“At least with the FSB and SVR [domestic and foreign spy agencies] there are places you can apply to view the archives, but with the GRU there’s not even a place to apply,” the historian said.</p>
<p>“Maybe two or three military historians have been allowed in. Sometimes there are duplicates in other archives, but getting into the actual GRU archive is basically impossible.”</p>
<p>Flynn and Lokhova were introduced to each other at the end of a dinner attended by 20 guests who included Sir Richard Dearlove – the former head of MI6 – and Prof Christopher Andrew, the official MI5 historian. </p>
<p>Flynn says the meeting with Lokhova was “incidental” and lasted just 20 minutes. However, Andrew has said Flynn invited Lokhova to accompany him on his next official visit to Moscow to help with simultaneous translation. The trip fell through soon afterwards because of Putin’s annexation of Crimea, Andrew wrote in the Sunday Times.</p>

<p>I don\'t know whether to laugh or cry. Clearly there are certain standards of behavior for US spies, it looks like Flynn just isn\'t  adding up here.  :(</p>

             posts about Flynn and the possibility of Trump draining the swamp with or without Flynn are permitted because Flynn Jr actively tweeted about pizzagate last fall. This post is not about pedo sex per se but how absurd the MSM and "intel community" is in regard to "russia hacking"

              Its not up to me decide what is or isn't permitted here. I only stated it has nothing to do with pizzagate. The woman in question in this article is in her 30's, and  they have already used the same story on Trump so yeah it is absurd

            Why didn't you quote the part where Flynn stayed in email contact with her and called himself General Misha?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or the fact that any member of the Defense Intelligence Agency is required to "self-report" contacts with people like this, a Russian dual-national who has access to Russian Intelligence archives.  He did report it and he was head of the DIA.  That is not a small thing in the intel world.  It's how you keep track of undercover espionage agents.  Her name would go on record and all the people she is in contact with would be known.  She might have done nothing the night with Flynn, but perhaps later they see her meeting in Prague with known Soviet Agent.  They would want to find out who she tried to get close to.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also becomes a data point about Flynn.  Other data point was shortly after this he became a contributor to the Kremlin's TV channel.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can minimize what is being discussed, but that is because you don't know how seriously things like this are taken and how it raises eyebrows.

            What a joke. Flynn was considered one of the greatest intelligence officers of his time. In field intelligence. He is the one who put country first and stood up to Obama and everyone stating early on that arming moderates was actually arming rebels and radicals and terrorism would spread globally if we did not stop it. Back in 2014. Obama had already promoted him. Then because he risked it all he was smeared and has been and is the biggest patriot of all.

            We have heard nothing from our MSM probably because there IS no bed peeing or pedo sex.  Well, even if there was pedo sex, we are sure to not hear from the MSM.  I wonder if they will try to make some cloak and dagger out of the fact that he asked her to accompany him on his next visit.  A rendezvous perhaps?  I am sure they will try to hit him with all of the above.

             I think Flynn wants to spill secrets, and is asking for immunity so as to pique interest in his story, not because he has actually done anything to need it. Congress and MSM will vilify him to keep him un-credible or silenced. Trump should offer him a pardon for testimony.

              Well, all I can say is this sure is one big mess.   I think the  Elite Pedo Dems are doing that circus act, you know, the one with the guy with sticks and a bunch of plates.  They throw a bunch of plates up in the air and keep them up there with sticks.  But eventually after a while they will have to come crashing down. When that day comes.  Look out.

              They know Flynn has nothing on Trump so they denied his immunity. They also know he has what they don't want him testifying at all.

            lol. I don't even know if this article was meant to be a joke, but it sure seems like one to me. Flynn is a concern because he met a russian student at a spy dinner... of course he has a lot of stories to tell, but this is truly pathetic.
