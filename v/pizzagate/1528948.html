<p>Could someone in London go shoot pictures of them all and find out what firm did them?  Even in just these few images, they are practically laughing that there is something sick going on underground and aren\'t they cleverly art-y about it?  
</p>
<p>You can see a child in a strange pose.  <a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c73dd53ef01bb095ce6e1970d-pi">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c73dd53ef01bb095ce6e1970d-pi</a></p>
<p>And there is a child\'s writing, saying &quot;under where?&quot; (Yes, where?)   Or is it a play on underwear?)

<p>And others, sexual or &quot;modern&quot; sexual symbols (circles and straight lines intersecting) or creepy in their own way.

<p>Hollows out?  Chambers?  Decomposed?  Repugnant?  Nose?  Look at those words on their own.  What do they create images off?

<p>&quot;Decomposed <strong>soil</strong>&quot; is not repugnant.

<p>The image across the first picture is of an abandoned prison.  Somehow that was unsettling in this context as well.</p>
<p>And the final link in the article is also about what\'s underground in the US and what\'s been done there by DHS (potentially to every subway system in the country) and when it comes to underground water systems, by unknown parties.  These underground systems have potentially been set up for horrific things.  Could they be before or used during the inauguration?</p>

<p>And what do you know, ISIS is said to be planning to use sarin gas in subways.
<a href="https://www.algemeiner.com/2014/09/28/isis-subway-nerve-gas-attack-in-us-eu-wests-nightmare-israeli-analyst-video/">ISIS Subway Nerve Gas Attack in US, EU, West\'s Nightmare</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Israeli intelligence researcher says a successful nerve gas attack perpetrated by a Japanese doomsday cult, which killed dozens and wounded over a 1,000 others could be a working template for ISIS, and like-minded terrorists against the United States or Europe, Israel Defense wrote on Sunday.</p>
<p>Basing his thesis on the triple release of sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway system, carried out by five members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult in 1995, Ronen Solomon noted recent threats by ISIS to carry out similar strikes deep within the New York and Paris subways.</p>
<p>Solomon is a widely quoted intelligence analyst, and regularly appears in a number of Israeli and international publications, focusing on the nexus between information-gathering, terrorism, and the mideast.</p>
<p>“The emerging concern is that ISIS activists holding western nationalities will be able to lay their hands on unconventional weapons (chemicals and biological toxins) from Syrian stockpiles and possibly smuggle them into Europe in order to carry out attacks in subways,” Solomon said.</p>
<p>Such an attack was “imminent,” according to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, ,</p>

<p>Thanks to George Webb we all know who is shipping stores of sarin gas to ISIS and who would have a big reason to not want Trump inaugurated.  The article that hat-tips pizzagate investigaters </p>

<p>shows the CIA has used subways to deliver toxic stuff before though it was more concerned with ebola-rabies, made in the US and coming with vaccines produced by one of Hillary Clinton\'s very top run donor\'s, Bill Gates.  Rockefeller is another big donor and together they run the WHO, and it\'s the WHO that is shipping arms to Syria in UN trucks and the WHO which would declare an pandemic emergency that allows the UN and WHO to take over the US.  They appear to have already hellishly fiddled with Obamacare in preparation.
<a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/11/to-attorney-generals-of-all-states-opposing-obamacare-it-includes-illegal-foreign-coding-for-beheadi.html">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/11/to-attorney-generals-of-all-states-opposing-obamacare-it-includes-illegal-foreign-coding-for-beheadi.html</a>  There\'s martial law to be achieved and billions to be made on vaccines.</p>
<p>And the CDC which is run by the CIA and a top donor to CF <a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/08/cdc-and-cia-a-close-and-sick-relationship.html">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/08/cdc-and-cia-a-close-and-sick-relationship.html</a>
is already Johnny on the spot there (and could easily take children under this ploy).

<p>And big time asset stripping of everyone and the country was put in place by Bush in case there is a pandemic declared by the WHO, run by two of CF\'s biggest donors (these numbers are small potatoes compared to the CDC\'s new regulations).</p>

<p>Amazing how this stuff just keeps coming back around the Clinton Foundation, to Hillary,  and to her donors and their stunning rapaciousness and willingness to kill anyone for what they want.  Maybe as people realize that, it makes it easier to believe that they inserted something into Obamacare, <a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/11/to-attorney-generals-of-all-states-opposing-obamacare-it-includes-illegal-foreign-coding-for-beheadi.html">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/11/to-attorney-generals-of-all-states-opposing-obamacare-it-includes-illegal-foreign-coding-for-beheadi.html</a>
with special attention paid to the one means of &quot;legal execution&quot; they list that says &quot;specified means&quot; but is left unspecified.  What is worse than beheading that it needs to be hidden or done underground?  Pizzagate investigators might have an idea.</p>
<p>And why beheading?  It seems it has occult value for bringing in the NWO.
<a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/10/the-jesuits-ebola-and-beheadings-trying-to-get-the-new-world-order-going.html">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/10/the-jesuits-ebola-and-beheadings-trying-to-get-the-new-world-order-going.html</a></p>
<p>If we don\'t think the NWO is the way to good things for anyone, including little children, the subways and water systems might need to be checked out by the FBI and loyal military and by everybody else able to help or whistleblow.  The inauguration may not be pleasing some people and while some are on the look out for bombs and other such things, these occult satanists seem to have an affinity for underground harm.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone might reach George Webb?</p>',

            “The emerging concern is that ISIS activists holding western nationalities will be able to lay their hands on unconventional weapons (chemicals and biological toxins) from Syrian stockpiles and possibly smuggle them into Europe in order to carry out attacks in subways,” Solomon said.

            Such an attack was “imminent,” according to Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, ,

           shows the CIA has used subways to deliver toxic stuff before though it was more concerned with ebola-rabies, made in the US and coming with vaccines produced by one of Hillary Clinton's very top run donor's, Bill Gates.  Rockefeller is another big donor and together they run the WHO, and it's the WHO that is shipping arms to Syria in UN trucks and the WHO which would declare an pandemic emergency that allows the UN and WHO to take over the US.  They appear to have already hellishly fiddled with Obamacare in preparation.

           There's martial law to be achieved and billions to be made on vaccines.

           Amazing how this stuff just keeps coming back around the Clinton Foundation, to Hillary,  and to her donors and their stunning rapaciousness and willingness to kill anyone for what they want.  Maybe as people realize that, it makes it easier to believe that they inserted something into Obamacare,

           with special attention paid to the one means of "legal execution" they list that says "specified means" but is left unspecified.  What is worse than beheading that it needs to be hidden or done underground?  Pizzagate investigators might have an idea.
          </p>
          <p>
           And why beheading?  It seems it has occult value for bringing in the NWO.

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           If we don't think the NWO is the way to good things for anyone, including little children, the subways and water systems might need to be checked out by the FBI and loyal military and by everybody else able to help or whistleblow.  The inauguration may not be pleasing some people and while some are on the look out for bombs and other such things, these occult satanists seem to have an affinity for underground harm.

           Perhaps someone might reach George Webb?
