</p>
<p>The book was allegedly created as a recovery therapy method for a slave known as the System. <strong>The System reminds me of Comet Pizza and Tavistock\'s Kim Noble</strong>, as they suffer from Dissociative Identity Disorder /MPD and seem to have much experiential knowledge of these occult programs, which comes out in their artwork.  Unlike Kim Noble, this author seems to have broken their programming, and is working towards exposing their tormentors. </p>
<p>The book and experiences seem come from <strong>before 1994</strong>- but, with recent discussions regarding Disneyland, color psychology, triggers, and <a href="https://voat.co/u/gamepwns">@gamepwns</a> incessant calling out of symbolism found in our media, I thought you Goats would benefit from seeing it.</p>

            Mengele was a Dr of anthropology and medicine, who during WW2 was a combat medic (earning an ‘iron cross- first class’, for rescuing crew members of a burning tank, as well as the ‘Black Badge for the Wounded’
           </p>
           <p>
            And the ‘Medal for the Care of the German People’, due to the outstanding medical care he provided and his exemplary service as a combat medic.) The guy was a through and through German war hero, not a sadistic, evil torturer.
           </p>
           <p>
            After receiving injuries, he was reassigned to auschwitz and after the war the propaganda began, using him as a scapegoat to deliver the fake holocaust message (including that he trained his dog to bite Jews who sung out of tune and other garbage I can link you to).
           </p>
           <p>
            He was “never captured” after the war and supposedly escaped to South America untill his natural death; there are no reputable claims that he ever worked with the CIA, or that he was involved in MKULTRA style experiments.
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate that you may not have heard the name mengele, or researched the subject thoroughly; however the claims in your post by the apparent victim do not hold up to scrutiny and are very, very questionable (and reminiscent of a pop culture film plot - “Mr. Green the evil nazi scientist and my dad the CIA operative brainwashed me!”)

            Let me get this straight, this apparent victim was brainwashed by her dad who “worked for the CIA” alongside Josef Mengele...

              How can you never have heard of Mengele?  Supposedly the most evil Nazi.  Can't imagine any public school failed to push that guy's story.  You must have a private school education.

             vatican aka catholic church put out a moloch statue in front of the coliseum. It has a jewish star outline in the centre of its chest. The pope also wears a jew hat. So its basically jewish controlled.
