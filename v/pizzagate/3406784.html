<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The year is 2005 and Mandelson is taking time off from his work as the European Union’s Trade Commissioner, for which taxpayers are paying him a salary in excess of £200,000 a year.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Epstein (unbeknownst to the world at this point) is under police investigation for numerous ghastly sex offences. Meanwhile, he is doing what he does best: pursuing a Gatsby-esque friendship with a famous and powerful man.</p>
<p>Guests who have spent time on his nearby private island Little St James, a stunning, 72-acre patch of the U.S. Virgin Islands, have included a virtual Who’s Who of celebrities — from Bill Clinton to Naomi Campbell, Stephen Hawking and, perhaps most notoriously, our very own Prince Andrew. On various trips to Chateau Epstein, they’ve spent days or even weeks sunbathing on his private beaches, swimming in his pools or playing tennis on his personal court...</p>
<p>..Mandelson and Epstein’s hitherto unknown shopping trip took place on December 27, 2005, six months before the now-notorious Epstein was arrested in Florida and charged with a string of child sex offences.</p>
<p>Details have emerged, and can now be reported, thanks to two of the extraordinary photographs that are featured on these pages.</p>
<p>They form part of a remarkable and never-before-seen cache that provide a visual record of daily life in the high-octane (and somewhat seedy) orbit of the morally-bankrupt billionaire, who killed himself in prison this month while facing prosecution on multiple counts of paedophilia and child sex trafficking.</p>
<p>.....Most of the girls, whose pictures cannot be printed (as victims, they must not be identified), appear to be in their late teens. Equally damning for Maxwell is the fact that she can be seen embracing Jean-Luc Brunel, a French model agency boss accused (again in multiple lawsuits, and in a New York court this week) of helping traffic teenage girls.</p>
<p>Brunel, now 72, was alleged in recently unsealed court documents to have used his fashion business to provide the billionaire with a steady supply of impressionable young women who were then sexually assaulted. In return, Epstein is said to have invested in his businesses. Now under investigation, he has also denied wrongdoing...</p>

            It's a pity that this post didn't get more upvotes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Virginia Roberts-Giuffre says she thinks Epstein met Mandelson only for business, since he never told her she needs to sleep with him, but Mandelson is gay, so obviously he wouldn't want to rape a
            <em>
             girl
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Which again leads to the question how did Epstein cater for his male buddies (like Kevin Spacey).

             Eptien is most likely Mossad, so we got the spy angle, but pedos stick together, whatever the preferences.From what we know they are starting these anti Pedo orgs to (1) give them an air of legitimacy, (2) Give them access to the escaped victims and vulnerable, whether that might be former victims of their sick group, or new victims and mothers. I am not sure their is much separation in Evil.Org.

             Great question. What did Epstein do when a wealthy or famous target expressed a desire for something other than 12 to 17 year-old girls? Men who prefer young teen girls are only a subset of all perverts and paedophiles. Surely Jeffrey and Ghislaine didn't turn down opportunities to blackmail or extort those with other kinks. If this was
             <strong>
              just
             </strong>
             about under-legal-aged teens, it wouldn't take three mansions (some with hidden, soundproofed bathrooms equipped with dental equipment), the Lolita Express, a ranch, and two private islands, one with a gold-domed temple.

              Of course this was not just 'only a subset'

              These revelations are about the dark/light duality of this world. Righteous vs Evil, anything that is of a dark energy is what Epstein and CO. were all about and as servants of evil that would encompass many and all things against pure and good.

              the occult angle that they abide by is what they guard and is why they do what they do.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tilt the scales in one's life toward purity,good, and love IF that's the worldview ONE wants. Only the person can begin that process within their own free will. Be Fearless in the face of evil!

              Yes. There is a phone message Brunel left for Epstein which said he had found a 'Russian teacher, 2 x 8 years old' for Epstein, and Epstein could have the first lesson that day.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which probably translates to 'I have two Russian children for you, each is eight years old, and I can send them to you today'.

              The Center Of The World Is Actually Hiding in a tiny Wisconsin Town-Poniatowski is the intersection of 45 North parallel and the 90 West parallel. The 45×90 points, as they're called, are the four points on Earth which are halfway between the geographical poles, the equator, the Prime Meridian, and the 180th meridian. (I’m not sure if this is the correct answer...more I research, I think there are two other places)

              The „Offshore Tour Operator“ is a psycho-geographic GPS prototype that guides the walk of the user through the database of the Panama Papers, in search of the physical traces of the offshore banking within the city landscape.
             </p>
             <p>
              The dérive will bring the participants outside, in the various neighborhoods of the city of Berlin, in a hunt for shell companies, trust firms, domiciliation agencies and shadow finance offices and agents that are referenced in the Offshore Leaks, Panama Papers and Bahamas Leaks data­ bases. The GPS guides the user through audio indications.
             </p>
             <p>
              Participants are invited to photograph the entrance, describe the area, observe the letterboxes and intercom systems to check if the name of the offshore entity, revealed by the leaks, is still there, and take notes on the path taken to it, to later discuss the experiences and share collected images.

              This workshop is generally for everyone who is interested in the topic: artists, journalists, cartographers, hackers, architects, criminologists, economists. Some basic understanding of the notions of dérives, psychogeography, tax evasion, optimization is welcome, but not mandatory.

              What you will get out of this afternoon is a cross-related knowledge of the financial aspects of the city and the places where offshore banking actually happens.
