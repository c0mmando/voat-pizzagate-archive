<p>Did my best to do what I think you guys were requesting which was to isolate the adult voice separate from the child screaming, since that\'s impossible to listen to for many of us. I used the parts where you can hear only the adult, but there wasn\'t a WHOLE lot to work with that didn\'t include the child\'s voice too. </p>
<p>I didn\'t even get into the whole &quot;Skippy/John&quot; thing.. While I did hear the child call him John, I didn\'t catch the Skippy part, must have been when a lot of the unlistenable screaming is going on :( anyway.. </p>

<p>In a previous post I said I might have thought it was the voice of a convicted pedophile named <a href="http://archive.is/rwGwp">Robert Robinson</a> aka <strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/casiocasiocasio/albums">Robert Casio</a></strong> (who some of you already know about), because I <a href="http://prezi.com/jctatsh7_ebc/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">connected him directly</a> to worldcorpo.net where the torture/screaming videos originated. But it definitely <strong>sounds like Podesta to me</strong>. </p>
<p>And it\'s no surprise Robinson would have a connection to the website, I first came across him on Flickr when he had a <strong>secret account</strong> that he <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wQvf4Je.png">had &quot;liked&quot; a Comet Ping Pong pizza picture</a> with. This was an obscure, &quot;innocent&quot; picture nobody else had seen at the time and who knows if he liked it before or after Pizzagate came about, but I bet it was before. Once I ousted him in a video (I\'ve since taken down but it\'s on my harddrive), he deleted the secret Flickr account. <s>Will fill details in with more links shortly.</s></p>

            Why doesn't anyone talk about the picture of Podesta playing cards with the teen girl whose hands are ziptied? I don't know how to grab it and post it separately but scroll to the end of my blog post here and see it. Please share... I thought it would be all over, but I never see it. Thanks everyone.

            Yes, I read this when it was posted. Also looked at Marty Leeds video. I am a student of numerology, astro-numerology and my favorite book is Occult Ether Physics about Nikola Tesla by Bill Lyne so things that are resonant, kept secret do intrigue me. That is not what Podesta reads like to me. He is way more straight forward, it reads how many. Small Christians. What needs to be deduced is dead or molested or eaten whatever the strange behaviors these people do.

            FBI: Federal Bureau of Inertia. They have technology that can prove whose voice that is, besides it being satan's. FBI must be full of pedophiles or they would have investigated this by now. If this is Podesta's voice, how evil, how dark hearted to you have to be to abuse children like this and then go to work as if everything was normal? My wish, my prayer is that Podesta and Co. feel the fear, in this life and the next, that children abused/killed by them have felt. Collective fear that is. Fear mutiplied by the number of victims. Do the souls affected by pedophiles have a say in how justice and karma get back at these perverts? Wouldn't you think a just world/universe/God would have a mechanism for combating this fucked up stuff? Are we the chosen generation to finally put an end to this? If so, are we up for the challenge? Are we doing all that we can? 
The Left seem to think child abuse is funny for some reason. Nothing can be further from the truth. If this is Podesta's voice abusing child/children, Podesta has to suffer. He needs to be arrested, prosecuted, and left to rot in a cell, then in hell.

            Pretty sure it actually does apply. Just the risk of if it gets covers up, or a crime didn't actually happen, it falls back on you.

            I have been looking back through the posts to try and find where some pictures were found in an email. The pics in question were of John Podesta in a room and a pic of some kids in the same room. I think the room the kids were in playing on chairs was behind a two way mirror. The other side of this mirror was John. I am wondering if this same room is where the filming for this video has taken place?

            Thank you for your work great post. I don't suppose you could isolate the voice of the child saying stop slippy slippy please? I could make out the skippy please part but I think it would give myself and others more reason to not doubt this if there was clean audio of that phrase.

            I can prove who is the producer of these videos and have decided to do so with a video that I urge others to share and make videos discussing if you so choose.
The guys name is Gary lee Monroe Barney

             I doubt it's him. "World Corp" is one of the most generic sounding company names ever, I but there are hundreds of them. The emails associated with this Dr. Gary guy are
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bc8d858885dbd0d1defccbd3ced0d8dfd3ceccd9d2c8d9ceccced5cfd9cf92d5d2dad3" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
              [email protected]
             </a>
             and
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1e767172676d7f797b5e7277687b307d7173" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
              [email protected]
             </a>
             . The email associated with worldcorpo.net was
             <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9aedf5e8f6fef9f5e8eafff4eedafdf7fbf3f6b4f9f5f7" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

             (which is how it was linked to Robinson). Also every picture I've seen of Dr. Gary shows his beard being much fuller than the one in the piss video (as far as I can tell). I think the guy in the piss video has more of a truckers mustache.

              I know what you are saying and that is still a thought that nags at me when im looking into this guy. I've looked into him for the past day now and think for sure that he is involved in some very shady shit that's related to abuse or possible trafficking....if he does have no connection to the World Corp website with the "Fatherhood" and other videos going around, do you agree that this guy is shady? Not a rhetorical question, I'm genuinely curious only because I personally do see some very dark shit affiliated with this guy, but I'm not COMPLETELY sold on the idea of him being producer or owner of World Corp.

               I don't know about shady, but definitely not normal. To me he doesn't seem that much different than the type who go off about FEMA death camps and other tin foil hat tropes. I am convinced that those in government and NGOs seem to have a higher number of sickos than the rest of the population, so his connection to UNICEF is troubling. I think the biggest thing is his hippie/spirituality flair. While I'm sure I could find examples of those types trying to normalize childhood sexuality I just can't picture someone like that being a scat freak. The other thing is if someone is a scat freak I would expect them to be a recluse like Robinson. This guy seems to travel a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
               To put it another way while I don't think it's likely this guy is a pedo I wouldn't be completely shocked, I would be completely shocked if he was a scat freak.

              It is a video that proves who is the producer for the website hosting the videos being discussed. This doesn't fornsure debunk that podesta is the voice just points to the website owner.

                 I just finished your video. I watched the first part last night and followed up with a few hours of looking into this guy. I know Worldcorp's video voice analysis lead is currently going, but are others here aware of this? Makes sense a sick video would be produced by a sick individual but there are multiple sketchy things I've picked up. Tumblr page has an image of a bird, buddha(?), and small pictures of people (some children) in one corner that is also obscured partially by beaded necklaces in a wavy pattern. A few of those pictures look like criminal mugshots, as well. Another thing I picked up on was his picture of that map with the red dot in the center with towns and cities around it. I have to double check because I just got home but I remember thinking last night that the map looks like a normal GPS image but the locations marked as being next to eachother are actually towns/cities in diff locations. I think its just listing their different branch/HQs around the world. I also found the paperwork on him being ejected out of one of his organizations for a variety of things but some involved sexual misconduct. What did you think of those?

                  I have found tons of stuff on this dude, that he is a holy sage with a mostly bogus ordination, that his kids have been taken twice but not sure why, that he is connected to multiple countries including lybia, Guatemala which he got money to aid in a earthquake relief effort, that he thrws weird signs in pictures like 6s that he claims to not believe in god but also claims to be so spiritual to be ordained that he claims to have been CEO of multinational corp and claims that Canada put a brain spy chip in his head, he always wears a laminate of something probably him at some ceremony. That he has what appears to be a mostly fake phd from some foreign nation.. and that at some point he added Barney to his name.. that he has used the address of a rescue ministry outreach shelter in TN. That he was said to have died on an old site that's removed but has posted since or newer sites. And so much more...

                  But I have not seen what you say about a sexual misconduct that's interesting can you source that?

            Holy fuck, Robinson followed that worldcorpo guy? My brain is telling me that Ronbinson and that other creepo being connected doesn't have anything to do with Pedodesta, and they seem like greasy poorfags that Pedodesta would associate with. But damn that voice matches so closely. Now my spidey senses are beginning to tingle.

            Someone was sent a video by that
            <a href="https://yuki.la/x/17941762">
             worldcorpo
            </a>
            last year.

             Here
            </a>
            is that video. It's sick but doesn't look real.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is this
            <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/videos">
             video
            </a>
            from worldcorpo. It's of a guy taking a piss in a toilet and then... forget about the rest. Maybe someone could ID him from some identifying features. I'll just describe him so no one has to actually watch the video. Same body type as Robinson except greasier and harrier. He has a Casio type watch on his left hand with a white/silver-ish band. He has a trucker style mustache that looks sort of like
            <a href="http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297393524691_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&amp;size=650x">
             this one
            </a>
            (again not him, just the same type of mustache, looks to be about the same age too). If anyone comes across a pedo or fecal freak that looks like that we might have another piece to the puzzle.

            The E fit  is hard evidence. The audio is hard evidence. Without the demand for an investigation, without the power of a search warrant, substantial, corroborating evidence will not come to light.

            Well after listening to the audio, I can safely confirm that he is saying "pizzagate is fake losers." You pathetic Scooby Doo detectives make us all laugh. Pizzagate lost steam because it is fake. Now hop on over to Comet's website and buy a shirt, etc. to make up for harassing poor Mr. Alefantis. Theseus touches tantalizing tidbits. C3P16P16./.

            I posted a reply to another comment earlier today about how I cover up or hide my accent in day to day life but that I cannot control it when I am angry. The toned down daily accent is the same as the angry accent. I couldn't pick that up before this sound isolation. Good work.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was against this being Podesta from the start. I just couldn't match it. Hearing it isolated, I am 90% on board with it being a match.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, he sounds like he almost over exaggerates the accent. Like Skippy has a personality and accent of his own. I have not heard the actual place where Skippy is said though.

             It could have been leaked by CIA who controls him to intimidate him (Alefants/WorldCorp) or by law enforcement to put the screws on him.. couple of theories.  He defintely stands to lose so he is not the leaker, but he has never been the leaker, only the leakee with Wikileaks...lol

            On the one hand, I am fully willing to believe that this is real; there are certainly no points of forgery that I'm aware of.  On the other hand, I would also be willing to believe that it is a forgery in order to discredit PizzaGate; IE, they put out a very convincing fake and after it's the main thing everyone's talking about they reveal evidence that it's fake.  If it's real I hope it gets used as a smoking gun to hang the fucker.

            Thank you!  I could not ever listen to the original again.  Still can't get it out of my mind.  Anyone hesitating whether to watch it, I would say don't, if you think you wouldn't sleep.  I don't know of a lot of benefits to hearing the child in total terror, and not being able to rescue him.

            All the experts I've heard on pedos say that it's not so much an obsession with sex but POWER.  So this does seem totally legit, even if not a ritual thing, this asswipe gets off on being IN CHARGE.  Just like he probably was raised.  At the same time, he has to take control of someone less able to  overpower him.

            And as for HRC making her little tweets, god I can only HOPE she keeps it up... If she hasn't learned by now, that Trump makes them sorry if they push him too hard, then she deserves what she'll get.

            Does anyone have the full video/any more of the second one (Each Day I Grow Some More)? I haven't listened to all of it because I don't want to go to the Worldcorp website for fear it's a honeypot. I don't have a VPN. As little as I want to listen to it, I think it's important.

            In return, I bring  you Jeff Zahn, who is connected with numerous children's shows (Caillou, Barney, Madeline, Arthur, Paddington Bear, etc).

            His website, with credits.
           </p>
           <p>
            His name is Jeff Zann on Wikipedia, but I believe it's the same person. Zann/Zahn is listed alongside Worldcorp Enterprises as the composer of the Caillou theme song (which the terrible man is singing in the Each video).

            I don't know if this would work, but doesn't Siri use voice identification, like you can teach Siri what your voice is and it will then recognise you by your voice to allow you to log in, like with the touch ID, but a voice ID? If that's the case, then could someone train Siri on Podesta's voice, and then see if the recording of this video can later unlock the phone? Ok so it's not amazingly scientific, but given that speaker identification technology seems to cost a lot, it might be at least something extra to either confirm or deny?

            it is at the end of OP's original post - I'll copy and paste it here anyway, it can get confusing reading through these reply threads.

             optional side-ramble:     In a previous post I said I might have thought it was the voice of a convicted pedophile named Robert Robinson aka Robert Casio
             <a href="https://prezi.com/jctatsh7_ebc/httpworldcorponet/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">

             (who some of you already know about), because I connected him directly to worldcorpo.net where the torture/screaming videos originated. But it definitely sounds like Podesta to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it's no surprise Robinson would have a connection to the website, I first came across him on Flickr when he had a secret account that he had "liked" a Comet Ping Pong pizza picturePNG with. This was an obscure, "innocent" picture nobody else had seen at the time and who knows if he liked it before or after Pizzagate came about, but I bet it was before. Once I ousted him in a video (I've since taken down but it's on my harddrive), he deleted the secret Flickr account.&gt;

            If this does not answer your question, write me back  or maybe PM me.  I want to make sure what I am posting is clear, so I appreciate your feedback.  thx.

            Thank you for your work, and all of those exposing this. "You think you're hot shit, don't ya." Probably what the ped said to him, raping him as a young boy. That's how it goes.﻿

            I'm on the fence about this one. I'd prefer an opinion from someone from NE. If that's an accent you don't hear a lot then it would be easier to confuse, bc honestly I could hear Matt Damon in his southie accent sounding similar to the voice on the tape too.

             I don't care why it was leaked nor does it ultimately matter if it was Podesta or not, a child in that video is being horribly abused, Robert Robinson knows something about it and he's a free man. Something needs to get done about this.

            Absolutely. Until we can properly debunk or confirm, we have to keep open minds. To decry it as per personal opinion is so utterly base I feel, and should be called out. At least we can see the shills with clear eyes ; )

            Thank you for doing this. I have refused to listen/watch the original video -- can't handle any more evil these days -- but curious what this has been about. My 2cents...Sounds more like JP than not. So willing to believe (or at least add it to the growing list of " just coincidences" that eventually will become fact).

            Nice work. I have a lot of experience producing and editing audio tracks but I just couldn't handle hearing the original video. Thank you for providing something I can listen to and weigh in on. In my mind, it's a definite match to Podesta.

             That's my worry too....   too big to fall.  It's been suggested that as much as 30% of government could be involved with this sickness.   Can you imagine the fallout from such a house of cards collapsing?   This certainly isn't a unique problem for the U.S. This shit is worldwide.   By the same token, there is No cure for pedophelia..... it can only continue to spread and fester.   Concerned patriots have been investigating this for decades but I feel that we have Never been closer than we are at this very point in history. And I believe history will be made and we can rid the world of a very 'invisible', yet very dark veil of evil enshrouding the world and the 'universal mind'.  On that note...  thank you to all contributing in any way to ending this depravity &amp; evil madness.   Carry on &amp; Godspeed........

            It's Podesta or maybe Anthony Weiner. It's a leak from FBI or NSA meant to scare them into doing something very stupid. Well done white hats well done. Thank you for doing something good.

            I have posted this elsewhere but got buried:

           <p>
            Shitfreak99(Robert Robinson account) is rather similar to the old tumblr page for Worldcorp:
            <a href="scatfreak99.tumblr.com">
             scatfreak99.tumblr.com
            </a>
            . I guess we can establish that worldcorpo = Robert Robinson. The page is still available on
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150727054728/http://scatfreak99.tumblr.com/">
             archive.org
            </a>
            and features some questionable content.

             I had my suspicions from the get go that the video has nothing to do with pedosta, and the fact that Worldcorp is run by KNOWN pedo Robert L Robinson, well im getting my nails ready to nail this coffin shut.. now we just need audio of robinson so we can connect the videos to him, but unfortunately, i dont know if thats ever going to happen..

             That's horrible news. Now we need to really explore the possibility of it being Robert's voice just as much as it could be John Podesta's. Both are east coasters. Both are missing teeth and have the lisp. Both are raging pedophiles.... Only one has been convicted for it thus far, however.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where to BEGIN with Robert's links... he isn't camera shy at ALL:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QF1w4I5mMoTwT_yNyKo1A">
              https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QF1w4I5mMoTwT_yNyKo1A
             </a>
             - This channel of his has videos AND lists the dozens of other backup channels he has, check under the "My Other Channels" column or just click
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QF1w4I5mMoTwT_yNyKo1A/channels?view=60&amp;flow=list">
              here
             </a>
             for the list of his sh-tty channels.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can search his Flickr for the hundreds of videos he has on there:
             <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=61935397%40N07&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=video">
              https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=61935397%40N07&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=video
             </a>
             (sign in to Yahoo and turn off "safe search" for .. different results :/)
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been over with and disgusted by this puke of an amoeba-sludge-specimen reject for SEVERAL months, ever since I  came across his festering, pederasting ass on Flickr. I've reported to his local authorities for the shit found in his public social media accounts. Not only child-related, but sad kitty stuff too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not sure I can comb his stupid, self-involved, sad, depressing videos for one that has audio of him distressed/yelling. If anyone happens to find one with a good audio sample, please share and we can compare.

              I can't speak to whatever else it is you're discussing because I'm not that into it but I listened to a second of this other guy speaking and don't think he'd sound like that at all if he raised his voice.. this one is more effeminate or something. The guy yelling sounds 100% like Podesta, who I find more similar to Larry David?
             </p>
             <p>
              I do a lot of comparative audio analysis tweaking amps and that.. it's a strong muscle. I don't need more than a second to be very sure and can see through a lot of shit.

              If it was Robert Robinson, it may be his daughter he is abusing in the videos. He has access to her and visitng rights. I think she lives in New York, need to re-find the personal info I read about him. Not jumping the gun, just giving a bit of backstory and context.
             </p>
             <p>
              If it was John's voice, I imagine it would be a captive child he's yelling like that at. Either way this is some horrific shit.

              Don't know how to find an old Hillary statement that if she loses, that she would be going down and taking everyone with her. Maybe I just felt it emanating from something she did or said but that's how / what Podesta feels like. The crumbling of the Clinton cartel. Thankfully they got cocky, smug, invincible and did very careless things. Can I add a voice of sensible here. It's Bill Still's report on the number of "slaves" in the context of "sex slaves" this business has metasticized into. It is so much money. CF must have been the Banker, and that shuttering says a lot.

                Have you seen that? Thankfully I have lived a wholesome, sheltered life. What was risqué to me is nothing to these degenerates. I expect Hollywood will unravel into this sadly corrupted insult to the human culture. Maybe we can turn the tide of extinction if we expose all of this. On the other hand maybe the oceans, earth and sky have been pushed over the tipping point. I'd like to help children of the future recover if possible. Restore birds, bees, seas, and sun.

            How do you guys think we can make this go viral so that normies can hear it for themselves? How about a separate video that first plays the original clip followed by this one (so that they know what's that about)? People should see this and judge for themselves - that's what the establishment is so afraid of, that's why they're censoring our boards.Our only strength over them is that there's more of us - let's use it to our advantage and spam everywhere about pizzagate.

               Here's another long thread packed with information on those E-fits.   Very real, very much did happen and how they happened and what they signify is a lot stranger than just linking a couple of perps to a crime.  There is no question these were created to target the Podesta brothers.

               The efit sketches were not "debunked", they do exist, were released, and were shown to be a psy-op directed at John and Tony Podesta.   That an efit sketch so resembling Podesta at all became part of the narrative of the McCann investigation is in itself an item of interest.

              <p>
               My point is that it is very interesting that these type of weird psy ops involving pedophilia pop up around Podesta, the latest being the Fatherhood video. I would say that hidden operators believe he is vulnerable to pressure and blackmail.  They put the screws on him to contain and control him.

               People need to stop throwing around the term debunked carelessly, as you seem to be doing here.   I've seen a lot of that lately and usually accompanied by an assertive self righteousness about it which indicates misdirection, not a wish to add a helpful correction.

                Firstly, they look vaguely similar. Regarding John. What face mole are you talking about? Second picture looks nothing at all like Tony Podesta, only similarity is that the picture makes him look kinda round.
               </p>
               <p>
                They saw the same person, at the exact same time. To suggest they both saw two different people in the same place at the same time while they were stood next to each other - but didn't notice the other guy, is just a totally ludicrous suggestion to make.
               </p>
               <p>
                Much more likely that efit descriptions aren't all that accurate, right?

                You're suggesting a high profile politician personally abducted a girl with his out of shape brother, while flat out ignoring the fact that the origin of the sketches suggests it was only one person. Why the fuck would he risk that? There is no evidence he was even in the country at the time, except that he didn't answer his emails - which happens all the fucking time with a travelling politician.  Oh and it also happens to be the
                <em>
                 most high profile case of child abduction in the last 20 years
                </em>
                - what a coincidence! Did you check all the abduction cases and witness descriptions of other cases for efits that vaguely resemble him too? Or just this one?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why am I here? I like to read about pizzagate, im not a denier at all, most of this has substance behind it - but the maddy thing is such outstretched bullshit and makes the whole movement look stupid when people talk about it while ignoring that aspects that I've highlighted.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you can't handle me questioning aspects of pizzagate, and would prefer it to be an echochamber, then just downvote me and move on -but i'm going to question and call bullshit on weak links regardless of whether or not it hurts the narrative. Sorry!

                 I have been researching this diabolical shit for years... years and years... I have reserved my right to judge the stories until now. You are really missing the bigger picture if you think this is all about the Podesta's. This is worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I just think that, instead of attacking what I believe, do your own research and come to your own conclusions... I'm not here to argue and go mental at people, but when there is SO MUCH circumstantial evidence as there is in this case, it simply cannot be ignored. Podesta's aside...

                  Dude - it sounds like you just want to believe, and are accepting extremely outstretched possibilities as fact - while at the same time brushing off my arguments with "you can't prove otherwise" and "but MSM said that". Which are weak arguments that you are only using in your favour where appropriate and I could use those exact same arguments back at you, but I won't sink to that level.

                   Why? Madeline McCann was just another kid... Just like the rest... Why is this so outlandish...? Just because of Podesta's potential involvement...? How many rapists, child molesters and criminals are in the senate? In positions of power? It's no different.

                  <p>
                   The reason I am saying "well, the opposite is true" is because that's correct... Your own arguments just state that "podesta wasn't contactable" - which doesn't prove he wasn't in the country.

                     I could drop the McCann link with the Podesta's and WikiLeaks emails completely and there is still TONS of circumstantial evidence linking Podesta's to a bunch of shady shit.

              I kept the video unlisted since it is completely out of context for normies. I just might make a video giving context first. But I wont be playing the sad audio with the kid screaming ... but will give viewers the option to do so themselves at the link. @_@

               You probably know it but maybe not by Efit?  I'm not even sure why it is called that.   It started with reports like this
               <a href="https://prezi.com/jctatsh7_ebc/httpworldcorponet/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy">
                https://prezi.com/jctatsh7_ebc/httpworldcorponet/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy
               </a>
               for lack of a better link.   There were big threads on it here a few weeks ago but I didn't find them right away so went to the internet for it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It got looked to and some consider it "debunked" because it seems like it was actually released in a similar thing like actually these audio/video Father things - as a warning or a way to frame the Podestas or as an actual piece of material evidence.  Whatever, there is TOO MUCH of this stuff floating around with J Podesta's face, voice and name (yes the Breitbart naming Podesta 2 weeks before he died)  I think those two things in a meme plus the Father voice audio comparison are really a lot and put together make a case that blue pills will take a second look at.    Hope that answers ok, if not let me know.

               The e-Fit is what first drew me to Pizzagate last Nov. Critical, multiple cited sources from New Scotland Yard.  It doesn't get anymore bona fide than this one.

               The Efit criminal sketch is from the McCann case, the tweet referred to is this one:

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The Efit is typically reported to be of
               <em>
                one
               </em>
               person, but that's debatable. Translations etc.
Anyway, a quick look and you'll see that it's pretty much how a sketch of John and Tony Podesta - down to the mole on the latter.

            May I just say everyone keeps self doubting their own  instincts. Knowing all of the "coincidences", for example the code words, the Madeline McCann efit, let's talk aboutthis audio. what does your gut tell you? That instinct is useful during an investigation. Any private investigator will tell you the majority of time you suspect your spouse is cheating guess what? She or he are. I personally am convinced finally  it's him, enough so that I would find him guilty if I was serving on a jury. There is just to much circumstantial evidence it can't be explained. Of course we have never heard podestas side of it.....seems like he is pleading the fifth?  My gut tells me podesta hands are dirty, his canabilism, his involvement with known sexual predators: Hastert, wiener, clintons, Epstein, the disappearance of Madeline McCann. He needs to provide alibis or it's more than suspicious its incriminating. The code words, the dates of his meetings at cpp coincide with a member site on cpp. The art work, and I know I am leaving out pertinent information. How many coincidences upon coincidences  will convince you? This audio is the nail in the coffin. The ball is in podestas court at this point. His silence speaks volumes! Is he planning on pleading the fifth? Eliminating witnesses. The fake news label does not address these questions. It does not offer an answer to all of these questions.  If he does not come out and provide some alibis and cooperate with the authorities then let the chips fall where they may. Deleting emails obviously did not eliminate the trail. Let me call it like it is, he is avoiding responding to these questions. Why? You tell me, A simple alibi would put all this drama to rest. There is no alibi, call a spade a spade. I won't second guess it anymore. It's on him now. He cannot provide an alibi. They know where he was. He knows they know . He is relying on his connections as if he is above the law! He owes the American public an explanation.  His hands are dirty. Call the grand jury.....it's enough at least for an official investigation. To quote the late Andrew breitbart: what's in your closet podesta?!? Either Plead the fifth or stand guilty in the court of public opinion! I won't doubt my self ever again, this goes deeper than him. I dread to know what is in his closet but I pray that everything in darkness comes to light! Amen. For the sake of those children.

              Because you need a search warrant to compile evidence. Don't underestimate the level of organization, supply chains, man power that these elite have. They even own pig farms, build custom kill rooms, and smuggle undocumented children. What hard evidence can anyone here provide with out a forensic field team. Without search warrants that would force banks to disclose information or the ability to wire tap. Don't compare this to a TV show. These are not wild, uneducated, crimes of passion committed by an individual high school drop out who grew up in poverty. These individuals have the best education money can buy, the best connections, unending supplies of money and children. They can hire the best clean up crew money can buy and even own police departments for their or purposes. Does that answer your question?

             Brilliant post...there's ample information and evidence for an official investigation...Brietbart knew what Podesta was - a kid raping psychopath.

             Thank you.  I was going to ask 'now what do we do with it'' but you answered that.  Would a judge consider it enough to place a grand jury?  Because he will NEVER come clean!

            <p>
             And as awful as this is, imagine what disgusting evil things he has on others.   And there's probably more on him.  If anyone hasn't seen the George Webb YT series, I strongly suggest you do!  Day 109 gives an overall summary for new people.  He explains the blackmail/brownstone method that is part of HRCs pattern.

             It is not a stretch of the imagination or instincts even to look at the image of Podesta from the Wikileaks emails holding up his hands and reading what he said. I think the number was 15 on one hand dead little christian fishes is how the other hand read. I do not know if the fish has a gender. It felt like little boys but maybe he said something about boys in the email. How happy he was/is. He is not afraid. He is in the thrall of his talmud for whatever perverted teaching that directs to kill goyim. I kind of can't get past that. Really can't get over it.

               I know he was raised in Catholicism. Beyond that, the only religious text I'm aware of about killing Christians is in the Talmud. I am reading his message on his hands. Thanks for referring to the followers of that Book as Kabbalists. Will refer to that way next time it comes up.

              This I am ranting I know but the connections and his total silence when all of this could so simply be put to rest with answers there are no answers just fake news labels, no more!  Time for a grand jury I am ready to openly demand this! Time for search warrants and Miranda rights, something smells really bad and it is not just him right? It is his brother! And alefantis and wiener and hasert! The epsteins and the clintons and what about the hotdog stand in Hawaii? Those poor kids in the rachel chandler photos. Those poor children on Tony podestas wall! When is this beyond a reasonable doubt? What will It take ?  His silence is loud and clear: PODESTA:   You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. now I know why he is silent he expects arrest warrants any day? Podesta we have your emails!!! Ok enough I am just on fire. Apologies.
             </p>
             <p>
              By the way your posts and your investigations are great I wish I knew how to investigate like that! I am a tech dunce but I pray for these kids every day! Good job! And thank you for fighting for these kids!

               I think he's silent for the same reason Hill makes her little snide tweets; they think they are untouchable.  They always have been.  And you can bet she wouldn't be so smug if the 650K emails were released.

                let me tell you: the ghosts of these children cry for vengenance they died alone with nothing but these evil scum who take pleasure in their innocent cries. Who used them for organs and stem cell as pig fodder omg! Inhuman that is all I will say. And podesta remains SILENT! These children's cries have reached heaven and there will be an accounting. I will always remember they did not die or suffer in vain. Thanks for listening! :)

                     Somehow, that makes me feel better LOL. There's a very funny vine I stumbled upon that I love to watch and have a good laugh. It's a lip-sync, but it's so funny, mocking both sides. Even though I am a huge fan of Trump, i didn't feel offended by it at all. And the title is very funny too. Here's the link. Enjoy :)

             It's sad we have to consider the possibility that it's the FBI (or similar agency) leaking. What do they expect us to do with the leaks?  Shouldn't WE be leaking things to THEM? You know, so THEY can do something about it?

             Hillarys tweet ripped the scab right off, and this podesta bacteria on the open wound guarantees infection, I'm not aware of a child abusive antibiotic for this.  Nothing they try will work, child rape is resistant to treatment.  They can try amputation, but it looks like the entire organism is dying, its gone on too long, it's time for the children to be safe again.

             or is it a way for Alefantis and co (CIA) to leak intimidation material "You better tow the line or else the real videos are going to be leaked" and at the same time conveniently take the spotlight off Alefantis?
            </p>
            <p>
             But I like the way you think.  I think it is too "messy" - real abuse, sketchy website, for law enforcement now, but it was one of my theories.  Law enfocement leaking in order to pressure the peds into acting out or panic.

              Someone else mentioned this here too. Makes sense. Esp. since i have a felling Alefantis may be CIA. Now is it possible Hillary retaliated and put the spot light back on Comet with her tweet? Is there trouble in paradise?

            I don't think it was a LARP.  It happened but we don't know who those people were.  I followed that as much as I could find at the time.  I read a guy describing the CP.  the Anon said half of them were filmed in an" industrial environment ".   Could it have been the silver refrigerated room?  Anyway 8Ch at that time posted real CP a man penetrating a 18 month old vaginally sedated and a 3 year old giving a hand job.  It got deleted but I'm glad I saw.  That same thread had a pic from deconstructing daisy which I saved, but just the upside down part before anything happened. The good thing about the Podesta Torture video (aledgedly him) is that it isn't CP, just torture so we can share it.  Although YT deleted some right?  And I hope I don't need to qualify that I'm glad I saw it so I know it's real. And that some of the kids don't scream, they just accept.  I found that quite sad actually.

             Good Excuse!? Not.  It was LARP? - That's a Flowery embellishment.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess the perps depend upon the fact most people are trained to ignore their own senses and just listen to what they are told?

             Whoever thinks that is LARP has a limited skill set.

             I can't imagine seeing something like that, I can't imagine it at all, like the idea of infinity or 24 dimensions, my brain isn't capable and I think I would instantly go insane if I saw something like that. It must be awful for the poeple who ahve to look for it for their jobs. Just hearing that kid screaming brought me to involuntary tears, and I can still hear him :-(

            I am impressed with the voice work. thank you for what you have done.
           </p>
           <p>
            EVEN MORE impressd with the seeming link between a Comet Ping Pong picture of boys liked by convicted pedo Robinson and the WorldCorp website.  You are really a detective.
           </p>
           <p>
            My new theory:   The videos have been leaked at Alefantis' instigation through a friend running the shady WorldCorp shock/music/gore art/pedo/snuff website and shilled relentlessly by team Brock  IN ORDER TO PUT THE HEAT ON PODESTA and also take the spotlight off Alefantis.  If these are really Podesta, you know he is hearing about it and think of the heeby jeebies it gives him.  His nerves are already on edge probably but this stuff floating around?  it would drive even the innocent nuts, imagine the guilty and fearful of loss of freedom and status - nuts.   It is intimidation and a warning, "we've got the goods on you, don't step out of line, bolt or do anything stupid."  It also might make them feel "in control" and like they are "running" the pizzagate narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your Robinson link OP lends credence to this more refined theory.

              not even.  I would guess that he compartmentalizes all emotions and has little or no access to them.  But he can put on a mask and seem social, and can get nervous, agitated, anxious, afraid, pissed, volatile.   Skippy could even be another personality that takes over that side of him, inflicting terror and feeling nothing, not even remembering it clearly.  And round and round he goes.

               And this probably has been mentioned, but just like the guy from the Johnny Gosche case, he probably was abused as a child and developed Skippy and other personalities long ago.  I got the impression in the original video, that the sick scum was partly 'playing' the 'father', a little bit as a release of his own pent up anger.  I think that's part of the cycle; they at one time questioned why they were abused, and eventually just accept the reasons they're told.

             Thanks... for the record it was Flickr, not Instagram - and the picture posted wasn't by Alefantis, it was
             <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wQvf4Je.png">
              by some other guy

               I connected him (Robinson) directly to worldcorpo.net where the torture/screaming videos originated... And it's no surprise Robinson would have a connection to the website, I first came across him on Flickr when he had a secret account that he had "liked" a Comet Ping Pong pizza picturePNG&gt;

             <p>
              that was the Alefantis (CPP)&gt;Robinson&gt;WorldCorp connection which I think may be more significant than you think.

            Thank you! This is the first time I listened because I couldn't handle hearing the child scream. It's past my limit. In my opinion, that sounds just like that sick pervert. I hope that kid is alive 😕 I don't know all of the details. How did someone come across this audio? Edit: I guess it was a video instead of audio. But who found it and where?

             This was published by Worldcorp. It's either a group of pedos or a group of anons working to expose pedos and trolling them in the meantime.

            You know how many different sounding voices and languages there are in the world? We have this random video dropped in front of us of a guy abusing a kid and out of ALL the voices in the world we cant legitimately say It DOESNT sound like him

             I doubt the naysayers, when they offer and have no proof to debunk. Respecting others opinions, how can people say something is bullshit when they haven't 100% proof of that?  And to be adamant about it? Hmm.. I'm all for listening to all opinions, however total debunkers get the hairs on my body rising.

              That was my reply yesterday to a "debunker"
             </p>
             <p>
              "Look, it could be fake. But just statement from "artist" that it is fake is not good enough. Than the "artist" has to release making process or other evidence that there was no real torture. When it is removed from youtube, channel shot down, the "creation" has a to large impact on society that society can demand proof no real torture was going on imo. And if given, well, it's a real damn good artist to make that "creation". Not my style, can't listen to it without getting tears in my eyes, even if i keep in mind t could be fake. But if Fake, it's a peace of art."
             </p>
             <p>
              For me it sounds way to real to be fake. I think when parent you have a feeling when child is crying for real or for attention/playing.

             urging us to stop this "fools errand" are rediculous and need to GTFO. We specialize in rabbit holes around here, it's nearly a sport. Some lead to more tunnels, others don't. No big deal.

              When I said we have this random video dropped in front of us what I mean is: I've asked numerous times on Reddit and here the question of Who Was The First Person To Uncover And Post This Video?
             </p>
             <p>
              This child abuse video came from some old outdated obscure website that most people have never heard of and
              <em>
               Poof
              </em>
              out of no where a video with a voice similar to Podestas just fell into our lap. I'm wondering if it was leaked by someone close to a real investigation or close to Podesta/Comet Ping Pong but I don't know for sure because nobody has answered my question as to who was the first to bring it up in Pizzagate. I just find it hard to believe someone found this video "Randomly"

              Most good forums dealing with controversy have a character or two who are there to create doubt and ask questions.  It is a useful tool to keep a group from total intimidation of alternative viewpoints.  He is reasonable about it and he promotes skeptical thinking.

            Which clip could have been composed of many sources? If you're referring to the
            <a href="http://www.worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm">
             source clip
            </a>
            *, I think that's highly unlikely. It's one fluid (completely f-cked up) "exchange" between the adult and child.

             Voat wouldn't let me private message you. Wanted to say great job and thank you for isolating that audio. I linked to your video on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             and it's currently at the front page of that sub. Hopefully it gets traction and you can make the video public ASAP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sidenote: interesting channel, who is the female character from your avatar on YT?
            </p>

            this is all very interesting.. but i don't think the voices match. sure they are similar but the father does have a noticeable accent where j podesta doesn't. j podesta's voice is softer as well. what does tony sound like? have we compared it to anyone else on the radar?

            That is no a Chicago accent but he was born in Chicago. Very strange.  So, I propose that his having lived in DC so many years and having graduated from Georgetown, it has played a part in the way he now speaks.  Also, he is yelling and very angry which can make your voice go higher or lower, depending what you want to convey.  My ex used to talk lower and almost growl when he got angry at me although his voice was normally higher.

             He and Tony have lived in DC for 40 years, and I can make a case that they were social climbers and political animals that groomed themselves to look and act more like east coast elites (think Boston) than Chicago tenement spawn, which is what they were.  (No offense to the poor in Chicago or anywhere, it's how THEY would have thought about it)

              Actually Jefferson Park is a nice middle class neighborhood and has always been.  I have a friend that lives there for years.  But they for sure rubbed elbows with the hob nobbers at Georgetown like the rest of their cohorts.  Most definitely they are the type to want to change their speech and accent to blend in and climb higher on the ladder.  Besides when you become MK Ultra mind controled you can blend them all.

               agree completely.   And the tenement thing actually comes from the Podesta's father's childhood.  Dug into their background a bit and Tony said their dad was raised in a tenement and the grandparents were the immigrant generation.

                Yeah, but they must have moved up a little to live in that neighborhood as boys growing up.  Then of course they wanted to go higher.  I think there are things in that family we will never know.  There is nothing hardly on the internet.  You have to know there were some strange things going on for those two to turn out the way they did.

                 so agree.  And Tony mentioned the local Chicago Alderman.  I had to learn why that was important - the Chicago political machine that granted favors and ran almost like a mafia group!  He mentioned his Alderman when he grew up by name in an interview decades later!  So the "machine" they grew up in and became political animals in was important.  And I wonder if some of those men...well one of the famous ones ran a bathouse another had a weird nickname.  And they all protected brothels and ran drink during prohibition.  So I wonder if they didn't have to bend over to get on the inside, to try to not put it too crudely.  And maybe the younger the better.  Just a suspicion.  Something turned both those boys very weird absolutely.

                  Again I also agree.  What ever was going on in Chicago goes on in all the big cities, but we have to admit that it probably started at home.  I have a feeling there were some wild  goings on their home.

            You already proved Robert Robinson is associated with this video. There is no way he and John Podesta are connected.

             I appreciate your reasonableness, but the way you expect everybody to say, "oh, OK, DM lived there, so his agenda or opinion trumps anything we can hear for ourselves."   Sorry, you are just not convincing.  I don't think Podesta should be accused without solid evidence, but you don't need a judge and a jury to say, he is a prime suspect for being the person in that video.  .
             <br/>
             Sorry, just the truth.

             I actually explained in this post how Robinson was already connected to Comet Ping Pong, and therefor Podesta, before I ever connected him to the website with the graphic videos. In fact I first came across him on an old Comet Ping Pong picture he had liked... so yeah, there was speculation at that time if he was just a pedophile who happened to be a fan of Pizzagate? Or was he a pedophile who was a PART of Pizzagate? So yeah, everyone has their opinions - Robinson is obviously involed with worldcorpco.net somehow, but he's also connected to Comet Ping Pong. Two toothless peas in a pod, Rob &amp; John.

              "happened to be a fan of Pizzagate".....Robert has nothing to do with Pizzagate other than the fact he's a pedophile. He's just here to troll. He has absolutely NOTHING to do with John Podesta.

            This sounds very much like him. The part I am having a hard time with is the way the guy pronounces his R's in the video at the end of his words. Video guy has a very soft R and Pedosta has a very hard R pronunciation. If you can, can you roll those two side by side?

             Re-watch "fatherhood" and pay close attention to the lighting itself...it's a bunch of red and purple/blue flashing/moving splotches with the occasional flash of green (and the green always happens in about the same area):

            </p>
            <p>
             Now re-watch that creepy Comet Pizza speech:
            </p>

             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIroYouTube">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIroYouTube
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Watch the light orb thing on the right...it can be set to do that same red/purple/blue flashing and there's a green spotlight flashing to the left of it. And in fatherhood the light is primarily coming from one spot down low (the light fades into black around the top of the video), just like this orb on stage.
            </p>
            <p>
             The white light in each.mp4 could be the same light set to just white instead of color and being carried/aimed by the kid (it seems like the kid is trying to use it to see through the translucent wall at who the voice is, at the very start of each.mp4 the kid says "I can see four of you" and at the end the voice says "That's me, and me, and me" (those are the lyrics to the end of the Calliou song though so who knows, maybe the voice thought it was funny that it could have a double-meaning)
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone know what those walls could be? Can we find those anywhere in any pics related to Comet Pizza, like in construction photos or in the background of videos or anything? They sound like plastic when he hits them (I don't think glass would have that "rattle" sound they make when he hits them), but I can't find any room dividers or shower walls etc with a texture and that bar across the middle in a quick google image search...
            </p>
            <p>
             Something like this is what I was thinking they might be:

            </p>
            <p>
             There are portable room dividers, these could be something they bring out in that room where they have bands play and use it to section the kids off when they do whatever the fuck they're doing in this video to them...also that broom he's using to bang on them would be something you'd find around that band area for clean-up etc

              Really good insight. I watched the two videos at the same time. Why does Majestic Ape light show look so much like the one in the torture clip? Struck me as more than a coincidence. The doors are taller than shower doors, and they're translucent as you say (and not glass,doubt it). And multi-paneled.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is good that we have this ghoulish clip, as seeing is believing (whomever it is) ... but it sure sounds like John P.

              A doctor back in the early '70s used voice-print analysis to try and dispel the Paul is Dead rumor. Imagine what can be done now. Though some guy commented on here recently, who has a background in this kind of thing, says you need 'enough' to work with. The McCartney doctor obviously had plenty to work with (or he wouldn't have tackled it).

             I would bet that this video was filmed in the torture chamber in Tony's basement ( Tony on video? )

              pretty sure the kids are in a shower/tub with a glass sliding door and one of those weird light-ball things inside. Tony's basement is like a huge open space with a crazy projector (I think).

               That's what I thought at first, so I'm a bit torn. It doesn't seem like an ordinary shower situation, and who knows, his 'room' may have one large area along w/ compartmentalized places. Let's go bust the doors down and find out.

              Ah yes, the basement where the complicated art was shown. He was brave, stupid, or careless, or all of the above to go on record talking about his stupid basement designed for viewing 'difficult' or 'complicated' art.

               According to David Livingstone, part of the satanic ritual involves hyping yourself up to do evil.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is because our natura instincts actually prevent us from harming children, so in ancient times they'd get drunk, so drugs, have loud music and chanting, and get worked up into a frenzy.
              </p>
              <p>
               The goal was to "overcome" the instinct not to harm children through distraction and altered mental states.  Being able to sin in such an extreme way was considered an act of power and rebellion against god.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's sick huh?
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, that could be the nature of this video art.  To overwhelm the senses by having images in every direction, so that it's easier to not think about the evil you're doing.
              </p>
              <p>
               And this "think you're hot shit dontcha?" is a sick sort of "self hyping" where the perp is convincing himself that this little kid is some sort of competitor so adrenaline will kick in and he'll find it easier to cause harm.  Sick fucks.  Thanks for the audio edit.  I haven't heard the original with the kid and just imagining it fires me up with rage.
              </p>
              <p>
               In any event, imaging Satanists metaphorically circle jerking each other over how powerful this or that individual is that they can kill and torture without feeling any hesitance.  "Wow you're so powerful I really admire you, you're hot shit."
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillary flicking her bean to that shit.  Holy fuck if this shit is real bring out the goddamned ropes.  I say make a museum/zoo/jail where people can go watch them while their tormented by lack of sleep, load music and occasional beatings.  Okay, now they're getting to me.  A rope would suffice.

               yes...  this is it.   Did you notice the cylindrical structure with the beam of light at the top, capable of projecting images on 4 walls, simultaneously.

            Great.  Very good.  Did you see that I put abortionburger screenshots of the chat room on 8Ch.net?  It is the mod admin stating it is Podesta.  Plus the kid says John twice.  Another thread has a shadow of a hand that has fingers bent or cupped like Podestas Dupuytren's contractures/. The hooded picture and video. And the emails saying he has a bad personality.  To me that is the main evidence.
