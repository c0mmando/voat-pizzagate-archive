            I am definately not saying there isn't VERY questionable things in this magazine,BUT,it is actually an industry magazine much like Restaurant Magazine ,for those in the pizza business. My family has been in the pizza business for YEARS,and I am familiar with this publication.I did quick search for Tombstone on the magazine site,and my grandpas obituary was in the magazine. TRUST me ,I am looking for every lead in this right along with you,and praying for justice for the children🙏🏻
