            I wanted to keep this short and simple: but that is impossible there was just so many sources to cite. I am going to stick with Wikipedia. I included the link below and I also cut and paste relevant text below. I suggest when you are looking to define an illness, stick with scientifically gathered data and not some nonsense that is put together for financial, political and cultural purposes. National institute of health is solid place to start. In addition, In the Wikipedia entry there  is a whole tab dedicated to the controversy and lack of data that is used to put DSM manual together. Now Pedofilia (and sexual deviants) are definitely a political topic right now and lobbying organizations similar to NAMBLA  definitely want to get it defined as an illness because then there is an obligation to treat and it eliminates criminal culpability. I am still waiting to hear what YOUR point is on this forum and where you stand on this issue. Is your priority bringing criminal scumbag pedofiles to prosecution of the full extent of the law or are you trying to present them as victims of a disease who can abuse children without repercussion? Don't reply with more of your nonsense unless you address this one question. I don't hide my opinion on this and you? Where do you stand?
           </p>

            While the DSM has been praised for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria, it has also generated controversy and criticism. Critics, including the National Institute of Mental Health, argue that the DSM represents an unscientific and subjective system.[2] There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from "normality"; possible cultural bias; and medicalization of human distress.[3][4][5][
Now I also am including the quote below from the same link as I thought it was important since you seem to blindly trust the experts of DSM manual.
           </p>
           <p>
            DSM  manual : 100 percent of the authors have a financial conflict of interest when including a set of symptoms as a disease. See below I pasted the txt. Clearly their motivations are NOT providing the utmost in patient care but profit margins are what guides their choices when revising the DSM. Profits for themselves and insurance providers, pharma companies and other stakeholders such as politicians, soros???? Who knows who are the puppet masters? But you should question everything and not be such a trusting robot.  There are no experts, trust is earned, the best source is our logic and sense of right and wrong. These so called experts are making a quick buck and will sell their own child for position and financial gain.  I feel sorry for you. You are not an independent thinker. Worse you seem to defend pedofiles and try to create sympathy for abusers and have no concern for children. What kind of person does that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half have had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry at one time, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest.[82] The same article concludes that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong in those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.[82] I

            You are the one trying to convince this forum that pedofilia is a disease classified by the DSM-V. 
You are the one Citing a source that changes year to year and has classified behaviors and personal life choices as diseases implying a lack of personal responsibility. I criticized your choice in citing the DSM-V which even by mental health professionals is considered an arbitrary and political reference. This publication unfortunately is responsiblefield For the stigma mental health is a soft science, or quackery. The danger of labeling pedofilia a disease means that an abuser cannot be found guilty by reason of insanity. I am trying to understand your point but it seems you are trying to say pedofiles are not culpable because it is a disease. you are in the wrong sub if that is the case and you should find some likeminded people elsewhere. The majority here are more interested in exacting justice against these vicious and cruel pedofiles and vindicating the victims. Disease implies an obligation to treat and compassion for pedofiles and frankly if that is what you are espousing then you have no business coming here and are clearly a shill! I say death to all pedofiles, they are a scourge to be eliminated from the earth! Anything less is a disservice to the victims. I don't need a corrupt reference to tell me the difference between right and wrong, children are our most vulnerable, protecting them is simple logic and the most natural of behavior.

            Your sources change their song every year. You are either a very trusting person that believes everything you read or a shill. Hopefully you learn to question these so called sources and not get led like a sheep to slaughter. That source has no credibility, they are used for political reasons and for financial advantage, every year they change their minds about what is a disease. It's called soft science or quackery.

            The DSM-IV ? This is your source for facts? This is a source that changes year to year depending on the latest fads. This is the Same group that invented the "false memory syndrome" in order to delegitamize the testimony of victims. Next time use sources that are not pedofiles protecting pedofiles under the guise of quackery!

            I'm a bit bothered by the misleading headline.  In the yournewswire piece it says:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A US Secret Service Agent who worked for the Obama administration has pleaded guilty to raping a young girl
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            But that appears nowhere in the CBS article.  The CBS article says:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity and one count of attempting to transfer obscene materials to a minor

            Obviously pedophilia, or pedophilic disorder as it is called in the DSM V, is a psychological/psycho-sexual disorder. Most pedophiles also satisfy the criteria for anti social personality disorder (sociopathy). I'm sure there are some pedophiles who always resist any urges, feel huge disgust and shame and hate themselves, never having looked at child porn or harmed any child. But the majority don't fit into that category and the majority don't care, it's like in the same way it's a tautology to say that sociopaths are horrible people.

            You can be a good and decent person and still abhor pedophiles and other people who do harm to others, you know. Being tolerant doesn't mean tolerating all manner of terrible deeds - it is okay to know that some things are wrong and that some people are bad. People aren't all the same, we're all wired very differently and there are human beings out there you wouldn't even recognise as such if you were given access to their thoguhts and feelings for an hour or two.

            Thanks for the tip!   Now I know there's a mountain of evidence indicating that John Podesta, former VP Biden, and James Alefantis are child rapists and definitely pedophiles.

            Yea mate I understand that, but when its acted upon and covered up, as in the case of many high-ranking politicians, in many countries, it is a crime. A terrible crime.

             I remember a while ago a similar thing happened, mods said they didnt want anything PG related, I think T_D is on thin ice, reddit's looking for an excuse to ban it, so they seem to be booting anything PG related, shameful really.

           <p>
            Is there any way we can use this post to retract my banned status?
I would enjoy being able to contribute to help out and not have to keep creating new accounts?
           </p>
           <p>
            I would greatly appreciate it.

             Hey, sorry I hadn't done that yet. Just removed it now! So just remember to post sources/links, explain what links are/where they lead and how it relates to Pizzagate if it isn't completely obvious like this post is!

             Since you brought up that sub. I've created a new account there and it seemed like I was automatically shadowbanned, so I messaged the mods and they said all new accounts are automodded at first, but didn't tell me, and won't, how long that lasts. My comments aren't getting "accepted" nor are my posts, and it's been almost a week.
