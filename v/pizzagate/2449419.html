<p>Well, is it any surprise that an internal memo went out to the investigating officers that slut shamed the victims? This even though the legal age of consent in the UK is 16.

<p>Police officers investigating the Telford grooming gang scandal, possibly the largest in UK history, were sent an internal memo telling them “in most cases the sex is consensual”.</p>
<p>The initial police probe, Operation Chalice, identified at least 100 potential victims in Telford targeted between 2007 and 2009. However, fewer than ten men were jailed despite the police admitting as many as 200 groomers may be involved.</p>
<p>West Mercia Police sent the memo the year after Chalice was closed, to officers investigating on-going child sexual exploitation in the force area, The Mirror reports. Officers also considered some of the young victims as prostitutes.</p>
<p>Commenting on the revelations, UKIP London Assembly Member David Kurten, blasted: “Telford Police memo on children consenting to abuse is despicable. The UK age of consent is 16.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>“Gangs and their child abusing ‘customers’ that groom, rape and pimp out girls under 16 are rapists. If the police do not know this they are not fit for purpose.”</p>
<p>An 18-month probe by journalists, published last weekend, found that 1,000 girls could have been targeted over 40 years by as many as 70 groomers. They were allegedly drugged, raped, and trafficked, and five deaths have been linked to the abuse.</p>

<p>Wrap your mind around trained professionals describing these minors as prostitutes. How exactly does an underage girl get that into her head? In kindergarten? And the fact that these young girls had NO WAY OUT BECAUSE THE POLICE CONSTRUCTED THEM NOT TO HAVE ONE makes this INTOLERABLE! </p>
<p>Who would they go to other than the police? And when you consider that some were murdered to set examples of what happened to those trying to escape ... what I\'m saying is that adults wouldn\'t be able to stand up to that kind of pressure and we\'re expecting children to handle it better? </p>
<p>Please UKers, make a huge deal out of this. Demand answers. We really should target the BBC and ask them why they\'re not covering, and didn\'t cover, this story.</p>',

            Oh, second and third generation of Rape survivors.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is easy to do if you disarm the fathers from defending their woman's honor, let alone the personal right to not be a victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            They arrest and convict for stand your ground, a fatalistic fuck the victim mentality.

            Now the local police protect the authorized pedophiles with National Security interest against the British "common" subjects!

            The Brits are Subjects to the Queen of England. The children are her right to take as an honorary Tax donation.

            Does no one understand the meaning of Subjugation to a Royal entity?

            The question is why Royalty has a historical control of National Security services? Think that could make it easier to make Blackmail evidence open door never before dreamed possible for the sick fucks on Earth.

             Things are a mess, but the same thing is happening in Sweden and Germany. Evidently, the sheep are allowing this to happen to their children. I gotta say I'm shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope this awakens those that care about children to demand answers, firings, and new policies put in place. I feel sorry for the Brits because they did vote corroectly in Brexit and in electing May. She was the one that talked the good game. They thought they were getting one thing and got The Devil instead.

            You think that's bad? They had to run Kangaroo courts for Gang rape victims in Australia. To protect Australians from learning the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Censorship and the Police have been fucking over the last 10 generations down under.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aussie government had been removing half breeds up until the early seventies. They removed children by the hundreds every single bloody year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Problem is, many never returned for horrific reasons. Poof. Disposable children by her Majesties decree.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Aussies are clueless because the state controlled media manufacture the narrative. Sad thing is her Majesty has done the same thing in Canada and India.  Big time.

             This is why we're in the position we're in. People abjectly refuse to believe evil when it stands before them!

             Thank you for your comments and I'm sorry Australia has succumbed to this. It's disheartening, sickening, and all the rest of the words describing what it feels like to have your heart ripped out. It's why it's important for all of us to connect.

             We can do this. It seems insurmountable, but that's because things have eroded up until this time.

              My family escape Australian control freaks well before the Gun Grab PSYOPS. I returned while the Gun Grab happened, I now understand the power of State Controlled media.

              It is worse in the US with Social Media being used as the CIA's very own psychological operation with devastating effects.

               The control of the press is worse. There's no way to get any truth into a publication that is bought and controlled and printing/pushing propaganda.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember that the legitimate press is what we learned to rely on for the truth. But what happens when it's no longer that? What happens when it spews lies and distortions, and ridicules any attempt to dislodge that which is entrenched?

              <p>
               Pizzagate is what happens.

                 It all comes down to Judgement Day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Right now He's finding all His Little Lambs. People are given chance after chance to make good and choose a side. Whatever sin committed will be lifted if the heart asking for forgiveness is pure in intent to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The judgement will be what they deserve.

             It's the same with gun crimes. The perp is typically given a reduced sentence and the crime isn't taken seriously. Instead the left would prefer to cry about gun crime to strip rights from the law abiding gun owners. If we would just enforce the laws and give the deserved STIFF sentences to criminals we would have less repeate offenders especially pedos!

               Well, it is easier not to do anything and live in a dream state where you actually think elected officials are handling things. But let's see, you're letting the same officials who handled the initial scandal, handle the aftermath?

                  Because they want to believe they live in a society that is more or less ok, and problems will go away when they look away. (One possible answer.)
                 </p>

                  Another possible answer: Because they feel helpless when they realize that politicians (from the local levels upwards), social services, and police are all involved.

             Disgracefully none of the broadsheets covered it.  Seems only tabloid' newspapers like the Mail and Mirror.  I think at this point the UK is lost as a society.
