<p>The Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers on Friday with a litany of alleged offenses related to Russia\'s hacking of the Democratic National Committee\'s emails, state election systems and other targets in 2016.</p>
<p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who announced the indictments, said the Russians involved belonged to the military intelligence service GRU. They are accused of a sustained cyberattack against Democratic Party targets, including its campaign committee and Hillary Clinton\'s campaign.</p>
<p>The GRU attackers also allegedly targeted state election systems, including government agencies and their vendors, and stole information about 500,000 American voters.</p>
<p>The attacks were a signature feature of Russia\'s active measures against the United States; embarrassing emails were passed to WikiLeaks, which released them publicly. The GRU also created other ways to pass the material it stole into the public, including a website called DCLeaks and a fake persona called &quot;Guccifer 2.0.&quot;</p>',

            David Brock, founder of Media Matters, Correct the Record and owner of Shareblue . Not only is David Brock the ex-boyfriend of James Achilles Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong #Pizzagate , but his organizations have closed political opponents and dissenting discussions through less technical means, such as overwhelming them Social networks and eliminate them from the traditional press. Correct Recording (CTR) is a "SuperPAC" founded by David Brock to support Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. CTR would spend $ 1 million USD to find and confront users of social networks that published unflattering messages about CLINTON. Can be a valuable tool and a reference to Internet researchers who meet these online groups and strategies. "George Soros has been the main funder for Media Matters since at least 2010.
Overall, CTR would spend about $ 10 million in total on the 2016 campaign according to Open Secrets. All this would go to the "correction" Redditors as well as members of Twitter and other social media. The CTR is found in innumerable Reddit threads, surveys and omissions of moderators having participated in a major censorship on defined topics such as #Pizzagate. The people was engaged for producing but positive content on Hillary Clinton..."

            "‘COINCIDENCES’ CONCERNING HILLARY
Seth Rich was no Hillary Clinton fan. He opposed her adamantly throughout the campaign. Per statements from Rich’s father, despite the tough relationship between Rich and the Clinton campaign, they offered Seth a job at their New York office. Why would Hillary Clinton look to hire such an adamant opponent to a position in a very important Democrat state? Was Podesta and the campaign looking to create plausible deniability in the case? If so, that shows that they were intimately aware of the travesty that was about to take place in the coming days.
After Rich’s death, things moved quickly. Bernie Sanders conceded to Clinton just two days later. At a speaking engagement on July 12, 2016, Clinton (with Bernie in tow) even used the murder as an emotional plea for gun control. Hillary Clinton was once again feigning care for Rich in order to give her an ‘out’ if the investigation ever turned awry. Did Bernie get the ‘message’ that he shouldn’t pursue an investigation into the primaries?" Author unknown

            "DC Police Seth Rich / PizzaGate Heather Podesta &amp; Rothschild Alefantis Connection"
Published on May 22, 2017
In this video I first go over the fact the Heather Podesta the Wife of Tony Podesta is on the Washington DC Police Foundation Board. This is a massive conflict on interest in the Seth Rich Murder investigation, the lack of investigation into PizzaGate and the investigation of Shawn Lucas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also covered is the DC Police Chief Newsham is a completely corrupt and awful officer. He should not even be on the force, he actively took part in the cover up of the rape on an 11 year old girl. He beat his wife, and got so drunk he passed out on a sidewalk with his Police revolver on him. Newsham is obviously not the type of person you want running a Police department or even on the force, if I ran the MPD he would have been fired a long time ago.
           </p>

            At the end I cover the connections between the Rothschild Family and this entire scandal. Lynn Rothschild is 100% connected to all the persons of interest. Also James Alefantis who was multiple voter id's strangely, owns the same apartment as a Rothschild. "

              REMEMBER DR. SAVA? It was theorized that he was the doctor tending to Seth Rich before he died. Later, HE WAS ORIGINALLY  CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE'S DOCTOR AFTER HE WAS SHOT. Researchers noted this as it was happening in real time. That evening, Trump made a surprise visit to the hospital and brought HIS OWN DOCTOR. After that, Scalese's reported prognosis changed dramatically.

              "Scalise was in critical condition after suffering damage to internal organs, and his injuries will require additional operations, according to a MedStar Washington Hospital Center medical update late Wednesday.
"Congressman Steve Scalise sustained a single rifle shot to the left hip. The bullet traveled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding," MedStar said in a statement put out by Scalise's office. "He underwent immediate surgery, and an additional procedure to stop bleeding. He has received multiple units of blood transfusion. His condition is critical, and he will require additional operations. We will provide periodic updates."

He sat next to Scalise's bed and spoke with the congressman's family, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. He also spoke with Griner and her wife, as well as hospital doctors."

               Wow.  Thanks.  It's really strange going back in time, and going over all this again.  This Sava, there's mention of him and Bosnia.  Could he be also involved in organ harvesting.  It makes me sick to think of it, but now  I remember that we had discussed before that Seth's organs may have been harvested. Yuck. No opportunity is ever missed with these people.

This is my 1st post here, I hope I am doing this correctly/this is the correct place for this but, I wanted to get this out there asap (and see if others might help w/ digging...) In doing a quick duck-duck-go search on the surgeon (Dr. Jack Alfred Sava) who operated on Seth Rich, I came up with this anomaly:
More About Jack Sava - MyLife AKA: Jack A Ateljevich, Jack A Sava, Jack Alfred Ateljevich, Jack Alfred Sava ... More About Jack Sava. mylife.com Interestingly, in George Webb's most recent youtube video he mentions "organ harvesting'" and questions if Dr. Sava might actually, instead, be "Dr. Ateljevich"? Futher, Webb questions if, perhaps, this Dr. may have been in Bosnia, during the conflict in 1992. Here is Webb's video: YouTube Might be worth spending some time looking into this."

              I recently posted to VOAT/pizzagate the original tweet picture with both Alefantis and Newsham in front of the sign.  Now they are only showing the "cropped" version. LOL!

             "INVESTIGATORS NEVER QUESTIONED LOU’S CITY BAR STAFF
Per a report from World Net Daily, investigators never reached out to Lou City Bar for video footage or interviews. The bar has a surveillance system within the building, but per a Lou’s City Bar manager, they were never asked to turn it over to police. To make matters worse, the system runs on a 30 day loop, so in less than a month after the murder, the tapes that would have shown Rich in his last moments were copied over, the proof gone forever.
Do you find it odd that the investigators looking into a murder case wouldn’t review tapes or question employees from the last place the deceased was seen? That goes against every metric of police investigation and following out leads. It would make more sense if they had caught Seth Rich’s killers that same day, but they have no leads or suspects in this case even almost a year later. Any and all information related to that night would have been crucial to aid their investigation, if it was happening.
RICH’S LAPTOP WAS CONFISCATED YET CONTENTS NEVER DISCUSSED
It is not clearly known who has Seth Rich’s laptop, but what we do know is that it was confiscated from his D.C. home the same day as his murder. Additionally, no details from the laptop have ever been disseminated in reports from investigators. It is odd that if this was truly a botched robbery that the investigators saw fit to take the laptop. What would they be hoping to find on it? It is not common practice to keep the laptop of every murdered individual, especially one not connected to the laptop in any way. Did the investigators know a facet of this case that the general public does not? Were they trying to protect evidence in some way? That only strengthens the premise that this was not a robbery gone wrong, this was an assassination and the contents of that laptop give insight as to why.
TIES TO WIKILEAKS
The most damning evidence against the official story of Seth Rich’s murder is his claimed ties to Wikileaks. Per multiple reports, Rich sent as many as 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments (anyone else notice the 1776?) from the DNC to Wikileaks. The DNC leaks archive was released starting on July 22, 2016, only twelve days after Rich’s death. Even before any of this was confirmed in the recent days, Julian Assange, the Wikileaks head, all but confirmed that Seth Rich was killed for leaking to the international leaking site back on August 9, 2016, just days after Rich’s murder."

             JOE CAPONE
Joe Capone is the owner of Lou’s City Bar. It is reported that Joe is one of the last people to speak to Seth before he left the bar that evening. Four days prior to Seth Rich’s murder, on July 6, 2016, Capone was summoned to the White House, but details as to why remain a mystery. Why would a D.C. bar owner be summoned to the White House for a private meeting? And just days before his bar was a piece in a murder investigation? Is it just coincidence that this man also had ties to Rich?"

             OFFICER ROBERT WINGATE ROBINSON
Now let’s look at one of the officers that reached Seth Rich first. As mentioned above, one of the officers to arrive on scene first was Officer Robert Wingate Robinson. Officer Robinson is also surrounded by several ‘coincidences’ in regards to connections as well. He was a student at Georgetown University at the same time as John Podesta taught there (obviously not necessarily a key to this case, but worth noting). Officer Robinson’s sister, Nandi Robinson, worked for Hillary Clinton. Are you still wondering why we haven’t seen body cam footage?"

Seth Rich? He was a DNC staffer who leaked DNC emails to Wikileaks. He was mysteriously murdered a few days later.

Also this invalidates the whole Russia hacking/collusion narrative from the DNC
aside from putting a murder investigation right in the lap of the DNC
"hanging by the nooses" is the right term alright

I still cannot post images. Do the conversations there feel odd to anyone else? I feel like shillbots there are now posting for both sides to make it seem like business as usual, but there is just something off about even the "remember seth rich" posts.

Attacking 4chan? That's how you start a war.

MSM starts a conspiracy with nothing but anon sources and no evidence and people immediately start joining their side and doubting Trump...
Alt Media starts a conspiracy theory with oodles of evidence AND non-anonymous sources (that's big) and MSM, along with large swaths of public, utterly fail to recognize one iota of legitimacy in the claims....
As tupac would say "That's just the way it goes"
But this time...things WILL change..."

              UPVOAT!!!  Thank You Thank You!!!!  All of it So Very True.  I remember all of this.  I was on Reddit before coming here so I remember all of it.   Also remember that Share Blue was trolling many of the subs on there.  I don't believe it has stopped. So keep your eyes open.

            I call bullshit! This is a last minute desperate effort to legitimize Mueller. Did they ever get access to the DNC Servers? No. They did not. This is Deflection. Also it's an open door to attack Trump for having a summit with Putin. Putin HATES the Rothschilds and the Satanists. It's why he stopped Adoptions in his nation to America. This is the DYING GASP of the Deep State.

             Thank You.  Thank You for bringing up those adoptions.  They were horrid.  I remember reading about the children that ended up dead at the hands of those that were allowed to adopt them.  Now I want to look them up, those parents and see if they were torturing or sexually abusing those children.  They said that they were damaged because of their mother's drinking too much vodka.  Lies More Lies. Those children acted out because of possible sexual abuse.  You are right.  They will have their own made up stories about what is happening over there in the summit.  We have to remember that vampires need to be killed with a stake.  I think Trump is driving that stake slowly, bit by bit. I can't wait to see their Last Gasp.

                I am 100% behind you. Who appointed Mueller and why can’t Trump fire him?  The American people should call for him to go. What a Bleeping Joke. Let it be known that I am  a Progressive. A Woke One.

              So not only do you think PG is fake, (sure u do), you also are against any perception that is agreed in here about any news angle. Ain't that a hoot. The government was dissolved march 9th, 1933 via the emergency banking act. USA inc, is a possession of the international banking cartel, The agencies do their bidding. The news is theirs. They pay the politicians, not us. We pay our income tax to them, not the government. You still think their words have weight? You can't just nay say everything.
