<p><strong>Scientology Founder, Ron Hubbard mentions the Book of Revelation and its prophecy of a time when &quot;an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti-Christ, will reign&quot;. According to Hubbard, the &quot;anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer&quot;. Hubbard writes &quot;My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period.&quot;
In the document, Hubbard also teaches that &quot;the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be. In addition to being a lover of young boys and men. he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred&quot;.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It Is a good joke that the Calactic Confederacy is  associated  with  the  Serpent in the Garden, the beast and other emissaries of the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;.      Yet in certain passages and esoteric interpretations of the Bible  (much  of  which has been taken out and effectively suppressed for  centuries)  as  well  as  the Cabbalah, the truth reveals itself quite nicely for the clever and the ungullible.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SCIENTOLOGY AND SATANISM</p>
<p>In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John &quot;Jack&quot; Whiteside Parsons, an avid occultist and Thelemite, follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley\'s magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the &quot;Babalon Working&quot;, a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Thelemite Goddess.
This episode is narrated at length in the Scientology documentary &quot;Going Clear&quot; in Netflix.</p>
<p>Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, Jr., Hubbard\'s eldest son, had been an active participant in the early days of Scientology. In 1959, he left Scientology and later took the name Ronald DeWolf.
In the mid-1980s, DeWolf gave a series of sworn statements and interviews detailing his father\'s history. DeWolf explained his father had been &quot;deeply involved in the occult and black-magic.&quot; According to DeWolf, Aleister Crowley\'s death in 1947 was a pivotal event that led Hubbard to &quot;take over the mantle of the Beast&quot;. DeWolf claimed that &quot;Black magic is the inner core of Scientology&quot;, arguing that &quot;my father did not worship Satan. He thought he was Satan.&quot;</p>

            Hubbard was a fat old sot. Enjoy hell you old bastard. Fun fact: some people think David Miscavige murdered Hubbard. As an aside, y'all need to be watching Leah Remini's show I  Scientology, she is a WARRIOR QUEEN! 😁 And yes. Scientology is full of pedos. It's the perfect environment for them.

            Just remember that Hubbard was a failed science fiction writer--a dubious distinction if ever there was one.
           </p>
           <p>
            He really liked Aleister Crowley (MI6 agent 666) and his invented Satanism project. But Crowley actually said of Hubbard (to Jack Parsons) that he was "the most evil person I have ever met"
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's more on Hubbard: In a 1983 Penthouse magazine interview, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. (who later changed his name to Ron DeWolf) stated:
           </p>
           <pre><code>“I believed in Satanism. There was no other religion in the house! Scientology and black magic. Black magic is the inner core of Scientology — and it is probably the only part of Scientology that really works. Also, you’ve got to realize that my father did not worship Satan. He thought he was Satan. He was one with Satan.”
</code></pre>

              Crowley called them "Goats" 
Hubbard would chant and invoke the spirits while Parsons and Cameron had sex. The men believed they were summoning spirits and lightning with their incredible potency and sorcery, though Crowley was so disgusted by their antics that he called them "goats" in a letter. Eventually Cameron did become pregnant, but instead of spawning Satan, she decided to have an abortion.

             Hi Angela, sorry about the troubles with upvoats and views.
            </p>
            <p>
             We've been experiencing them for two weeks now:
            </p>
            <p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The admins uploaded new code, which seems to have caused the bug. We've been told they're working on the problem, but unfortunately, this seems to take longer than expected. :-/
            </p>
            <p>
             Apologies!

            The Total Freedom Trap:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jon Atack, the author of this booklet, was a client of Scientology from 1974 to 1983. Since his resignation from the Church of Scientology, he has consulted to many leading newspapers and magazines, including the Sunday Times, Forbes magazine, Time, the Los Angeles Times and the Reader's Digest. In 1987, he was the main consultant to BBC TV's Panorama documentary. He has also consulted to TVS, Central TV, Granada TV, CBC, NBC, CBS and ABC.

            Seeing the list of publications...looks like that battle over cult mentality was lost lol.

            This is why I object so strongly to the word "PEDOPHILE".

            These creatures do not LOVE children; they HATE children.

            I'm so offended that I can't even express how profoundly offended I am. I'm only surprised they didn't tarnish all revered figures with this brush.

             I am super offended, too, but if there is one person who can and will set this straight, its Jesus. He's the Big Kahuna, IMO. If this bothers you and me, for sure it bothers him. Im convinced he will act soon, when his father gives the word.

            Hubbard was probably a Satanist (or possibly possessed, if you believe in that sort of thing), so his hatred of Christianity checks out.  If you want another in-depth read on OTVIII there’s a good article here:

            <a href="https://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The bigger issue is how much child abuse has been allowed to continue in Scientology.  Hubbard references pedophilia a number of times in some of his writings.  There’s certainly been a lot of evil perpetrated by this man and his ideas.

             I also believe he probably was possessed. I believe that every high hierarchy satanist is possessed. Their passage from level 9 to 11 i believe indicates the moment of posession.

            How they twist the words.  YES Jesus was a lover of boys AND girls.  He Loved All Children.  But not in the way L Ron Hubbard wanted us to believe.  This is how they twist the words to mean what they want.  It's the normalizing they have done for decades and even centuries in their own brains.  Scientology=Satanism

             Also, the history of each part of the Bible, how the documents were codified, preserved, translated, copied and passed down to us over the years is quite miraculous. Considering all of the many campaigns to burn all Christian literature, and how it was illegal to own, translate or share the Bible for centuries... There is no room to say that something has been missing or excluded from the Bible. Almost all of the Bible writer's were ignored and mistreated in their times, too, debunking the idea that it was written by clever manipulators and designed to control people. The opposite is true: it has a challenge message, with a hard path to follow, but it doesnt shackle the mind, it liberates. From the moment that each part was written, a campaign of slander and censorship has been continually in place. Why? Because Satan attacks what is Holy. This is  reason that, despite all worldy efforts to the contrary, the Bible is the most popular book in the world (by far), existing in more languages than any other writing. Its God's message to us. Nowhere in it does it even HINT that pedophilia is ok, nor that Jesus was into such a thing.

              They always try to twist the words.  But this time, they have gone too far.  Only pedophiles will believe it.   Boy Love is what he means. We know what he is trying to do.

             Yeah I’ve never cared for the term “boy lover”.

             It’s a false paradigm that is used by sick narcissists who certainly do not love the boys they rape and abuse.

              Yes!  And it has been written that pedos actually hate children.  Why would you treat a child like that if you sincerely love them and not sexually.  So we know what they Really mean, don't we.  They are not fooling us.

               Regarding self identified Boy Lovers (pedophiles, activists):  They equate their penis arousal as "true" love. They fantasize that "true" love as a real "relationship", like a stalker imagines a "relationship" with the victim of their obsession. They justify it by saying they would never hurt a child and that their 'sexual mentoring' prevents societal violence because boys are aggressive without the 'guidance' of 'true' Boy Lovers, who understand them best. (they believe every boy wants or would benefit from a sexual relationship with an adult male, whether it's a relative or just a kindly old 65 year old benefactor looking to help a boy in need).
              </p>
              <p>
               A renowned Boy Lover activist, seeking to escape Nazi Germany, cruised the countryside with a band of children, (girls invited to attract boys), having free sex with each other at every stop.  During his life he 'mentored' at least 800 boys according to his estimation, and he claimed to have left each one of them better off for it.  Boy Lovers believe unenlightened parents are the problem in society and they seek to do away with age of consent and laws allowing parents to protect their children from old men who want to have sex with children.  They recommend incest for father who are Boy Lovers with their sons (females are inconsequential to this philosophy, the claim is that females are different and that girls in general don't need sex with Boy Lovers like boys do).

                Brainwashing of their own minds.  Yes, and Narcissism plays into this Sickness of the Mind.  Mental Illness most definitely.  The kind that can not be turned around.  They of course believe they are in the right and we are all in the wrong.  They only mean to help boys, for they will be better for it.  The only ones that will be better for it is the Pedophiles.   Boy Love should be changed to BOY LUST.
