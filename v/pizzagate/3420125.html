<p>Science Funder Jeffrey Epstein Launches Radical Emotional Software For The Gaming Industry</p>
<p>by Drew Hendricks | October 2, 2013</p>
<p>Contributor I cover what entrepreneurs are looking to learn.</p>
<p>Virtual gaming is about to warp through a black hole, thanks to a band of scientists in Hong Kong and a hedge funder with a zealous science background, called Jeffrey Epstein. Indeed, game programming is moving away from algorithmic robots to a twilight realm of emotional thinkers, taking online, video and toy entrepreneurs, one step closer to Star Trek’s ‘Holodeck’.</p>
<p>For years, in virtual gaming, the only intelligent player was the person playing the game, responding to non-reactive obstacles. At most, opponents could blow up or morph into something else. Whatever the reaction, it was a simple linear or algorithmic response (if A, then B, if A+D, then C).</p>
<p>By the 1970’s, opponents became more complex with the development of virtual chess, where the program responded to a vast network of algorithmic possibilities: up to 10123 chess board variations to be exact. But even in those scenarios, the program remains purely reactive and deterministic: it does not have any goals, nor does it aim for check mate, but simply responds to a series of steps that lead to that direction.</p>
<p>Today’s gaming characters from virtual soldiers to Tinkerbell are also vastly more complex than their dash line tennis, Pac Man or Pong forbearers. Like the chess program, virtual soldiers can react to a wide variation of landscape scenarios and respond in a myriad of ways, based on each case.</p>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) group in Hong Kong behind this new emotive software is called Open Cog. As an open-source foundation, Open Cog (‘Cognition for All’) lead by co-founder Ben Goertzel, develops programming language for the AI community to share, in what is still a very fragmented field. However, in efforts to map the architecture of the human mind, Open Cog also programed three game characters, a ghost, a robot and a girl that push past traditional gaming algorithms:</p>',

               Since the beginning of this board, we have been spammed with a certain style of long, forum-sliding, baffle with bullshit submissions designed to tantalize and waste people's time. Submissions that were either nonsensical in part like this one of yours, or repetitive and botlike. Submissions that read as if generated by an AI like those in the article you just linked, in fact. I note the software was to go to market in 2014.

              <p>
               TTT spammed this board with such material and lost his posting privelege after repeated warnings. You are now definitely on the suspicious list. I recommend you take heed and begin adhering to the submission rules and make serious research posts. If you want to shitpost, you can go wild in

            Most people on the internet seem to be living off internet conspiracy fantasies sold to them by Jeffrey Epstein, Marvin Minsky, Norbert Weiner and friends. Some of the top mathematicians are friends with Jeffrey Epstein. Let that thought sink in for moment. It’s as if people who can’t get out of this fantasyland (game theory) and get a grip on reality, are going to be given a pedophile-based A.I. This AGI technology is reaching out to children. If you are a parent are you even remotely aware of the games your children are playing this AGI has access to? Let’s get a friggin’ grip here parents. Look how Ben Goertzel gets idolized on the Joe Rogan show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think for a second who got piles of free cryptocurrency, stock options, and investment credit on this AGI technology including with Sophia and OpenCog coming through “visionary funding”? Why of course, Jeffrey Epstein. People are not being given a choice on whether or not they want to use this technology. Governments are choosing to use SingularityNET to post their A.I. research and it is a massive project. SingularityNET is operated by OpenCog “visionary funded” by Jeffrey Epstein. Now, does anyone actually thing Epstein will spend serious time in prison?
