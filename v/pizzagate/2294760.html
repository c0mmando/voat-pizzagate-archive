              ‘Guccifer 2.0’ claims credit for DNC hack
             </p>
             <p>
              On Wednesday, an individual going by the handle Guccifer 2.0 claimed credit for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s network, though a cybersecurity firm investigating the breach stood by its conclusion that Russia was behind the breach.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Guccifer 2.0” posted to a website some of the allegedly stolen documents. They included a file titled “Donald Trump Report,” dated Dec. 19, 2015, and a list of what was purported to be million-dollar-plus donors to the Democratic Party.
             </p>
             <p>
              The DNC acknowledged the intrusion Tuesday.
             </p>
             <p>
              And CrowdStrike, the firm that investigated the breach, said Wednesday that it had no reason to change its assessment.
             </p>
             <p>
              “CrowdStrike stands fully by its analysis and findings identifying two separate Russian intelligence-affiliated adversaries present in the DNC network in May 2016,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So in the June 14th, they establish that a hack is committed at the DNC and that opposition intel on Trump is stolen.  One day later on the 15th, they take control by establishing CrowdStrike as the authority over what occurred even though it's alleged and looking pretty much like CrrowdStrike was organization behind the purported breach.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's how these scumballs do it.

              Your entire premise makes no sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Guffiifer2.0 was a quickly thrown together character who WAS a REACTION to Crowdstrike going public.  He pretended the be Roumanian, but couldn't speak the language.
             </p>
             <p>
              What do you mean lays' the groundwork for the dossier?
             </p>
             <p>
              The dossier was commission by Republicans back in 2015.   They needed opposition research for the upcoming primaries.  Steele was hired his April, his first update was in June 16 and doesn't mention hacking at all
             </p>
             <p>
              from wikipedia.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In October 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates.[1] For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, The Free Beacon stopped funding research on him.[21][22][23]
              </p>
              <p>
               In April 2016, the investigation contract and funding were taken over by Marc Elias, a partner in the large Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie and head of its Political Law practice. Elias was the attorney of record for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Clinton presidential campaign.[6] In total, Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 of which was paid to Orbis Business Intelligence, a private British intelligence firm, and used by them to produce the dossier.[24] Glenn R. Simpson of Fusion GPS has stated that Steele did not pay any of his sources.[25]
              </p>
              <p>
               In June 2016, it was revealed that the DNC website had been hacked by Russian sources, so Fusion GPS hired Orbis to look into any Russian connections.[21] The investigation was undertaken by Orbis co-founder Christopher Steele, a retired British MI6 officer with expertise in Russian matters.[21] He later told Mother Jones that he soon found "troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, 'there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.'" He described the finding as "an extraordinary situation" and that it was "sufficiently serious" enough for him to share it with the FBI. He did this in July, without the permission of Fusion GPS.[26]
              </p>
              <p>
               Steele delivered his report as a series of two- or three-page memos, starting in June 2016 and continuing through December. He continued his investigation even after the Democratic client stopped paying for it following Trump's election.[21] After the election, Glenn R. Simpson of Fusion GPS "reportedly spent his own money to continue the investigation".[7]

              I can follow this (with effort!) up until :
'they take control by establishing Crowdstrike as the authority over what occurred even though.'...its looking like Crowdstrike was behind the breach.
?are you thinking that DNC paid Crowdstrike to say it was the Russians?

               What's being alleged is CrowdStrike helped the DNC by carrying out the strategy. The payments prove that there was a connection. As to what the payment is for is anyone's guess and conjecture. But in order to ascertain what connection was struck, you have to look at what transpired at the time. You also have to take into account that no other accredited security firm came to the same conclusion. And WaPo just coincidentally published the narrative?

           <pre><code>I will not leave this beautiful country without saying that the “Guccifer Project” was a failed project. My will / intention was to fully expose the Illuminati / the Council, and their crimes, but I failed!

“Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt nature to understand what I am talking about.

“Though I know I invested a great deal of time &amp; effort trying to expose the crimes of the Rockefellers, the Bush klan, the Clinton, and many others, maybe my skills (or lack of skills?) were NOT matching my faith.

“So, I apologize in front of the unknown soldiers who struggle to take this fight against these monsters to a glorious end. Many of ’em are risking their lives, while doing this behind the computer screens, from inside or outside the system.”

             Believe that was answered previously. Remember the two payments to Crowdstrike? They were timed just before two the deaths of Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas so they were working in conjunction.

              So is it this? The leak happened , possibly related to Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas, Crowdstrike is buds with Soros and DNC so they make up Guccifer 2.0 persona to make it appear that someone with mental health issues is behind the leaks...to discredit?
Sorry, I am a bit thick on these IT stories....

               Pretty much. Be sure to add in that Guccifer was Russian. That's a key component in launching the fake narrative.

              Who was working in conjunction?    Isn't the conspiracy supposed be between the DNC and Crowstrike?  And Guccifer 2 the guy calling them out?
             </p>
             <p>
              The DNC paid Crowdstrike.    So how does Guccifer 2 help Crowdstrike or the DNC?

              Also Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas were friends?  First I'm hearing of this.

                Yes, well her jobs in the field of Space Science could also play in, but maybe just her knowing Seth Rich was enough for them.  But there must have been someway they knew that she knew something.

                  They thought they probably created the perfect scenario.  Robbed at night.  Drug Overdose, whether on purpose or not.  Pay off another coroner.  But really the botched it.  There are so many unanswered questions, they will never hear the end of it.

                   Yes, they botched it big time, but it doesn't even matter. Nobody's doing anything. The cork is in the bottle and nothing's getting out. That's the frustrating part. People can collect all the evidence they want, and it won't change a thing.

                Yes, and I have read before that Seth Rich and Molly knew each other, just as Seth and Shawn were friends.  Here is one of the comments and I think it is a pretty smart analogy. 'The Sy Hersh phone call indicates that Seth had friends who also had access to the dropbox he offered to Wikileaks. If Seth and Shawn were indeed friends, I bet that Shawn also knew about the dropbox. And I'll bet the people who murdered Seth had found out about this, and so had to kill Shawn too. My theory is that the people who created the Guccifer 2.0 hoax had to kill Seth - and anyone else who could prove that Seth was the leaker - in order to prevent their fraud from being exposed. It is speculated that, before his murder, Seth was interrogated under torture while drugged - and this might be how the killers learned about Shawn' involvement."

                 Yes, well that whole night needs to be reconstructed. Turns out, Joe Capone, owner of Lou's City Bar, is now saying Seth Rich was never in there. Remember how he had this whole story about how depressed Seth was and that he was going to Wonderland, well, it never happened. And Seth was broken up with that skank lying girlfriend. Damn, I could never stand her. So where he was and who he talked to falls back to being a complete mystery because the parents won't allow Seth's phone or laptop to to be examined.

                  Yes, I remember the whole Wonderland story.  WONDERLAND again? Why would he say he went there when he did not.   A Head Scratcher.  He really seemed happy with her in the pics I saw, but maybe he did not know she was part of the plan.  Who knows.  I hope something comes of this.  If nothing else, more exposure.
