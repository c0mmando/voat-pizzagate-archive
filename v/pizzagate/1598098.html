             Dr. Pong Manifesto, Presse rants: 'rough around the edges, a bit bizarre, but fun as hell'

            These translations are probably pretty terrible, but here they are:

            Slide and blaring
           </p>
           <p>
            At Dr. Pong in Prenzlauer Berg you with one hand can keep a bottle of beer, with the other premium practice, run to a ping pong table and chat at the same time with people. A self test.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is, says R. My Swabian friend is right. I ask the next who comes in to close the sliding door. He looks at first unsure, then I make the corresponding movement, and he understands. As he walks over to me, he says kindly: "I'm not speaking German." Here it is very international. Later I'll have a Word with him and at three in the morning in the night tram we will wave to even us. And all because Dr. Pong - and the binding force of the table tennis.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the front. Really, I am table tennis player, with Club and training. Dr. Pong is a pub with music and a plate. And together we are a risky experiment. I do so as I could not play. And I'm good in that role. I games with links, even though I'm right handed, make strange movements and knock the ball past, as all other. I'm often the free hand in your pocket. Others keep a bottle of beer. Although casual - effect but I can not drink, I'm here to work.
           </p>
           <p>
            The room is about 30 square meters, further back, there is a small bar, but a great ping pong table, model Joola 2000, an approved tournament plate is, after all, at the Centre. Otherwise it's pretty simply here, the window facing the street are taped, from outside is to see a black and white image with Swedish table tennis player. Thats because of the cops, says my side man in the rotation, which not can look there.
           </p>
           <p>
            The floor is smooth. Many therefore slide around corners, just past on the chairs, which are on the edge. There are the losers. Between 12 and 20 people join each round. The last two play the final. The ball is first put to play, who has impact. Absurd in these premiums.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I have prepared me for this evening, and brought a racket. A Senta allround wood by TSP, a 730-covering, 1.5 red on the forehand and a cut to 1.5 mm black on the backhand. I lend the bat but then R., who has drunk about five beers, trying to avenge that out has smashed him previously but still in the "asshole". My Club helps him throughout the evening. I'm one of Dr. Pong. You are severely pitted, partly without linings. I take out the best and me series in the game.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first time I immediately fly out, I win by two edges balls in the final for the second time. In the background ' come Mr d Maitra "by Harry Belafonte runs. Later, I lose a round in the final 3-2 against R.. A friendly service, that's okay. I win for the fourth time with a net ball. Still I am not discovered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quickly, a few players emerge. There is the best (for me of course), which looks always so grim. R. prompts me to punish him. Therefore I change my bat in the final in your right hand and take care of it. He even noticed the change of the hand. The second-best player is nice to me (after me, and the best). He is told quite often when Dr. Pong, he and has an own bully is no longer particularly spirit present this evening. Sometimes he is until 8 o'clock in the morning here, he says. He is then also that unmasks me almost still at the end. He discovered my Donic bag and asks me about the notes, I'm at. Henceforth, I must resort to a gesture, which hurts me very. I suggest pretentious with the edge of the bat on the plate, to display a new round.

            If you follow the link for the design of drpong it takes you through one site to another that is in Berlin? Saying that they make cutting edge
Web designs?? All of the pages that linked from drpong look like a child has designed them, their messy and completely out of order, why a company from Berlin and why claim to be a web design company when the pages you've made look like utter shit? Somethings not right here...

             Blotto design split into two firms. The Dr. Pong website just looks like it was designed quickly and cheaply.

            First of all, this smacks of "dominos" with the giving and taking of control.  Secondly, it screams of Pegasus Museum. That room is completely a" take down and re-arrange to suit the mood"  museum. I believe that upper floor loft platform is slid over and victims are suspended from that "O" ring hook in the ceiling. That ring was purposely put in AFTER the remodel.  I also consider that platform to be used as a "viewing" area to watch what is happening on below them.  I believe he is using CPP for the same type of venue.  Just my two cents.

            Certainly doesn't make any sense does it? Reason that I wouldn't have a fkn clue what their talking about, but on the other hand if you were in the know I'm sure it would make a lot of sense? Have you looked in to the people that designed it? Their names are at the bottom
