<p>The reason for this is normies don\'t give a fuck about reading about pedo rings cuz its uncomfortable. But the (((leftist))) propaganda as anchored the &quot;fight racism&quot; trigger into almost all of 
society, and they\'ll be expecting to feel good about themselves by clicking the link. As they start reading, we just hope their natural curiosity takes over and they keep reading.</p>
<p>4- Expect to get your account blocked in 20 seconds (happened to me).</p>
<p>5- Respawn and start over from 1.</p>
<p>Anyone knows who to program a bot for this?</p>
<p>PS: if I get suicided, it was murder. If I have an accident, it was murder. I am happy, have plans for the future and am a safety minded individual in my day to day that keeps in great shape and health and is 
concerned with his safety.</p>
<p>PSS: shills will appear and say &quot;It\'s over, Trump won.&quot;, ignore and KEEP PUSHING. HIGH ENERGY AUTISMOS!</p>
<p>PSSS: I was banned from the vietnamese t-shirt stamping place of discussion for saying that:</p>
<p>Seth Rich leaked the DNS emails to Wikileaks.
The emails make the base for the investigation that is now called pizzagate.
Imran Awan finds out that Seth Rich is the leak.
Seth Rich gets killed by the Clintons.</p>
<p>On a pizzagate bread that was going on. The bread was 404\'ed some 40 seconds after I poasted dat, and was under HEAVY shill attack. Guess it must have struck a nerve on the (((merchants))). </p>
<p>Shills will say this is bunk, have a folder prepared with good info graphics that BThemTFO so newfags learn the truth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Preemptive shill tactic inoculation:</p>
<p>When shills say something like:</p>
<p>&quot;I spent a long time researching pizzagate. I know the satanic practices are real. And pizza places are being used as a front (they\'ve been since the 80s, but with drugs instead kids. 
Then it went to callboys, and now children). However, pizzagate was brought to attention by the very same people you are up against. They control the narrative to make any talk about it look foolish. 
And you are going along with the narrative. So don\'t tell me who you think is awake or not. Do you really believe Julian Assange is really on our side? I would have believed it if he died, but he didn\'t. 
Instead it was a LARP to draw our attention, just like Seth Rich the israeli agent.&quot;</p>
<p>OR:</p>
<p>&quot;Wikileaks is a Mossad front, you\'re playing into the juice hands&quot;, think about something, that is like the leftists commenting on Trump ordering the CIA to stop the financing and training of ISIS with &quot;THAT IS WHAT RUSSIA WANTS&quot;. I don\'t give a fuck if pizzagate was handed on a silver platter to general population to investigate by Mossad, get the fucking pedos, we know that pizzagate is real, lets burn these fuckers at the stake by mass redpilling the normies.</p>
<p>Another common shill tactic is to imply that pizzagate as to be playing into the hand of the globalist scum because powerful ppl don\'t get sloopy. THIS IS A SHILL DEMORALAZATION TACTIC. Powerful people that feel untouchable and invicible for extended periods of time are the most prone to sloopiness in result of their hubris. Just look at Hitlery when she said that she was so far ahead of Trump that she didn\'t even though about him anymore, someone who felt so unbeatable by anyone that she got sloppy and beaten at her own game.</p>',

             Hi there!
It's not my blog, I just got the idea of coating the red pill on the favorite treat of the leftists so they swallow it.
Good job, its important to save everything, the treasonous globalist scum are getting scared, they will try to shut everything down.
They won't escape the wrath of the people they've been treating like cattle for long.
Have a great day friend!

            I don't think it is a good idea to lure people in under one premise, and switch to a different topic, that's the other side's tactic, and should not be from this side. If you wish to educate someone on pizzagate, do it, with the actual information, one on one, and ask if they have seen anything themselves that make them uncomfortable

             I agree with you on one part, but see the need to force feed the red pill on another hand. Ppl who care about the truth will search for it, and those are probably already here on on some four chum bread discussing this. But many normies that are not complete retards in the sense that they are not brain dead SJW or hardcore leftists (although most normies where I live have leftist tendencies, that crap is all around and ppl grow up around it and many never break the conditioning), but at the same time they just want to keep their buzz going and you'll probably never get them to click anything pizzagate related in their lives. If we shove an introduction to pizzagate thru 100 normie throats and 1 of them starts doing his own research, and talking about it with ppl IRL and on the net, and perhaps even shoving the pizzagate redpill down other normies throats in a similar shotgun faction thru out the net, we can acelarate the rate of research and the awareness that people have on fake news (where I live almost everyone still believes CNN narrative of Trump and Russians, very sad), given that we scale the operation. That is why I will need to look into boots, that way, even if only 1 in 1000 persons who get bait and switched keep readying the landing page till the end and starting adding man power to the investigation (which is probable because that shit is so disturbing that I believe most people will want to help), if one person can target 1000 per day and get 1 extra man power, imagine what 100 people can do (target 100000 ppl per da, add 100 manpower), 1000, etc. And as we keep going we can refine the shotgun method, as to make for better ratios of opening and reading (which we'll never know exactly). The secret to this is to make it an autistic storm. There are plenty of more organic ways to spread the awareness, this is just one more tool in the tool box which, at the end of the day, has no negative repercussions at all. Ppl who won't read the link, won't read, people who do, will be glad they did. And now that Jamie Alefantis has been doxxed and shown to be an Rothschild, we must push harder.

              Your motives are noble, and you should continue. I'd like to balance the opinion by reminding that most people can't think as fast as us. A balanced approach to an individual's own speed is more likely to succeed. Best wishes.

               Agreed. 
Today I redpilled my mother on this. I showed her the Ben Swann video (this one:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSvUlkB61s">
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBSvUlkB61s)
               </a>
               ) and showed her some of the photos on the landing page of the shotgun redpill campaign. She isn't internet minded at all (she uses internet once a month, if that) so she won't be adding to the manpower, but now she knows, and she knows she can't trust the MSM news to cover important stuff.
You too friend, have a great day!

                Ah! Now we are really getting somewhere! If others are watching this conversation, link back the "if you just watch one video...", and it would be most helpful if the vid had the desired reaction. Mr. Swann's video was great for its ability to serve as launching platform for people to start off from.
