            You've brought up a very important point I think a lot of people are missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't studied cryptography at any advanced level, but I'm familiar with something called
            <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/iguide-crypto-hashes.html">
             cryptographic hasing
            </a>
            . This is something Assange is very familiar with, as he remains a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange#Hacking">
             renowned hacker
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks isn't today's average news outlet. They specialize in integrity, an
            <strong>
             extremely
            </strong>
            imperative facet to cybersecurity and e-Discovery as a whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point you made about believing that the only remaining truth to be the originally posted emails is a sound one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, that's all I can really make a case for. After having that
            <em>
             essentially
            </em>
            proven to you, it's up to you to understand logic, the manipulative tactics involved in politics, and other governing aspects of truth (as it is naturally subjective) such as philosophy (which gives us an understanding of personal motive and prepares us for manipulation) and social sciences (which helps us understand the dynamics of social interactions).

            Agreed that the only undisputed part of this is the emails which are demonstrably true.  Also the vast, vast majority of social media pictures.
           </p>
           <p>
            The part where people here don't understand how other people view it is that the rest of it is based on interpretation (of emails and linkages between organizations and peoples) or inferring (the social media pictures).   Everyone can insist otherwise, but there is no smoking gun as of yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are inferences based on that which is true (Wikileaks emails and social media pictures) but there are no photos or videos of anyone abusing children.  I don't think I've read of any victims of JA or JP coming forward and having their story corroborated.   At least to my knowledge, I don't know of anyone of stature accusing Podesta of molestation before pizzagate.  Breitbart said he covering up for ACORN who was abusing children.  Damning in light of other things but again, not a smoking gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            People here shouldn't just dismiss people's skepticism of pizzagate with 'sheeple' or 'idiots who haven't looked at the evidence'.  The evidence proposed requires inferences and interpretation.  People should keep in mind that a lot of people do not instantly suspect someone of pedophilia based on pictures or weird comments.  People need things presented coherently based on a sturdy footing otherwise it strains their imagination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just my two cents and if there is evidence of that nature, send it my way.

            You understand that the FE video with stefan was an obvious setup to make FE look crazy and unsubstantiated? They literally must have gotten the worst flat earther to debate him, which leads me to believe this was intentional to make stefan look like the sane, rational one and the FE idiot look insane.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only did he not bring up many of the arguments most flat earthers believe are proof of a FE (lack of measurable curvature, obvious NASA psyops and Lies, accuracy of the Gleason map/FE map, Michelson-morley experiment, sagnac experiment, just to name a few) but he obviously knew little about FE and sounded completely irrational. Stefan got the worst FE faggot you can possibly find and had a 1 hour debate about NOTHING with himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is the only source you used for your FE research, you might want to ask stefan for your time back. He will never have a real FE debate with a seasoned veteran like Eric Dubay, or allegedly Dave (dmurphy25 on youtube) because he will get ripped to shreds and lose his precious subs. FUCK HIM and FUCK YOU. I hope you like a side of dick with your confirmation bias.

             The Flat Earth theory is pathetic and moronic. It has been destroyed thousand different ways, but obviously the powers that be are pushing it, because it discredits other conspiracy theories and draws attention in to something completely idiotic and useless.

               That applies to you as well, sir. You simply assume that I haven't researched this subject. And I have, I have watched several hours of documentaries etc by the most popular Flat Earthers, including information by Eric Dubay you mentioned. So it is you who condemn me without investigation, while I am merely talking about my investigation in to the several hours of Flat Earth arguments and documentaries I've watched, and rejected the fallacious sophistries of these people pushing this theory.

            Well said, and I agree. My hope goes up and down weekly and sometimes daily.

            Most of us that are open to the possibility of pizzagate as a reality, seem to be above average in critical thinking and are wired to want to face reality and seek the truth even if it is uncomfortable. Regardless, probably for most of us it is a perspective to be mindful to keep in balance and look at each piece of evidence as its own before jumping to the most fitting conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the nature of this particular pizzagate ordeal is internally conflicting because on one hand the reality that the facts/clues lean towards is SO OUTRAGEOUS that it is hard to even grasp... while on the other hand the amount of "evidence" of pedogate and factual history of pedophilia in high societies/ governments is just there and there is no denying it- how could it be completely ignored? If the case were of a more believable/less severe crime, then we would be more easily able to use the evidence and form a solid case. The extremity of pedogate being so far from most people's normal reality, is used against us by naysayers /guilty people, and very easily.
           </p>

            Not quite, but almost reminds me of gaslighting... where the abuser (mainstream media and it's puppets and brainwashed) tells you that there is nothing to see behind the curtain, all the while you are seeing very well the disgusting monster that has flung the curtain open... you are crazy for seeing it. But they know it's there. At least if they are honest with themselves.

             You know who gives me hope? Bill frikkin Cosby. He kept his roofy/rapey racket going for decades with quiet pay-offs, intimidation, and media manipulation. But in the end, the media landscape shifted beneath him, the internet roared to life, and it chewed him up. Now he's been reduced to pretending that he's too senile to understand what he's accused of.

              Keep in mind, pizzagate is just over 3 months old and it's already got this much traction, more people jumping on board every day too! What a time we're living in!

              So true.  I personally believe the truth comes out sooner or later in most cases.  Just hopefully it will be the full truth and before these assholes die off so that they can do some time in prison.
