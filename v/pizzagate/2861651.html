<p>So far we openly know of the connection between George Soros and the Clinton Foundation through large donations and shared ideology, and we have identified links from the Tavistock Institute\'s research playing into large parts of federal organizations involved with domestic populations. However, Soros can also be more directly linked to the Tavistock Institue. <strong>Soros has closely worked with Joe Lewis</strong>, particularly in regards to Black Wednesday where they both made inordinate amounts of money from the pound crashing. Lewis also is the main investor of the Tavistock Group, which was founded out of the first generation of Tavistock Institute\'s staff. </p>

           <p>
            So far we openly know of the connection between George Soros and the Clinton Foundation through large donations and shared ideology, and we have identified links from the Tavistock Institute's research playing into large parts of federal organizations involved with domestic populations. However, Soros can also be more directly linked to the Tavistock Institue.
            <strong>
             Soros has closely worked with Joe Lewis
            </strong>
            , particularly in regards to Black Wednesday where they both made inordinate amounts of money from the pound crashing. Lewis also is the main investor of the Tavistock Group, which was founded out of the first generation of Tavistock Institute's staff.

             Not sure if this is related but FBIAnon said that Muhammad Yunus needs to be looked into. He also said to be careful with this name. He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in developing the Grameen Bank. He is a pioneer of microcredit and microfinance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yunus was a Clinton Foundation donor, and one of his charities, Yunus Social Business GmbH, teamed up with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti to "solve social and environmental issues in Haiti by bringing sustainable, productive, and socially responsible forests to the country" via the Haiti Forest initiative.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Yunus resigned from a group called the "Elders," he became a regular at international conferences, including a youth leadership conference called One Young World.

            The Creche helps the children to socialize, play together, and start to learn Arabic and French. These languages are commonly used in Morocco but not always familiar to the Berber-speaking children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asni Creche needs a regular supply of learning materials, toys, and fun activities to ensure more children can benefit in the future.

           <p>
            Thanks to the Asni Boarding House for Girls, girls are able to complete their Baccalaureate, have greater employment opportunities, and some girls are even able to go on to further education, however the house is over-enrolled and there is an urgent need for items to help sustain the project for the future.

            This is a well thought out scam I believe.  There is a list of supporters as well.  This is a very remote area high up in the mountains so only those that are wanted make their way there.  I remember researching this place but could not find it in our Search.  I had to find it on the internet.  Possibly it came up in the comments within another subject.  Branson is involved in this as well.

             Prince Harry's friends offer insight into island party holiday
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Prince Harry's naked antics in a Las Vegas hotel room took his reputation as a party animal to new heights.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 27 year-old and a large group of friends including Arthur Landon, Tom “Skippy” Inskip and Cressida Bonas, his most recent girlfriend, spent a week on Sir Richard Branson’s private island of Necker celebrating the 27th birthday of the Virgin tycoon’s son, Sam.
            </p>
            <p>
             One friend, Rory Hoddell, joked; “Damn you jet lag!” while Dan Philipson, a friend of Prince Harry’s who dated Chelsy Davy following her split from the Prince, commented: “That is funny as fark!”
            </p>
            <p>
             Hours after they arrived, the Prince and four male friends hired a cabana at “Surrender”, a vast open-air nightclub based around a pool at the Wynn Encore hotel where he was staying. The cabana, which featured a red sofa, red stools and red curtains, and a large plasma television screen, had a view across the pool on one side and a balcony on the other side overlooking the Las Vegas strip.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was about 10 yards from a back entrance to the VIP section of the Encore hotel where the Prince’s £5,000-a-night suite was located. Surrender also features dancers in skimpy red bikinis gyrating against poles to loud music.

            “I’m going to rape you like I rape my daughter,” Rubin, a former Bear Stearns trader, yelled out during one of the attacks, according to the lawsuit.

            Why would we be surprised that Soros hangs around with a Pervert Scumbag like this?  Someone shove a mic in front of Soros and ask him what he things about that charge.  These are the kind of people Soros surrounds himself with.

            <p>
             One of the standouts on the Art in Embassies program is Masterpiece INTL, a Manhattan-based cargo shipping service specializing in fine art. While that’s not exceptional in itself, information on the Masterpiece website proves that (1) there is proof that the works of art can bypass security, and (2) that they also permit the shipping of “perishables”.
            </p>
            <p>
             The description of the services of Masterpiece, located a literal stone’s throw away from the Rockefeller Standard Oil Headquarters, shows that FAPE’s shipping service gets special privileges when crossing national boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
             So let me get this straight. I can’t even carry a laptop on a fucking flight anymore, but anyone with an Art Gallery whose part of the program can ship large, cumbersome, ridiculous, bloody, pedophilic works of art around the world under the supervision of the Podestas, Kennedy’s, Kerry’s and people connected to history’s largest smuggling rings?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the big picture that everyone is missing. And they’re pulling this off right under our noses. The Rockefellers run the folk art industry and are prominent donors. Tony Podesta is a record-breaking collector. They all visit the Venice Biennale and go to major art events all over the world.

            <p>
             Wesley Robert Edens is an American businessman, private equity investor and sports team owner.[1] A cofounder of Fortress Investment Group and founder of New Fortress Energy[2], Edens is also a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with Marc Lasry. He also owns the League of Legends team FlyQuest.[1] A group consisting of Edens and Nassef Sawiris injected cash into English Championship club Aston Villa in July 2018, becoming majority shareholders
            </p>
            <p>
             He began his career in 1987 at Lehman Brothers, where he was a partner and managing director until 1993.[6] He then went to BlackRock's private equity division BlackRock Asset Investors, where he remained until 1997 as a partner and managing director.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wes Edens was one of five principal partners—Peter (Pete) Briger, Jr., Robert (Rob) Kauffman, Randal (Randy) Nardone and Michael Edward (Mike) or (Novo) Novogratz[8]—who founded Fortress Investments in 1998.

             Prior to joining Fortress, he was a partner at Goldman Sachs where he spent much time abroad including leadership roles in Asia and Latin America. Novogratz is a 1987 graduate of Princeton University, where he was a member of the wrestling team. He was a Virginia state runner-up in high school wrestling. He served in the U.S. Army National Guard after college. His siblings include Jacqueline Novogratz and Robert Novogratz.

            <p>
             His sister Jacqueline Novogratz is founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, while his brother Robert Novogratz is a designer who has been profiled in the Bravo television series 9 by Design.[1] Another brother John Novogratz is a senior managing partner at Millennium Partners.

             In 2006, he bought Robert De Niro's $12.25 million duplex in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood.[2] When he moved into De Niro's former residence, Mickey Rourke moved into Novogratz' former Meatpacking district residence.[1] He and his wife Dora "Sukey" Caceres have four children.[1][9] They also own a home in Amagansett.
            </p>
            <p>
             In September 2007, Novogratz was listed at #317 on the Forbes 400 with a net worth of 1.5 billion dollars.[20] He was ranked 962 on the March 2008 Forbes list of world billionaires with a net worth of $1.2 billion.[21] The same year, he became a member of Kappa Beta Phi[22][23], a Wall Street secret society made up of wealthy financial executives. By 2012, after the decline of Fortress' stock price, his net worth had shrunk to $500 million.[2] He supports Democratic political interests
