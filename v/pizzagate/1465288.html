Its like a history of this sick pedo fuck that basically influenced our policy and started the gay agenda in America.  You can basically trace it all back to this.  Tons of info in here you guaranteed never saw b4.  But somewhere in this documentary, this pedo scientist said some shit about it being harder to do it here anymore in the US but overseas its ANTHROPOLOGISTS studying it and the subject is (these sick fucks i cant believe this is even a real term) \'child sexuality\' 
They may have it under different terms, maybe this is the sex education theyre doing in Africa.  Speaking of sex education, that basically came from the &quot;research&quot; (disgusting crimes against humanity not research) and he picked up where some sick fuck pedophile nazi left off.  This is truly horrifying shit, but this documentary basically covers the whole history of where we got to today.
