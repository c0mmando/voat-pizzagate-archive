<p>her wiki page :  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Waters">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Waters</a> </p>
<p>her intagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alicelouisewaters/">https://www.instagram.com/alicelouisewaters/</a> (seems nothing particular but i didnt dig it a lot)</p>
<p>Some people already pointing to her in previous post but its not get enough attention in my opinion...so its a kind of repost/summary of the finds and few more things...(i did find only 2subs mentionning her but could have other i didnt find...)</p>
<p>--&gt; Fisrt reason why i believe we should dig more on her is this pics that probably many here have seen already  <a href="http://sli.mg/NCW4od">http://sli.mg/NCW4od</a> where we can see witten discretly &quot;Moloch Machine&quot; on a pics from Alenfantis instagram , where it say that she offered some present to him.</p>
<p>Also the hashtag &quot;LittleJapaneseThings&quot; can sound odd too...again speculations here, but in a context of pedophilia suspicions i assume we all know what it could mean...and what kind of presents it could be....</p>
<p>here the 2 past subs speaking of her of which i will try summarize the more important finds here  : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451378">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1451378</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1440036">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1440036</a> </p>
<p>-&gt; from the first listed sub -comment about the initial A.L on the handtowel of the J.A pics: &quot;I believe that is &quot;A L&quot; for &quot;Al Netilas Yedayim&quot;, a special Hebrew handwashing ritual. That\'s what I got Googling &quot;A L handtowels&quot;
(note that its also could simply be Alice Louise or something else..)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>here an article describe her relations with the white house : <a href="http://archive.is/hAvSg">http://archive.is/hAvSg</a> website named &quot;Sun-sentinel(dot)com&quot; &lt;sun cult symbolim related ?..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extracts from this article : &quot;&quot; I went to talk to a celebrity (A.Waters) in San Francisco who inspires cultlike devotion(...)&quot; - </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Waters has been much in the news lately as the fairy godmother of the White House organic vegetable garden,
&quot;cultlike devotion&quot; (?) &quot; &quot;godmother&quot; of the white house&quot; (?)..hummm...
i studied a bit ancient cults and pagan cults etc, and its a know fact that in some of this sects the highest level are woman , powerfull wiches woman... again ,here only speculation, but all this make me think it need more digging !</p>

<li>
<p>one comment on a song  Arlo Guthri  write about her first restaurant in the 60\'s: extract &quot; you can get anything you want, at Alice\'s Restaurant Excepting Alice You can get anything you want&quot; Here\'s the trailer to the 1969 movie they made about song about her restaurant: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9wLQsCYC5r8">https://youtube.com/watch?v=9wLQsCYC5r8</a> (pics of the comment : <a href="http://sli.mg/r72EbS">http://sli.mg/r72EbS</a> )</p>

</ul>
<p>here from the 2nd sub : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from her instagram a pics where she speak of Comet Pizza/alefantis organising Pizza party for hillary campaign - (logo&quot;H&quot; remasterised with pizza) here (lol at the last comments :\')) : <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKhHsk8gz6r/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BKhHsk8gz6r/</a>?

<p>The poster think that in this Spirit Cooking event film we can see A.L Waters at 6:22 - 
 iam not sure what to believe its hard to say with the quality of the video, i asked few people and some say that they are sure its her without doubt ,while others dont think its her....so you decide...any opinions/researchs on this subject are welcome !  here a screenshot comparing her photo and the film : <a href="https://i.sli.mg/0N0THZ.png">https://i.sli.mg/0N0THZ.png</a>

<p>here is a pics of her with Obama , she received a price &quot;the National Endowment for the Humanities award&quot; :  <a href="http://archive.is/wLAKC">http://archive.is/wLAKC</a></p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>here two additionals pics where u can see her enjoying/having fun with Alefantis : <a href="https://sli.mg/hpSOZj">https://sli.mg/hpSOZj</a> and <a href="https://sli.mg/j29RJv">https://sli.mg/j29RJv</a>  (these 2 pics come from a PizzaGate FB group, i asked the girl who posted it the source but she still didnt answered me atm..)</p>
<p>What i think we can do that i didnt do yet: </p>
<p>try to find anything could be relevent with her (her past life, relatives, friends etc) - try to check if there is direct relations with Hillary Clinton and/or Podesta - maybe checking wikileaks emails or any other leaks place...</p>
<p>side notes : </p>
<p>for those new here: Moloch is a (old) deity known in sacrificial cult especially kids sacrifices or/and cannibalistic cult. Google it for more infos ; ) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i seriously believe that this reference in the J.A pic is not a coincidence at all ,neither the fact thats its really made to be &quot;dicreet&quot;... its mean something ! and i dont buy anymore the &quot;joke&quot; theory ,specially for this pics, i dont see anything funny at all in this random pics !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here an extract  from Metropolis by Fritz Lang the Moloch The Machine : where u can see people being sacrified/thrown to fire in a mouth symbolizing Moloch - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-fINQZUIM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-fINQZUIM</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>--&gt; just my opinion we should try to concentrate on our person of interest, not on the Moloch symbolism side etc that already have been discussed here and that we can find many infos on the net already...</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for help !!</strong> </p>
<p>(ps: english isnt my first language so sorry if i did mistake, i will maybe edit it later for add few things if i find any more infos now iam done for the moment )</p>',

            I noticed  Alefantis is on Waters  Edible Schoolyard Project staff.

              She has the H and 2 slices of pizza that  showcased the   food part of an event.    They can’t tell me they don’t know what the pizza means with all his pizza  code connections.  2 slices have slightly different colors –  one white, one darker.     Judging by the comments  Waters has to know what’s up.

              Her  annual  new years bread pic  has a star that’s cut in an artistic  semi-pentagram shape.   Her comment notes that it’s a very symbolic  bread.   Last years star wasn’t blatantly marked with artsy pentagram slashes and mentioned it's levain bread.    Levain.   hmmm.

              The Instagram pic of the Sicilia cake with 3 legged art piece.  This is triacria symbol for Sicilia, Triacria Island.  Triacria  is Triangle.   These symbols are very old and they’ll have trouble replacing them.

              One pic  shows Alice with  a man wearing a t-shirt   slogan on the front of t-shirt says  “It’s Time”.   Alice comment says,  “Prime Minister  Gough Whitlam.   What a visionary he was!   IT’S TIME for a delicious revolution."

            Whitlam was a Australian Prime Minister –   Australian name for the president.    I remembered reading that name and sure enough,  Fiona Barnett,  a child abuse survivor  blew the whistle on him as a pedophile killer.  I haven’t had a chance to go through the commentators   accounts.

            How would anyone  describe  food as a visionary and delicious revolution while comparing food to an accused  pedophiles  t-shirt slogan?           I notice another person on this thread  showing   Waters at the Abrahovic  spirit cooking event?   If that pic can be authenticated that it’s real, not a photo shop,  we have a BIG connection. Marina Abramovics  desensitization of human body cannibalism in the form of food art  is huge.

              A pic of her and Barry Obama  getting a  national endowment for humanities award.   She must be one of the cooks appointed by Obama to head the  national  cooking   team.    I wish someone would investigate all the cooks.  So far  Bourdain and Obama’s  conversation is suspect of  code words that do not involve   actual food.   A pic of Mario Batalli  is buddies with  JPodesta.     I wonder  how connected they are with each other and why Obama  chose those specific cooks, were they pay and play members or just lucky to get his attention and placement?

              A pic of a desert cake in the shape of a pyramid.   The comments describe it as  a meringue  birthday cake for Tony.  Tony who?  How many Tony’s would be partial to a pyramid shaped cake?

              Pic of the guy in front of the pink balloons  at a SanFran gay pride parade.  She says he’s expressing her joy.  Maybe she’s gay?  That’d explain Barry’s appointment of her award.  He  has a gay promotional agenda along with promoting American  chefs apparently.

              One picture, I can’t remember which one now,  had a strange comment  by someone named Sashalevine.
I looked on her Instagram and saw the portugese restaurant pic of Farta Brutos.   I know portugese has a pedo rep, while travelling I met a family from the  US on a one year  stay in Portugal.  I’m a female and he told me to avoid it.  I was young at the time.  The family told me that while camping a portugese man approached them and wanted to buy  his daughter.  They left the country asap.  It really shook them up.

              her comment next to the photo showed a cat emoji.     Is cat code for girl in this case?

           <p>
            I checked out  Farta Brutos restaurant facebook page.   A review specifically describes that a few portugese dignitaries like to eat there, they’ve got to eat somewhere, but it might be worth digging for a global connection  food source  restaurant.    The rest is in Portugese and I can’t read it.

              A pic of  a woman holding a pizza,  in Naples Italy.   A comment  says

               @hotgirlseatingpizza
              </a>
              it’s a closed account but the avatar looks  questionable and something to look into.  On that commentary   avirnig makes an interesting comment.  Pre-PG I wouldn’t of thought anything of it, but now it seems suspicious,  detailing a restaurant in SanFran that serves Napoli Pizza among other things.

              A pic of a man with a black hat and white beard, Carlo Petrini, Italy’s  Slow Food President.  Slow food is a push-back of  fast-food.   She’s got a number of pics of Petrini.    An article by Heather Paxson mentions  Petrini:  file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/64493.pdf   says, ""A fat society would be a consumer’s society, though not in the manner of the cannibal or the narcissist….In a fat society…[c]onsuming would become satisfying to the degree that it became social, generous and unburdening. People would consume not to hoard but to harbor. Abundance would not terrify them, for they would not fear that everything must be consumed lest it consume them. Abundance would be a quality of life rather than a test of appetite.”
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            As an aside, I know this sounds odd,  but the article made me wonder if    the fat obese society  is fed for the advent of a cannibal society?     Now that I put  Waters pic with Abramovics  spirit cooking,  the pentagram and she’s got to know what the comments on the  H-&gt; pizza photo mean.   This would connect some of   the Clinton/Obama/Alefantis  food connection a little further outward.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the comment on Prime Minister  Whitlam's  t-shirt makes more sense.    Waters  co-chef creation with  Abramovics  sperm, breastmilk shit recipe,  Abramovics  cannibalism dinners,  Whitlams  heroic place in Waters commentaries ----    A delicious revolution huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            Abramovics  use of the pentagram is well known.   Waters symbolic use of the artistic pentagram on her symbolic levain bread = pics of them together doing   rituals with spirit cooking.   Is this what it's time for?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there’s more to dig  but at this point I have to stop because my eyes are going buggy and my computer is slowing down.

              I don't have screen grab  but go on the opening posts instagram link. Scroll down and you'll see a pic of her sitting in front of what appears to be a black and white pic of  the austalian  prime minister. You'll see it he's wearing a shirt  that says it's time.  She may have have photoshopped, or may have posed  somehow on her Australian trip. The fact that Whitlams pic is black and white and hers is color suggests they may not have been physically together.  I don't know if the original pic showed him wearing the tshirt with the phrase or if the phrase is photoshopped.

               ok thanks for ur answer, i will look into it later, if u want, for u, next time, u can use a simple and tiny software called FastStone Capture ,for screenshoting a little part of ur screen for example...and u can then host it on a website like sli.mg , very easy and quick ;)
              </p>
              <p>
               i did a little digging on my part before on some of ur infos and others related to A.Waters too, but didnt find much ..but iam still not closing this lead for moment ;)

                I am interested  if you come across any other connections with australia names, the farm and museum specifically and the 2 female chefs she has pics with.   Whitlam already has Fiona Barnett backing that and i find it hard to believe that Waters doesnt know about his past or Alefantis details.  These specific connections with food, Abramovics cannibal agenda  "art"  and  whitlams accused child murder is suspicious.  Barnett was on record in a few  of her testimonies saying she witnessed cannibalism from these groups of people.  It appeared that Barnett was being groomed to lead a division of it, which makes sense because she's sharp.  She had a conscience  that couldnt be broken.

            Possibly a distraction but consider the other side of the argument. If human trafficking is taking place then the perp would benefit from having an A-List celebrity or famous chef as cover. With Jeffrey Epstein it was inviting famous people to his Pedo island like Steven Hawking etc. Those famous people are totally innocent and are just there for cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also think of Jeffrey Epstein flying to Africa with Kevin Spacey and another guy. Kevin Spacey was the cover, the excuse to go to Africa. That trip was totally legit but Epsteins trip to Africa after it was where the high end human trafficking happened. These people didn't get rich and powerful because they're dumb and possess strong moral fiber. Behind every great fortune is a great crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and bee tee dubs Africa is the sort of the gold standard in human trafficking. Libya didn't just experience the surge in human trafficking in the past few years. Libya has been the human trafficking route from Africa to Europe for 1000+ years.

            The kitchen towel says "My dearest James".  That sounds pretty friendly to me.  Is that her hugging that cutout of HRC?  A little over the top.  Thanks for all the time you put into this research. Have an upvoat.

            I've noticed Alice Waters popping up in some of these things as well and I'm not sure what to think.  Is she simply on the peripheral of these circles because of networking and being involved in politics?  She is basically the inventor of California cuisine, it's hard to imagine she is a satanist, human trafficker, cannibal or pedophile but at this point I'm not outright dismissing anything.

             sorry for me its not that hard to think she could be a satanist of some sort,...not hard at all in fact...i studied a bit old pagan cults etc (and not only on youtube) in middle age etc, wiches was the ones that kept the old occults secret alive, womans was often the leader of some cults - and even if iam agree with u that she seems not suspect at all at first glance, its also exactly the kind of people who seems innocent that could be the prosper ones in this kind of stuff...we are dealing with clever people i believe...i think we must to dont let our assumptions only close a potencial lead....
            </p>
            <p>
             what i shared/compiled here, seems at least to show 1) she have close link to Alefantis..2) IF its confirmed that is her  in the video, she also attend to Spirit Cooking thing..she seems quite comfortable with Abrahimovic too...and 3) this "moloch machine" pics referenced to gifts from her on J.A pics...&lt;&lt; for me,only this is enough for make her a suspect here...even if i really aware that all this thing sound totally crazy ,  but we are dealing with crazy stuff so...i still think she need more digging...
