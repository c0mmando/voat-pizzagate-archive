<p>The victim was discovered duct-taped and covered in feces in a closet in 2016, according to local reporting. A tipster called police and said he was offered the girl for sale as a sexual plaything by Francisco Javier Rios-Covarrubias, 30, an illegal immigrant DACA recipient from Mexico.</p>
<p>Rios-Covarrubias, 30, allegedly offered the 3-year-old malnourished victim for sex as he was left to babysit the child by the mother, Mayra Solis, 22, who was also arrested and currently faces numerous related charges. Solis’s original charges were recently dismissed by the country prosecutor, but she was re-indicted and served new charges while in custody. Solis faces a preliminary hearing scheduled for November 26, 2018, in Maricopa County Superior Court.</p>
<p>Police found the child with her legs and arms bound and duct tape over her mouth. She was covered in feces inside a black trash bag with nothing but her shaved head exposed. Law enforcement at the time said the level of neglect was so harsh; the girl could not stand as police initially indicated the girl was sexually abused.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old mother Solis and Rios-Covarrubias pleaded not guilty to multiple felony abuse charges in February 2016. Rios-Covarrubias later pled guilty on August 28 and was sentenced on Tuesday. Solis was also arrested for fraud because she allegedly shaved her daughter’s head to fool people into giving money on the basis that she was suffering from cancer. Medical exams reportedly showed sexual abuse signs and officials claim the girl was thrown into a closet and left for hours–and even days–as the adults went to work or hosted visitors for paid sex.</p>
<p>At the time of his arrest, Rios-Covarrubias was being shielded from repatriation by President Barack Obama’s DACA program, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

             "We had no idea that Mayra was allowing all of this to happen," Maria Solis said in Spanish from her home in central Mesa. "She moved out in October and told me she was moving in with a family."
            </p>
            <p>
             Solis said she was at work, cleaning a house, when a co-worker told her about her daughter's arrest.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I immediately went to all the hospitals looking for my granddaughter," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mayra’s relative, 19-year-old Jazmin describes, her as a "reserved" person. She said she had noticed that Mayra had alienated herself after moving out of her parents' home in October.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It’s hard; it’s hard on all of us because none of us knew what was going on so for us to find out over media, it was a shock," Jazmin said. "There is no other way to say it."
            </p>
            <p>
             Mayra and her daughter’s father separated in May 2015. Mayra then moved in with her parents before telling them she had somewhere else to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I asked her repeatedly where she was living and Mayra would not tell me," Solis said
            </p>
            <p>
             One day in December, Solis tried to follow Mayra to her new address, only to be disheartened when she lost her in traffic. Hearing of the horrific details of what Francisco Rios-Covarrubias is accused of doing to her granddaughter leaves her in tears.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I can’t wait to have her here, know where she is, and protect her," Solis said.

             “The lead officer was debating calling CPS because obviously shoplifting with child and the condition the child was in, but for whatever reason they didn’t do it so we thought that was strange.” Tilley told KNXV. “It’s just heartbreaking because you know something should have been done ahead of time back in December, and it’s just a shame it took something to this extent to happen.”

             The second situation was far worse. Devani was placed in a house with foster parents, one of whom is currently serving a 17-year prison sentence for his prominent role in running a pornographic pedophile ring out of his house with the foster children that DCS placed with him. Law enforcement discovered a graphic video in David Frodsham’s house with a little girl crying out for her mother as she was being sexually assaulted.

             Devani’s mother had long been reporting signs that her daughter was being molested in foster care, but social workers and the attorney appointed by the court to represent Devani, Thea Gilbert, told the court that the mother was simply “interfering with placement.”
            </p>
            <p>
             DCS looked the other way when Devani and other foster children in the Frodsham house of horrors showed clear signs of being victims of sexual abuse. It took the federal ICE agency to bring a stop to David Frodsham pimping out foster children in his house as part of his pedophile ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             The department refused to return Devani to her parents. DCS terminated parental rights, refusing all along to allow the child to live with any family members.

             As far as, is this case connected to an elite pedophile ring?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is the fact that AZ a high incidence of child abuse and the government checks not doing their jobs isn't enough, what about the fact that this little girl, Would Not have been found in a bag of feces damaged and found like this. . .
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              bound, gagged and “inside a black trash bag with only the top of her head exposed. The victim was covered in human feces.”
             </p>
             <p>
              According to police, the tipster said he met Rios-Covarrubias online and went to his apartment for a sexual encounter early Monday morning.
             </p>
             <p>
              “When he entered the apartment, [Rios-Covarrubias] was dressed in a pink dress and a blonde wig,” reads the probable cause statement. “[Rios-Covarrubias] performed oral sex on the witness, and the witness smoked some methamphetamine that was provided by [Rios-Covarrubias].”
             </p>
             <p>
              At some point during the meeting, Rios-Covarrubias allegedly brought the child out and asked the witness, who has not been identified, “if he wanted to have sex with the child,” Meza said.
             </p>
             <p>
              The witness told police the child’s mouth was taped shut and her hands were bound.
             </p>
             <p>
              The witness said he argued with Rios-Covarrubias and left the residence, but returned later and the two had sex. It was after that second visit, police said, that the witness contacted investigators and alerted them to the condition of the child.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those injuries, police said, include several scrapes and scratches, a “severe blistering rash” and evidence that indicates she may have been the victim of sexual assault.
             </p>
             <p>
              “It brings to light the efforts we need to continue on sex trafficking. It’s a problem that exists,” Meza said.

            What a horrible crime perpetrated on that Poor Precious Child.  I had a hard time reading it, as I know many others did as well.  It is always difficult for me to understand how anyone can do something like this let alone to a Child.  But a Mother and Father? Prayers for that Little One. She will have a hard road ahead of her.

             I believe it is Absolutely connected as he had a guy come to the house so he could engage in sex, wasn't the first one, this 3 year old's vile abuser had a blond wig and women's clothes.  He brought out the little girl and offered her to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The man claims he did not take him up on it.  Left, they argued, then he came back to have More sex with the abuser.  After leaving second time called authorities and described the little girls condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             Horrendous.

             I told the whole story in all the specifics as you can see, I attempted to jump through the hoops.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a Vast Pedophile and child trafficking situation that has gone on for Years in AZ.
            </p>

             Truly All border states and throughout the U.S. if there need to be connections to something more sinister.

             This poor little girl just Knows them All as vile abusers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some kids in her conditions believe it is normal for all children to experience this Because they Don't Know Any Different!
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides, how do we know if those coming to his house are of means or maybe they pose as "low level thugs," but are as means.
            </p>
            <p>
             These sick crimes Are Not just exclusive to the elite and it makes them no less repulsive no matter their means or ethnicity.
            </p>
            <p>
             She will Indeed have a hard road ahead of her carmencita.  You and all other Truly Good exposers of these heinous crimes Know that CPS doesn't always protect these children.  I gave some examples right there in AZ.  So very sad.

            <p>
             One accuser connected to the military.  Not sure if that is considered Eilite, but definitely Is an institution where there have been among some ranks pedophilia problems dating back to Anton LeVay.  Others have come forward in certain military families telling how they were inducted into satanism And sadistic pedophile abuses.  Horrific.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyhow, the girl's grandmother claimed, not to know.  She is now homeless, but if she were not and can be proven not to have access to other illegals that are not vetted, then I would think she would be the Best caretaker for this poor baby.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for caring about this little girl.

              Would you try to post it in pg again?  Because yes, the Military is considered of the elites.  We have done posts on some that are Military and even Firemen too.  We had a post quite a while ago on how CP was being made on a Military Base in Columbia.  Fifteen year old girls filmed.  So yes, it should be allowed.  It is so frustrating posting this everyday and after almost 2 years (for me) it seems to still be continuing full speed ahead.  A lot of the raids  I believe are faked.  Maybe a few for real but some are fake.  Just my opinion.  That is a sad thing to say but I believe it is reality.  The good thing is that we have woken up many and there was never anything on twitter 4 or 5 years ago about child trafficking like there is now.  We have mad people aware.  The problem now is how to stop it or drastically cut it down.   Thank you for caring too and not giving up.  This is hard.

               Thanks caremencita,
I revised it, took out all that may be perceived as conjecture (even though those of us who have been at this for a while Know better).
              </p>
              <p>
               I put in Tons of more evidence, sources, tie in's to the huge problem with CPS and the border states, and the child traffic epidemic All over the U.S.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had already submitted revisions, but to connect it all together for them, took more than the allotted characters so put it in a response, with a reply to the response.
              </p>
              <p>
               May have had one piece of opinion in one response, but I'm sorry, they Are arsses whether Elite pedo rings or what was being referred to as "low level thugs."
              </p>
              <p>
               I had asked the mod if it was enough.  Didn't hear back.  Maybe he deleted it already.

                I don't think it would be deleted as of yet, they have to tag it with a warning I would think.  If you supplied a lot of evidence and sources I don't see a problem, but then I have to remember we have new rules now.  Thugs or Elites, yes what is the difference.  In our minds nut much.  Congratulations.

            requires linked sources supporting every major claim; this sub is for research posts not opinion. You have numerous unsourced claims and statements here that either need to be edited out or backed up with linked evidence. Also, you need to clearly state how this is relevant to elite child sexual abuse and link evidence supporting that. You have to show this isn't just some low level thug thuggin'.  I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair to edit.

              Thank you for attempting to edit, AJ. Unfortunately,
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              isn't for articles about every heinous child abuse case that pops up  in the news. It's specifically for those that will help take down elite pedos. "A larger pervasive problem connected to access at the border" is definitely indirectly related, but we have a separate subverse for that:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              . If you want to include this story as part of a post about why building the wall is essential to breaking the elite pedo stranglehold on this country, we might be able to leave something like that up, depending on how well supported the argument is with other links establishing that stranglehold.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm afraid I have to remove this per Rule 1, though. Please do repost in

            This is so so awful. We see these horrible cases from all types of predators -- immigrant or not, illegal or not, American or not.  Evil doesn't care about race or immigration status, wealth or profession, etc. etc.

             Completely Agree!  Said something to this effect yesterday on a report.

            <p>
             Doesn't matter who they are or Where they came from.  If they're harming a child and perpetuating this evil on them, they need to be Stopped.

             I thank you for that statement.  I so agree.   It's horrible no matter who commits it.  No matter who they are they are just as sick as anyone else that would do something like this to anyone especially a Precious Child.

             Grandmother wasn't aware, but she isn't in the care of the grandmother, rather CPS.

            <p>
             Sickens me because I did a report on this last year where an AZ child went from home to home where there was an abuser and the CPS worker Did Nothing to help the child though there was evidence abuse was taking place.
            </p>
            <p>
             This post is considered a low level abuser so I believe it will be taken down.  No doubt in my mind this was all part of what they have been doing at that AZ border for some time.
            </p>

             Fits the profile.  He also had some sicko come to his house where this boyfriend of the mother was dressed up in a wig and dress and they engaged in their activities, then he offered this baby girl to the guy.  They argued, then he came back, engaged more.  He left and apparently called the police about the little girl and her whereabouts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pretty sick stuff going on there.  I realize now this board is only for high level profile pedos that cater to elites.  Perhaps I will post it on the pizzagate whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
             There should be a board titled **We don't care how poor you are you sick baby raper,we're reporting your evil!
            </p>
            <p>
             I suppose that would be considered "politically incorrect.*

            <p>
             Never been one to care about political correctness.

             Police found the child with her legs and arms bound and duct tape over her mouth. She was covered in feces inside a black trash bag with nothing but her shaved head exposed. Law enforcement at the time said the level of neglect was so harsh; the girl could not stand as police initially indicated the girl was sexually abused.
