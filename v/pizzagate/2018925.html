             That road is so fucking murky...if I thought I could maintain my sanity I'd do it in a second but that's even too much for me to handle. I could only imagine the filth that would be easily obtained. FTP sites like this are Pandora's box.

            <p>
             I'll leave this to a more inclined/well-minded individual. I don't think many "normal" people could access that without taking a bullet to the brain shortly thereafter....whether suicided or not...
