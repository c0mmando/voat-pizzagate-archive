extreme depression.</p>
<p>So i had the idea that i would track all of the BEST youtube videos and put them in a play list, why?
So i can go back and watch them later, borrow from them when compiling data. Share with others
the best video content with out sifting through a ton of  clickbait or garbage...</p>
<p>if a video made the list there is some inherent value / or payoff even if some of the details may be dodgey

<p>The reason i reccomend Evvonne is because of her attention to detail. She reviews the pizzagate information
out there and as with having many eyes looking over something, her experience, uncovers things that others would
have missed. ( example in the Secret Pizza Party Childrens book, she makes the connections that \' being recognized from the wanted posters\' is actually referncing the missing child posters ) She also pulls no punches in her videos, her commentary is witty and entertaining.</p>

<p>Barry is a conspiracy theorist with wild ideas that are both entertaining and get you to think about things in a new light.
Not everything he posts is 100% accurate or true but its ALWAYS interesting to look at,
 What gets him a mention in my list is how he SUCESSFULLY Predicted there would be a Comet Ping Pong staged event,
an entire NINE DAYS Before it happened and even told us the time frame of when to expect it.
 i know this to be true because i had no idea this would have been a thing or could have even been a thing ( i am new
to the entire staged events crisis actors etc thing ) - i watched the original videos close to when they were put up in late November.
 He Said for Certain it would be an actor (which it was) and it would involve fake victims, and either a gun or fire.</p>
<p>and finally  Really Graceful - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/reallygraceful">https://www.youtube.com/user/reallygraceful</a></p>
<p>i don\'t particularly like her &quot; style &quot; of presentation, but i won\'t let that stop me from watching her videos because, she is on her
grind trying to get the truth out. Currently she has the biggest audience and reach, and so she needs our support while she is
on the front lines fighting for Truth and Justice.</p>',
