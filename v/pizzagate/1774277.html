<p>Many of us are familiar with Dr. Handrahan’s recent report, “Professors and Staff Arrested for Trading in Child Rape” which you can read here: <a href="https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e">https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2/professors-staff-arrested-for-trading-in-child-rape-6c39fcf62a9e</a> </p>
<p>Here is Dr. Handrahan’s database page that tracks child porn as well as child sex trafficking arrests: <a href="http://data4justice.org/">http://data4justice.org/</a></p>
<p>Here is her main website: <a href="http://www.lorihandrahan.com/">http://www.lorihandrahan.com/</a></p>

<p>Here is her Twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/lorihandrahan2">https://twitter.com/lorihandrahan2</a></p>
<p>She needs our help inputting data into the database she’s created that tracks arrests and convictions of child sex traffickers and child pornographers. From the database website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The American public needs to know the statistics of America\'s child porn crisis in order to keep our children safe and halt the crime that is threatening all of our security. The US Government is not (and should be) collecting demographic data on arrests for those trading in child rape and torture, aka child pornography.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if you can dedicate just one hour a week to inputting information from your local newspapers into the database, we can show the world that PedoGate is real and the numbers of monsters out there are staggering. </p>
<p>From Dr. Lori Handrahan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our immediate goal is to get 1,000 child porn arrests entered before the end of April.</p>
<p>It is very easy:</p>
<p>(1)	Go to <a href="http://data4justice.org/submit-data">http://data4justice.org/submit-data</a></p>
<p>(2)	Decide how you want to enter known child porn arrests. </p>
<p>(a.) Select a professional subject and enter all known arrests you can find of coaches, doctors, professors, etc. </p>
<p>(b.) Pick a region and enter all known arrests for California, Alaska, Maryland, DC, etc. </p>
<p>(c.) Pick a time from and enter all known arrests from 2014 or 2013, etc.</p>
<p>(3)	We also need someone to go to my Medium profile <a href="https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2">https://medium.com/@LoriHandrahan2</a> and enter the data in my various lists. This is, perhaps, the easiest way to start.</p>
<p>Please contact data4justice@gmail.com and let us know what category you are entering child porn arrests under so that we avoid people entering the same data. Thank you!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find the known child porn arrests by:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A)	Searching on Google and using keywords like: child porn arrest Maryland; child sex abuse arrest</p>
<p>(B)	If you are willing to pay for PACER, you could access federal child porn arrests on PACER</p>
<p>(C)	Anyone with a university library access can use Lexis Nexis and the other great search engines to search</p>

            People needn't forget that just because you're accused of having CP, doesn't neccesssarily mean that you put it there and consumed it. The Deep State can easily frame people with CP.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, that Inside Edition journalist who was just arrested for CP. What stories was he working on? Is he being set up because he investigated something that threatened the Deep State?
           </p>
           <p>
            I still think tracking these events is prudent. Arrest patterns can be ascertained through them, painting a wider picture of WTF is going on. But, I fear some people are not taking into consideration the frame-job aspects of CP arrests.

             I have that concern too, but we need to start somewhere. The database will be updated as arrests turn into convictions or charges are dropped. The database is one thing, but it doesn't stop us from discussing issues/concerns here on Voat. I think it's vital we continue to investigate all pedo-related issues as citizen investigators.
