<p><strong>Some background on Olin:</strong>
From the Wikipedia page, &quot;The Olin Corporation is an American manufacturer of ammunition, chlorine, and sodium hydroxide.&quot; Originally, this program was founded by Franklin Olin in order to supply coal mines with gunpowder and explosives. In 1898, the company expanded to include ammunition cartridges - for guns of course - for the sole purpose of maximizing profits. The business has proven itself extremely successful, as it was even a prime beneficiary of the U.S. wartime necessities pertaining to Iraq and Afghanistan - mainly after 2004. Just two years ago, Olin underwent a merger with the Dow Chemical Company in order to secure the #1 profit margins in the entire industry. </p>
<p><strong>Email Synopsis:</strong>
At the top of the email, you can see a message from a Sandler Foundation constituent stating, &quot;RE. OLIN.......INTERESTING?&quot; This instantly piqued my interest because the Sandler Foundation is a notorious Clinton donor who sold their bank to Wachovia for $2.6 billion during the American housing bubble (via <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1877351_1877350_1877343,00.html">Time</a>) - which led to the Great Recession. Moreover, Herb Sandler wrote one of the most talked about Pizzagate emails, in which he asked Podesta if he\'d &quot;do better playing dominos on cheese than pasta.&quot; (<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30613)</a>) Throw in the mention of Olin, and you have yourselves a glistening money trail. </p>
<p>The body of the email contains a Wall Street Journal article depicting the purposes and functions of a prestigious Yale University program, aptly titled Grand Strategy. Some quick research revealed that the students have to go through a rigorous process of recommendations, applications, and interviews in order to be admitted. If approved, the members are then greeted by Henry Kissinger, which is mentioned later on in the article. This program reeks of corrupt influences as a result of all the politicians and businessmen brought up throughout the article, with it even blatantly stating, &quot;The class attracts a large percentage of conservative students, and all the students have benefited from the ties and contacts the men have in Washington.&quot;</p>
<p>The one thing regarding this email that confused me, however, is there is no mention of Olin at all in the entire article. A quick Google search of &quot;Olin Corporation Yale&quot; brings nothing of interest to light, except for a 1998 article stating that Yale and Olin Corporation would join forces to sponsor a science fair for New Haven - where Yale is located - public schools (<a href="http://news.yale.edu/1998/03/05/yale-university-and-olin-corporation-team-sponsor-science-fair-new-haven-public-schools">http://news.yale.edu/1998/03/05/yale-university-and-olin-corporation-team-sponsor-science-fair-new-haven-public-schools)</a>). I will keep doing investigative work to see if this money trail leads anywhere, but I urge people to help, as this program has produced numerous American political players such as the former director of the Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism at the State Department, two National Security advisors, and two Lieutenant Colonels from the Army as well as the Marines. Of course, I am not sure this will produce any smoking guns regarding Pizzagate, but if we find some evidence regarding money fraud or laundering, it will be easier to convince more mainstream journalists to investigate our cause.</p>',

            You're looking at the wrong Olin.  It's not the corporation that funded this but the foundation.  The John M Olin Foundation was a conservative foundation that funded many conservative causes including several Johm M Olin professorships at different universities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The article says
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It was a remarkable moment for a program that had begun only in 2000 with donations mainly from conservative foundations
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            John Podesta's Center for American Progress was a liberal/progressive attempt to catch up the well-funded conservative think tanks that had been dominant in Washington since the 1980's.  If you think Soros is the only rich guy in politics, you've been fooled.   The Koch Brothers, the Olin, Bradley and Scaife families are big players in what New Yorker writer called Dark Money in her book.  They fund think tanks, academic programs and professorships and entities like ALEC, the american legislative exchange council, that has quietly written many of the laws passed in conservative states in the past decade.  Many of the groups working behind the Tea Party protests were associated with the Koch Brothers.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this is Sandler and Podesta keeping their eyes on their opponents.  Sandler is either saying that Olin helped started this or wondering that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Hertog who is mentioned in the article and the John M Olin Foundation helped fund a think tank called the Manhattan Insitute.

            The degrees of 4 - 33 are part of the Scottish Rite, an appendant body of regular Freemasonry. Most temples only do rituals for the 4th, 15th, 19th, and 31st/32nd, and they do it all in a single afternoon. That's why you generally don't see a 17th degree Freemason.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are two 33rd degree masons: active and honorary. Honorary 33rd degrees are given the title for service to the order. Active 33rd degrees are given to active leadership.

            This was in regards to the US Freemasons and it was a comment on Voat from someone who described what was in their books at that level and the initiation into the prestigious 33 degree level. It made me want to vomit. The thing that binds all of the Freemasons worldwide though is said to be Lucifarianism which is something they all practice, despite being different religions. I've never heard of both men and women together at Freemason lodges, I thought this was a no-no.

            The 33rd level for Masons is supposedly symbolic, essentially for powerful people like presidents, billionaires and people high up in the Mason organization.  "Normal" Masons can't get to level 33, and are not "in the loop."  At least that's what I've read generally.  My friend's brother is a low level Mason, but they just do local trustee type stuff according to him.

            Never too late to tar and feather Kissinger. Someone needs to make it happen while he's alive.

            Well, Kissinger is rumored to be a 33 degree Freemason and also belong to the (Freemason) Knights of Malta. Of course, since both are secret societies that won't disclose their members, it's hard to know for sure. It would explain a lot about him.
