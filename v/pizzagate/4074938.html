            Do you know where the editor of The Verge is from who is the key person behind all of the Foxconn articles? He is from Racine. His articles only tell part of the story. There is much more hidden under the surface. In Wisconsin, both parties are extremely corrupt. Scott Walker did not lose the election, he threw the election. He was also compromised long ago, and again by people such as Maria Butina.
           </p>
           <p>
            You never bothered to investigate anything about Racine. Everything is verifiable. Many others have done so. We cannot share links because you changed the rules, and started censoring and banning any accounts discussing Racine.

            I read some of this on Twitter. I'm not sure what to make of "Sarah". On the one hand, she has outted her father, posting pics and I assume fully doxing herself. She has been kind to everyone outside of her family, Hanks and Hillary. On the other, she has said a lot of super weird crap. The kind of crap that feeds right into the "crazy conspiritard cult" narrative that shills from Shareblue have been advancing ever since 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example: she posts Q stuff and claims it's about her like this Rachel Chandler Insta photo that Q posted:
            <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/SaRaAshcraft/status/1108778071891591168">
             https://mobile.twitter.com/SaRaAshcraft/status/1108778071891591168
            </a>
            . That thread -- to me -- reads very similarly to some of the stuff posted by the bot fixated on Racine. Same co-opting of other people's work to support their own narrative. Same lack of verifiability. Same effect on reader of jacking up emotions.
           </p>
           <p>
            She, on the other hand, has always respected the submission rules here and shared our work, which is very un-shillish.
           </p>
           <p>
            I honestly don't know what to think of her.

              It's obvious the Racine poster can not possibly be a bot. Look at how he replies to people on Twitter:
              <a href="https://twitter.com/DenyTheMark2020">
               https://twitter.com/DenyTheMark2020
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Those are obviously not automated replies. You should be asking yourself why there is such a strong effort to convince people that he is a bot when it couldn't be more obvious that he isn't.

               , post about Racine and see what happens. Never contributes; only shows up to spam posts on certain topics, always in an attempt to sow discord and distrust. Definitely automation going on to one degree or another.

                 The banning is based on lies and a false premise. We are not a bot, nor a partial bot whatever that means, nor a bot with “humans occasionally” adding text. It could not be more apparent. Why would they continue such an obvious lie in order to censor and ban what you and others have proven to be so easily verifiable as, in the least, an extremely corrupt small city with ties to every single aspect of pizzagate?
                </p>
                <p>
                 We don’t adhere to “community standards” because there are no standards. They have changed the standards to fit the agenda. They have said they would not delete comments, and then deleted comments. They ban the account, then attack the account for not replying. They don’t allow submissions for new accounts, but then accuse the account of not submitting. They don’t allow links with new accounts, and then accuse the account of not sharing links. They have said they would not ban topics, but they banned Racine in Pizzagate and Great Awakening. They then backtracked a bit and will allow others to post about Racine but only under their narrowly defined terms. Does any of this sound like a “bot”?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Truth does not care about votes, or subscribers, or donations, or selling merchandise. Ask Srayzie. The moderators abused and manipulated the forums and were caught and exposed for it. That is why they hate The Truth shared about Racine. Every single comment ever posted was original and created by “humans”. That is dehumanizing to have to explain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When the mayor of a small city gets arrested for pedo crimes and multiple mayors and other community leaders are also arrested for other crimes, with suicide attempts and judges found in rivers, brains found on the beach, satanic ritual abuse, extreme human trafficking, you might start to think it could all be true. It is all true. And more.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We are a group. Anyone can Share The Truth about Racine. Those who have witnessed or experienced it know it is all true and very real.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We made a promise with others who also Know The Truth, some of whom are no longer here, that The Truth would be Shared with All who chose to seek Jesus Christ and The Truth. We know there are many hubs of corruption, and Racine is a model that many others follow or are connected to. Models become standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are also Sharing The Truth, and will be rewarded someday for your courage. This is not a game. To any who actually look into Racine, The Truth is easily verifiable and shocking. This is from what is available through public sources. Under the surface there is much more.

                 Mayor Pete will be in Racine tomorrow. He is having secret meetings in Racine, not simply because he loves Kringle. Why?

                <p>
                 What is going to be announced all day? How is the debate going to go? What role is Mayor Pete going to play?

                <p>
                 5G+ AI is not your friend, and COVID was a great cover to install it. Racine is a key smart city model for everything involved. How do you measure “Sustainability”?

                 Why hasn’t Vindicator ever researched how Racine is a key model for so many components of the agenda with Sustainable Development, Community Policing, Sanctuary Cities, Smart Cities, Housing, Transportation, Paris Accord, Underground Railroad, Human Trafficking, NXIVM, Knights of Pythias, Brookings Institution, US-Ukraine Business Council, and on and on and on.

                   You should know by now, right? Or do you want to keep lying to everyone, manipulating the forums, censoring the free speech you falsely claim to protect, and banning The Truth in desperation?

                 He's had multiple usernames claiming he's not a bot. In fact, he generates new usernames all the time, whether they get banned or not.  He does it to avoid downvotes, which is directly against the Voat User Agreement rule against vote manipulation.  He doesn't give a crap about the community standards at all.  Just like a bot.

                 Do I think humans occasionally add real text to his replies?  Sure.

             Her story never added up with all her claims. There are people out there with serious psychological/psychiatric issues who claim things they read and hear that never actually happened to them. She is the second I’ve read. There was another on here before a couple years ago.
