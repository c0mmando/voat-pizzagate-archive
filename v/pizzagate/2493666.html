<p>Canadian humanitarian worker Peter Dalglish, who helped found the charity Street Kids International, was taken in by police in Nepal on Sunday (April 8), Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police said they wanted to question Dalglish over claims he was involved in pedophile activities in Kavre district, around 50 kilometers north of the capital, Kathmandu.</p>

             I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Like the children being found with him. I'm sure there was some incident with Crazy Glue where they became stuck to him and he had no choice but to bring them along.

             The other horrible side to this is you can see how easily a kidnapped kid could be mixed in with these actual orphans. So Madeleine McCann could be absorbed into this population and have been shuffled around without anyone being wiser. It's another troubling aspects to each one of these pervs having their own humanitarian charitable organization.

               It's true. They may well be. It's sort of what they did in PedoWood. The blacklisted anyone with even a modicum of decency and kept the scum.

             With all the charities of late that have been charged with sexual assaults I would not be surprised if some are set up for just that.  A Free For All for Pedos.  I have no proof just a feeling, but some were sent right back because they don't get charged and just sent home.  This is Just Nauseating.

               .Yes, I believe they set things up for their own operations and amusement.  As sick as they are.  Businesses to cater to their pedo friends and operations that seem to be legit businesses but under it all it is a Fake Setup.  They have been doing this for years.  and now I believe that BC and CGI and the CF are setting up another one.  One that will cc Haiti.  I am going to be sick.

            These people make me want to vomit.  I can't take this anymore.  Why do these people even go and work with these kids?  They have no respect for them.  They look at them as street trash, like prostitutes of the night.  Children begging for food or a few pennies and what does he want in return?  Sick Perverts all of them.  They brainwash themselves into believing they are entitled to it, since they wrongly believe they have bettered their lives.  Well, guess what?  They will carry this rape or dropping on their knees to pleasure this Scumbag for the rest of their lives.  Their souls will be stolen and they will never be the same.  I think these people don't even go there  with good intentions for the kids, only with intentions to get sexual perverted pleasures for themselves.  Total Narcissistic Pedophilia.  This Must Stop.

             It's all about them. Their needs, their wants, their pleasures. To hell with innocence and anything approaching morality. They want a chaotic, divisive world where the damaged kids grow up to be devoted slaves to their cabal.

              Yes,and they want them to be just like them.  Creating more pedophiles. Raping and abuse is what they know.  This is their world and they want us to conform.  Nope.
