            Here is a good way to judge his work for yourselves. I am not sure if this gallery is still open. I know it will be closing if it hasn't already. The pals of Hunter's who run it are sick of the customers. I signed up for their mailing list when it opened. They opened it 2 or 3 years ago.

            I have an opinion but no way of knowing. Just look and see. I see the fearless man, the fierceness in the man. If he was hired for a job and needed money, who knows what he would be capable of. I doubt he had the same attitudes anybody else has, anywhere ever. I am happy to think he was suicided and not pathetically demised. Which may be why the gallery opened in the first place. If you read his books, he drinks, carouses not for his depravity but for the depravity he sees around him, is the impression they give.
           </p>
           <p>
            I admire his courage to explore. To have fury at the matrix. He's an artist. and he is not an artist like the podesta / clinton excuse for one!!!!!

            I remember reading an anecdote of Johnny Depp waiting for him in a Woody Creek bar.  And he knew when Hunter got there because he was using a cattle prod and a taser to get everyone to move out of his way.  And that was at his favorite local bar.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was a fucking nutjob who exaggerated and did things to get a response.   I'm sure he'd have found it funny that people thought he was part of some secret cabal considering he hated elites.

            Gruesome as it is, Bonacci's report to me harks back to the
early cries for help, from Loretta Smith:
I went in January of '84 on every trip. I was paid by men
King knew for sex. In the summer of '84 sometime I went
to Dallas Texas and had sex with several men King knew
in a hotel.
I flew on YNR Airlines and Kam Airlines normally for
King. I never had much personally to do with King, only
went where he told me to go.
In or on July 26th I went to Sacramento, Ca. King flew
me out on a private plane from Eppley Airfield [in Omaha]
to Denver where we picked up Nicholas, a boy who was
about 12 or 13. Then we flew to Las Vegas to a desert
strip and drove in to Las Vegas and to some ranch and got
something. Then flew on to Sacramento.
We were picked up by a white limo and taken to a hotel.
I don't remember the name of it. We meaning Nicholas and
I were driven to a area that had big trees, it took about an
hour to get there. There was a cage with a boy in it who
was not wearing anything. Nicholas and I were given these
tarzan things to put around us and stuff.
They told me to f--- the boy and stuff. At first I said no
and they held a gun to my balls and said do it or else lose
them or something like that. I began doing it to the boy and
stuff. And Nicholas had anal sex and stuff with him. We
were told to f--- him and stuff and beat on him. I didn't try
to hurt him. We were told to put our d---s in his mouth and
stuff and sit on the boys penis and stuff and they filmed it.
We did this stuff to the boy for about 30 minutes or an hour
when a man came in and kicked us and stuff in the balls
and picked us up and threw us. He grabbed the boy and
started f---ing him and stuff. The man was about 10 inches
long and the boy screamed and stuff and the man was forcing
his d--- into the boy all the way. The boy was bleeding from
his rectum and the men tossed him and me and stuff and
put the boy right next to me and grabbed a gun and blew
the boys head off.
           </p>
           <p>
            The boys blood was all over me and I started yelling and
crying. The men grabbed Nicholas and I and forced us to
lie down. They put the boy on top of Nicholas who was
crying and they were putting Nicholas hands on the boys
ass. They put the boy on top of me and did the same thing.
They then forced me to f--- the dead boy up his ass and
also Nicholas they put a gun to our heads to make us do it.
His blood was all over us. They made us kiss the boys lips
and to eat him out. Then they made me do something I don't
want to even write so I won't.
After that the men grabbed Nicholas and drug him off
screaming they put me up against a tree and put a gun to
my head but fired into the air. I heard another shot from
somewhere. I then saw the man who killed the boy drag
him like a toy. Everything including when the men put the
boy in a trunk was filmed. They took me with them and we
went up in a plane. I saw the bag the boy was in. We went
over a very thick brush area with a clearing in it. Over the
clearing they dropped the boy. One said the men with the
hoods would take care of the body for them.
I didn't see Nicholas until that night at the hotel. He and
I hugged and held each other for a long while. About two
hours later the men or Larry King came in and told us to
go take a shower since we had only been hosed off at some
guys house. We took a shower together and then were told
to put on the tarzan things. After we were cleaned up and
dressed in these things we were told to put on shorts, socks
and a shirt and shoes and driven to a house where the men
were at with some others. They had the film and they played
it. As the men watched they passed Nicholas and I around
as if we were toys and sexually abused us.
They made Nicholas and I screw each other and one of
the men put the dead boy's penis in mine and Nicholas'
mouth. I didn't want to write this because the man forced
me to bite the boys' penis and balls off. It was gross and I
saw the film where it happened and started freaking out
remembering what they made us do afterwards to the boy.
They showed us doing everything to the boy. I was there
for about 5 days attending parties but only recall cutting my
wrist which is why I stayed two days in a hospital under a
name I can't recall. Some guy paid for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inother testimony, Bonacci said that Larry King was smiling
and laughing the whole time the film was being shown, and
that "the men with the hoods" were a Satanic group which
planned to use the dead boy in some sort of ceremony. He also
named the director of the snuff film, whom they had picked
up in Las Vegas, as "Hunter Thompson."

            Hunter was identified as the camera operator for a snuff film at Bohemian Grove when camp was not in use. Rusty turned down the offer to film that  at first. Nancy Reagan had her hairdresser fix him up. They actually fixed him up to look like someone already operating in this manner. When Rusty was finally roped in they gave him a mini camera that fit on his belt and looked like part of the buckle. He'd walk through the origies and would be filming. Hunter was a bad man.

            I had to modify my response because I had heard before that Hunter was wtiting a piece on how the world trade center was droped by controlled demolition. This I rememberd from reading a post on the forum linked. That would explain why all the sudden TPTB want to discredit him as a pedophile or into snuff. That still has to be established by a credible source.

             Well, I guess the work he did is separate from some of the choices he might have made but he wrote about being into beastiality and he admitted he loved to kill on David Letterman. He was an excellent journalist and was one of a kind but I think in order to ride with Hells Angels and get close to the action; so to speak, you have to prove your worth.

            I hear ya man. I knew a guy which used to cling to every word Hunter said and still espouses his admiration for him but once you look into him he was a bad guy.

             He wrote that he was into beastiality and a bunch of weird stuff. I swear I'm beginning to think we are in the grips of a worldwide satanic conspiracy and the people perpetrating it really believe they gain power by doing these rituals. I'm not a racist in any way shape or form but I had a Jewish cousin who was into really weird stuff and I think that it's one of the dirty little secrets about some families. Jewish ritual abuse was pervasive up until the earl 1900 and when they would have a Passover Seder they would kidnap gentile children and murder them by cutting them and draining their blood, and I they were very methodical. And then they would drink the blood for Passover Seder. Finding this out I remember being invited to celebrate Passover by a Jewish girl who was passing through town. She made the whole table read part of the story then we drank cranberry juice. I still wonder she thought of the juice as gentile blood.

                  Tell me about which parts you view as "speculation". Nickole Brown wrote about, and confirmed to Mark Dice, that he possessed snuff porn. He admitted on Letterman he'd been to Bohemian Grove. Paul Bonacci named him as a snuff porn director. He admitted that he took human adrenal gland secretion.

                  You're clearly a fanboy in denial. A "brilliant writer" he may have been. He was also VERY likely a complete degenerate, sadistic lunatic who enjoyed watching children being tortured, raped and murdered.

             I hate to break it to you, but it was almost certainly Hunter S. Thompson. He had a girl living with him for some time in Colorado about 10-15 years ago. She said she had to flee when he tried to get her to watch snuff porn with him. I'll find the source within the next 2 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: I remembered the exact details wrong (he threw her out, she didn't flee), but here's the quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              One time I watched him beat his car because his cigarettes were locked inside, and another time he threw me out of the house for refusing to watch a snuff film. And he was hell on his new kitten, Hugo, especially when he felt I was paying it too much attention. He would snatch Hugo up, smudge his pink nose in cocaine, and send him darting across the kitchen floor.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Hunter S. Thompson, an avid drug user, talked about his love for the ultimate drug: Adrenochome. Andrenochrome, as he admitted himself, only had one source: Human adrenal gland. Ring a bell? I mean, it ties directly into Pizzagate. Terrify the child, get his/her andrenalyn pumping, kill them, drink their blood full of adrenaline and get high.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe Hunter S. Thompson was a degenerate, pizza-loving piece of shit who was rewarded greatly, being enshrined on the silver screen by the likes of Johnny Depp, then murdered when he was talking too much about his snuff porn addiction to people he shouldn't have been (like the girl from the quote).
            </p>
            <p>
             FUCK HUNTER S. THOMPSON.

              It was the Paul Bonacci testimony that did it for me.  HS Thompson was indeed a piece of crap.

               Wow really? That would explain him discussing watching people cut holes in a girls head to drain the blood. In Jewish Ritual Abuse the abuser would cut holes in the victim(usually a child) and the blood would drain out. I think I saw on YouTube  make as many as 60 cuts to get all the blood out, which they would consume. I will have to look into him being a crypto Jew. Also
There is an episode of Oprah where a Jewish woman comes out in a disquise and proclaims that lots of Jewish families were secretly into this satanic ritual abuse and throughout history that's partially why they got kicked out of every place they settled. They were kid napping kids and ritually murdering them!

              Sorry to break it to ya, but he was vile. I was meant to go see him once in Lincoln Nebraska. His appearance was cancelled however, as he had to spend a few nights in jail near the southern border of Nebraska for raping a 12 year old girl on his way to the gig.

               Wow that's a pretty amazing story.  Any source for that?  Everytime I google 'Hunter S Thompson rape'  I either get some assault charge from a porno producer Gail Palmer or a bunch of random blogs devoted to "the Franklin coverup" all using each other as sources.

                It was literally before the internet, and i have looked as well - it was in the newspaper (I only knew because our event was cancelled - but it wasn't a big story by any means). It sucks, and I'm so sorry i can't provide a source. This was yet another rape of a child that will go forever unacknowledged.

             Yeah, I really doubt it. The dude hated Nixon and corrupt politics, I can't see him dropping it all to go to Bohemian Grove and film snuff films with the freaks.

            Rusty Nelson was a sad figure by the end.  I'm not sure all those interviews are still on You Tube.  He had epilepsy and a head injury which they caused to diminish him.  He had the sense to save pictures, which was good.  Even if he was lured into some of it. Rusty Nelson really tried to help.  But he died.  So sad. And the pictures lost.
