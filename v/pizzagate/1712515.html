<p><strong>Special thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/riggedelection">@riggedelection</a> for bringing recent JSOC developments to my attention.</strong></p>
<h1>President John Fitzgerald Kennedy</h1>
<p>Perhaps one of the first members of the U.S. government to actively try and disband the CIA was President John F. Kennedy. JFK was personally affected by the dangers of the CIA\'s secrecy in the failed Cuban invasion known as the &quot;Bay of Pigs Incident&quot; and throughout the Cold War. </p>
<p>Recently WikiLeaks paid homage to JFK\'s opinion of the CIA in the password chosen for the first set of Vault 7 &quot;Year Zero&quot; leaks, <strong>SplinterItIntoAThousandPiecesAndScatterItIntoTheWinds</strong>. This came from a quote of JFK\'s published in The New York Times in 1966:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And President Kennedy, as the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him, said to one of the highest officials of his Administration that he “wanted to splinter the C.I.A. in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E. Howard Hunt, an infamous CIA agent involved in the Watergate scandal, was suspected to be one of Kennedy\'s assassins. In 2003 Hunt believed he was going to die, and disclosed to his son that he, under direction of the CIA and with other CIA agents, was indeed involved in the plot to kill John F. Kennedy. Recordings of this confession were made and an article was published about the confession in Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Most recently it has been uncovered that the members within the CIA have been investigating the assassination on their own and found that Director John McCone withheld crucial information from the Warren Commission on JFK\'s death. CIA historian David Robarge, now deceased, had a report released in 2013 which described the conspiracy as a &quot;benign cover-up&quot;.<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/jfk-assassination-john-mccone-warren-commission-cia-213197">(1)</a> The evidence later uncovered showed that McCone had committed perjury before the Warren Commission, albeit this was never to be brought up or taken to trial.</p>
<h1>Grassy Knoll Club</h1>
<p>The Grassy Knoll Club is a living tribute JFK\'s mission against the CIA. While not an official organization, and often used as a generic label for conspiracy theorists, the real Grassy Knoll Club consists of past and present members of United States government, military and intelligence agencies who continue to fight the expanding power of the CIA and the U.S. military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Few references exist (or at least are safe to publish) which corroborate the existence of the actual Grassy Knoll Club, but term was mentioned directly by author William A. Borst in the foreword for his 2004 book, <em>The Scorpion and the Frog: A Natural Conspiracy</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is dedicated to all those members of the &quot;grassy knoll club&quot;, or the &quot;black helicopter brigade,&quot; whose relentless search for the truth has led to their public mockery, ridicule and vilification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Grassy Knoll Club continues to operate to this day and its membership comprises of mostly NSA, CIA and FBI hackers, but anymore their operations entirely exist in the deep web or go by completely different names for reasons of personal and group safety.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we may have the Grassy Knoll Club to thank for the releases of Vault 7, as WikiLeaks obtained the information from hackers with physical access to the CIA\'s most secure servers and locations. </p>
<h1>Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)</h1>
<p>The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) is the United States\' elite, international special forces taskforce on the forefront of the War on Terror. It is a joint command of the Marines, Navy, and Army special forces as well as international commands and special forces units. JSOC operations aren\'t necessarily confined to Iraq and Afghanistan and have increased exponentially in scale over the last decade.</p>
<p>Many would not expect a military organization, especially the largest in the fight against a vague and invisible enemy, &quot;terror&quot;, to be in opposition to the CIA. However, the CIA has been found time and time again to support extremist militant groups and has been found arming them throughout the world, including the Mujahadeen, Taliban and ISIS of the Middle East and the drug cartels of South and Central America. </p>
<p>This is in complete diametric opposition to the mission of JSOC and has led to the deaths of thousands of highly-trained coalition special forces and innocent civilians, and thus the commands and footsoldiers of JSOC have become increasingly disgruntled with the CIA. </p>
<p><a href="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://i.magaimg.net/img/75j.jpg">An anonymous source from JSOC posted a firsthand account of their mixed relationship with the CIA on 4chan.</a> The source details that while leadership is in general denial about the CIA\'s intentions, ground forces themselves and NCOs are becoming increasingly aware of threats manufactured by the CIA. For instance, the insider describes several instances in which the CIA would deliberately provide false or incomplete intel to JSOC missions that led to various, preplanned catastrophes. The insider went so far even as to state the CIA\'s actions were &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;sabotage&quot;.</p>
<p>One such example the insider provides was a peculiar CIA/JSOC mission to Mexico. The CIA told JSOC units that they were to train local police, but in reality the JSOC units were actually arming and training members of the Mexican drug cartels.</p>
<p>Even more sinister, however, is the CIA\'s attempts to obstruct the rescue of unidentified POWs. The source states that occasionally throughout the 1980s JSOC would receive intelligence on the existence of POWs who have were imprisoned in Southeast Asia. On at least on two separate occasions, however, the CIA deliberately prevented rescue missions from taking place.</p>
<p>Former members of Delta Force and other special operations units under JSOC would form a private militia of sorts to attempt to rescue these POWs from Laos and Vietnam. Both times these operations were set to take place, however, retired Lieutenant General James Gordon Gritz would disclose details of the operations to the press, such as CNN, and make outlandish and offensive statements to deter support from the missions and make them highly publicized. Gritz would even go so far as to have local women in Southeast Asia hand out t-shirts with POW rescue slogans before the operations even took place, which is a very obvious way to sabotage a secret rescue mission.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Gritz#Attempts_to_locate_prisoners_of_war">(2)</a></p>
<p>There\'s a very good reason why special forces <em>NEVER</em> disclose rescue operations before they take place. General &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz\'s sketchy past is enough reason to doubt his intentions, but the JSOC source says they and other units feel Gritz was doing this at the behest of the CIA. As an ex-Special Forces general, Gritz would have been more than aware of the standard operating procedures for rescue missions and the importance of operational secrecy, but did <em>everything</em> in his power to do the <em>complete opposite</em>.</p>
<p>Now for the million dollar question: Why would the CIA not want to rescue soldiers from Southeast Asia?</p>
<h1>The Phoenix Program and Pizzagate</h1>
<p>Many researchers familiar with the CIA may recognize that 1970s-1980s Southeast Asia was an important field of operations for the Phoenix Program. The Phoenix Program was an extension of MKULTRA\'s mind control experiments and was focused on applying MKULTRA techniques to insurgent forces and civilians in Southeast Asia. The JSOC source suggests that the CIA was likely using POWs in experiments or as bargaining tools for other illicit activities with insurgent forces, and thus the POWs were discarded as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Our JSOC source finally relates this all back to Pizzagate. MKULTRA and the Phoenix Program proved that mind-control experimentation was exponentially more successful and powerful when used on children as opposed to adults and that the effects of disassociation are such that children can be programmed with far more sophistication than adults. Once MKULTRA and the Phoenix Program officially ended and the POWs were no longer a liability, the CIA simply went further into the systematized abduction and use of children.</p>
<p>This all leads to the CIA\'s increased interest in the use of children as mind-control experiments and slaves to the present day.</p>
<p>Now, with all that said:</p>

            Learn how God’s Word was originally scribed in Hebrew and Greek. Walk with Dr. Lampe among the ruins of the very first Christian Church ever built above ground… not in Israel, but in England! Discover how the Word was preserved through the 1,000 year period of the Dark and Middle Ages, when possession of scripture in any language other than Latin meant certain death at the hands of the organized church.

               If it provides anyone comfort, chances are very good that the PEOTUS and his team have access to full-on, state-level resources to include datamining, structured data analytics, link analyses, and relationship mapping programs. I'd bet good money that they have access to national assets as well.

               Here is what most don't realize - you have the former G2 of CAG as NSAdv. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then don't weigh in.

               I know the man. I know these people. I'm out of the game now, but I can assure you, they are on it.

            Such a well written submission.  Much to ponder and look further into.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best write up I've ever seen on JOSC is in the beggining of the book "Another 19" written by the lead scientist who formulated the steel that went into the WTC and who became a whistleblower for 911 as an inside job based on what he knew about the formulation of the buildings themselves.   He goes into the background of the military before 911 and JOSC is discussed thoroughly and intelligently.  "Another 19" refers to another 19 suspects he identifies (from the American political establishment mostly) as alternatives to the 19 terrorists that were charged.

            If Stalin had gotten his way, we wouldn't be going through all this horror.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stalin wanted to shoot 100,000 Nazi officers, but Churchhill cried like a baby and Roosevelt tried to pretend he thought Stalin was joking.
           </p>
           <p>
            They had such a problem with punishing the ones who caused over 100million deaths, but they had no problem bombing and punishing Dresden, and others who never wore the uniform.
           </p>
           <p>
            The head Nazis ended up over here and lived out their lives like kings.

             Yes, Stalin with his gulags.  What a saint he was!  If only we had listened to him!  /sarc

             What you people don't seem to realize is that WWII, like WWI, was a huge theatrical production.  Hitler, Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt were all 33rd-degree Freemasons.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the plans for the world wars were all laid out in Pike's letter of 1871.

              If it was all theatre, how come the USSR, ended colonialism and crushed british homogeny just like the Russians have done to every world domination project that has ever come down the pipe?

              All these people want are their human sacrifices they don't care about anything else, not what you believe, what politics you favor, what race you love or hate...natan...as long as the HS, keep going they don't give a fuck.

              The USSR, under Stalin ended abortion which in effect leaves no place for the pedo to hide behind.

               Could the Nazi's and the zionists be the same guys? Possibly the US &amp; Allies fighting against banking elite playing both sides of war as they did in WW1.  Would you be shocked to learn the Vatican helped indoctrinate German children against Jewish children. I have personal eye witness whose father was in Hitler's inner circle...who was met Hitler in person many times. Very wealthy German family &amp; big part of the SS. She carried the dark secrets until she was 80 years old. Trust me on this Hitler was evil beyond what I can mention. The US soldiers were heros to the Jewish people still alive in camps and the German people still alive in Berlin. She was there when they marched in and captured Berlin.

              <p>
               So as Rebel Skum wrote the German people who acted against Hitler and the Naz's was pure guts. So we're the soldiers of the US who landed on the beach in Normandy at 18,19 years old to give their lives not just for their country but for innocent German citizens who happened to be Jewish (not in faith, Hitler went by bloodline, genealogy)! &amp; the US soldiers freed the German citizens who had fought valiantly against the Naz's...the top made money as in WW1 betting both sides. Disgusting

            The biggest story that is missed is the CIA was and is an arm of the Vatican. That is right the Vatican &amp; Hitler were on the same side. There is personal eye witness testimony to this and the inner dark occult of the black sun represented by the swatstika.

             The more you study about religion, the easier it is to understand that the centralization of spirituality is a complete mockery. Spirituality is an individual's journey. The ones that use our spiritual tendencies against us are the most sinister of all.

               You are brilliant RebelSkum but I challenge you to start a post or thread on this topic. Can all of us collectively disprove God! I wonder if this very universal investigation actually proves the existence of God. Maybe the greed &amp; corruption of men ruined it. Like the catholic bible. Why do they have their own special seperate bible when Rome was involved on day one A.D.  Then Rome wrote their own rules again in their own book and kept secrets namining this catholicism? Really

            Unbelievable &amp; totally believable and true. 
You want to know who killed JFK look no further than his son JFK jr.  He set out to expose the truth about his fathers assasins. He created a magazine and named it GEORGE. Everyone asked why GEORGE?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was the most famous George at that time?
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after he is killed in a strange plane accident with his wife &amp; confidante. He was planning a run for Senate at that time. Who won after he passed away. The outgoing Hillary rodham clinton who then became Senator. Then SOS.....and so on and so on.

             Holy fuck I never knew that. Of course that's what she did. God almighty this woman is psychotic. Obviously it's almost impossible to prove but we all know what happened. Anybody who's followed this investigation for a while knows there are no coninkydinks anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember thinking at the time how in hell did JFK jr not know how to read an artificial horizon. It never seemed plausible someone could have been that incompetent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there's the auto pilot which I bet was active. I think one of the features of an auto pilot is to not only maintain altitude and speed but also maintain "wings level". I think the term is "Wing leveler auto pilot" I'm not sure though. If the auto-pilot was on it's impossible to flip the plane basically. ...........Unless the auto-pilot was tampered with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there was Michael Hastings, same odd one in a million type of accident. What a massive cluster fuck this is going to be when everything comes out.

              I read some years ago that JFK Jr had a co-pilot who was apparently programmed to crash the plane. Then someone went to the crash site and removed his body from the plane under water.

               I'm sorry but I didn't follow the "GEORGE" point you were making. I think JFK jr named the magazine George because it was about politics. I didn't get the impression he named it George because he wanted to be a senator.

                No he was naming the CIA agent responsible for his father's death. You are right over the mark. Who had that name &amp; was a former CIA director and higher?

                 Interesting. Yes I knew/know George H.W. Bush killed JFK. But I still think JFK jr named the magazine George after George Washington.

                 And it doesn't matter what he named the magazine because it was Killary Clinton who probably signed his death warrant.
