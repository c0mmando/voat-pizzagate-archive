              They are a data base for Nannies and Care Centers.  Plus one of those arrested, was able to bail himself out.  Where does a daycare worker make enough money for bail?

                Exactamundo!  My exact point.  Something is amiss here.  Possible trafficking of kids or CP filming.  People can also get help with childcare from the govt. SO there is some connection maybe with DHS or CPS?  But why the raid?  I would think that LE would be protecting them.  Possibly someone has some morals or they are trying to tamp down abuse reports and want to make people think it's a drug crack house.

                 Who is doing the vetting process that enables their licences?  Surely it involves deep checking? These are long term criminals - this would show up on the shallowest of searches that should invalidate their suitability?  Who’s over seeing the licence process?

                  I don't know who is vetting, but it reminds me of Rainbow Cultural Gardens (NXIVM)  that hired teachers from all over and they were not vetted either.  The main requirement is that they do what they want them to.  Someone at the top must be doing the hiring.  They list people all over the country even Hi.  Baby Nannies too.  My mind is wandering and I don't like where it's going.

             I have good friends with children who avoid me (or quickly work to shut me down in conversation) because of the warnings I present to them.  I have some friends who naively think their child will never be a victim because they don’t come from the background of the ‘usual’ victim or because they felt they did their ‘research’ before placing their children in any school or nursery - but then I ask them; did you insist on the Criminal Reference Bureau data? (CRB; the U.K. customary police check for conviction or suspect behaviour in an applicant’s past)...without exception the answer is ‘no’, usually followed by some self justifying blurb about me ‘reading too much into things’; ‘blinded by conspiracy theory’ etc etc.  It still staggers me that parents take risks with their children’s safety.  And some of my friends are from a law enforcement or Justice System background.

             Isn't feminism great? Get women thinking raising children and caring for the home is beneath them, so that they go off to work to pay taxes and leave their children with weirdos like this at daycare! Oh, and then after daycare they get shipped off to public school where abuse and indoctrination continues. It's so sad that we have been taught to live this way.

              Drug dealers use child care as front
             </strong>
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             (2009)  More than a dozen Wisconsin child-care centers that reaped millions of dollars in state subsidies have had close ties to drug-dealing operations, including big-time crime bosses, a Journal Sentinel investigation has found.
            </p>
            <p>
             Records show many of those centers have been used to stash and transport drugs, launder dirty cash and provide fake employment for criminals - at taxpayers' expense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Search warrants aimed at drug dealers often make no mention that the dealer's wife or live-in girlfriend is a child-care provider - even when the day care is the site of the search.
            </p>
            <p>
             And nobody - not regulators nor law enforcement officials - tracks the overlap.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet, cops and prosecutors say they see links between day care providers and drug dealers all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "Probably in 25% of the cases I deal with, there is a wife or girlfriend in the day care business," said Mario Gonzales, a veteran gang and drug prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <em>
               Children's Fantasy
              </em>
             </strong>
             has collected more than a half million dollars from the Wisconsin Shares program since 2006. The center is licensed to care for 57 children and had been billing the state roughly $20,000 every two weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police and prosecutors say drug dealers have found child-care centers to be natural shelters for illegal activity. Cloaked with lots of people coming and going at all hours, they don't usually raise the suspicion of neighbors. And, providers can easily funnel money through the business without drawing the attention of authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Day care centers are ideal sites, quite frankly, for conducting a drug-trafficking operation," Chisholm said.

              It's common sense that drug trafficking and child/human trafficking usually go hand-in-hand, as you alluded to in the OP.

              But I apologize for not spelling it out, aside from putting the obviously pedo day care name

            UPVOAT !!!  Seriously, those of us that have been here for a while know and agree with what you say, Yes, children food.  Imagine how enticing those gummie bears were!  And Laced Cookies!  It says nothing of trafficked children.  There has to be more to this story, WE all know that.

            I saw that...the people arrested looked like such low level ghetto losers.  I'm sure they weren't the "brains", so to speak, of the operation.
