<p><strong>January 2011</strong> - More back lash from Senator Charles Grassley. He claimed he was informed that Pentagon investigators failed to check all the names on a list of 5,200 employees suspected of viewing child pornography. He claimed that 1,700 names on that list were not reviewed and that &quot;These cases were not considered a priority by the Defense Department in the first place, and they should have been&quot;.</p>',

            Just wondering if CP is used as a weapon against those who are not corrupt. In order to get then fired by jail. I wonder how many are actually innocent. As we tend to think that it's always something the accused did and not something that was planted. It very well could be planted by higher ups controlling the infrastructure. (By design i would use the same form of control.) And that's a very effective way of having full and utter control over people. As there are SO many consequences with CP as opposed to murder. You're judged in a higher regard and violence or harrasment ensures in jail or publicly. No matter if you did it or not. Imagine being in the situation of doing your government job. Doing your best and along comes corrupt people you don't agree with which can force you to do their bidding or else... (but hey its just a thought)

            A staggering total of 10 convictions came from this one when all was said and done I'm afraid. Of the 264 identified DoD employees 212 were never even questioned over their actions. They all had subscriptions to CP sites.
