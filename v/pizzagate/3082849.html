            You're aware that the Trudeau Foundation logo was labeled a pedo logo before True Detective called it out. That's intense though.

              Oh okay. I just wasn’t sure if you had realized. But then I looked at the picture again and realized the fbi doc was in the show too. 2007 that doc was released. I wonder what symbols they used before.

            Season one had the swirl symbol, elite connections, the iconography and occult beliefs we've seen again and again.  Season two involved elite sex trafficking.  Season three, in passing, mentioned the Franklin scandal and the 2007 FBI symbol guide.

            There's no doubt some kind of limited hang out or actual revelation is going on at True Detective.

             Sadly this is true. If you take a real thing and bury it in fiction than people think you're gullible for believing it. It makes it less real to see something horrible juxtaposed with your favorite Hollywood actor or fictional character.

            Saw that episode of True Detective with the temple and symbols...didn't think much of it then. But I wonder about Woody Harrelson and how much he knows...didn't realize how old he was but he was hanging around Gore Vidal's house , I think, in the 70s...very wild sex scene....so he could have had first hand knowledge of hollywood standards and had input into that show. He has a very inquiring mind .....and speaks out with real knowledge about our US culture.....which has been shaped in the past, when movies had  power...by hollywood. There was even a movie studio in Laurel Canyon where they probably made the more blatant propaganda.......the actors who were in those movies all seemed to be in the club.......Marilyn Monroe for one.......bet Reefer Madness was made there...when marijuana became bad bad bad.

            I agree. But here's the bad news. Season 2 gives us a similar hype right up until the end, when it turns out its just an adult prostitution (eyes wide shut) scandal. Worse still, season 3 does the same hyping about kidnapped kids and ritual abuse too. But that turns out to be some bizarre scenario that has NO abuse element at all. It was total bait and switch. So, season 1 did a great job. That must have been a no no, so they tamed down seasons 2 and 3. Oh well.

             Guess what I found? Season 3 did as well btw. They showed the Trudeau foundation logo and pedophile symbols with the same exact tagline Learn, Share, Change. Downloading the episode and going to upload the clip.
