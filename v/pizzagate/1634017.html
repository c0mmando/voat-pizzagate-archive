           Amber Alert was a very popular bill. One has to wonder why the Republican controlled house at the time would add on such controversial provisions. Who stands the gain from it? Who would you want to make it hard on the judiciary to prosecute sex offenders.
          </p>

           Questions we should try to have answered. We should start by pointing out the politicians who added those provisions to the bill.
