            I'm not sure where else to post this so I'm just going to put it here.... the video that has been posted, that we think is JP torturing a child, he makes the boy sing a song. "I'm just a boy, each day I grow some more" is from the kids show caillou. I looked up the creator of the show and tried to dig to see if it had any ties to anyone or anything. Please be aware this may be really far fetched but go with me...
           </p>
           <p>
            The creator of the show is named Hélène Desputeaux. She is a Canadian educator and writer and that's pretty much all I've got on her. But when I googled her some related searches of people came up and one was of Robert Munsch. He is the author of the kids book 'Love You Forever' and has done collab work with Hélèn. This guy seems a tad bit creepy to me and on his bio page he goes into great detail about how he has always loved kids. He went to study and become a Jesuit priest before he realized it wasn't for him and he then decided he wanted to work in a daycare.... then went on to open his own daycare. Born in Pittsburgh and we know a lot of pedo activity happens there. Maybe worth digging into. I understand that being a children's author of books doesn't make you a pedophile but i feel it's worth digging into. I've found that nothing is coincidence when it comes to the elite so it makes me wonder if any of this is connected.

            I paused it on the last sign they see and there's a URL on it:
            <a href="http://hauntedwoods.biz/">
             http://hauntedwoods.biz/
            </a>

             http://archive.is/O6QOI
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Doing a search on YT for "haunted woods florida" brings up the driving footage they used which is just some friends heading to a harmless haunted house type event:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bMc8gCgMIA">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bMc8gCgMIA
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the related videos to the right of that video is "REAL GHOST GIRL CAUGHT ON TAPE (FOUND FOOTAGE)":
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYyWcRb8ULE">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYyWcRb8ULE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is where the audio from your video came from, around a minute in you hear the "that is a fucking girl, it's 31 degrees outside" audio (careful, loud audio jumpscare around 1:30)
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest of the video (like the distorted boy talking) is mainly just the stuff that was in the original SiivaGunner Caillou video shown here:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxz0p_4wXDA">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxz0p_4wXDA
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So nothing significant in this footage, it's just a mashup but:
           </p>
           <p>
            A) it does sound like the Each audio run backwards like you thought and would make sense since this is reusing some stuff from the SiivaGunner Caillou video Each is in, so good catch
           </p>
           <p>
            B) despite the SiivaGunner debunk video demonstrating that SiivaGunner (notice that the channel you found is VilvaVunner, a play on the name, just like SiivaGunner is a play on SilvaGunner, the original channel which also had videogame remixes etc) mashed up random footage, there's NO evidence that SilvaGunner FILMED the Each or Fatherhood clips, and NO indication of who originally recorded them or where they came from...SilvaGunner used them in his Caillou mashup but the person explaining the ARG only shows where the tied up kid video came from, not the Each one.
           </p>
           <h2>
            <strong>
             So SilvaGunner being debunked as an ARG does NOT mean Each and Fatherhood were just made for the ARG anymore than the tied up kid or the driving down a haunted road were made "for" these mashups, which means we still need to figure out who filmed Each and Fatherhood and who the voices and people in those videos are.
            </strong>
           </h2>
           <p>
            Thanks for posting regardless, anything we can find involving Each and Fatherhood is worth looking at.

             Really appreciate you looking further, you found more than I could have begun to. I was unsure as to what I was seeing/hearing. I'll keep on looking for something that might be a bit more useful.

            So you posted it under another account aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's pretty sketchy. What's the real deal "Amaris"? Why did you post previously under another user name?

             I've never use this forum before to post, I didnt know deleted posts still exist, and wanted to make sure my post was seen as I felt it important. I'm not a person who usually engages in forums, part of the reason being that new members are treated with suspicion. I prefer not to be dragged into having to prove myself. I haven't got the time or inclination to. I posted something that may be nothing, I classed it as such, I have created one account only in the past hour, that's the deal. If something suspicious had flagged on my account I have no explanation for it.

              Out out of interest what other account are you referring to?I created an account to make a post, I received an administrator message stating it had been removed under rule 4 non existent link, so I posted again. I understand the scrutiny posts go under here but if you could at least give me some indication as to what other account your accusing me of having?

                Sure, if I can figure out how to. At inbox it gives options to reply, delete or says source. I can copy and paste? I understand about the shills, this prevents me from interacting, I know from first hand experience in real life. I've been done over big time and lost hope in being able to reach out to any authority ad they're all riddled with filth. Let me know how to forward and I'll send it over.

                 I trust you Amaris. Don't worry about forwarding that admin message.

                <p>
                 Just so you know, you can forward a message to someone by including their name in the comment like this:
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/DarkMath">
                  @DarkMath
                 </a>
                 will alert me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can put
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Amaris">
                  @Amaris
                 </a>
                 also and it will hopefully alert you..........in addition to this very comment.

                 Then again, Voat is a little buggy so it might not happen.

                  I hope so, and I'm sorry if I came off as defensive, I've sat for the past two weeks watching this unfold, I had no knowledge of it prior to then, as I have no TV, I don't buy newspapers or follow social media. I saw an introduction to pizzagate on youtube and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I hope to see the change were fighting for, I'm truly scared for the future. Thanks for your tech help, hoping I can contribute more!

                   Most may doubt you but a few will understand and pass the knowledge on. Eventually the truth will come out. The numbers are on our side.

                    I'm trying, my partner thinks I'm crazy but I keep presenting info and telling him what to expect. I'm past caring about people saying I'm crazy. I'll watch the video as I don't think I've seen it. Unsure of where you're based but here in the UK I saw in the shop a headline in the newspaper stand about madeline mccann, the msm are trying to spin it in a way thats causing people to look the other way, I wish I coukd bring myself to read it but I'm tired of the glaring bs. I'll keep on shining the light.

                 Something or Nothing? Vid Linked to abuse vid on worldcorp?

                <p>
                 I saw this whilst trawling through evidence posted on youtube, in amongst the videos I clicked on one called Theme song (extended Mix)-Caillou . Those who have been unfortunate enough to see the worldcorp videos portraying abuse of children may be familiar. I found it strange to see this video containing an audio sample of the "each day" video from Worldcorp. This was posted three months ago. 
I have no skills when it comes to finding out further details and hope that someone may be able to dig around on this, it seems as though youtube is getting rid of a lot of evidence and useful videos. Perhaps it's worth looking at this, I can't make out what the main channel is trying to achieve, I got that maybe it's audio clips from computer games, I was a little freaked out by some named "sara is missing" or something similar, a bit creepy...

            I wish I had more to offer than a pathetic link to an unhelpful video. I spend a lot of time looking through forum, reading comments, watching videos, but what can I really do? When my daughter was victim of suspected abuse (by the local authority) the police were alerted, I waited a year, submitted photographs and reports, I was passed to four seperate officers, each of whom did nothing. It's rife, it's real, and I want to fight to stop it happening again
