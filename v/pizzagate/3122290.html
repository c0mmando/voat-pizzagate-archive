<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Congress and President Donald Trump’s border wall (all times local):</p>
<p>6:05 p.m.</p>
<p>The Democratic-led House has failed to override President Donald Trump’s first veto, salvaging his effort to steer billions of extra dollars to erecting barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted 248-181 to overturn Trump’s veto, but that fell 38 votes shy of the required two-thirds margin</p>
<p>Tuesday’s vote bolsters Trump’s drive to build a wall along the boundary with Mexico, a hallmark of his 2016 presidential campaign and a priority of his presidency.</p>
<p>Just 14 Republicans joined all voting Democrats in Tuesday’s futile effort to void Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the Southwest border.</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>2 p.m.</p>
<p>An effort by House Democrats to override President Donald Trump’s first veto has failed. That hands him a victory because his declaration of a national emergency at the Southwest border will remain in effect.</p>
<p>The Democratic-controlled chamber has voted 248-181 in favor of overriding Trump’s veto. That fell 38 votes short of the 286 needed for Democrats and their handful of Republican allies to prevail, because a two-thirds majority was needed.</p>
<p>The emergency declaration would let Trump shift an additional $3.6 billion from military construction projects to erecting barriers along the border with Mexico. Building the wall was one of Trump’s most repeated campaign pledges, though he said it would be paid for by Mexico, not taxpayers.</p>
<p>Congress voted to provide less than $1.4 billion for barrier construction. Court challenges may eventually block the extra money Trump wants</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>1:05 p.m.</p>
<p>House Democrats trying to override President Donald Trump’s first veto say his plan to shift billions of extra dollars into building border barriers is a waste of money and an abuse of his powers.</p>
<p>But their veto override attempt seems certain to fall short of the two-thirds majority they will need to succeed later Tuesday.</p>
<p>Congress sent him legislation blocking his declaration of a national emergency at the border. He’s using it to shift $3.6 billion from military construction projects to building barriers.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon says money shouldn’t be spent on Trump’s “stupid, static wall.” Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro says Trump is guilty of “constitutional vandalism.”</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Sam Graves of Missouri says there is a border crisis and says Trump acted “well within his legal authority.”</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>12:17 a.m.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is nearing a victory over Democrats as the House tries overriding his first veto. Tuesday’s vote seems certain to fail, which means his declaration of a national emergency at the Mexican border would stand.</p>
<p>Trump’s emergency would let him shift an additional $3.6 billion from military construction projects to work on a barrier along the southwest boundary.</p>
<p>Congress has approved less than $1.4 billion. Building the wall was one of his most oft-repeated campaign promises, though he claimed the money would come from Mexico.</p>
<p>Trump’s emergency declaration drew unanimous opposition from congressional Democrats and opposition from some Republicans. Lawmakers objected that he was abusing presidential powers.</p>
<p>The House seems sure to fall short of the two-thirds margin needed to override vetoes.</p>

            The human and drug trafficking so prevalent in South America and Mexico are CIA operations. When the CIA goes down, the business will too. Already , there have been major blows , vatican . Third in command, Cardinal Pell sent to prison . He was in charge of money. Vatican was used to launder mafia money. Very circular. As Sam Giancanna was quoted in the book, Double Cross, written by his brother..."Working with the CIA is like the mob, in fact, it is the mob."
