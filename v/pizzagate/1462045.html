            Repudiate. You may to also want to repudiate it. But it's a bit late for this now don't you think? You see, when you accuse people of crimes against children BEFORE you have a legit case, legit evidence or even an actual victim of the alleged abuse that can be brought to authorities, you invite vigilantism, death threats, and witch hunts. When you fan the flames, conduct your "investigation" in the open,online, and NAME NAMES of people you THINK have committed something so horrible, you're going to set off the whack-jobs. Now you back peddle and say "WHOA...that's NOT what we're about"  Well, it IS what you're about. It's what has been going on here and on the reddit from DAY ONE. It's been a witch hunt from Day One. But all of a sudden, everyone's offended by it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't misunderstand me. Your intent is good, obviously. Nobody doubts that.  It's just the MANNER in which most of you go about it. Accusing people of a horrible crime just because you find something about their Instagram or emails "suspicious". You shout down ANYONE who tries to counter your assumptions, and let's be honest, that's all they are right now, assumptions and conjecture. No hard evidence that could bring charges against any of the principles. Yet, where this community parts ways with actual professional investigators, is that this community has no issue whatsoever with leveling these accusations against people who may not be actually guilty. No, to everyone here, ALL of these people are GUILTY AS FUCK, they're ALL pedos and even though none of it has been PROVEN yet, everyone here still calls them pedos, rapists, murderers, satanists, etc. You slap the label on them and RAGE when people try to point out the flaws in your argument or tactics. It's the very definition of a witch hunt and in your haste to convict them in your circus court you've damaged the very credibility you so desperately seek. 
Then this back-peddling. It's precisely why you are mocked outside of your bubble. I'll stand by and wait for the insults and accusations aginst me to begin in 3...2...

            Yes, even though I find myself flying into fits of rage thinking about this I would never act on them or even voice them because I know we gotta do this the right way if we really wanna nail these assholes. We can let the general population in the pen express themselves more appropriately when the time comes.

            I totally disagree we (the people) need to execute these pedos as publicly as possible to deter the abuse and murder of kids that continues daily. The whole idea of asking the "authorities" i.e. the masons to investigate and shut down the criminal operations of the masons is, obvoously, a masonic brainwashing psyop. Fuck the illegitimate "authorities", shoot the pedos and the CIA shills as soon as possible and burn them in the streets. And any masonic police that get in the way of real justice for these poor kids.

            This is a lie. We don't repudiate violence against pedophiles nor authorities who aid pedophiles. We must be honest with ourselves. We have righteous indignation, resolve, and our cause is just. We demand justice and if our demand is not satisfied because authorities are complicit in crimes against children, then the enemy of justice must expect a tidal wave of violence for his crimes against the children! There are forces at play here that will set the whole world on fire if the enemy of the children is not punished. Authorities have a choice: join us or be crushed by our ideals.

            You reddit faggots are truly useless. You embarrass yourselves and everyone you associate with nonsense and noise.. Until you learn how to police your own community, and formulate a rational argument, you are just stroking your own egos. You have a chance to change the world, but because you are such demented, deformed, and demoralized people you can barely pose a coherent argument.

            I think we may have the wrong idea about Voat being taken down because of this false flag. This attack was to influence public opinion on pizzagate investigators, not take out the investigation itself. Much easier to make us all look like violent tinfoil hatters than to actually destroy our ability to communicate.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all just scarred from reddit.  Reddit had shitty admins who took it on themselves to censor people and directly influence the narrative on the website.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat is not like that, no censorship here. If they want to take down
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            they will have to take down Voat or infiltrate its administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, I've been surprised before. If voat does get taken down, we will just reassemble on 4chan until we find another new forum..

            I've seen suggestions of violence.  I haven't seen many.  I've complained at the people who made them.  I will continue to do so.  It isn't what we're here for.  It won't help.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect there is a blackmail ring functioning via the exploitation of children to corrupt the American government, and as a patriotic citizen, I am appalled.  I hope the investigative agencies formed for the purpose of breaking such rings will investigate seriously and begin to purge this issue from our government in accord with their own patriotic duties.

            Also, would it be worth it, for someone to draft a summarized doc, that we could distribute on a certain day (either soon, or after 1/20), to every LE we can, to act on this?

            Part of the problem is, the vast majority of the general public only knows about pizzagate from videos they see on youtube. Many videos use scare tactics and ominous music, and false information to make their videos more popular to garner views/subscriptions. If you go to the video I link, you can see people calling for violence and spreading tons of hateful comments. I've been trying/begging/pleading to SGTReport to take it down since it went up a week ago. It is basically spreading fake "smoking gun" evidence about a document/menu of torture that was debunked on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            before it was shut down, and is provoking a lot fuel to make people violently upset. His response? He makes another video about it. It pisses me off so bad.

             Some have suggested these 'call to violence' are part of psy op.  Discredit the real investigation by encouraging a few loons to go over the edge.

              Possibly, but he had a really good video he put out right before that one that listed the missing children statistics that everyone quotes now for the missing kids in Virginia. Then he produces that crap. Angers me to no end.

            Authorities won't do shit about it, because THEY are the pedos. The only question is to be certain that they are guilty. If they are guilty, I would buy a beer to anyone taking care of them.

            I'm wondering, is the best way to get the authorities to do their job starting with a trusted private investigator(s) who'll do a bunch of the starting work for them? It should be completely fucking unnecessary, but it might yield results
           </p>
           <p>
            Only problem is if authorities decide to kill him instead of doing their damn jobs

            This was very well written. Like everyone else says, we just want the authorities to do their job. If they won't do it, then we can only spread the word and put the pressure on them to protect all children and lock these sickos up for good.

            Your reckless accusations have led to violence. I know you saw some crossed ping pong paddles and thought it looked like a pedophile symbol, but that isn't "smoke"--it's you being deranged.

             No one makes any one do anything, and it is ridiculous and unfounded what you have said. No one here drove him by gun point and said do this or else. Every violent act of any person is a willful act of their own volition, unless a gun is pointed at them. If you do not like the investigation leave and don't come back. You are the deranged one, living in lala land.

             Comet Ping Pong, its owners and operators, and their fan base are the cause of all of the suspicions surrounding this business.

            This board is well moderated.  There is a splinter group on Voat (all of the anti-Jewish conspiracy people migrated there) and there are folks on 4chan who are either shills are also neo-Nazi types.    Of course, there are Communists who support Hillary and Bernie, so can't have guilt by association.

            We are not "conspiracy theorists" and this is not a "conspiracy theory."  This is hard evidence of pedophilia that the mainstream media is making a concerted effort to ignore.  Where there's smoke, there's fire.  If it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck, its probably a duck.
           </p>
           <p>
            From now now, when you read an article, or hear the mention of "conspiracy theorist", substitute those words for "those seeking the truth."  Then restate the sentence and see how foolish you sound.

             "Conspiracy theory" is actually a phrase invented by... the C.I.A.   Meant to make those seeking to expose the truth look like nuts.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, there is a possible criminal conspiracy here - child trafficking and sex ring - and it is a theory - unproven as of yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it is a 'conspiracy theory' as no one is yet making public accusations using definitive proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             The MSM is ignoring the legitimate questions that have been raised and not doing a basic who/what/when/where/why bit of reporting.   That's only helped spread the legitimacy of our cause.

              All good points.  And yes this technically is a "conspiracy theory" although it's becoming less "theory" literally by the hour.

             <p>
              This next part isn't in reply to you, just leaving it here:  There are a couple of counter arguments that need to be stated constantly.  1)  Only pedos would be AGAINST researching this  2)  Covering up for this is almost, or as bad as, committing the crimes.  3)  For every "report" saying this is baseless, unfounded, absurd, etc. that is just a "narrative" being pushed by the pedos.  When shown the pictures and evidence, there are FAR MORE people that would say this is the #1 thing our nation should be investigating (fairly and impartially) at this point in time.

               The thing about conspiracy theories generally are there's NO EVIDENCE that can disprove them.

             In the name of he who as died, rose from the dead, and will come again, I implore you to read the attached file.  I pray that you who read this will clear your mind of past influence and come to this with an open heart. It contains information of international and immortal importance.  If you are not the head of your parish, please also forward this to them.   If you would rather not download the file, try going to view it on an image server here:
             <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg">
              https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpg
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Once you have read this and viewed the pictures, pray.  Then if you think it worth doing so, forward this on to seven other diocese that the word may spread.  Email, in person, telephone, smoke signal, it doesn't matter how you spread the word, just spread it!  Be careful, if you post it to facebook it will be taken down.  What you do with this information I leave to the will of God.  We will need good shepherds soon.
            </p>
            <p>
             I pray you do not disregard this message.  Amen."

              "Greetings in the name of Jesus Christ!
             </p>
             <p>
              In the name of he who as died, rose from the dead, and will come again, I implore you to read the attached file. I pray that you who read this will clear your mind of past influence and come to this with an open heart. It contains information of international and immortal importance. If you are not the head of your parish, please also forward this to them. If you would rather not download the file, try going to view it on an image server here:
              <a href="https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpgJPG">
               https://i.sli.mg/eoWIeB.jpgJPG
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Once you have read this and viewed the pictures, pray. Then if you think it worth doing so, forward this on to seven other diocese that the word may spread. Email, in person, telephone, smoke signal, it doesn't matter how you spread the word, just spread it! Be careful, if you post it to facebook it will be taken down. What you do with this information I leave to the will of God. We will need good shepherds soon.
             </p>
             <p>
              I pray you do not disregard this message. Amen."

             <p>
              DROP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND DO THIS NOW! SPREAD THE WORD! SPREAD THE TRUTH!

             Wikileaks provided the m.o. on what to do to hold those in power accountable.

             I am also concerned this apparent act of violence may lead to the new WARRANTS being issued where anyone posting her or other sites, regardless of their motives and without a specific showing of need, may wind up on some list as part of a criminal investigation.

              If they refuse to do their job it means they are involved.    All of them at th top?  Is that why we don't hear of any mutiny at the top?  There is NO ONE who isn't involved
