<p>Peter Sotos is a self-described &quot;notorious child pornographer&quot; who claims he repeatedly raped his sister when he was a teenager. He is also the first American to be convicted of child porn possession.</p>
<p>More on that here:</p>

<p>A $100,000 bond was set Thursday for a Near North Side man who, according to prosecutors, distributed a homemade magazine that outlined <code>the pleasures of child abuse, torture and murder in pornographic detail.</code></p>
<p>Peter Gus Sotos, 25, who was arrested Wednesday in his apartment at 748 W. Belden Ave., allegedly manufactured a magazine called Pure, which included pictures depicting the <code>lewd exhibition</code> of boys and girls, Assistant State`s Atty. Dan Jordan told Cook County Criminal Court Judge Francis Gembala.</p>
<p>The magazine<code>s first edition, published last year, said that</code><code>child abuse is a sublime pleasure.</code><code>It also said the</code><code>pleasures</code><code>of torture</code><code>reach their pinnacle when the victim is a small child,</code>` Judge Gambala was told.</p>
<p>Sotos became the first person charged under the revised Illinois Child Pornography Act that took effect Nov. 18, which makes possessing, manufacturing and distributing child pornography a Class 1 felony punishable by a prison sentence of 4 to 15 years.&quot;</p>
<p>He then started writing books chronicling his pedophilic fantasies, which Forney either praises or complains about when the child rape descriptions aren\'t graphic enough.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to hurt you so fucking bad.</p>
<p>I’m really gonna make you cry. You’re going to cry so much more, you’ll think your eyes are going to melt. Those crybaby tears are going to burst open your eyes and rip deep, red streaks straight through your face. You are absolutely doomed, my sweet thing. I’m gonna hurt you so much.</p>
<p>I’m going to see you dead. I’m gonna look down at your pale, bruised, and bloodied corpse and masturbate. I’m going to run my fingers through your matted hair – I’m going to let my calloused fingers get caught and tangled in the blood and sweat and grease. I’m going to pry your wounds further apart and peel off the dried blood and carve new holes in your corpse so I can fuck your entire ten-year-old being.</p>
<p>Dear, I will watch you die a horrible death. But then, that’s the last thing you’ll know-death will be a relief.</p>
<p>Because I’m going to hurt you so much. ‘Cause I love to hurt you. I want to hurt you and other little girls.</p>
<p>And you’ll be dead and gone, but I’ll still be around to hurt your friends.</p>
<p>I like to watch you cry. It gives me such a hard-on.&quot;</p>
<p>This is what Matt Forney calls &quot;pornographic gloriousness&quot; and &quot;triumphal&quot; &quot;erotic prose.&quot; That a polite way of saying this is what Forney masturbates to. He\'s also written a self-published a sex tourism guide called Do the Philippines.</p>',

            Theres been a pedo on here, he replied to one of my comments and was talking about how its a crime for adults not to have sex with children, how it does terrible damage to children if adults dont have sex with them, saying that anything to the contrary is propaganda.

            Matt Forney has proudly admitted that he would go looking for female junkies to rape.  He also advertised for Roosh V, who was selling false negative HIV tests for men to give their girlfriends.

           <p>
            <em>
             When I showed the test results to my girlfriend, she was so overjoyed that she let me raw-dog her in the ass that night. I even ejaculated deep in her colon! As she dutifully limped back to the bathroom to wash up her behind, I did a fist-pump of VICTORY!

             Same reason serial killers try to get close to, or at least follow, the investigation of thier crimes. A combination of fascination with people's reactions to the horror of what they did, and an attempt to stay ahead of the investigation.
             <br/>
             I wouldn't be surprised if half of the visits to the pizzagate subreddit/voat were from pedophiles that heard what we are doing and want to be sure they aren't in danger of being caught.

              Yeah, there was a homosexual killer who was murdering his sex partners in bushes on the hillsides around LA and when police started investigating him he literally took them to the places where he murdered his victims because of the thrill it gave it him to show off and makes faces like "catch me if you can!"

              That's literally the definition of what the FBI is supposed to be. That's why a public investigation was needed to begin with. Without transparency, the exact same shit happens.

                First of all, why do you say 'you' and 'you guys'? You don't consider yourself part of this?
                <br/>
                Secondly, the issue is kind of a slippery slope. As soon as you start trading transparency for security, everything about this stops working. I assume there is plenty of private discussion/investigation going on, but that is up to people individually. We don't really need a private official group.
                <br/>
                Thirdly, as far as destroying evidence, that's the bad news. These are the people who committed the crimes, so they know what the evidence is and where. If they can destroy it, they have already tried to. We could potentially tip them off to things they didn't think needed to be destroyed, but that is far outweighed by what we gain by co-operating.

             Absolutely. I wouldn't be surprised if there groups within agencies whose sole purpose it to keep an eye on our investigations and apply pressure and disinfo whenever we get to close to something.
            </p>
            <p>
             Always a good idea to keep an eye out for peculiar down-voting, or 'leads' that divert attention from informative posts.
