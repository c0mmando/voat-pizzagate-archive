<p>I knew immediately this was something first thing I find is the founder is a big Freemason and there are already rumors of all sorts of other &quot;rumors&quot; connected to the Lions here are a few I havn\'t had time to look into them deeper so feel free to help me out with that here are a couple. 
 -  In 2012 Australia-based website \'Martial Arts Council For The Protection of Children Against Government Child Abuse\' claimed that Freemasonry and Lions Club have links on the McKenna \'Pedophile Brotherhood\' cover-ups.
 - Given that many Freemasons are members of Lions Clubs, and its founder, Melvin Jones, was also a Freemason,[32] modern conspiracy theories have claimed that the Lions are connected to and act cohesively with Freemasonry. One example is found on Martha F. Lee\'s Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life. It says that the &quot;Freemasons are apparently in cahoots with the Lions Clubs and involved in plots ranging from the distribution of aspartame to control the human mind, to the death of John Paul I, to an apparent plot to spread Zionism.&quot;
 - Indonesian Islamic hardliners have called for a ban on the Lions Club,[31] saying it is part of a Zionist conspiracy. The club has been called an &quot;infidel&quot; front for Freemasonry and the world Zionist movement and threatened Islam in the world\'s most populous Muslim country.</p>
<p>Paxton Club, PC, Pedo Club? Pegasus = Peg-asses?</p>
<p>Here\'s a link about Masonic child abuse by design - <a href="http://pcfpc.org/2014/06/masonic-child-abuse-by-design/">http://pcfpc.org/2014/06/masonic-child-abuse-by-design/</a></p>
<p>I then went to check out their facebook page and immediately see the hand over hand pedophile symbol, the all seeing eye, and the piece of wheat all symbols we should recognize. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IA3Lw0C.jpg">Smybols smybols smybols</a></p>
<p>So at this point we can say for sure there is more to this and we need to look deeper. so lets jump back to Paxton and Peg Pizza there are a couple things right on the front of their facebook page too. First you see their photo shows the same exact spot in the middle of nowhere at Pegasus Pizza took us to, weird. Second you see an award given on the first post by the of course 33A Disctrict gov, 33rd huh? It also has ... 66 likes, 64 follows they probably meant for it to still have 66. Oh and what was the award for? For a girl recruiting 90 new YOUNG members to the Lions club... nice. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/V1te1Tj.jpg">PLC = Paxton Loves Children?</a> 
 - &quot;This weekend is the annual Mass Lions Multiple District 33 State Convention. Our own Leos Club president, Julie Goldberg was named Leo of the year for her outstanding leadership of the Wachusett Leos. In a short 18 months, the club has grown to 90 members. Congratulations to Julie and all the youth members of the Wachusett Leos. Julie accepted the award from District 33A Governor EJ Sowden, and Immediate Past International President, Joe Preston.&quot; </p>
<p>As always there are tons of cases against the Dioceses and the churches in Worhchester country </p>

In 1968, Bobby Kelley became the Rev. Robert E. Kelley and would be assigned to churches in Southbridge, Leominster and Gardner. His large Irish-Catholic clan was thrilled to have a priest in the family and parishioners adored him.
Until they learned the unthinkable: The charismatic, popular Robert E. Kelley was an insatiable pedophile.
In 1990, the priest called &quot;the Pied Piper&quot; by a former parishioner pleaded guilty to six counts of rape of a child and served seven years in state prison. Then, again in 2003, Kelley pleaded guilty to raping two young girls and was sentenced to five to seven years. In a deposition he gave during a civil suit, he admitted that he sexually molested &quot;50 to 100&quot; girls while he was an associate pastor from 1976 to 1983 at St. Cecilia\'s Church in Leominster. <a href="https://archive.is/OQ6XW#selection-805.0-817.457">https://archive.is/OQ6XW#selection-805.0-817.457</a></li>

            What is the deal with Freemasons? Why are they suspected of being involved as a generality? I don't know much about them, but the independent operation of lodges makes me wonder if they sometimes get into bad stuff on a local level, but why would that be a generality?

             Most Masons are in the dark just going to meetings doing service...but the higher up you go the Kid Fucking takes over because the Jews have taken over the Masons at the very very top....but most Jews are in the dark....blocked from understanding that the top of their tribes leadership are Satan Worshipers.  The Satanist use the Jews to hide.  They convince the regular Jews that they have to stick together for the world hates them for no reason it just is.....everyone hates us because.....and they dont really say.....maybe we work to hard?  LOL have not seen a Jew do much labor ever.   But they convince the Jews to clanishly hang together and they use this coordination to hide their Satanic crimes.   Basically the Jews were taken over first by the Satanic Cult....and from there the Satanic Cult moved in to the top levels of power where ever they saw it.  Politics....they moved in to it...using Kid fucking and murder as a weapon to keep a Goyim Politician on a short leash.....mens clubs....Lions, Masons, Shriners...they moved in and took over the top spots.....Saudi Arabia they moved in and with the British and the Rothschilds they pushed a sister Crypto Jew Clan to the top of Saudi Arabia.

             The Jews have infiltrated most every human system of power to bring everyone under their control.  That is also why the love the Pyramid.  You dont have to have lots of people to control a society....you just control the controllers.  Saul Allynski spelled it out in his limited field....

             I dunno its just like the churches, mass organized crime basically.... Just the new age Mafia syndicates. I'm sure there are good masons but they are just supporting this evil cause, plenty of great Christian people out there but the Churches are absolutely vile with their 4 billion paid out for cover ups and thats just the ones we know about.

            Service clubs are an integral part of the story and the circle of corruption. There are many of them, and they all connect back to the same groups at the top. There is a multi-level hierarchy, and they use innocent and ignorant members of clubs to obfuscate their criminal corruption.

            Every connection links to Racine, Wisconsin. That is why Racine is so important on the global scale of criminal corruption. Those who know the real truth know how it is all connected, and Racine is a weak link that would unravel the entire outfit.

            Until the feds pull on the corrupt strings that tie to Racine, Wisconsin, there is no law and there will be no justice. It is Paul Ryan's district. How  did he become so powerful? Racine is the answer to everything.

              Right! Like what is in Racine? Why are the Georgia Guidestones in Georgia? I'm not connecting the dots.

             It goes and it goes, I also found a connection in Iowa that was pretty heavy, it is absolutely widespread in every state and they have people doing their dirty work for them without even knowing it.
