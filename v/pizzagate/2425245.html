            HI there, I'm flaring this for a couple of reason and hopefully you can repost this. Please see
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            posting rules to help you post quality threads that present information that illicits conversation and challenges our community. This seems like a cut and paste, and it really needs a better title and a point. Maybe take a look around at some of the higher voted posts on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            to see what I mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flaring per rule 1, 2, 3... and possibly 4 because this is the kind of post that belongs there. If you want to add to the conversation, please review the first 3 rules. You have 24 hours to repost or it will be deleted by mods, thank you!

             Hi Honeybee_
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that a post about a celebrity busted for CP definitely satisfies Rule 1 and 2, and this title accurately reflects the article it links to. Not entirely clear why it seemed problematic. I'm going to remove the flair.

              I remember in the post to Mods that links need to be explored and a hypothesis or correlation to pizzagate/pedogate needs to be defined, maybe a direct relationship to this man watching child porn and how it is contributing to pizzagate/pedogate investigation must be clarified. I don't agree this satisfies the rules, seems like a cut and paste, granted it is fact, but what is the point, why should it be investigated deeper?It's also a blog post that may or may not have been written by the poster and it mentions only his crime and that that he commit suicide before trial, there are tons of more credible sources for this story and simply getting caught for watching child porn without pointing out the obvious connection to Hollywood pedophilia and how it relates to pizzagate/pedogate at all, makes me feel otherwise, but I trust your judgement! Voat on :)
