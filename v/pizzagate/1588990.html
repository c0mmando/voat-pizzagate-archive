<p>So, this morning I did a little digging and found out about the secret sub-group of the Shriners called the &quot;Royal Order of Jesters&quot; and apparently this group likes it\'s privacy and is all about &quot;fun&quot;.  They lost their 501(c)3 status in 2012 as a result, after an IRS investigation.  They have been linked to pedophilia and during the investigation through the depositions of five Brazilian girls describe how one was left pregnant at age 13 after one such fishing trip. Fishing guides took pictures of Jesters having sex with minor girls and surrendered them to the Brazilian Federal Police. The fishing guides testified in the same case that the Jesters asked to be called “Masons” and for girls over 13. It is not yet known if these Jesters are among the twenty fishing customers currently under investigation by the Brazilian Senate. </p>

&quot;Whereas most Masonic bodies are dedicated to charity, The Royal Order of Jesters is a fun &quot;degree,&quot; with absolutely no serious intent. The motto, &quot;Mirth is King,” is sufficient to give voice to the purpose of the organization. The Royal Order of Jesters feel that there are times, after our hard work and dedication to family and mankind, when everyone should remember to laugh and appreciate the good work one has done.&quot;</p>
<p>The order is very anti-publicity. For example, a website made by one of its members was removed after intervention of the National Court of the Order. The primary reason behind this was the desire of the Board to minimize the public exposure or public access to Jester information.</p>
<p>This video as it is over an hour long, but it is excellent in giving insights into the Order\'s secret rituals and practices.

             Catholics are behind this. Muslims are behind this. Jews are behind this. Masons are behind this. Republicans and Democrats are behind this. People who like the color blue are behind this.

             The common thread to them all is money and power. Let's evolve away from this simple way if thinking and blaming one group. Its fucking dumb.

            May I ask how even you are invited to become a mason? I am guessing they are racist? But they have many different races in their ranks, Lots of black and hispanic people from what I have seen.

            I was watching the news and was so glad about the Elephants not being used anymore.  Then they said that the reason that Ringling Bros. is shutting down is because of lack of business due to people missing the Elephants. WTH?

            I'm not understanding, sincerely - he's a brother, not a blood brother I assume you mean, angry at you for what the Mason's do?  but he was in further than you?  possible for you to just do a quick summation of what the video is about?

            Back in 2010 we found (R) Rep.Gus Bilirakis from Pasco County, Florida was a member of this group. We tried to get into their next meeting, but were not able to. We went to the local newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times with this info, and they did NOTHING. Glad to see the Jesters back up for consideration.....of evil.
Adding the link for all the doc I have here:

            What it boils down to for me, is that wherever there is SECRECY, there should be suspicion. It is their strict adherence to secrecy that should make it blatantly obvious that something just isn't right. There's no way around this - there's no way to explain away all the secrecy.

            False idols, in fact any idol is bad. If I worship myself that is a slippery slope too.  The best we can hope for is mercy at our human frailty.  Be careful of methods that require one to earn respect or conversely reward respect or shed our shared responsibility to the innocent.

            While every group is suspect and no group beyond reproach in shining a disinfecting light- the number of positive and glowing expressions of gratitude for all of the Shriner Hospitals' services are quite consistent over many years. I would be interested to see anything bad and would hope it would be immediately condemned and shut down.

             The Kosair Shriners in Louisville,Ky had some sort of a dispute with Nortons Hospitals over 2 million dollars, and removed all the Kosair names off all local affiliated medical offices/hospitals just a few months ago. I will need to do more digging into this.

            The Freemason's Royal Order of Jesters is a bizarre group.  They have been linked to human trafficking, prostitution, pedophilia, and other sorts of perversion I won't mention.  Granted, Shriners raise a lot of money for children... but they have ulterior motives.

             This is precisely it, and why these things are happening. Take a random anti-trafficking charity, make yourself a well known big-time donor, gain information on the organizations work, perhaps learn about the weaknesses in the systems that are in place, exploit said weaknesses on a need-to-know basis amongst trusted friends, make money, get your kicks, all the while looking like a good guy, cause
             <em>
              everyone
             </em>
             "knows" you donate tons of money to children's charities.

              Well said. The wolf in sheep's clothing is ancient, yet people STILL fall for it. Sometimes I wonder how this is even possible.

                You're right. We need to develop strategies to fix that. On Facebook, I'm surrounded by intellectuals with more doctoral degrees than I care to count. Yet very few even have a vague understanding of the dark occult. Although I'm sure a few of them are part of it, unfortunately. Some days this great new dark age we're living in gets to me, but I press on.

            Thank God the end has come for Ringlings, just late last year...after over 150 years of abusing those poor animals.  I only went once to the circus and left depressed for all the critters who needed love and the outdoors and to be free, not to be beaten into control like that...now it is the children :(

            Here is how the feds describe the Jesters in the Sheriff’s plea agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Royal Order of Jesters (“ROJ”) is a worldwide fraternal organization whose membership is limited to individuals invited to join by other members. The motto of the ROJ is ‘mirth is king.’ The ROJ has local chapters or ‘courts.’ On occasion, a local court or group of local courts in the same geographical area sponsor social gatherings known as ‘books of the play’ or ‘books.’ The sponsoring courts organize the ‘books’ and arrange for food, lodging, and entertainment at the ‘books.’ The ROJ also sponsors a yearly national ‘book,’ the equivalent of a national convention. In April, 2005, the Jester’s national book was held in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. As set forth below, a typical feature of a ‘book of the play’ is the presence of prostitutes (‘Jester Girls’) who engage in commercial sex acts with members of the ROJ. Arrangements for the prostitutes are generally made by the organizer of the ‘books,’ or the region hosting the national ‘book.’ On occasion, individual Jesters make arrangements to transport prostitutes to ‘books.’”
           </p>

            Indiana officials recently toughened human trafficking penalties in advance of the Super Bowl being held in Indianapolis. The state’s Attorney General worked with the Indiana legislature to create and unanimously pass a bill that Governor Mitch Daniels signed on Monday, January 30, 2012. The bill increases the penalty for forcing an underage person into the sex trade to up to 50 years in prison.

             This should be the law of the land. Not just in Indiana.  There have been articles written about what goes on during the Super Bowl Games not to mention the Olympics.  They Olympics should be shut down.

             the "book" thing reminds me of this post and Tamara Luzzatto's deep affiliation with a group of 25 "book club" members, or "followers of the book" who she wrote to Podesta about.  HIs wife Mary was in the "book club".
