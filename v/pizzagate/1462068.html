<p>Prime Minster John Key caught channeling millions of dollars of taxpayer\'s money to \'ethically compromised\' Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>The Cannabis Party is calling on John Key to explain why he gave over $7 million of New Zealand tax-payer\'s money to the Clinton Foundation.   <a href="https://cannabis.org.nz/node/278">cannabis.org.nz link</a>
Wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the Clinton Foundation when it published a hacked email, send to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of Bill and Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for him to go now. He was an Obama Hilliary man and now has no doorway into the US govt. Trump wouldn\'t be likely to be backing him. Did a lot of damage between NZ and China on behalf of the US govt. including breaking an international treaty where he tapped the Chinese embassy\'s cable for the US govt. </p>
<p>Key likes being on top only.  One of his rival politicians said he knew this was going to happen, as soon as his polls dropped below 50%. Also claims of similar democratic revolution similar to the themes in the USA and Europe where incumbents are being rolled. So his rivals claim he is getting out before being booted to save face.  It may run a lot deeper than all that. Things get tested in NZ, just in case sort of thing and it is well away from the world. GMO crops were grown in NZ before being released to the rest of the world. Cashless money systems have been in place in NZ since 1987. It is a chemtrailed nation. And it could be an earthquake weapon has been tested there twice with great accuracy. NZ had subliminals tested in their TV signals in 1981 onwards, before they were rolled out in the USA. NZ has been a test nation of how to run a post Austerity economy as they were forced to Austerity measures in 1988 (Govt employees take a 50% pay cut  for 20 years if you want to read the spoilers). NZ was the test nation for the global surveillance collection operation used by the NSA, the test operation was called Echelon and NZ was such a small nation it was able to be fine tuned there. In fact if not for echelon NZ might not have been hooked up to the WWW. </p>
<p>Lots of hackers and Pirates in NZ because of their software Law and previous copy-write laws. They still have Kim Dotcom in NZ. I wonder if one of them pulled something and we might see it released some time soon. Plenty of dirt if people could find the paperwork/e-mails.</p>',
