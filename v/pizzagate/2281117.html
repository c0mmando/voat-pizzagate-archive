<p>EXCLUSIVE: When Bret Tyer Skopek first met director Bryan Singer at a Halloween party in 2013 shortly after the aspiring songwriter arrived from Arizona, the 18-year-old had no idea who the guy wearing the Catholic priest costume was — though he realized it obviously was someone famous, since a friend urged him to pose for a photograph.</p>
<p>Skopek soon became intimately involved with Singer — one of Hollywood’s top film and TV directors whose credits include The Usual Suspects and four movies in the X-Men franchise —  and shares, for the first time, how he found himself pulled into the director’s orbit of on-set visits, expensive private dinners, ready access to drugs and alcohol and sexual encounters with an ever-revolving cast of multiple participants.... </p>

<p>“In the morning [Grasham] asks why there’s blood on the sheets. He said, ‘I guess I fingered you too hard. I’m sorry I was drunk.’ I was bleeding for a week,” Skopek recalled, adding. “It makes me realize these people don’t know what they’re doing sometimes. They are out to enjoy themselves. If they hurt someone in the process, they don’t even remember.”</p>',

            Very mixed on this one, as it is relevant and you can tell a lot of work was done on it. But it is not the bombshell that was promised. I wish it had not been pre-hyped like it was. I was waiting for most of the day to see what the amazing news was, and expected a lot more. For me, the more damaging stuff came from Singer's friend, with the mention of Singer's love of boys and sex tourism (which probably means third world countries and young boys). Singer may be relieved there is nothing more.

             Agree. When it was finally published and I read it, I was disappointed because of the hype. It just isn't what it was claimed to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's tons more to be told. We know that. It's what we're all waiting to hear. This is what it is. It gives a hint at what's going on but nothing more.

            I'm afraid this guy might have a legal issue, the reporter mentions listening to some recordings.  "California's wiretapping law is a "two-party consent" law. California makes it a crime to record or eavesdrop on any confidential communication, including a private conversation or telephone call, without the consent of all parties to the conversation."

               Where Singer and the cabal are involved? No doubt.

               My advice is to leave this one alone. Compared to other stuff published, he got off easy.

            The teen was 17 or 18 and that's legal age of consent. The cover up is in effect and Singer is being hung out to dry to keep the heat off of David Geffen and his pals who are the hardcore pedophiles in Hollywood.

             Issue is for years and years fake ID's were the norm in Hollywood. Even then Bryan Singer's staff were lax about checking if guests were of age. Police never intervene in private parties among the elite. How else would Drew Barrymore and lesser known talent be able to go to mansion events and nightclubs, drinking and partying, when they're actually still young kids?
            </p>
            <p>
             The expose of Bryan Singer is really about how huge numbers of underage and legal teens recruited, given illegal drugs, passed around countless times, all while being led to believe they'd get acting gigs as a result of their willing participation. Liberals in the industry say that Singer has crossed the line many, many times. For example no one is allowed to wear any type of swimsuit in the pool or jacuzzi. Also there's a lot of pressure, and some say outright rape, when joining the line for the bathroom.

             I agree with what you say. Seems they went out of their way to talk about the 18 and older crowd. Really? What about those twink parties?
            </p>
            <p>
             On the plus side, there is a name attached to the story and there is an alleged rape. And I don't want anyone making things up so if that's all this person knew, then it was right for him to stick with the truth. I think it's the hype the story was given. I felt it was important to post because it had been advertised, but this was not at all what I was expecting. There's still that sick side that needs to come out and be revealed. As I said, if this person wasn't involved in the more salacious acts, then he was correct in only telling what he knew. But there's somebody out there with a story to tell far beyond this one. That's what I'm waiting to hear.

              If this guy was an adult, he's not mentioning the underage guys at the sex parties because it implicates himself.

                That's because they've been going on for so long and no one has ever tried to intervene. Consider the huge number of young males that have been to a Bryan Singer party. It's comparable to copious amounts of coke on movie sets back in the 80's. No one ever bothered to try and hide it. Why should they?

            Don't take this the wrong way guys, no reflection on your hard work, but the more public and visible voices among us - the AnOpenSecret twitter account for one - need to stop and think before they make big promises of earth-shattering bombshells.  It doesn't serve any purpose, it only riles people up.
           </p>
           <p>
            This story, while disgusting, features a consensual relationship with Singer so it's anti-climactic, and I say that even though I see how damaging it is to our cause to call a story like this anti-climactic.  AnOpenSecret people - more straightforwardness and less emotion please.  We want credibility not hysteria.
           </p>
           <p>
            HOWEVER seems like a chunk of the story with Grasham is missing.  It doesn't mention if he's legally accusing Grasham of rape, is he?  It seems he described a rape, but then the story cuts to promoting a novel.  I don't understand the decisions made by the journalist in presenting this story as it is.

              consenting adults
             </em>
             story, makes it look like 'yeah im the gay who loves to fuck as much as i can' being his only

              Makes sense.  In this context, this dude is actually shilling and spinning for Singer, that it was all consensual and it was some other guy who raped him.

             I totally agree with you. I'm not sure if it was marketed for people who haven't been redpilled. I mean, most people think of Bryan Singer as a very legit director. But even having said that, no, we don't need that type of hype.
            </p>
            <p>
             I felt it should be posted because there is a name attached to this story. And there very definitely is an alleged rape. So that makes it more than valid, but this was not at all what I was expecting. I totally get what you're saying and agree.

              I'm glad you posted it, I was glad to find out what the story was.  We're on the same page, TBH it's the same issue I have with Liz Crokin.  The best of us get hyped sometimes, especially when we make new connections and discuss fresh information etc, but a constant tone of exclamation points end emojis doesn't reflect the seriousness of the topic.  IMO.  All good, mate, keep up the good fight.
