<p>New Study Confirms Overwhelming Death Rate of IVF Human Embryos </p>
<p>DENVER, Colorado, October 26, 2010 (LifeSiteNews.com) - A report by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) on a study of IVF &quot;efficiency&quot; states that just 7.5 percent of all artificially fertilized embryos will go on to become live-born children.</p>
<p>“It should surprise no one that the vast majority of sperm and eggs never get together to even begin the fertilization process,” said Dr. Robert W. Rebar, Executive Director of the ASRM, in a press release. “But, it is very important to understand that even once joined together for fertilization, an overwhelming majority of fertilized eggs do not become viable embryos, and only a small percentage of embryos thought to be viable produce a child. While this data come the IVF lab, natural conception is also very inefficient.”</p>
<p>The study was conducted at the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Maryland in order to &quot;quantify the fate of the eggs retrieved in the IVF process,&quot; and will be presented at the annual ASRM conference in Denver this week.</p>
<p>LET IT BE KNOWN - Shady Grove Fertility Center is where Dr. Steven Greenhouse worked.  He died in the accident.</p>
<p>Researchers reviewed all the in vitro fertilization cycles conducted at Shady Grove between 2004 and 2008. In 14,324 IVF cycles, clinicians retrieved 192,991 eggs. Initially, 110,939 of the eggs were successfully fertilized. However, only 44,282 continued to develop into &quot;viable embryos.&quot;</p>
<p>Usual IVF practice is to implant just one or two living embryos into the womb per IVF cycle, with the others being frozen.</p>
<p>&quot;Using the most optimistic set of assumptions that all the frozen embryos will eventually be used,&quot; the ASRM report says, &quot;this will result in 8,366 babies. Thus, only 7.5% of all the fertilized eggs will go on to become live-born children.&quot;</p>
<p>In reality the frozen human embryos are more likely to be used in research or abandoned, rather than be allowed to continue growing in their mother\'s womb.</p>
<p>When British physiologist Dr. Robert Edwards, a pioneer of in vitro fertilization whose work led to the birth of Louise Brown, the “first” IVF baby in 1978, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine earlier this month, Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, the recently appointed head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, pointed out that the award ignores the moral and ethical questions raised by artificial methods of reproduction, and disregards the destruction of countless human beings.</p>
<p>Without Edwards’ work, de Paula said, there would be no market for selling ova, or “freezers full of embryos waiting to be transferred to a uterus, or more likely, to be used for investigation or to die forgotten and abandoned by everyone.”</p>
<p>“In the best of cases they are transferred into a uterus but most probably they will end up abandoned or dead, which is a problem for which the new Nobel prize winner is responsible.”  An aspect of IVF not mentioned in the ASRM report is the necessity of &quot;selective reduction,&quot; or the abortion of one or more of the children growing in the womb in cases where two or more embryos are implanted.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incidence of twins has jumped 65 percent in the past two decades. A record 138,961 twin births - 32.2 per 1,000 live births - were recorded in 2007, according to the CDC\'s statistics. In addition, there were 5,968 triplet births, 369 quadruplets and 91 quintuplets or higher.</p>
<p>However, most multiple pregnancies resulting from IVF are &quot;selectively reduced&quot; by abortion.</p>
<p>David Picella, a Family Nurse Practitioner with specialty training as a medical consultant and teacher of the Creighton Model Fertility Care system, wrote in an article titled &quot;10 Reasons to Choose NaProTechnology Over InVitro Fertilization&quot; that &quot;One of the most objectionable things about IVF is that it can result in a situation where a woman is forced to deal with a dangerously high multiple pregnancy rate. </p>
<p>&quot;Pregnancy risk increases dramatically with the number of babies in the womb. Frequently, women are compelled to selectively ‘reduce’ (i.e., kill) additional babies in the womb due to unacceptably high pregnancy risk.&quot;</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (ABC7) — A Shady Grove Fertility (SGF) doctor died during an accident involving a personal water craft in Delaware over the weekend, the fertility center announced on Monday. </p>
<p>The doctor has been identified on the SGF website as 53-year-old Stephen Greenhouse, M.D. </p>
<p>&quot;Steve will be remembered at SGF and in the Washington, D.C. medical community by the thousands of lives he touched in both small and large ways. His passion for medicine and for his patients was a driving force behind Steve’s professional life,&quot; SGF stated in part following his death. </p>
<p>The DNREC Fish &amp; Wildlife Natural Resources Police Department reports the accident happened around 1:41 p.m. on Roy\'s Creek off Assawoman Bay in Fenwick Island, Delaware. It\'s unclear at this time what caused the crash, but police confirmed alcohol was not a contributing factor. </p>
<p>Greenhouse leaves behind his wife and three sons. </p>
<p>The fertility center said patients of Dr. Greenhouse will be connected with another doctor and their treatment is a top priority. </p>

             I know.  I am highly suspicious about what goes on there but that name really was a corker.  Remember what we say about messages in movies?  Well I think this is one too.  I am having trouble proving with links that there are some nefarious things being done by them.  I am still looking.

            I think part of the problem that results in so many abandoned or killed embryos is state laws regarding these matters. Some states allow a woman to freeze her eggs for later use. So if a woman is getting older or going to start chemo, she can freeze her eggs and use them at a later date to have a better chance of having a healthy baby. Laws in other states do not allow a woman to freeze eggs, they can only freeze embryos. It seems like such a waste to do it that way. And it takes the choice away from the parents.

             Anytime they can take away our choices, they win.  That is what I am trying to say here.  Our govt. is controlling these procedures and allowing this to happen, with these embryos when they do not step in.  Criminal, imo.

             I am getting that feeling to now.  I didn't use to look at it that way until I really delved into what they are doing behind the scenes.  To me it has become immoral unless in the life of the mother.  But the sad thing is, how can we trust them to do it honorably.  We can't.  In there lies the problem.

             We will probably never know, as with other cases like the one in Cali Dr. shot in front of his 2 daughters.  That is why we now have our posts under Discussion.  And yes I get your drift.

             Well, in my view, this is all happening under the eyes and blessings of the CDC.  They could put a stop to this, but they do not.  The CDC is allowing the sale of these embryos.  In a way you could look at it as murder.  But let's not go that far since we can't prove it.  It is still extremely questionable and I personally believe our govt. is allowing this when they can easily put a stop to it.

              You need to spell out the PG connection in the thread, as well as why you think the doctor's death wasn't an accident as claimed. If the theory is it might be part of a fetal stem cell harvesting operation, and the doc's connections with the CDC allowed him to profit from selling frozen embryos, then you need to say that and offer some links supporting the possibility. You've got a bit more time to do that. But if you don't, this is too much like those innuendo threads like the disinfo pushers create, rather than an  research thread. The purely speculative, hypothetical stuff needs to go in

               I am not a disinfo pusher.  You are insinuating that I am by your choice of words.  As you know I am not very good at posting, it is not my forte. I will try to connect what I believe if not I will have to move it to the sub you suggested,
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               That sub is where some go because we now have to delete because even though we post under Discussion, we do not discuss, we are boxed into a corner.  I posted in good faith and hoped that others would help research what you have suggested.  I have always had a good relationship with you but this is the second or third time you have put me in the disinfo group.  Saying it is like the disinfo posts is pretty much calling it disinfo.  We do not know it is disnifo unless researched. 
 The problem probably lies within my personal feelings as well, in that I think what they are doing is totally wrong.  I will see what I can do.

                Carmencita, I was certainly not trying to make anyone think you are pushing disinfo. My point was that a "collage" post of two links -- the IVF link and the link about the IVF doctor dying in an accident -- with no explanation of how you think they are related to each other or to elite child rape doesn't meet the submission requirements we have here to prevent the shills from posting collage posts that rely solely on innuendo and confirmation bias to make readers fill in the blanks. I happen to agree with you about IVF -- it's a shitshow. But there's a reason we require submitters to state their Pizzagate hypothesis and then provide the supporting links.

                 Police said the alleged sexual abuse happened over a span of nearly two decades and the accusers came forward 17 years after the alleged abuse stopped.

                 ROCKVILLE, Md. - A well-respected doctor who works with patients at Shady Grove Medical Center in Montgomery County is facing sexual abuse charges, according to officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dr. Virendra Saxena, an intensive care unit doctor at the hospital in Rockville, is accused of sexually abusing young girls he knew outside of work, authorities stated. Officials said the victims were not patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The allegations in the court documents mention the involvement of other men. FOX 5 asked authorities if anyone else was being charged and we were told the case remained under investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 OTHER MEN.  Could one of them have been Dr. Greenhouse?  I am working on it.  This was a long term of abuse.  almost 2 decades.

                    That is definitely suspicious. But the problem is that the submission doesn't connect any of these tidbits into a coherent thesis related to Pizzagate. You have to actually edit the post, not just add more links. If you don't want to edit this into a research thread that ties all of these elements together, it should go in
                    <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                     v/pizzagate
                    </a>
                    whatever. Also, you need to confirm these two Shady Grove medical places are connected -- the fertility clinic is in DC and the hospital is in Maryland. Is it a chain?

                      This thread was never edited. It still stands as a disjointed series of links connected only by speculation, so yes, I'd say it needs to go to

                      . If carmencita wanted to edit it, she has had plenty of time. Maybe she'll make a new directly-related research thread based on the pedo doc, and include a link to these maybe-related other events. This one's time is up. Removing per Rule 1.

            : your posts are always good and pertinent but Im not getting this one. Ok, a bonafide accident of a doctor doing IVF.  Help me out. Is it just the abortion of  excess fetuses  thats bad or are you suggesting this is a.source of body parts like the Planned Parenthood scandal. Im not up on the biology of selling fetus body parts. Are they used for stem cell research and  stem cell treatments which lots of doctors are doing nowadays tho not covered by insurance. Do they stay close to the. birth process to harvest placentas?  Other than helping out when normal pregnancy doesnt work, where is the bad?

             All of the above.  We have had posts on how they are selling them for all of those that you mention.  Remember the post on Alder Hey Hospital?  There are many reasons that come to play here. AND it all depends on what your view on abortions are as well.  As you see, the answer from darkknight suggests organ harvesting.

              well , we cant be an abortion forum even though partial birth abortions and selling fetuses has to make the most pro-abortion advocate think twice. And Im sure many, maybe even most PG's have not problem with IVF for couples unable to conceive naturally. And the success rate of fertilized eggs must vary greatly such that we assume the risk of too many babies. And we must have to abort some of the "excess" fetuses because humans werent designed to have large litters like dogs and a wman's life and the wellbeing of the fetuses can be placed in danger with a large number of viable fetuses and yes, we are playing God with all aspects of the IVF process.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, Im not seeing how this relates to sex abuse of children. I wouldnt reard favoring one gender over another when aborting a fetus as sex abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              I read your post in its entirely because it was interesting but I kept waiting for the sex abuse by a terrible doctor who in your opinion needs further scrutiny but why? And what makes his death suspicious?
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps you have very strong feelings about the ethics of IVF and the inevitable selection of fetuses for destruction (and the inevitable problem of disposing of the aborted fetus) such that you felt compelled to share. All Im saying is I kept looking for  the connection, thinking it was just around the corner. I actually read it twice thinking I must have missed something.
             </p>

              You are a very valued member here so dont take offense by the flare. Im sure it was hard for Vindicator to do it because you are so valued. But lets move on so we can out those bastards!

               We know that there are many hospitals and other medical facilities that are involved in the selling of baby parts and fetuses including stem cells.  This is not what I and some others on here want our medical community or the CDC to support.  As you may know there have been many doctors dying of unusual circumstances as the one in Atlanta and recently in Cal.  actually in other parts of the world as well, some had connections to Big Pharma and vaccines/CDC.  That's the reason I put a question mark after connected.  Because I was hoping others would help with the research.  I was asking a question.  We do post under Discussion. I never made a statement that he was suicided or mentioned any other criminal act towards him.  Thanks for your compliments.

               Just like with everything else.  They tell the story their way.  Ye, like the CDC vacs Dr.  A lot of things that popped up but the proof in the end, well, they always have evidence for their side. Things always boil down to those little babies and Our Children.

            IVF creates a sad dilemma.  Remember the "Octomom" who had eight embryos implanted at once?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Public reaction turned negative when it was discovered that Suleman already had six other young children and was unemployed and on public assistance programs. Suleman conceived the octuplets and her six older children via in vitro fertilization (IVF). Although she initially denied ever having used public assistance, she confirmed in April 2012 on NBC's Today show that she was indeed on public assistance."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "...she requested all of the remaining embryos be transferred into her uterus at one time. A woman her age would normally have a maximum of two or three embryos transferred. Suleman states that part of her reasoning for attempting a sixth pregnancy was so that the frozen embryos not be destroyed."

             Some of these procedures that were implemented to help the public, seem to have an ulterior motive behind them.  Then also we have strange situations like Suleman who for whatever reason decides to have more children.  They will take advantage of any poor woman just like they did with Henrietta Lacks.  God only knows what they have done with the IVF program.  Also we must remember the CDC is involved as well. Yes, I had forgotten about Octomom.
