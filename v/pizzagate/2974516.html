<p>The Great Conspiracy is not that hard to understand. It\'s goal is to gradually assert creeping authoritarianism and it is half the terrible parts of human nature and half organized from the top to exploit those terrible parts of human nature.</p>
<p>The trauma based mind control started with the Tavistock Institute of Human relations, who began to study PTSD in troops during WWI, before they even had a name for PTSD.</p>
<p>Tavistock, additionally, engaged in &quot;principles of mass persuasion&quot; which they later named, &quot;systems psychodynamics.&quot; Systems psychodynamics is based on Wilfred Bion\'s &quot;basic assumption theory&quot; where your basic assumptions are manipulated to control how you vote.</p>
<p>The goal, as far as manipulating your point of view, is to prevent you from caring about corruption through diffusion of responsibility, and to control who you vote for. This is where it gets annoying for some people. The ideal manipulation isn\'t to make everyone vote the same. The ideal manipulation is to make half the population vote one way and the other half vote the other way. There is never supposed to be a strong majority to lead the way, because things would actually get done and a single party could eliminate all of the corrupt officials in other parties (the checks and balances we are SUPPOSED to have.)</p>
<p>I don\'t want you to get too tied up with Tavistock, because they are far from the only game in town. But they are a good working model of a think tank that employs a lot of basic psychological principles, like self-fulfilling prophecy. It gets weird, though, because they looked for psychological principles to explain black magic. The first psychologists were occultists. &quot;Self fulfilling prophecy&quot; is the psychological term that refers to the individual level of &quot;social dreaming.&quot; Since researchers began to stumble on Tavistock, after the election, Wikipedia has removed their social dreaming page and the Internet, at large, has seen the disappearance of a lot other Tavistock documentation, like pieces of their &quot;wartime archives&quot; which aren\'t even on archive sites, anymore.</p>
<p>The reason you should know about social dreaming is because it is, essentially, a black magic spell, where you say something that isn\'t true or hasn\'t happened (while in a group of people) to invoke the principles behind self-fulfilling prophecy. This is how and why &quot;double speak&quot; works and why you see so many &quot;double speak&quot; titles in media. They are, essentially, casting black magic on you because, even if you don\'t fall for the ploy, you are angered and succumb to negativity to the extent you appear &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;obsessed&quot; so that you can be discredited.</p>
<p>Tavistock was preceded by the Coefficients Dining Club, who planned World War I to &quot;cooperatively make the world more efficient.&quot; Their minutes are still available, today, in London, where you can see them, yourself. Freud had started his own Wednesday Psychology club and held meetings in Vienna. He was doing this the same time Stalin, Hitler and Trotsky were also in Vienna. That group would, eventually, become an International Association of Psychologists and expand across the globe.</p>
<p>Dr. Ewan Cameron was the president of the Canadian chapter of these psychologists when he began unethical experimentation on children, later called &quot;MK Ultra.&quot; But, again, this has black magic origins. Torturing a child in a specific way shatters their mind, as a defense mechanism, and creates multiple personalities. He was working for Tavistock, in a compartmentalized manner, who was working for Bob Bannerman and Morris &quot;Morse&quot; Allen of the CIA. They didn\'t just stumble across torturing kids, they merely studied a behavior that was already being done.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon church, used social dreaming to make people &quot;see&quot; the golden plates with their &quot;mind\'s eye.&quot; So, what Tavistock is doing, is they are studying how to explain this religious and ritual behavior in a psychological way. Again, they aren\'t the only game in town.</p>
<p>What this all boils down to is that you, yourself, are somewhat MK Ultra\'d. You can\'t really be exposed to mainstream media, movies, music, the Internet, without your synapses being manipulated on a biological level.</p>
<p>In order to get around it, you really have to &quot;white magic&quot; yourself, but that doesn\'t mean trapping yourself in delusional positivism, it is more about embracing neutrality and knowing that the most powerfully cast spell is when you calmly, confidently tell the truth about bad behavior.</p>
<p>The black magic gets worse, though, as many have seen from a variety of documents regarding MK Ultra and related projects. But, notice in Tavistock literature and CIA documents, they are still using a great deal of double speak. After reading enough if this type of material, it is easy to start seeing how they arrange language to tell the truth and lie in the same sentence.</p>
<p>The dark web saw some interesting releases, years ago, that revealed MK Ultra was continued in a compartmentalized fashion into Chickwit, Artichoke, MKNaomi, MkSearch, etc. An integral part of trauma based mind control is sexual abuse, prolonged sensory deprivation, torture and we see this in nearly every star, today. The most acute way to control someone is to give them a cocktail of scopolamine, benzodiazepam and an anti-seaizure medication, where they essentially become a mind control zombie. Even if you have never put someone through MK Ultra, you can still calmly instruct them to empty out their ATM or participate in their own rape, when given this cocktail that nearly anyone can get a hold of and make, themselves.</p>
<p>By hyper-controlling people in the spotlight in news, sports, movies and TV, you are essentially tricked into adopting basic assumptions that the occultists want you to believe in.</p>
<p>Getting you to &quot;act&quot; is a simple three step plan they contrived in the 40s but applies to tap apps, today. Create a basic assumption, trigger an extreme emotion using that assumption, then call to action (usually, vote.)</p>
<p>Either way, it is possible this goes all the way back to the cult of the Elephantine Isle, where Eratosthenes correctly measured the circumference of the earth using the shadow of a red granite obelisk in Aswan, Egypt (the only place to get red granite in the ancient world). This cult used a trinity as a religion to control their people and when they conquered new ones, they allowed them to have their own deities, but more as saints underneath their trinity. This red granite obelsik was moved to Alexandria, which was sacked by Augustus, who took it to Rome and put it on top of the Necropolis that the Vatican stands on, today. The obelisk used to have the story of creation on it, but it was scraped off around the 1500s. Prior to the Vatican being there, the Circus of Nero is where they did public sacrifices, essentially. So, what you have is an homage to the original psychology cult whose tricks were finally translated into psychobabble and implemented upon the masses.</p>
<p>From an intelligence perspective, you have a problem where you need to convince people to defy common sense and keep secrets. The best way to do this is to recruit cultists who are blindly obedient. To that end, Tavistock and others created fake cults that were specifically designed to infiltrate other cults. One example is the Process Church of Final Judgment. Tavistock created this fake cult whose theology was to combine all the god forms into one person (yourself). The Process church infiltrated Scientology, right away. Then, the Bohemian Grove and the Manson cult. They eventually co-opted Santa Muerta cults in Mexico before moving onto Voodoo cults in the Caribbean. Their theology, or a close facsimile, now rules a number of cults for the Crown, where the occultists, themselves, are dupes.</p>
<p>But they don\'t know that. By using symbols everywhere to communicate their cult is powerful, they think THEIR CULT is in charge, but they are all using the same symbols.</p>
<p>Why do mass shootings happen? Why does this corruption happen &quot;in your face&quot;? The occult explanation is that they are passing on their bad karma to you, where you are a passive, consensual participant. You like the famous people. You want to be like them. Etc. But, it is worse than you think. They have to put it in everyone\'s face to demonstrate their power, otherwise their cult wouldn\'t last very long. So, for every victory against them, you can expect a drastic reaction, in turn.</p>
<p>Again, the solution here is the most basic form of white magic. Spelling out the truth in a calm, confident manner.</p>
<p>Many are familiar with the Stanford Prison Experiment... essentially a Tavistock experiment... that shows we all have, within ourselves, multiple roles and personalities we can access. You don\'t have to torture people to bring that out. The torture is needed to make a slave, though. You are free, within yourself, to access your own &quot;god forms.&quot; I don\'t believe in magic. I think psychology is a lot of psychobabble where everyone is designed to be deficient, in some way. But I do believe in neuroscience, so it has taken me a long time to really understand how to communicate my ideas.</p>
<p>Multiple Personalities is almost a misnomer. They are extreme states of mind, relative to each other, where a sufferer cannot even access the neural pathways to other memories they have. You are no different. When you get emotional and allow a news article to make you emotional, you activate the more primitive parts of your mind, stealing electrochemical energy from the part that makes you human, the part on the front that no other creature has. Junk food. A sedentary life. Electronic screen dopamine traps. Pornography. Drugs. These things and more all work together, designed by people you will never meet and never know about, to steal your humanity and make you more of an easily controlled animal.</p>',

            Excellent post and so true. 
The power of life and death are in the tongue and these people know this well and have been using it. A "spell" is nothing more than this practice in action. We "create" with our words. Good or evil.

            , sorry to be a nitpicker, but our submission rules require links to supporting sources in the text (embedded or next to) of each major claim in the submission. This is how we make it more challenging for disinfo pushers who constantly troll us. You will need to edit the body of your post to include the links you've put in the comments in the appropriate spots, so that users can vet your claims for themselves. I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. You are welcome to use the shortened archive links SWMBO has provided. Thanks.

            Wow where to start, youve certainly been looking into this a while. I Agree with you, its hard not to. This has been going on since the Talmud reading Babylonians and Sumerians the very people who ran the mystery schools
            <a href="https://www.invidio.us/channel/UCqOdHprLVQnHhE8FmIY3Yzg">
             (Dark journalist has some good research on the mystery schools)
            </a>
            had a tradition of MtoF and FtoM "priests" and "priestesses", the are the same folks who gave us the numerical system which our GPS systems run on now (Sexagecimal/base 60). I believe they where a lot, lot smarter than we are led to believe in brainwashing school, (especially the greeks, earth, water, air, fire, OR solid, liquid, gas, plasma. OR

            </a>
            (I could talk about this all day but for more info on the greeks the nature of light and magnetism and just how long weve known these secrets -
            <a href="https://www.invidio.us/channel/UCVcxJ9k14bi__-uA1cGkEcA">

            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            Weve been controlling people through fear and torture for a long time too. Some castles and keeps that contained villagers would have the torture chambers located under the markets so the screams could be heard by the locals in a supposed effort to keep them inline. like they were built that way. so the torture of one man could affect the whole keep. efficient. IIRC I think I read that when I looking into Liz Bathory (
            <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/human-body/ambrosia-medical-to-open-ny-clinic-offering-blood-transfusions-for-renewed-youth/news-story/f6bfd4bfc43367b04dd1c5b5cda329da">
             theres maybe another link to back to the ancients there with "Ambrosia"
            </a>
            ) but yet another link to all this ancient knowledge, blood drinking, fear based programming and control - Glamour, the thing that keeps people in power.
Not like teen vampire glamour, more like psychological, the wool being pulled over your eyes type glamour from legends of things like
            <a href="http://myths.e2bn.org/mythsandlegends/origins15607-the-hand-of-glory.html">
             "the hand of glory
            </a>
            "(who wouldnt freeze in fear when spotting a burglar in their home with a skeleton key on one finger and a burning candle on another whilst walking towards you chanting "skidadle skidoodle your dick is now a noodle"?) upto the confidence man style smoke and mirror tricks of the elite's (theyre all just grifters trying to sell nothing for something the very nature of usury). Thats why I think theyre so hellbent on poisoning us with heavy metals - to dull our wits, making us easy marks for their tricks.

            Being a now out of work locksmith, I know all to well the power of illusion. Locks which have absolutely no good reason to be so shit in general nowadays are because a manufacturer writes "Security level 10" and people who look no further and go home believing they've got a good lock. But with the right pick most pin tumblers can be opened by anyone who can knock one out with enough skill to not pull their own cock off.

            Instigate mass migration from Syria and other Muslim countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do a psy-op by brainwashing people in the West that these are all poor refugees (while most of the genuine refugees are middle class from Syria, or migrants from other countries like Morocco, Tunesia etc, many of the latter criminals), which people have to embrace and take care of.
           </p>
           <p>
            Get people to forget that most of these refugees and migrants are young males, not women and children. And that the really poor and most traumatized refugees never make it to Western countries anyway.

            Create an opposition by setting up anti-Islam and rightwing groups, talk about an upcoming civil war. Finance anti-fa groups that fight the anti-Islam and rightwing groups. Get people all emotional by instigating terror attacks, and when they read news about the crimes the young male migrants commit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make people vote for rightwing governments that take civil liberties away like in Poland or Hungary, because they seem like the only solution to the problem.

           <p>
            Make people vote for leftwing governments that take civil liberties away by seemingly fighting 'hate speech' because they give you the notion you are a good human being when you accept open borders and shifting money to welfare institutions that care for refugees.
           </p>
           <p>
            End up with a polarized, divided, agitated population, that has turned away from calm discussion, one that lets itself getting ruled even easier.

            Hey you undisputed champions of extreme irrationality. So where are all the incoming pizzagate arrests you were rambling about the past 2 years? Quote:

             Is it ridiculous to believe that Hillary Clinton is in photos with a Hell of a lot of Pedos, when you can see the photos? What about the Biden videos?
            </p>
            <p>
             On a personal note, I was told the story of a girl who came forward about the abuse she and others suffered in the uk care system (as a sort of "well it could be worse" sort of pep talk). In nottinghamshire, a girl named Melanie Shaw tried to blow the whistle when a care home was visited by repeatedly "posh speaking" pedoviles, one of whom had a penchant for buggering boys whilst wearing a freddy krueger mask. Then years later The International Tribunal for Natural Justice involving people like Robert David Steele, heard the same story as testimony. As well as that of ex police officer John Wedger. So dont tell me powerful people around the world arent involved in pedovileia and that its covered up on a scale thats becoming a joke. Wake the fuck up.

            The Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (German: Wiener Psychoanalytische Vereinigung, WPV), formerly known as the Wednesday Psychological Society, is the oldest psychoanalysis society in the world. It commenced meetings in Sigmund Freud's apartment in 1902. By 1908 the group adopted its new name and was the international psychoanalytic authority of the time.

              Crime, Gangs, and Civil Disorder. Wells predicted an intractable increase in crime, gang warfare, and civil disorder until his "modern world state" became a reality. Wells came as close in this area as anywhere else in "giving away his propaganda game". On page 143 Wells states, "And then, as the greater community of the World State began to struggle clumsily and painfully out of traditional forms, we see police control again out paced by its task. It gives way. 'Why,' the student asks, 'was this police organization unable to keep pace with the new stresses'." The obvious answer would be that the Brave New World Order agenda, or movement for social change, is essentially destructive and to blame it for the accelerating degeneration of society. But no! Wells spends pages blaming the limitations of individualism, capitalism, religion, and nationalism for the breakdown and postulating world government as the "only hope" for order. It is clear that this philosophy of blaming traditional forces, that in spite of their imperfections, have been compatible with order for centuries for the increasing disorder instead of the new philosophy remains the successful propaganda line of the New World (dis)Order.

             <p>
              War and International Disorder. Wells actually had some knowledge of the possibility of nuclear power, but made no mention of it in this book and apparently did not foresee the nuclear stalemate of 1946-1989 which gave the world some respite from the exhaustion of perpetual war which he postulated. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the examples of Yugoslavia, Somalia, South Africa, India-Pakistan, etc. in front of us, it is possible that his projected "30 year war" may run from 1990 to 2016 instead of from 1940 to 1966. &gt;Wells has a long section on Henry Ford's "Peace Ship", a public relations device by which the great industrialist tried to bring WWI to early conclusion. While giving no publicity to Ford's central contention that Wells' mentors, the "Great Pirates" or "International Bankers" were promoting WWI as part of their destructive program for "war profits" and a New World Order, Wells shows how Ford's efforts were doomed to failure not because they would be ridiculed unmercifully by the power of his mentors over the press, but because the evil forces of individualism and capitalism would force the great industrialist into war production for a profit. In fact, if Ford had not been run off the stage by the Anglophile Eastern Establishment press, he might have achieved something!

            <li>
             <p>
              The Money Question. Wells takes a firm position against the usury and tight money policies of "high finance" and for the easy money policies of "Social Credit" as promoted in Britain and the Commonwealth by C. H. Douglas, crack-pot conspiracy theory advocate (one of us!) who Wells actually goes so far as to mention by name! Of course, Wells fails to mention that his mentors, the most powerful usurers of all time who hold the world's credit in their hands and manipulated the great crash of 1929 which triggered the Great Depression, create boom and bust cycles to maintain their dominant world position.

            <li>
             <p>
              Education/Social Nucleation. One of the great mysteries of Wells' book is his apparently imaginary author, Gustave De Windt who wrote Social Nucleation, supposedly in 1942, a book that solved the final theoretical problems in creating the Modern World State. Wells states that the book, "was the first exhaustive study of the psychological laws underlying team play and esprit de corps . . ." Wells pictures De Windt's ideas having the
impact of a Marx, Plato, Darwin, or Adam Smith, sweeping away the social rubbish of the past including family, religion, ethnicity, tribe, and patriotism and smoothly replacing it with New World Order socialization patterns. There can be little doubt that De Windtian ideas inform Deweyite Progressive Education and, more recently, Outcome Based Education. On a deeper level, De Windt has created a technology of "macrobe" or "social organism" building for the "Air Dictatorship. One can only wonder if Wells had a specific psychologist in mind, perhaps the German Wundt who prefigured behaviorism?

              The Martyrdom of Man by Winwood Reade. As we have mentioned before, ultra social Darwinist Winwood Reade was Cecil Rhodes' "Ayn Rand and Jules Verne" rolled-up into one. On page 108 Wells pays sly tribute to this mentor by mentioning Winwood Reade, though he claims in his autobiography never to have met Rhodes personally. On this page Wells also attempts a lame justification of his mentor's advocacy of worldwide carnage, disorder, and suffering on the basis of an abundance of happiness in the future Modern World State.

              Non-Lethal Weapons. Non-lethal "peace gas" was portrayed as the supreme weapon of the "Airmen". In fact, the miraculous gas was used to put an end to the influence of the Pope! Though the conspiracy has, of yet, done little of proven value in this area (ask David Koresh), it is interesting to note that Newsweek of February 7, 1994 ran an article titled Soon 'Phasers on Stun': A new generation of nonlethal weapons may help rout mobs, subdue gunmen, even win wars--without killing the innocent. The possible application to UN "Peace-Keeping" did not go unnoticed.

Project Artichoke was headed by former Naval intelligence officer Morse Allen and in 1951 and 1952 especially, Allen worked closely with Fink in New York City in efforts to thoroughly explore the merits of electroshock techniques for interrogations.* The CIA was especially interested in the use of electroshock machines in producing amnesia, inducing subjects to talk and making subjects more prone to hypnotic control.

Lastly, Bannerman stated to the official and Allen that “[the CIA’s Office of] Security [through its Artichoke Committee] would have to be cognizant” of the operation, and may even want to “run the operation themselves since this type of work is one which Security handles for the Agency. Here it is interesting to note that among the many members of the agency’s Artichoke Committee in 1952 was Dr. Frank Olson, who would about a year later be murdered in New York City.

             There are several quarries in Egypt, but the preferred granite source came from the Aswan area. One of the earliest known directors of the Aswan quarry was employed by Ramses III, named Hori around 1170 BC (1). Much of the red, grey, and black granite used in the pyramids and Valley Temple on the Giza plateau was taken from here, and was utilized long before Ramses III. The stone from this quarry was transformed into the casing stones of Khafre and Menkaure’s pyramids, the 70 ton lintels above the Kings Chamber, and numerous sarcophagi, columns, and megalithic blocks on the plateau and beyond. The casing stones on Menkaure’s pyramid have caused some controversy. Robert Temple and his colleagues concluded, by using a technique called optical thermoluminescence , that the casing stones were dated between 3590 – 2640 BC, much earlier than Menkaure, and possibly confirming that the pyramids were built several hundred years before King Menes, the first Pharaoh, circa 3100 BC (2). This also dates the quarry at Aswan much earlier than previously thought, as that’s where the stone came from.

              many ancient inhabitants of the Americas engraved records on metal plates, found near Burlington, Wisconsin.
 Purportedly the final testament of an ancient American ruler named "Rajah Manchou of Vorito",   this discovery vindicated his claims to be the true successor of Joseph Smith, founder of the LDS movement—as opposed to Brigham Young, whom most LDSs accepted as Smith's successor in 1844. The plates also lent credence to his claim that Voree, (not the Salt Lake Valley,) was to be the new "gathering place" of the Latter Day Saints. Strang's translation of this text is accepted
 as scripture by his church and some other bodies descending from it, but not by any other LDS org.
             </p>
             <p>
              the existence of Strang's plates were verified by independent, non-Mormon witnesses
