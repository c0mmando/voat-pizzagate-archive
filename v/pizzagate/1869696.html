            Was the accuser a minor? Maybe not pizzagate related but one thing I'm noticing is accusations arising from what goes on in bed once someone embarks on consensual sex. Look at the ridiculous charges by the Swedish gals against Assange. Disputes over protected sex, disputes about stopping when one partner doesn't want to continue any further, accusations being made after further and presumably conflict free social interaction occurs.  Sounds like revenge in some instances. Internet eternity means someone's reputation is permanently damaged no matter how innocent.

            Yeah, I found it strange that the fallout was so immediate/devastating... it makes them seem VERY guilty. Imagine if Fox News fired O'Reilly instantly after an initial allegation? Everyone would just assume he was 100% guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            My initial post touched on this, the distancing process was so immediate, it really made it seem like something far worse was going to come to the surface. If these accusations are all BS - the labels that dumped them are going to need to make good on their mistake really quickly.

            I'm only suggesting we listen at this point! Not believe... either side of the story. Until there is evidence, it's just that. Two stories.
