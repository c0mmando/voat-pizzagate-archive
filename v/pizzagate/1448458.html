            You'd be crippling us. Look at the sub now - I've been moderating lightly the past 24 hours or so and already people getting frustrated with the dilution. There are alternative subs if people want to shitpost or general post.

            I prefer Zero Hedge's sometimes infuriating policy of non interventionism. Reading the naive, racist, and sometimes just plain stupid comments isn't fun, but we need to give more credit to the majority who wish to a) know the truth and b) get humainty out of this situation. For the time being at least, trolls and shills will be a factor, but I do think allowing them a voice increases our ability to deal with them (by ignoring generally) as well as serving to highlight their ignorance. Censorship always gives a skewed version of reality, and is open to manipulation itself.

             That's a really terrible system though. I don't think we should risk alienating regular users because we think it's a shill. That would do more damage than it would be worth. But, I would like the admins to be more active in removing obvious spam/troll accounts like the ones OP mentioned.
