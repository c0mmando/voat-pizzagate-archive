<p>Last thing I\'d ever want to do is try to act like the voice of anyone else - especially on such a site like this where we have a hugely varied group of people investigating some seriously sick shit.  I think that we can all agree, however - at least those among us who are here to actually try and get something done - that there has been a huge problem with the trolls coming here lately and while I\'m certainly in no position to police anyone else\'s speech, I think it\'d be useful to create a list with (proven) trolls, suspected or known CTR shills, time-wasting people and general assholes. </p>
<p>I think it\'ll help to save everyone a lot of time and potentially keep the huge amounts of BAD information coming in by the boatload even a little bit less frequent.  The types of people I\'m referring to are not those who are legitimately discussing incorrect (yet potentially plausible theories) but those who have joined voat, it seems, specifically to insult the users of this forum.  They\'re usually quite easy to spot as they have post histories which are riddled with nothing but short, homophobic/anti-semitic accusatory posts calling people \'cucks\' and actively working to try and dissuade further investigation or draw attention away from legitimate avenues of investigation.</p>

<p>This is just a small sampling - and it\'s likely to be all the same person, which is sad because they must have a pathetic and lonely life.

            You'd be crippling us. Look at the sub now - I've been moderating lightly the past 24 hours or so and already people getting frustrated with the dilution. There are alternative subs if people want to shitpost or general post.

            I prefer Zero Hedge's sometimes infuriating policy of non interventionism. Reading the naive, racist, and sometimes just plain stupid comments isn't fun, but we need to give more credit to the majority who wish to a) know the truth and b) get humainty out of this situation. For the time being at least, trolls and shills will be a factor, but I do think allowing them a voice increases our ability to deal with them (by ignoring generally) as well as serving to highlight their ignorance. Censorship always gives a skewed version of reality, and is open to manipulation itself.

             That's a really terrible system though. I don't think we should risk alienating regular users because we think it's a shill. That would do more damage than it would be worth. But, I would like the admins to be more active in removing obvious spam/troll accounts like the ones OP mentioned.
