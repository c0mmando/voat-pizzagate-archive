<p>On June 21, 1922, Bronfman married Saidye Rosner (1897 – July 7, 1995), with whom he had four children: Aileen Mindel &quot;Minda&quot; Bronfman de Gunzburg (1925–1986), Phyllis Lambert (born January 24, 1927), Edgar Miles Bronfman (June 20, 1929 – December 21, 2013[5]), Charles Rosner Bronfman (born June 27, 1931).</p>

<p>Minda married a French banker with Rothschild ties and became a baroness</p>

<p>There are many more connections between Bronfam Family and Rothschild through Foundations and Groups</p>

<p>would appreciate help finding them and putting in comments </p>
<p>would also like help running down Charles\'s other wives and Children and their ties to either Rothschild or Israel</p>
<p>Maybe put ties of Edgars children here too</p>
<p>I also wonder if the same rat lines used by the Bronsfams are being used for children trafficking</p>

            It is a pretty substantial oversight on the part of this forums researchers if they are just learning of the Bronfman family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jewish families are key not just because they have the most financial resources but they literally built the foundations (politically and often physically) of pizzagate cities like LA, SF, Seattle.
           </p>

            Sometimes they end up molesting each others' daughters

             The British realized the Bronfmans would be a liability if they continued to work as openly with their distributors in narcotics trafficking as they did running Prohibition. They could not afford to dump Bronfman. The family had become irreplaceable due to its in-depth control over the syndicates which were needed to pump drugs into America.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem was resolved by bringing Bronfman into the lower rungs of the Hofjuden caste. Sam’s children were welcomed into the Hofjuden elite by intermarriage. Almost overnight, the Rothschilds, Montefiores, de Hirsches et al took “Mr. Sam”, the crime czar of North America, and transformed him into a rising star of the Canadian Zionist movement.

             In the early modern period, a court Jew, or court factor (German: Hofjude, Hoffaktor), was a Jewish banker who handled the finances of, or lent money to, European royalty and nobility. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including in some cases being granted noble status. Court Jews were needed because prohibitions against usury applied to Christians but did not apply to Jews.

             Yes.  They were actually found guilty by the Court of Brussels.  Of course no one will arrest them.  No one has the power.  There were stories about the Indigenous and many of them were abused and died.  They found large graves.  Nuns were also guilty and involved.

               Our Mandate: (1) To lawfully prosecute those people and institutions responsible for the exploitation, trafficking, torture and murder of children, past and present, and (2) To stop these and other criminal actions by church and state, including by disestablishing those same institutions.

               LET IT BE KNOWN that the flesh and blood man JORGE MARIO BERGOGLIO, as the liable head fiduciary officer of the Vatican Incorporated and the Roman Catholic Church, has been duly convicted in a Common Law Court of Justice of Crimes against Humanity and Complicity in a Criminal Conspiracy, including the trafficking and death of children. (ICLCJ Case Docket No. 06182014-001, In the Matter of The People v. Bergoglio, Pachon, Welby et al, 18 July, 2014)
              </p>
              <p>
               ACCORDINGLY, an International Common Law Arrest Warrant has been issued for the immediate apprehension of BERGOGLIO as a convicted felon and a threat to the safety of children. This Warrant has been recognized by INTERPOL and by judicial and police agencies in Spain, America, Russia and Serbia.

              <p>
               SO, Fired without cause for exposing the death of Aboriginal Children and land theft by the United Church.  He is trying them in public but is unable to be able to personally arrest the criminals.  We have to remember how powerful these people are.

            One of them had a farm outside of Orangeviile in an area called Caledon Hills. Rumors about what went on there are speculative but as we are discovering, remote farms are ideal for ritual abuse and their sick ceremonies.

             Yes. They also love Harbour Island and go frequently. Clarissa Bronfman has a jewelry line with Hamza’s and evil eye pendants. Edgar and Clarissa have a few kids, two bat shit crazy girls who are late teens and a son who died apparently. Edgar has a few more from a previous marriage half black I believe. Big money but nutjob family in every sense of the word.
