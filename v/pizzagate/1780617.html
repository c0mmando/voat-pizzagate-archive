            A survey by WorldNetDaily of recent news reports found that rarely did the media describe priestly sexual abuse as “homosexual” or “gay” activity – even though the worst incidents involved male-to-male contact, and a spate of investigative reports has revealed that the Vatican is concerned about an upsurge of homosexuals in seminary schools throughout the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gay press promotes sex with children
           </p>
           <p>
            Baldwin says his research not only “confirms that homosexuals molest children at a rate vastly higher than heterosexuals,” but it found that “the mainstream homosexual culture” even “commonly promotes sex with children.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The editorial board of the leading pedophile academic journal, Paidika, is dominated by prominent homosexual scholars such as San Francisco State University professor John DeCecco, who happens to edit the Journal of Homosexuality,” Baldwin wrote.
           </p>
           <p>
            During his research, he also found:
           </p>
           <p>
            The Journal of Homosexuality recently published a special double-issue entitled, “Male Intergenerational Intimacy,” containing many articles portraying sex between men and minor boys as loving relationships. One article said parents should look upon the pedophile who loves their son “not as a rival or competitor, not as a theft of their property, but as a partner in the boy’s upbringing, someone to be welcomed into their home.” In 1995 the homosexual magazine “Guide” said, “We can be proud that the gay movement has been home to the few voices who have had the courage to say out loud that children are naturally sexual” and “deserve the right to sexual expression with whoever they choose. …” The article went on to say: “Instead of fearing being labeled pedophiles, we must proudly proclaim that sex is good, including children’s sexuality … we must do it for the children’s sake.” Larry Kramer, the founder of ACT-UP, a noted homosexual activist group, wrote in his book, “Report from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist”: “In those instances where children do have sex with their homosexual elders, be they teachers or anyone else, I submit that often, very often, the child desires the activity, and perhaps even solicits it.” In a study of advertisements in the influential homosexual newspaper, The Advocate, Reisman found ads for a “Penetrable Boy Doll … available in three provocative positions. She also found that the number of erotic boy images in each issue of The Advocate averaged 14. Homosexual newspapers and travel publications advertise prominently for countries where boy prostitution is heavy, such as Burma, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Homosexuality ‘youth-oriented’?
           </p>
           <p>
            “Research on the homosexual lifestyle confirms it is almost exclusively a youth-oriented culture,” Baldwin wrote. “Very few gays exhibit preference for older men.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Some admit to focus on teenage boys,” he said, “some on prepubescent boys, and many cross over between categories.”
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1988 study detailed in Baldwin’s report found that most pedophiles even consider themselves to be “gay.” According to the study, “Archives of Sexual Behavior,” some 86 percent of pedophiles described themselves as homosexual or bisexual. Also, the study found, the number of teenage male prostitutes who identify as homosexuals has risen from 10 percent to 60 percent in the past 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            When asked what he thought about critics who attempt to debunk his research, Baldwin said the results speak for themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            “For them to say this theory is false is to call many of the homosexual movement’s leaders liars,” he said. “Most of my evidence comes right from the gay community.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “I managed to find enough evidence that my thesis – child molestation is an integral part of the homosexual movement – is a valid thesis,” Baldwin told WorldNetDaily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other experts have also found a distinct pattern between child sex abusers and the incidence of homosexuality.
           </p>
           <p>
            “How long can psychologists be in denial about the significance of the dark side, and ignore what it implies about the homosexual condition? And there’s a matter of even greater concern. How long will psychologists eagerly throw open the door to gay life for every sexually confused teenager?” writes Joseph Nicolosi, Ph.D, on behalf of NARTH – the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality – a group that says it exists to “provide psychological understanding of the cause, treatment and behavior patterns associated with homosexuality, within the boundaries of a civil public dialogue.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The North American Man-Boy Love Association, or NAMBLA, is “a group that openly promotes sex with minor boys and claims that boy-lovers respond to the needs of the boys they love,” Baldwin said in his report.
           </p>
           <p>
            The group is often endorsed by “many of the homosexual movement’s most prominent leaders,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Advocacy moving to schools
           </p>
           <p>
            Promotion of the “gay and lesbian lifestyle” is increasing in the nation’s public schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            A WND survey of homosexual-oriented websites found that almost every group has some sort of program to “educate” teachers, school administrators and other school employees about the homosexual lifestyle:
           </p>
           <p>
            GLSEN – the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network – bills itself as “the largest national network of parents, students, educators and others” specifically formed to end “discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in K-12 schools. Two recent press released boasted of the Broward County (Fla.) school board approving GLSEN-sponsored “training for teachers.” A student activist working with GLSEN officials has managed to “give voice” recently to “gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered students” at California schools; PFLAG has created a national campaign called, “From Our House to the Schoolhouse,” distributing to school officials – among other materials – a booklet entitled, “Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth: A Primer For Principals, Educators, &amp; School Personnel. [Editor’s note: Readers need the Adobe PDF reader to open and read this file.] Though most school-related programs are sold to administrators and parents as programs designed simply to end persecution of homosexuals and lesbians, none disclose what Baldwin says is compelling evidence that homosexuality is harmful to children.
           </p>
           <p>
            “What … does the academic literature say about the relationship between homosexuality and child molestation? Quite a bit, actually,” he wrote, quoting data compiled by the Family Research Institute: “Scientific studies confirm a strong pedophilic predisposition among homosexuals.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The institute, after reviewing more than 19 studies and peer-reviewed reports in a 1985 “Psychological Reports” article, found that homosexuals account for between 25 and 40 percent of all child molestation.
           </p>
           <p>
            “But this number is low,” Baldwin says, “due to the fact that many reporters will not report if a child molester is a homosexual, even if he knows that to be the case.”
