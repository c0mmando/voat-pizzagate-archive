            Michael Bloomberg has a tunnel under his house in Manhattan that leads to another building nearby. Rumors from Bloomberg's NYPD detail say that the former mayor has a thing for "young asian males" and uses the tunnel to have secret trysts in the other building.

            No wonder Hillary went to NY,
            <strong>
             once JFK Jr was out of the way,
            </strong>
            she was a shoo in for the Senate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hi.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note from a New Yorker, that is a ridiculous theory that I never heard about before coming to this board. JFK Jr was rightly considered a lightweight and and threat to nobody's future.  He was not taking seriously as a politician and that's why he started his magazine.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was not even mentioned as Hillary's competition, another local politician was.
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/04/senate.2000/hrc.senate/">
             http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/04/senate.2000/hrc.senate/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And a bit of trivia, the politician that Hillary was running against was Rudy Giuliani who was saw that he was going to be defeated and in a spectacular political moment had a press conference with his mistress.  This was his way of announcing to his wife, he wanted a divorce. He said it was for health reasons, but he left the race because he was losing.  He also tried have the mistress come into the mayor's mansion while his wife still lived there.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's marital problems exploded yesterday in a public exchange with his wife, Donna Hanover. The mayor abruptly announced that he was seeking a separation from Ms. Hanover, and Ms. Hanover, caught unaware, then said that the couple's troubles began years ago because of a previous relationship between the mayor and a member of his staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             At an extraordinary, emotional news conference in Bryant Park, Mr. Giuliani also said that as he battles prostate cancer he will turn ''more now than maybe I did before'' to Judith Nathan, the woman he describes as a very good friend.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Giuliani did not say whether he would continue his campaign for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he did say that his political career was not his first concern. Speculation about other candidates raced through the city last night, reflecting Republican fears that Mr. Giuliani would withdraw.

             I think Bloomberg is a Rothschild U.S. agent. His claim to fame is the Bloomberg Terminal, created to be a private internet for global financial trading. You can only lease them for a large monthly fee. His Bloomberg News gets info from customers using his service. He then sells them that info. This system was used to rig LIBOR rates. Traders communicated over his system "chat." In my opinion, AN AUTIST TRADER was set up to take the fall (jail time) when they were exposed. After leaving the mayorship, Bloomberg built a large townhouse in THE CITY OF LONDON. He and Rothschild are on the board of Lady Di's "favorite" charity, THE SERPENTINE ART GALLERY. Marina Abramovic performed there.

             Libor trader Tom Hayes loses appeal but has jail sentence cut to 11 years

             "Tom Hayes, the former trader jailed for conspiracy to rig global Libor interest rates, has had his sentence cut to 11 years from 14, but failed to have his conviction overturned.
On Monday three senior court of appeal judges reduced the sentence, one of the longest prison terms on record for UK white collar crime, after considering factors such as Hayes’s age, lack of seniority and his ASPERGER'S SYNDROME diagnosis."

               It is a global connection for financial traders. They communicate through Bloomberg's chat feature. The government docs spell this out. That's how they were rigging LIBOR. Of course, the chat is only one feature. You must be renting a terminal to use it. Why don't traders just use the internet for their trades?

                  What Bloomberg is selling is real time access to financial data specifically pricing data , tons and tons of real time data.  You can find any price in any market with just a few clicks.   It's this data and the analysis of this that is why people pay $21,000 a year for a terminal for one desk. Before his company existing each Wall Street outfit used to spend figuring out this pricing data.  Fast Access to financial data and time saving analysis is what Bloomberg is selling and why is company became a standard.  It's not Internet access they are selling.  It's data and speed and security which is why they are a private network.  You want to find out what government security prices are in the Hong Kong Market and what the trends look like? 
It's less than 10 keystrokes.

                  Bloomberg saw  early on how computers could help traders and like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, back in the 1980s he built a company that would change the world.....in his case it was a much smaller world, but they were will to pay more.  Other companies like Dow Jones sold financial information, but they didn't put it all together like Bloomberg did and it revolutionized the market. It also has a customized keyboard that allows you to bring up this info very fast.

It is everything the Internet is not: well organized, fast, and filled with help screens and responsive customer service.

                  Chat and communications are so useful because Bloomberg has such a devoted user base. The most important 300,000 financial folks in the world are going to be at their terminals whenever their markets are open.    Since traders are already on their terminal, it's useful to do all in the Bloomberg service without going to another tool.  This is why Bloomberg News exists. Get your news in your desk in the same application you use all day. They have kept updating their service with more and more functionality.  All in the same windows. Want to see where all cargo ships are in the world right now? You can do that.  Want to see every oil pipeline in the world?  They have that mapped.  Want to use Chat to fix prices in the Gas and Oil Markets?  Better off using Yahoo messenger, for some reason gas and oil folks never took to Bloomberg messaging.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There's alternatives to Bloomberg as well.  Thompson Reuters has Eikon, they are like 1800 a month.  So Wall Street obvious thinks these service go way beyond internet access.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  After some Bloomberg chat logs leaked, Goldman Sachs and other banks went out and bought a chat company just to do secure chats.  In response Bloomberg has unbundled chat and offered it at a cheaper price.

                   LIBOR WAS fixed via Bloomberg Terminal chat feature. One poor AUTIST fall guy is serving 11 YEARS for the crime. Bloomberg has access to all info that passes through his CLOSED system.
 HSBC goons served NO TIME for Mexican drug cartel money laundering.

                       "Chat and communications are so useful because Bloomberg has such a devoted user base. The most important 300,000 financial folks in the world are going to be at their terminals whenever their markets are open. Since traders are already on their terminal, it's useful to do all in the Bloomberg service without going to another tool. This is why Bloomberg News exists. Get your news in your desk in the same application you use all day. They have kept updating their service with more and more functionality. All in the same windows. Want to see where all cargo ships are in the world right now? You can do that. Want to see every oil pipeline in the world? They have that mapped. "

                The Foster Care program as we know tries to find homes, this adoptions.  For each adoption they are paid a fee.  Think about the incentive and the total.  It's really disgusting.  The Sale of Children. There is no punishment horrid enough for these people.

                  The 3 Musketeers.  Cuomo Bloomers, and DeBlasio.  I think they are working hand in hand to keep things running smooth.  DeBlasio is hiding something for sure.  I think he may be using his wife as a cover (although her being a former lesbian is crazy enough).  How can you be gay and then not? Abracadabra!!!  I have not figured that one out yet.
