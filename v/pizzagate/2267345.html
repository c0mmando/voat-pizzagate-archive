For Normies it\'s a hard pill to swallow, that the US government could be involved in weapons/drugs/child trafficking.
But the movie &quot;AmericanMade&quot; -2017 with Tom Cruise is a good start.
I was going to make a thread on how great of a <strong>REDPILL</strong> this movie is for normies, but I found something odd.... Hold on,...first let\'s talk about </p>
<p>that movie and the story of Barry Seal.</p>
<p>For people that do NOT know the connections of the <strong>CIA to international smuggling</strong>, this movie is a really good starter.
This all ties back to the &quot;iran-contra&quot; affair, the medilin cartell, the contras, clinton and bush.
The movie seems <sub>&gt;
</sub>to be quiet accurate on most parts, but of course it\'s not a doku either.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think this hole case around Barry Seal is too Big to discuss here now, since google will hit you with a storm of info if you wanna know more.
But in one sentence:
Barry Seal was one of the biggest players in drug-trafficking in the past. For the CIA he was bringing weapons to the Contras ,and for the medilin </p>
<p>cartell, he was smuggling drugs on the way back. Later he heavily expanded and even got his own airport where the CIA trained militants to fight for </p>
<p>their cause. He hired several other pilots and even had and military grade transport plane at the end,a Fairchild C-123, because he could not keep up </p>
<p>with the high demand of all sides. He had so much money he did not know where to put it. Banks, Boxes; Bags,...the soil in his garden was in big </p>
<p>parts made of paper...lol.
And all the players knew exactly what was going on.
There is tons more, but long story short: Right before he was to testify in front of a grand jury, he got brutally killed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just for starters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The real-life Seal seems to have joined up with the CIA much earlier. The late investigative journalist Alexander Cockburn contended that &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Barry)Seal first came into contact with the CIA in the ’60s as a special forces helicopter pilot in Vietnam and maintained links with them &gt;throughout </p>
<p>his TWA years. Other accounts suggest his links might have gone back as far as the Bay of Pigs. Moreover, although the film &gt;suggests Seal was just </p>
<p>an excitement-loving pilot who got swept up into espionage at the time, eight years earlier he had been attempting to &gt;fly 1,350 pounds of plastic </p>
<p>explosives to some anti-Castro Cubans based in Mexico when he was arrested by the U.S. Customs Service. And &gt;far from resigning from TWA in </p>
<p>1978 to pursue this new, more exciting career in spying, he was fired in 1974 for falsely claiming medical leave &gt;when actually he was absent due to </p>
<p>weapons trafficking. He escaped prosecution only because the CIA intervened, stating a trial would &gt;threaten national security.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Needless to say, such a scene would have been highly controversial, considering Bill Clinton\'s involvement in the affair has never been &gt;proven. </p>

<p>The movie balanced the political scales, however, as the original script also implicated the complicity of George H.W. Bush, then Vice &gt;President, in a </p>

<p>NOW some weird stuff:
As watching the movie I thought to myself:&quot; Damn that dude looks like Stephen Paddock and behaves like him/his brother!
This William Cooper is supposed to be dead quiet long.
I just wanna check where they both lived. My intuition always leads me to this strange things.</p>
<p>link to screenshot from movie:
<a href="https://ibb.co/mgi3eb">William J.Cooper in the movie: -jpg</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>William J.Cooper:</h2>
<p>He was one of the pilots that got hired by Barry Seal. Of course he made a fortune as well.</p>
<h4>Article from 1986!</h4>
<h4>http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-10/news/mn-5214_1_air-america</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In Reno, where Cooper has lived off and on since 1949, a friend displayed a 1973 newsletter distributed to Air America employees that had a </p>
<p>photograph of Cooper in uniform and identified him as the head of a training program for the Laotian air force.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>RENO.</h4>
<hr />
<h2>Stephen Paddock:</h2>
<p>We all know the story of Stephen Paddock until now, which was also a pilot, which amounted an immense fortune for him and his family,...with </p>
<p>ähm...video poker. Wasn\'t he also suspected to be involved in child/drug/weapons smuggling for the Deep State?
Ok lets check where he lived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paddock lived in Mesquite for several years with his Filipino-born girlfriend whom he met at the Atlantis in Reno, Nevada.[36] According to </p>
<p>neighbors, they also lived together in <strong>Reno</strong>.[34] Many Mesquite residents recalled only seeing him around town; those familiar with Paddock </p>
<p>described him as someone who did not speak much and kept a low profile.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really Reno?? what where the odds? While watching the movie I did not know these 2 cases where geographical that close, but the same fucking </p>
<p>small city?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reno,_Nevada">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Reno,_Nevada</a></p>

<li>2000 – Population: 180,480.</li>
<li>2010 – Population: 225,221</li>
</ul>
<p>I really suspect that paddock and/or his family was somehow involved in that shit.
At first everybody suspected that Paddock was a arms dealer working for the FBI, but I think it\'s clearly CIA. Just google both.
The FBI is only used to cover up for the big boys.</p>

For Normies it's a hard pill to swallow, that the US government could be involved in weapons/drugs/child trafficking.
But the movie "AmericanMade" -2017 with Tom Cruise is a good start.
I was going to make a thread on how great of a

This all ties back to the "iran-contra" affair, the medilin cartell, the contras, clinton and bush.

           I really suspect that paddock and/or his family was somehow involved in that shit.
At first everybody suspected that Paddock was a arms dealer working for the FBI, but I think it's clearly CIA. Just google both.
The FBI is only used to cover up for the big boys.

            Paddock is one of many mind controlled 'assets' that the NWO keeps...
           </p>
           <p>
            It does appear he was a drug trafficker. The story never made sense about how someone could afford to gamble so much but keep coming back... without another source of income. As rich as he was from working a legit job before retiring, he didn't make THAT much.
So what was Paddock doing for them? Running drugs and then laundering money (incl. proceeds) in the Vegas casinos. They plan it from A to Z. Paddock just did what they told him to do.
Anyone can tell you that what Paddock did takes years of planning. Most of the conspiracy FUD is crap. The reality is he was most likely programmed to carry out the shooting at a certain point in time. He mind just carried out the programming. Many of the famous shootings are to destroy targets, and to further gun confiscation. It's amazing how much is done through their mind control ops. Target might not always get hit, but they know and revel in the knowledge that hundreds if not thousands of victims will need psychological help and likely be pushed towards prescription drugs. Furthers their destructive agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know more than most, there's more like him unfortunately. This country is always kept on its toes and made to be reactive to these timed terrors.

             I think it could have been a weapons deal combined with an attempted Saudi assassination attempt, something went wrong, possible distraction, resulting in extracting of high level saudi targets. The internal "official" explanation is that the CIA fucked up, and the FBI must cover for them because of "national security" reasons.

              I think that falls under FUD, Tetr4. 
The only connection I've hear that could make sense is the possible ownership of the top two floors by Saudi billionaire Bin Al-waleed.... Now for anything showing hard evidence of this ownership ... I haven't see it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do know some Saudi's had big ownership stakes in the Four Seasons, which is special section of the Mandalay Bay Hotel... but it is not the top two floors in the tower... its a separate building.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sorry but all this CIA and FBI explanation doesn't make sense.... it always seems to be shilling for covering up for the real perps. Sorry, but CIA and FBI do not carry out anything remotely like this that even has a change of going wrong like this .... and the fact this was intentional murder of hundreds of civilians (what kind of civilians? Mostly white and country culture (Christian)).

             I have said many times on here that eventually Paddock took the place of Barry Seal. When that exactly happened I don't know the exact year, but slowly he took over, and probably after Seal's death. and YES I strongly believe his father was DB Cooper. Whenever I think about Mena I just can't get those two boys out of my mind. Killed and then Thrown on the RR Tracks.
