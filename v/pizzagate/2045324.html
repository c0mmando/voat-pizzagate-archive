            This is everything I need to know about Mueller. This is the key.
The 9/11 Commission Investigation was a complete farce run by Robert Mueller, the same person who ran the investigation on the BCCI scandal, the Iran-Contra criminal investigation, and the Noriega-CIA drug investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Commissioners of the Investigation of 9/11 followed no leads, investigated no banks or brokers, and the case was closed without looking at any evidence, with 28 pages of sealed testimony by Bush and Cheney remaining secret.

            So, I guess this means that they found nothing on the supposed collusion between Trump's campaign and muh Russia, and are now desperately looking into every crack and crevice?

            Fucking ridiculous! Excuse my language but this russian narrative has gone beyond fucking ridiculous . for several reasons anf im sick of hearing about it and i do so believe if they had something on trump the obama adminustration would of found in while illegaling wiring Trump Towers and they did it. They are. Scrambling so hard to find something they are desperat to get us americans off the pedo trail they want trump impeached and one of their pedo puppeteers filling the swamp. Trump is going to drain the swamp with the help of gods army and everyone here is part of gods army and we will not stop till they are all exposed and all evil is behind bars.

            can Trump be impeached for prior crimes (if they find any?) and isn't there a statue of limitations? how far back do they go? I'd think that if there really was prosecutable evidence against Trump this would have come out during the  campaign.  If Trump is a total criminal (like anyone else including comey, lynch, clintons), he should be held accountable but to go decades back will only come across as a witch hunt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, the Elizabeth Carlisle email to Comey's advisor regarding the talking points of the tarmac mtg is prima facie evidence of collusion and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

             They have nothing. From Wikileaks, in one of the reports going around (had them for every candidate): "trump - not political, authentic (not tps), independent (money), crazy things are for show. Character is the biggest consideration."
I'd provide a link to it, but it's not on Wikileaks anymore. As you (hopefully) know, they've been scrubbing over there. But I have the quote saved back from November. Anyway, if they had anything they would have brought it up then in their report on him. But that raving endorsement is all they had (have).

             getting impeached itself is easy enough, they just need votes, i.e. clinton got impeached for diddling his secretary. The important question is whether or not they can remove him from office, and "sold a condo to a russia mobster 10 years ago" isn't very compelling

               no, the background checks you get from real estate just check if you're good for the money as a private businessman trump had no reason or need to know if any of his customers were russian mobsters or oligarchs and even if he did know there's no particular reason he should care, if trump owns the real estate whether it's in russia or florida he can legally sell it to anyone who can pay him and isn't obligated to know anything about who they are or what they do with it. They're just trying to tie him to russians i.e. some russian mobster or member of the russian government bought a condo from him and was a good customer so they met once and trump shook his hand or some shit = conspiracy! money laundering! collusion! they have blackmail on him! etc. it's mostly a political smear unless he coordinated directly with the kremlin or someone they funded it's not collusion and even then if they just gave his campaign information that's not illegal in of itself but there's no evidence of any of that yet so far as I've seen

                I don't think this is true.  High end real estate transactions have to be done in accordance with the anti-money laundering conditions of the Bank Secrecy Act which would require you to understand if the transaction involved money from illegal activity.

                 the laws also differ in russia, but regardless the overarching point here is:
                 <strong>
                  what does this have to do with the 2016 election?
                 </strong>
                 if trump laundered money in the last 10 or 20 years and russians were involved,
                 <strong>
                  so what?

                Infringing on Trumps right to sell his property seems to me a violation of commerce laws, but I'm not a lawyer. the desperation to pin shit on Trump just makes them seem even more crazy than Trump ever could be. Even msnbc is going to have a tough time selling this "crime" to the brainwashed mainstream

                 it's also not his responsibility who his customers are or what they do; i.e. if a serial killer went into a deli and got a sandwich did they deli worker who made the sandwich do anything wrong? it doesn't matter if trump sold condos or property to russian mobsters or oligarchs because stopping their criminal or otherwise activities is someone elses responsibily; i.e. theoretically say trump sold a US property to a member of the russian government and they used it for espionage it's the intelligence agencies and law enforcement who didn't stop it as long as their money was good trump as a private businessman doesn't have to know or care. It's similar to their nonsense about holding gun shops responsible for gun crime

              thats what Rubenstein said yesterday. "the investigation is limited and anything beyond Russia hacking needs his approval".

              Its pretty fucked up when you have multiple investigations of investigations.

               Actually I don't think this is what Rosenstein said.  I think there is a distinction between crimes that are uncovered organically and crimes which are tangential and thus would require an investigation to start.  Rosenstein emphasized no "fishing expeditions" and he didn't define Mueller's scope.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, if say, Paul Manafort confessed he colluded with Russia in this election AND confessed that he is guilty of money laundering.  Mueller could prosecute both.  There would be no need to move the money laundering to a different investigation.  This is did not come about as part of a fishing expedition, it was a crime confessed to during the investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's how LawNewz reported it
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said on Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller can investigate whatever crime he uncovers as part of the Russia probe. The thing is, Mueller has to check in with him first.
               </p>
               <p>
                “The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice and we don’t engage in fishing expeditions,” he told Fox News host Chris Wallace. “Bob Mueller understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation, and so no, it’s not a fishing expedition.”
               </p>
               <p>
                He said that Mueller needs to ask for permission before expanding the probe beyond its initial scope if investigators discover a crime outside the parameters.
               </p>
               <p>
                “If it’s something outside that scope, he needs to come to the Acting Attorney General–at this time, me–for permission to expand his investigation,” he told Fox News host Chris Wallace.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rosenstein did not specify in detail what that scope was.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               So I think Rosenstein was being very careful with his words.
