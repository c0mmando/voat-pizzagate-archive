            To promote the transhumanism agenda.  So how much did Facespook pay this a-hole to promote this crap?

            What is the Oculus Rift?
           </p>
           <p>
            Invented by a VR enthusiast named Palmer Luckey, the Oculus Rift is a set of virtual-reality goggles that will work with your gaming desktop or laptop. After he debuting a prototype at the E3 gaming convention in 2012, Luckey founded Irvine, Calif.-based Oculus VR with Brendan Iribe, who became CEO. The two launched a Kickstarter project in August 2012 to sell prototype developer versions of the Oculus Rift, raising $2.4 million. Since that auspicious launch, Luckey and crew went to work refining the HMD, releasing several prototypes including Development Kit 2 (DK2), Crystal Cove and Crescent Bay.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              On Mar. 25, 2014, Oculus VR was purchased by social networking giant Facebook for a combined $2 billion dollars. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the headset "has the chance to create the most social platform ever," though we don't know how exactly the website will utilize the Oculus Rift.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            In an interview with Polygon, Luckey said that Oculus VR will continue to operate in its Irvine headquarters, and will use Facebook's backing to create a better, more affordable product."

            The convergence of technologies such as virtual reality, haptic feedback and wireless connectivity raises the prospect of virtual sexual assault, two noted futurologists have warned.
           </p>
           <p>
            These new forms of violation could arise by combining emerging devices, such as suits that provide wearers with physical sensations through haptic feedback, with existing virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift.
           </p>
           <pre><code>What is transhumanism?

Transhumanism is a movement that aims to use technology to enhance human intellectual, physical and psychological capabilities. This can be achieved through anything from brain implants and bionic eyes to stem cell technology and exoskeleton body suits.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            "If you have a haptic suit on, and someone tapped into it and made you do things you didn't want to do, I would consider that a violation and probably equivalent to assault," Zoltan Istvan, author and 2016 US presidential candidate for the Transhumanist Party, told Australian publication Vertigo.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is one of the very strange issues with transhumanism.

             actually there was a lawsuit with zenimax and the actual sale price was well over 3 billion. they have judgement of over 500m against them. Palmer is a trump supporter and funded a meme campaign of over 1 million dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             They stole most of the tech involved from zenimax and valve and created the rift. the vive is a superior product. But with farcebook involved the rift is a scary product. It has infrared cameras that can be hacked. Used for room scale. With eye tracking farcebook will be able to gauge your response to advertising and everything else. They will then sell that. What you sign on for but the downsides and particular farcebook yikes.
