            , "proves" is probably the wrong word in this headline. MF will likely take this down for Rule 3. You may want to pre-emptively remove and repost with a better headline.

              I don't believe it legally counts (a lawyer or social worker would know) but I'm sure most of us would agree in common understanding that it does. Something that came to my mind was years ago when Larry Flint's daughter I think...sued him? Maybe just publicly complained? that she had been abused growing up simply by being around massive amounts of pornography. THAT was an easily arguable point, and maybe a social precedent with this type of thing. At least I thought so.

            I can't believe people actually believe the gossip posted at CDAN when the guy who runs the website has this disclaimer on his page:

            "CRAZY DAYS AND NIGHTS IS A GOSSIP SITE.

             The gossip I'm quoting is from Hmmm, and attributed to Robert Downey Jr.  He has never publicly denied nor tried to sue any of the many publications re-posting Blinds that were originally posted under his name. Likely much of the info was contributed to by a few very close friends who were children of old Hollywood stars and grew up in the same environment as RDJ.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact at one point RDJ made a list of stars he personally thought were "good people."  Every single one on this list worked with Robert Downey Jr in one of his films. Few in Hollywood would have praised Mel Gibson at that particular time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I personally know of Blinds that were published by CDAN which were much later confirmed as very accurate by Gossip Cop. Obviously star's PR teams often are requesting a Blind be posted and directly providing the info.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition it's very clear celebs are using the fact that not 100% of CDAN Blinds may be completely true to post info that they want exposed but know the subject matter may have repercussions upon their career. For example Justin Bieber's "friend" revealed he left a planned concert tour because he did not want to take part in all of the sickening rituals required of him. The "friend" made it pretty clear what was involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gossip Cop, according to Bieber's management, called out the "friend" as "a fake," and CDAN's particular Blind, "a total lie." Coincidental that the pressure on Bieber for trying to out pedogate and "old religion rituals" was getting threatening in nature?
            </p>
            <p>
             IMHO very savvy move on Bieber's part. One can always call CDAN Blinds "totally made up. "

            1 - Apparently Hollywood royalty _____________________ (Aging just about permanent A list mostly movie actress who is an Academy Award winner/nominee) thinks it is not only okay for a woman to molest her tween stepson, but she thinks that is what an empowered woman does. This is why our actress (without noticing how far up her own ass her head is) decided to make a movie paying tribute to that woman who is an Old Hollywood A lister who was an Academy Award winner/nominee. She notoriously raped her own tween stepson, the son of a famous director. The director reportedly caught them in bed together and divorced the actress. The director has been attacked for years due to his relationship with a teenage actress who was murdered in her later years.  However, neither the director nor the teenage actress were related to each other. Family friends of our Old Hollywood actress and the director said the actress kept her stepson "groomed" and tending to her every whim during their time together. The world would collectively castrate any actor who did such a thing to his tween stepdaughter, but apparently that is romantic if it is a woman.

            2 - In the next few days, this studio will have a public announcement made relative to them that the corporation swallowing them up will be stalled. The government will announce they are suing to block the deal. The studio's stock price will drop like a rock and a lot of investors and partners, both Russian and Arab, will lose a lot.
           </h1>

            Behind the scenes, this politician is making good on his threats - that I told you about last month -  that unless this network bends to his will? He will block the takeover deal, which will allow congressional hearings - and politicians will go crazy grilling the studio and the corporation over their Hollywood abuse culture. It's the last thing the studio or corporation need now.

            The studio head is already putting out feelers for a new job and told one Hollywood super agent (has a famous offspring) he'd take a job in Silicon Valley to escape the pressure. Meanwhile, that friend/"employee" of the politician was told that if he has to resign his post due to overseas entanglements, he's got the politician's blessing to form a consortium to take over the studio for himself. That is, of course, unless the corporation decides to cave in to the politician and become his personal "kneepads network" like this other network.

             It's interesting to see the reader comment speculation.

             The second part, about the studio, doesn't relate to the post, really.
