            I've avoided saying this all along, but...I think those are anal beads, child size. Even the color yellow was pointed out as code for anal. You know how they're used. Another sick way to sexualize AND control a child. And you get an adult (if they survive) that suffers forever and finds no peace.

            By support womens health issues? Do you mean kill even more babies before they are born than they already do?  Do your research on 'Planned Parenthood' it does not have anything to do with womens health issues, just the killing of babies and the selling of their body parts. 
Please take the time to watch and educate yourself :)

            Long time lurker first time poster.  I found a few interesting connections that reference chickens in the context of children.  A few weeks ago I was reading through a thread on a Philly pizza place called Pizza Brain.  Here is a link to the thread in case you have never heard of it:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1562506">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1562506
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I stumbled on an instagram account of an ex-employee who opened up their own place called Pizza Gutt.  Like all of these pizza nut jobs, Daniel Guttter (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Pizza_Gutt">
             @Pizza_Gutt
            </a>
            ) has a lot of weird stuff on his account.  For instance:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/b9ccL">
             http://archive.is/b9ccL
            </a>
            Somebody commented "brephophagist".  Google that if you've never heard of it before (I hadn't).  I am a pretty sarcastic person with and can cross the line of appropriateness from time to time, but I don't think I'd call somebody a baby eater as a joke.  But that's just me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gutter owns a bunch of chickens, and has a few odd pictures like this one:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/cyWsw">
             http://archive.is/cyWsw
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He has multiple pictures like this one with the hashtag #moistboys:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/Aoiu8">
             http://archive.is/Aoiu8
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now moistboys could just be referencing that they like to smoke a lot of pot, or it could be a reference to a band, like the comment about Dean Ween is referring to in the previous picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this comment led me to do some research on Dean Ween.  Dean Ween (not his real name) is a part of Ween, a somewhat well known alternative rock band from New Hope Pennsylvania.  They have done many different projects under many different names, one of them being Moistboyz.  Now there is a ton of digging you can do on Ween and Moistboyz, but the first song that caught my eye, and the one that is relevent is called "Chickendick".
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YZzz9U5Q_Q">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YZzz9U5Q_Q
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another song by Moistboyz called "Roy" starts off referencing "chicken" in the first line.  The song is about a pedophile named Roy.  Here is a link to the video and another to the lyrics.

            That's it for chicken references but there is a really creepy song by Ween about Cheese Pizza that is very sexual.  Apparently the original song was made for Pizza Hut for a commercial but Pizza Hut didn't like it so Ween made this unedited version.

            Sorry if this isn't relevant to this thread, I just found all of the connections a little weird.  I also think this helps validate the term "chicken" as a term used by pedophiles to describe children.  I have some more stuff on Pizza Gutt and Ween but it's not chicken related.  Let me know if you'd like me to post it.

            Good find OP. Not that I had any doubt about the original meaning, but having official and academic sources to cite definitely makes it a more convincing argument.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would recommend someone with photoshop skills showing a screen shot that #ChickenLovers instagram image, along with a screen shot of this page and paragraph ( also citing the title, page number, and year of the book). It is a much stronger argument than citing Urban Dictionary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading this new source is a painful reminder that these sick fucks aren't in jail. Knowing that Scott Cummings is a free man makes my blood boil and my heart hurt. Just thinking of that picture of Scott Cummings holding his daughter close, and then, for no reason, hashtagging the word "chickenlovers" on it... it makes me so damn sick.

             Wow. I didn't make the connection until I read this. That statement by Hillary (correct me if I'm wrong) is horrifying. She's aware of these word's meanings just as much as she's aware of Molech's prefered type of sacrafice. Scary.

            I remember Chicken Lovers being referenced in a very old episode of south park. While they used the term literally, I cannot help but feel the shocking parallels between the parody and this.

            <p>
             The meaning of this hashtag is no longer questionable but certain. 'Chicken lovers' is undoubtedly a phrase used in pedophile code.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The second sentence is true.  But the first sentence is not.  Certain?  Even if we agree on the definition of the word used, there's too much room for nuance, ambiguity and double meanings in language.
           </p>
           <p>
            When code is used over and over, it's basically slang.  Chickenhawk to mean is not a coded word, but a slang street term for a pedophile.  I never heard chickenlovers before this, but I heard chicken and chickenhawk as known slang.
           </p>
           <p>
            But a big question for this whole investigation is just because other people are using regular words as code, does that mean everyone is using those words as code.    (I don't think chickenhawk would be regular words, but pizza and pasta and cheese surely are.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now is Alefantis using #chickenlovers this way?  Quite possibly.   Does mean he is using it this way?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             James Alefantis and his buddies are pedophiles using code in public, arrogantly communicating their sick lifestyle.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I don't see that as certain.   I see this much like the guy calling his brother his favorite pedo. Sick humor used to undercut a tender moment.

             The words were originally slang, yeah, but given the current circumstances, they're being referred to as codewords. They're certainly being used with an assumption of the public's ignorance because no actual pedophile would so brazenly publicize their illness. Though some may believe this usage to be brazen, I personally don't. Before Pizzagate, the lives of Alefantis &amp; Friends were not under anyone's microscope. They basically shared their secrets openly with friends of the same persuasion in ways that only they would understand. No one was provoked by these hashtags before Pizzagate because only those near Alefantis saw his Instagram posts. Slang or code, it means what it means and what it means is pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT: Don't forget: James Alefantis is a homosexual. He's, I'm sure, well aware of these words and their meanings. A gay man would never mistakenly or unknowingly use a word used so prevelantly within gay culture. Perhaps his use of the word 'chickenlovers' wasn't intended as code. Either way, he used a word that I'm sure he's aware of and we caught on, ultimately exposing the true meaning.

            If you search the archives of the Chicago Tribune and watch the documentary "Boys for Sale," you'll see that Chicken Lover has been slang for gay men who go after little boys for decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            I worked with a bunch of gay guys back in the 80's and through them I found out what a Chicken Hawk was. It's a real thing.

            The paragraph above the chicken references (page16) talks about a 1970's pedo network with 300,000 boys and a high school football coach taking nude photos. "...NBC Journalist Robin Lloyd published For Money or Love: Boy Prostitution in America, in which he claimed that a huge network of prostitution involving 300,000 boys exisited (1976:226). Lloyd wrote the book after his teenage sons were picked up on vacation by a man who brought them to his home and took nude photographs of them. When Lloyd tracked the man down he discovered that he was a school football coach and had taken similar photographs of a number of other boys. This got Lloyd thinking about the extent to which his sons' experience was an isolated one..."

             Taxi Driver used Chicken in 1975. So I'm sure it goes back before then.

             can you do a screen shot and make it an OP? Its great evidence and should be featured. More evidence proving that the code is more than circumstantial will enrage the shills.

              I don't really want to feature that link in an OP quite yet until I can figure out a decent way to back the page up offline. The Chicago Tribune is running the archive page for free right now but they are planning on putting it behind a paywall. If we flood the site with visits it might make the site go pay wall early and fuck our access to the archives.
             </p>
             <p>
              The CT has a cheeky way of posting the news articles, and archive.is can't back the page up properly. I din't know of another way to copy the articles in their entirety quite yet.

                Problem is, the whole page is a gold mine. Take a look at the other articles on there. A screen shot would't get the resolution to get everything of value. I'm going to see if maybe I can print the page to pdf tomorrow.

              Check out news stories about "the boy with the henna tattoo". Those sick fucks were raping a baby they abducted and took a pic of him with a baby chicken. It's another validation of the code. I din't think there is any question any longer of the use of the word "chickens", but we need to find old sources for the use of "cheese pizza". The earliest I've seen only goes back to about 2006-2007.

               The first and only place I've ever seen the codeword 'cheese pizza' used is 4chan. I think the whole pizza/food code is something relatively new. It could even be the creation of Podesta &amp; Friends themselves as I've yet to see it's use anywhere outside of what Pizzagate has discovered.

                That would virtually destroy the investigation, because the whole thing is built on noticing known code.

                 Well, I don't frequent sites where people would be engaged in heavy usage of pedophile code (with the exception of 4chan but I rarely even go there now) so I'm unaware of the codes actual frequency of use. But regardless, if Podesta &amp; Friends were using a totally original code, it would only stall investigation for so long and once people made the connections, the resulting evidence would justify it, as it has.

                There was a thread someone posted here or on reddit where they sourced the term to around 2007 and not on 4chan. It was some kind of pedo chat board. I'm wondering if it dates back earlier to possibly usenet threads in the 90's? Not sure how we could research that though.

            In the movie Prisoners (again with Hugh Jackman, he must like this sort of thing if he attends MA dinners and plays Pan lol) here's the IMDB description:
           </p>
           <p>
            When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the movie Gyllenhaal plays the cop who is looking for the girls and what does he call on of the main suspects? A fucking ChickenHawk!!

               This is a problem. Hillary supporters are where Bush supporters were at 9/11. Do you think for a minute if they (or anyone) really got the truth they would be okay with mass peodphila/blackmail/corruption? Many of them were Bernie supporters who are letting the MSM drive the Trump=Hitler train through their brains. Trump, to his discredit isn't really helping. He could win them over in a heartbeat if he advocated for equal pay and supported women's health care, not much to ask for really.
