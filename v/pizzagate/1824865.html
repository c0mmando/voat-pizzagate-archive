<p>This is related to pizzagate as the article questions DCF\'s decision to close the investigation without visiting the home, even that there were marks of physical abuse in the boy\'s body. If DCF is unable or unwilling to address police to access homes of children in the CHILD-ABUSE registry, they are probably unable/unwilling to help those children threatened by sexual abuse as well. This is a political and practical issue well proven in the article, and the same issue might prevent/block investigations related to child sex.</p>

            The result of long term abuse and neglect.  This story is so sad that I had to read between the lines.  When will we learn to teach parenting classes to our children in high school or even before?  I am not saying that would made a difference here, but it is also a good way to even help brothers and sisters know how to deal with siblings or help at home.  It is a good thing for all to know.  It would cut down on work for the agencies as well.  Some people never will learn but so many could if we give them a leg up early on.  When will we learn to help people before they go off the deep end?
