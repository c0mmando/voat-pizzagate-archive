<p>WASHINGTON, DC – As reported by Courthouse News Service, Federal prosecutors announced charges this Tuesday against four men connected to the law firm “Mossack Fonseca”, which has extensive ties with the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>The charges, which include Conspiracy to Defraud the United States,  Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Conspiracy to Commit Tax Evasion, Wire Fraud, and Money Laundering Conspiracy, come merely three years after the leak of the Panama Papers by the ICIJ, and pushed heavily by Wikileaks. The papers were received by the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung in 2015 from an anonymous source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton Foundation-connected associates which are related to Mossack Fonseca include Gabrielle Fialkoff, finance director for Hillary Clinton’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate; Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining magnate who has traveled the globe with Bill Clinton; a member of the Chagoury family, which pledged $1 billion in projects to the Clinton Global Initiative; and Chinese billionaire Ng Lap Seng, who was at the center of a Democratic fund-raising scandal when Bill Clinton was president. Also using the Panamanian law firm was the company founded by the late billionaire investor Marc Rich, an international fugitive when Bill Clinton pardoned him in the final hours of his presidency.</p>

            what a fucking load of bullshit. don't fall for this limited hangout from crooked DOJ. they aren't finally busting MossFon, no, they are running cover to prevent the rest of the offshore bread crumb icebergs from surfacing.

            Benczkowski is just another Illuminati puppet on the Clinton Crime Cartel payroll obeying orders from his master Moloch. Benczkowski won't do shit to really dig into the MossFon leaks and put a bullet in the real baddies--the super elite globalists who are sucking and embezzling trillions out of out economy and into their pockets in the shadow economy using fake and tax dodging illegal offshore shell front corps in Panama and Bermuda and Cayman and all over the Caribbean.

             While Feldman was having innocent fun with Jackson, the scene was different at a soda pop nightclub in Los Angeles frequented by Drew Barrymore, Ricky Schroder, Christina Applegate and, of course, the two Coreys. Feldman doesn’t name the club (note, it was Alphy's Soda Pop Club).
            </p>
            <p>
             Feldman and Haim’s girlfriend at the time, actress Alyssa Milano (above, as the butterfly), co-hosted the first party. One night, passed out at the home of one of the club’s proprietors, Feldman writes that he woke to find the man “on me.” “I pulled up my pants and ran ... back to my dad’s apartment, and cried for the rest of the night,” Feldman writes. He said that it took time for him to realise “that many of the people I had surrounded myself with were monsters.” (nydailynews.com)
            </p>
            <p>
             It was through Alphy's, that many of the teen stars eventually ended up 'strung-out' on drugs. We can only speculate as to whether sexual abuse occurred there, but it is a possibility (very likely) and one that I'm not discounting. Feldman says that his first date with Drew Barrymore was arranged by her mother (who was also Barrymore's manager at the time) when Barrymore was 10 and Feldman was 14, Feldman was told that Barrymore had a huge crush on him. Feldman and Barrymore later briefly dated for real in 1989, when she was in her mid-teens. He says that at the time, he was heavily into drugs and she was trying to stay sober after multiple stints in rehab.

             You need to be asking yourself, why are all of these kids, supposedly with the world at their feet and with the envy of their peers, are such total and utter 'drugged out/sexually deviant' screw ups?

            Interesting comment about HRC, Putin, Iran, and the war in Syria:

            <p>
             Got a feeling this is where it ALLLL started. My take: Podesta worked the uranium deal for the Clintons/NWO. Clintons hoped the Uranium would keep Russia happy and out of Syria, thus letting the them (Saudis/Clintons/NWO) control the pipeline. Iran was given the ((hush money)) to keep their nose out of the pipeline deal.

             I have maintained, since the beginning, that these issues were the most damning because they are proof of treason, misprision of treason and Voorhees Act violations. This email, combined with the Offshore Leaks is clear evidence that every American can look at and justify putting Hillary Clinton and John Podesta in jail.

Mossack studied to become a lawyer at a small private Catholic university in Panama. In his practice, he became an expert in maritime law. By the early twentieth century, Panama began to offer itself as a place to register foreign ships. With the Panamanian flag on their vessels, shipowners could avoid taxation and circumvent regulations such as labor protections and boat safety standards that their native countries demanded. The extractive industries (petroleum, minerals, precious metals) were first to discover these benefits, with Standard Oil registering its fleet of tankers in Panama in 1919.
            </p>
            <p>
             In those early days, Ramón Fonseca, a recent law graduate himself, stopped by to wish him luck.
            </p>
            <p>
             Born in 1952, Ramón Enrique Fonseca Mora, known to childhood friends as “Yike” (pronounced YEE-kay, short for Enrique), is the grandson of Costa Rica’s first ambassador to Panama on his father’s side and a dentist-turned-insurrectionist on his mother’s.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1931, Mora, revolver in hand, was among a small group of young men who staged a successful coup against the Panamanian government of Florencio Arosemena. To keep the peace, the United States made minor concessions. Mora became agricultural and public works secretary. He lasted nine months before Community Action’s pick for the presidency, Harmodio Arias Madrid, removed him. The dentist watched from the sidelines as Arias, and then his brother Arnulfo, both of whom had participated in the coup, assumed control. They pursued a populist agenda: Women received the vote, a social security system was created, antiforeigner rhetoric escalated. In 1940, Arnulfo Arias, who openly sympathized with the Nazis and Mussolini, won the presidency. A year after his election, the National Police (under the approving eye of the United States) deposed him.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time of the coup, the sixteen-year-old Fonseca was a budding activist who later entertained thoughts of becoming a priest and “saving the world.” There had been a priest in almost every generation of the Mora family going back centuries. Fonseca dropped out of university after a year, attracted by the reformist zeal of the Jesuits. The priests were secretly running workshops where university students could connect with other members of civil society interested in social reform. Through the Jesuits, Fonseca met Father Héctor Gallego, a charismatic thirty-year-old Catholic cleric from Colombia. Gallego practiced liberation theology, which taught that the Church’s responsibility to the poor included helping them to improve their economic and political situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...For years, Fonseca kept a box of mixed human remains under his office desk at Mossack Fonseca, the suspected bones of his former mentor resting by his feet. In 2015, the public ministry took them back. They still await a proper examination and burial.
            </p>
            <p>
             pon completion of his law degree in 1976, Fonseca left Panama to attend classes at the London School of Economics. The United Nations recruited him before he could complete his studies. They needed Central American lawyers to fill their quota system. In the UN, Fonseca envisioned an opportunity to save the world on a good salary. He accepted a position with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva, but within a few years he had soured on his employer.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I lost my idealism inside the UN bureaucracy,” he says.
            </p>
            <p>
             ... The Geneva attorney was Fonseca’s doorway into the secrecy world, acting as his sponsor and making introductions.
             <strong>
              She called the companies “chickens.”
             </strong>
             The business was simple—hatch the chickens in Panama and collect the annual fee as the registered agent. Fonseca says that while employed by the UN, he referred the work to a cousin in Panama, who agreed to give the companies back to Fonseca if he returned home.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1982, after six years at the UN, he quit and moved back to Panama to open his own law practice, retrieving from his cousin the companies created during his UN years. Fonseca created a Panamanian holding company, Michiana International, to handle the registration business.
             <strong>
              His new clientele included one of the richest men in the world: Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi billionaire arms dealer.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Named after Khashoggi’s daughter, the Nabila cost around $85 million (roughly $250 million in today’s dollars) to build and outfit. The 292-foot yacht could travel eighty-five hundred miles without refueling and store three months of food for one hundred people. It had a hair salon, a surgery, and a patisserie on board. Tucked away among the five levels and one hundred rooms were quarters for a crew of fifty-two. Movie stars, musicians, and the megawealthy danced in its disco. Bathrooms were hewn from single pieces of onyx. Khashoggi’s personal suite had a tortoiseshell ceiling and featured a ten-foot-wide bed, behind which lay a secret passageway for paramours. Portly, short, and balding, Khashoggi kept a bevy of high-end prostitutes on call. The yacht was a self-contained mobile world, ideal for a hyper-controlling, reality-bending, glam-loving billionaire.
             <strong>
              When creditors repossessed the Nabila in 1988, Donald Trump bought it.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             All that sizzle was in service of the sale. Khashoggi acted as a middleman for arms deals and commodities trades, taking a healthy commission on each transaction. Inside the Nabila’s staterooms, Middle Eastern royalty, Fortune 500 company executives, Swiss bankers, and government functionaries wheeled and dealed. When necessary, the yacht motored into international waters to complete contracts free of government constraint such as tax obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Khashoggi had an unsavory reputation, but neither Panamanian lawyer appeared to show any hesitation in working with him. In the mid-1970s, U.S. congressional hearings had exposed Khashoggi’s involvement in a massive multicountry corporate bribery scheme orchestrated by the defense contractor
             <strong>
              Northrop
             </strong>
             , which had poured tens of millions of dollars into the bank accounts of foreign officials to win contracts. Northrop had paid Khashoggi $106 million as a consultant between 1970 and 1975. The hearings showed that at least $450,000 of that found its way into bribes for two Saudi generals.

             Just a great contribution here. Just goes to show how long South American and Middle Latin American politics have been infiltrated by those groups that fled Nazi Germany and how they are currently utilized to support the New World Order shift.

             Even the Khashoggi connection comes into play, definitely a well defined and continuitous network where all the same players involved in an international effort at destabilizing world politics. here we are in these forums pointing them out left and right but yet the show goes on....

             Interesting. Bernstein was the whistleblower in the UBS case IIRC. I think he said (at least initially) that there wasn't a whistleblower behind the leaks of the Panama Papers, as the journalists claimed, but that it was a job by an intelligence agency, most likely the CIA.

             Possible reason: To make US citizens withdraw their shell companies and money from Panama, and invest the money in the US tax havens like Reno or Wyoming (there are two more, I don't recall the states currently).

              Well Mossack's father was a member of the German SS and Jurgen himself worked with the CIA 'early in his career' according to the official narrative. And we all know once you're CIA that's usually it. Eye opening stuff. Nothing is ever as it seems...

               Yes, indeed. I read yesterday that Mossack got a warning by the NSA previous to the publication (?) / hack (?) of the Panama Papers that they should delete their Nevada office info. (?) So that the US clients there (= tax haven) would not be implicated.

            - would you please correct this, as it turns out that Podesta was not on the Executive Board of Mossack Fonseca, but on the Board of Joule, which was connected to Mossack Fonseca.

             Info about Jurgen Mossack, one of the owners:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             '[Mossack Fonseca] is a partnership between 2 lawyers.
             <strong>
              Jurgen Mossack's father was in the SS
             </strong>
             and Wikipeadia is very vague but says
             <strong>
              he ended up working for the US as a spy against Cuba and ended up in Panama. Has Paperclip type ratline written all over it.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Mossack was born in Germany in 1948. He moved to Panama with his family in the early 1960s, according to his law partner.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mossack’s father had been a member of the Waffen-SS, the notorious armed wing of the Nazi Party during World War II, according to U.S. Army intelligence files obtained by ICIJ.
            </p>
            <p>
             After the war the father offered his services to the U.S. government as an informant, the files show, claiming “he was about to join a clandestine organization, either of former Nazis now turned Communist . . . or of unconverted Nazis cloaking themselves as Communists.” An Army intelligence officer wrote that the offer to spy for the U.S. might simply be “a shrewd attempt to get out of an awkward situation.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Nevertheless, the old intelligence files indicate that Mossack’s father later ended up in Panama, where he offered to spy, this time for the CIA, on Communist activity in nearby Cuba.
            </p>
            <p>
             After earning a law degree in Panama in 1973, the son worked for a time as a lawyer in London before returning to Panama to start the firm that he would later merge to form Mossack Fonseca &amp; Co.'

             Yeah this material is just phenomenal. Anything Bush related also has connections to the Nazi's and people just think the Nazi's are some myth or one of those fags that carried candles on a college campus when in reality the money stolen from german citizens during the war propelled a vast empire after the war and was melded with other ventures in the NWO paradigm. SO MANY of these new researchers are completely aloof on the Nazi angle when what we are looking at in the Bush empire and CLINTON CARTEL is the attempted rise of the Fourth Reich in league with other New World Order goals.

             Comment on the deepstatepolitics forum about who is behind the organization that published the Panama Papers leaks, and the selective reporting of the MSM involved:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'Unfortunately the leaker has made the dreadful mistake of turning to the western corporate media to publicise the results.
            </p>
            <p>
             In consequence the first major (

             )story, published today by the Guardian, is all about Vladimir Putin and a cellist on the fiddle. As it happens I believe the story and have no doubt Putin is bent.
            </p>
            <p>
             But why focus on Russia?
             <strong>
              Russian wealth is only a tiny minority of the money hidden away with the aid of Mossack Fonseca.
             </strong>
             In fact, it soon becomes obvious that the selective reporting is going to stink.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Suddeutsche Zeitung, which received the leak, gives a detailed explanation (
             <a href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/">

             ) of the methodology the corporate media used to search the files.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The main search they have done is for names associated with breaking UN sanctions regimes.
             </strong>
             The Guardian reports this too (
             <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/a-world-of-hidden-wealth-why-we-are-shining-a-light-offshore">

             </a>
             )and helpfully lists those countries as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Russia and Syria.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The filtering of this Mossack Fonseca information by the corporate media follows a direct western governmental agenda.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              There is no mention at all of use of Mossack Fonseca by massive western corporations or western billionaires – the main customers.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              AND THE GUARDIAN IS QUICK TO REASSURE THAT 'MUCH OF THE LEAKED MATERIAL WILL REMAIN PRIVATE'.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Mossack was born in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany, on 20 March 1948.[2] His father, Erhard Mossack, was a Rottenführer (senior corporal) in the
              <strong>
               Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel
              </strong>
              , during World War II. According to U.S. intelligence files, he offered to spy for the Americans after the war.
             </p>
             <p>
              When Jürgen Mossack was 13 he moved with his father and the rest of his family to Panama.[3] Once in Panama Erhard Mossack offered his services to the
              <strong>
               Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
              </strong>
              for spying on Communist activity in Cuba.[4][5] Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, said in 2016, when contacted by journalists, that they had documents related to Erhard Mossack but would not share any information, owing to possible security risks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mossack served on Conarex, Panama’s council on foreign relations, from 2009 to 2014.[4][9] On 7 April 2016, he announced that given the leak he was resigning from Conarex, the national foreign relations council.

              Fonseca is also an award-winning novelist.[9] He has written four novels, along with plays and short stories. He has been awarded the Ricardo Miró Prize, the national literary award in Panama, twice, for novels Dance of the Butterflies (1994) and Dream City (1998).

              On partnering Mossack, Fonseca later told a journalist, 'Together, we have created a monster,' according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
             </p>
             <p>
              The book jacket of chart topper Dance of the Butterflies 'raises the close relationship between power and morality', while his latest novel Mister Politicus delves into the shady underworld of corrupt politicians and 'articulates the tangled processes that unscrupulous officials use to gain power and achieve their detestable ambitions.'

              Among people he follows on Twitter are a fair amount of 18+ accounts - the naked bottom of 'Horny Cherry' sits alongside the official account of the President of Argentina Mauricio Macri.

            <em>
             Info about one of the guys who were arrested:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For more than 30 years as the founder of
             <strong>
              Boston Capital Ventures
             </strong>
             ,
             <strong>
              Harald Joachim von der Goltz
             </strong>
             has built a reputation as a savvy investor in emerging companies.
            </p>
            <p>
             What few know, however, is that over roughly that same span of time and with the help of Mossack Fonseca, Mr. von der Goltz has also come to command a vast offshore empire:
             <strong>
              interconnected corporations, foundations and bank accounts with about $70 million in assets
             </strong>
             , according to internal emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lawyer for Mr. von der Goltz said the beneficial owner of all of the trusts and accounts is Mr. von der Goltz’s 100-year-old mother, who resides in Guatemala. One document also suggests that the tens of millions of dollars in the accounts originally came from businesses operated by Mr. von der Goltz’s father.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              But numerous other documents prepared by Mossack Fonseca and signed by Mr. von der Goltz list him as the founder, manager and “first beneficiary” of the foundation that controls most of the family’s wealth.
             </strong>
             Mr. von der Goltz also put assets from companies he helped operate into the accounts, documents show.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most important, Mossack Fonseca registered Mr. von der Goltz as a resident of Guatemala, which tax experts said
             <strong>
              could help him protect the family money from certain United States tax obligations.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "...we know he lives in Miami; and makes his residence for 5 months of the year in Boston,”
             </strong>
             Mr. Owens, the Mossack Fonseca partner [the fourth man in this case, who remains at large], wrote in an email in 2009 to top executives at the firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             “My suggestion: Leave everything as it is with von der Goltz, i.e. stay and live this potential risk, we might prefer to send money orders and cashier’s checks, which have a slightly lower risk than bank transfers. It’s all well done, customer understands well and accepts it as is,”
             <strong>
              Mr. Owens wrote
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “I agree with your suggestion on my part,” responded Ramón Fonseca, one of the firm’s founders.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In a statement,
             <strong>
              Mr. von der Goltz
             </strong>
             said the companies were established for legal purposes, and that both he and the companies were compliant with United States tax and reporting requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
             “There has never been any illegal activity associated with these companies,” the statement said.

             Yeah good find I've been trying to find anything I can on the guy because of such an interesting name. Pictures of any von der Goltz are sparce and informationally obscure but there has to be a much deeper connection with a name like that.

            <p>
             In a recent article in the Observer, John Schindler, a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst, examined one of the U.S.-related connections associated with the Panama Papers: Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, uses The Podesta Group as its lobbying arm in Washington, D.C. The Podesta Group’s CEO is Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta. Of course, John Podesta served as former President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, was an adviser to President Barack Obama and is currently chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The Podesta Group is helping Sberbank (“Savings Bank” in Russian) improve its public image, so to speak. As Mr. Schindler points out, Sberbank is functionally controlled by the Kremlin—in other words, it’s controlled by Mr. Putin. “Funds moving through Sberbank are regularly used to support clandestine Russian intelligence operations, while the bank uses its offices abroad as cover for the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service,” Mr. Schindler noted.

            Thank you for a well sourced post. I hope you are right.  I believe that the recent arrest of the Huawei CFO is linked to all this:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/charges-loom-for-ex-intelligence-official-roger-uren-after-asio-raid-20170727-gxjrks.html">
             Charges loom for ex-intelligence official Roger Uren after ASIO raid
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Federal police are seeking to charge a former high-ranking Australian intelligence official, Roger Uren, with breaching spy agency secrecy laws after ASIO discovered a cache of classified files during a raid on his home in late 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             The revelations come as the federal government adopts a more aggressive approach to countering Beijing's influence and intelligence operations in Australia, flagging new counter-interference laws and threatening to boycott an undersea internet cable from Australia to the Solomon Islands because of the involvement of Chinese firm
             <strong>
              Huawei.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             As Yan serves out her jail sentence in the US, the United Nations bribery scandal continues to play out in US courts. According to court files, one of Yan's co-accused, Macau billionaire
             <strong>
              Ng Lap Seng
             </strong>
             , is also suspected to have connections with Chinese intelligence. Australian and US intelligence agencies suspect Beijing was seeking to covertly influence the UN via proxies such as Yan.

              The film project originally belonged to Sherry Lansing, who bought the unpublished manuscript of the novel in 1991, after many publishers had rejected it, and handed it over to producer Scott Rudin when she became CEO of Paramount Pictures in 1992.[4] "It was one of the single best ideas for a movie I've ever heard," she said in a 1996 interview with The New York Times. "The situation of a woman getting left for a younger version of herself was far too common. But we didn't want a movie about women as victims.
              <strong>
               We wanted a movie about empowerment.

               I'm sorry.. my contributions can be messy as I tend to post as soon as I find something and spend very little time writing up coherent threads putting pieces together.
              </p>
              <p>
               In my opinion, it is very clear that Mossack Fonseca is the CIA and represents how they hide money trails to do with drug running, trafficking, blackmail, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also have written much about the Omidyar Network.  They are very involved with the entertainment and public relations industries, especially in the UK.  Tavistock is involved.  In America this ties back to the CIA.  (Of course, CIA is heavily involved with the transformation of society via the Hollywood studios).
              </p>
              <p>
               In this post we see a link between Omidyar, Wikileaks and Paramount:

                Walter and Anne Pincus were mentioned in one of Tamera Luzzattos WL emails. So I wanted to find out a little more about them.

              <p>
               Booz Allen and Omidyar Network are corporate members of an NSA-linked consortium called Innocentive, a consultancy focused on crowdsourcing (read: data-mining of public-opinion polls, consumer surveys and Internet-based personal data). Other member-companies include In-Q-Tel, a developer of communications monitoring software spawned with millions in start-up capital from the CIA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also represented is the In-Q-Tel spin-off Palantir, which creates fictive personas or virtual trolls to mount smear campaigns to debunk or threaten journalists and critical websites online and in letters to editors. Palantir, which refers to itself as an “electronic warfare” firm, has created a meta-data collection program similar to the NSA’s PRISM.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another corporate partner in Innocentive is Lilly Ventures, the investment arm of Eli Lilly pharmaceuticals, which produced LSD for the MK-ULTRA mind-control program and is now the lead partner in the Obama-sponsored national brain-mapping project.

             What IS IT with these HEDGE FUND managers, every single one of them I here of has a HIGHLY dubious lifestyle
            </p>
            <p>
             Donald Sussman -has a yacht called Alices Restaurant, #3 biggest donor to the Clintons, linked to the death of Aaron Dover
Jeffrey Epstein -Lolita Island and modeling agency spy ring
Louis Bacon – a billionaire hedge fund manager who's in a bitter fight with another luciferian Peter Nygard
Gabe Hofffman -fronts his 'own' money for AnOpenSecret but is a jewish homosexual who spends his time harassing sexual abuse victims on twitter and uses the antisemite defense like a magick wand.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why are they all so TWISTED?
            </p>
            <p>
             We have all those examples like Wolf of Wall Street and The Devil's Advocate, when are we going to get the hint?
            </p>
            <p>
             It really seems lie theses
             <strong>
              HEDGE FUND
             </strong>
             managers have the time and money to slip into ALL of the big luciferian events almost as though they are head minions or satanic saboteurs,

            I think this story will get added on to and that more dirt will come out on the Clinton Global Initiative as some investigations begin to bear fruit.

              I can tell when journos are checking my blog because they go way back to older pages and there's  more traffic on it than usual. They seem to be checking out Clinton Foundation and (tottering) Deutsche Bank today.

               Traffic? I just had someone blow by with a cop scanner CB and look directly at me. Clever car, I have to admit. This guy did not realize I do not sleep like others. He did catch me by surprise though. I usually write down all licence #'s. They are like a receipt, You can return them to sender at a later point.

               Interesting detail. Yeah, they have no choice but to find ways to print this because it's really the only news worth reporting.  This and that Epstein story is catching on like wildfire and we've got to keep the flames fanned.

             Yeah I find the timing uncanny, this is a weird life. I guess it's ok that we didn't get to see him twisted up like a washcloth and every ounce of sin squeezed out of him but that would have only fed the wrong side of me anyway it's best he die in the torment he created for his own progeny.

              His funeral resembled one that may have been someone canonized a saint by the Satanists. Also McCain. Babs  checked out right around the time it was on Twitter that she was on the Board of Rainbow Cultural Garden which is an arm of NXIVM. Another convenient exit imo.

               Yeah it was exactly as you said it was, all the usual suspects paying tribute to a master spy and luciferian. Shameful and a really sad sad spectacle. I hope they know and understand we're not falling for it. Disgusting evil murderers.

            I made a lead about Panama Paper stuff about 9-10 months ago and spread that lead across the internet.

            I can tell you, Mossack Fonseca ties ALL of them together. Soros, Rothschild, Rockefeller, the list goes on.

            I suspected that LE white hats watch our forum. This development is proof of that.

              ! This shows that reading
              <em>
               The Guardian
              </em>
              as morning paper really sucks sometimes - I read an article about the case, but
              <em>
               of course
              </em>
              they didn't mention a connection to the Clinton Foundation. ;-)
             </p>
             <p>
              Would Mr. Supersleuth be content with a 'Potential Lead' flair? ;-)

               That's interesting. Yeah it takes a discerning eye and a ton of practice to read between the lines and I don't doubt you're damn good at it in the first place but those devils speak in tongues on those huge publications. Thankfully we've got quick thinking alternative news orgs like the one that collated this beauty.

               Thank you for your very considerate reply and, thank you for the other comment you left earlier. You've always been kind and considerate toward me and I want to let you know that I notice. Nothing I've said or done here in the past few months have any reflection on you just so you know. Thanks for the flair.

               I will be opening up an entire section for TRUMP alone in this thread more than likely so you all can save your Q and Trump shit at the door.
