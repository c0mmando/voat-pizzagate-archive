&quot;Israel reportedly constructing an underground wall around Gaza&quot;
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-reportedly-constructing-an-underground-wall-around-gaza/2016/06/19/7bafb084-3636-11e6-af02-1df55f0c77ff_story.html?utm_term=.1d8e598f0802">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-reportedly-constructing-an-underground-wall-around-gaza/2016/06/19/7bafb084-3636-11e6-af02-1df55f0c77ff_story.html?utm_term=.1d8e598f0802</a></p>
<p>&quot;The presence of more than 30 Hamas-built attack tunnels around the Gaza periphery shocked Israeli citizens during the 2014 war. At least 14 of the tunnels went under the fence line and into residential communities in Israel. Residents still sometimes report that they hear scraping and digging sounds beneath their feet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;According to the media report, the new wall will update the existing wire border fence, which was constructed in 2005 after Israel withdrew its Jewish settlements from the Gaza Strip. It will extend the length of the Palestinian territory’s roughly 40-mile border with Israel and cost an estimated $570 million. Exactly how high, or, more important, how deep the wall will reach was not revealed.</p>
<p>“Most of it will be under the ground, where although it might still be possible for Hamas to build a tunnel, if it’s as deep as 30 meters, it will be much harder for them,” said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and a former deputy director general of the Ministry of Strategic Affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>We should follow the wall building process closely. A lone above ground physical barrier IS NOT WHAT WE WANT.</p>',

            The wall will be built to be torn down. I think it is a ploy to get people to demand open borders. The day it is torn day is the day world government is complete. They will encourage us to put the noose around our own necks. The sheeple will do it while buying the skit hook line and sinker.

            A concrete wall is as much a psychological barrier as it is a physical one.

           <p>
            The wall will be fitted with vibration detectors to pick up tunneling and I suspect existing tunnels will be detected and deliberately collapsed during the construction process.

            Illegals cost us $115 billion every year and the wall will be a once-off cost of perhaps $20 billion.

           <p>
            It will pay for itself within about 4 years, not counting the fact that illegal border crossings have dropped 78% simply because the idea of strong border security has put the fear of Jesus into the taconiggers. Also, don't forget that Mexico will pay for the wall using several mechanisms including tariffs and asset seizure from Mexican drug cartel members.

            I'm sorry about your feelings, however walls work and that's a fact. Just look at Israel if you have any doubts.
