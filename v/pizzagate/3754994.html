Hundreds of photos of hundreds of different children of various ages and links to rape videos. I clicked out and just about had a panic attack and got very sick to my stomach. Honeybee named who owned it and it\'s an extremely evil woman named Gaetanne Antat. I reported her to NCMEC as soon as I had that incident occur and was told it would be investigated. I gave the link of Gaetanne Facebook to them that was in Honeybee\'s original post.

            So,let me get this straight,you reported it to the very people that run it? Ncmec? They are the biggest child trafficking organization aside from USAID.  Your info is correct,but who you reported it to,not so much,contact the sex trafficking investigator,and prosecutor the one out to investigate Kim Fox of the smollett debacle.I forget his name,but keep sending it authorities,never NCMEC.

             Yeah ncemc is compromised.. sure they probably have wonderful investigators, but there's someone at the top that's sole purpose is to shield the big powerful players from ever getting caught.... So I'm sure nothing happened. And if you get too vocal something would probably happen...... TO YOU!

             They have a control safety net...  The majority of the organizations that are supposedly tasked with saving these kids are actually quite the opposite. Sure they will bust some of the small time guys to make it look like they're doing their job, but they probably rekidnap the victims and use them in their own crimes etc.
