            Actually, this isn't the only suspicious story out of Canada. There are the recent arrests, connected to the US. Then there is the well known situation with young Native women disappearing in large numbers out of somewhere in Canada. On one of the lakes?

            It tends to prove there's a Satanic aspect to the Church of England. The make-believe blood drinking and cannibalism of the ritual of communion is another clue. The "blue blood" of the English elites supports the bloodline theory, but I don't know enough about the history to support that theory, only the religious angle.

            It could be said of Christianity that Christ was a Jew, discernment is necessary.

            I'm not sure what is going on with this person, I don't feel that it is disinfo, instead it feels like a very wronged person who takes a kernle of truth and blows it up wildly in order to attract support and attention.  Proceed with caution.

             Kevin Barnett's court is a nullity, but that doesn't mean that the crimes didn't happen. The story of the Canadian genocide is very relevant to the child abuse that is perpetrated by high level paedophile networks.

               The Anglican and and Roman Catholic Churches were both involved in the Canadian Genocide. Likewise both of these groups have a history of involvement in paedophilia. The separation of the Church of England from the Church of Rome was primarily a matter of politics, the Reformation was a secondary issue. Rome was the original source of the civil law which is predominant is Europe and most other western political systems, with the main competing system being common law. The common law in inherently theistic, but this fact typically isn't recognised by western governments, since they focus of rights that they can control rather than the inalienable natural rights of the common law. While Christian ethics form a part of the common law, Christian religion doesn't conform well to the ideals of justice and reason which underpin the common law.
