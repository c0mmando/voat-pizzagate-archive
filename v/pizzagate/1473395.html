<p>Unicor, or Federal Prison Industries, pays prisoners less than a dollar an hour to manufacture products, including the solar panels at Sheridan Federal Prison in Oregon.
Clinton’s financial ties to Rive and SolarCity which also exist through two Washington D.C. lobbyists have not been mentioned too often by the Clinton controlled American media.
Rive and his brother founded SolarCity in 2006. The company’s chairman is Tesla founder Elon Musk, its largest shareholder. Also benefitting from prison labour.</p>
<p>SolarCity pays the Podesta Group $50,000 a quarterly to be their lobbyist.
Suniva has lobbyist is a firm called ML Strategies run by David Leiter the husband of Tamera Luzzatto, the Pool Party grandmother who delivered her three step grand-children to a party of the Podesta brother.
SolarCity also has entered into a $1.6 million agreement with the Clinton Global Initiative to aid schools.</p>
<p>Tamera Luzzato is a major player in this scandal, for her use of own step grand-children to accelerate her career in Washington DC, and as a right hand woman to Hillary Clinton.  She too was hired immediately by the Clinton White House, on a Rockefeller recommendation.</p>
<p>Her bizarre comments about how special her female descendants will be in the future suggests that she too has been promised to a royal dynastic family in the coming New World Order. The children can be sexually abused for fun in the short term, because they will be rulers of us in the future.</p>

            I'm good with the prison-labor thing, but I think there has to be some form of regulation/sanctions put on who benefits from the labor. I don't think it's cool that they can hire them out like slaves to their buddies. Not sure what the answer is, but I do like them working and out in the sun. It's healthy and beneficial.
