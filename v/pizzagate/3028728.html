            Angela, look at this:  https:// www.abadianiaportal.com/community   It's a call out to people wanting to adopt out children.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Loving Parents looking to adopt a child
If you know of someone who needs to give a child up for adoption please take a look at this letter from Dana and Kyle. Perhaps you can help form a new family.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the people who adopted children are not coming forward because they do not want to lose their child:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             there is also an alleged suicide case, and of a woman who was involved with adoption of babies in Brazil. Are you aware of any of these accusations?
No. The accusations I heard were from Germany, not from Australia. I'm following everything through the media. I do not know these women or the woman who says she adopted a baby and does not want to give her name because she does not want to lose her son, and this is very complicated because the child has been here for a long time, I guess

            confirms what Lydia Cacho says, which is that young girls living in poverty are lured away from their homes with the promise of money to send back to their families. The girls get paid nothing, while the traffickers (in this case JOG) makes big money:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Faria would offer money to poor girls aged 14 to 18 to go and live in mineral mines or farms he owns in the Brazilian states of Goias and Minas Gerais.
There they would become sex slaves and be forced to get pregnant and their babies would be sold to the highest bidder from other continents, Bittencourt alleges.
“In exchange for food, they were impregnated and their babies sold on the black market,” she said.
“Hundreds of girls were enslaved over years, lived on farms in Goias, served as wombs to get pregnant, for their babies to be sold.
“These girls were murdered after 10 years of giving birth. We have got a number of testimonies.

             This has ties with the M6 and the CIA according to recent findings. The whole purpose of the operation is the acquisition of babies for programming and SRA. This was never about money per se.

            It's very difficult to find final destinations of babies.  Bettincourt said she was contacting some families who had bought the babies before she died.  I hope the families who bought the children come forward and I hope the babies are in good homes, being loved.

              I have searched everywhere for any adoptions coming out of JOG centers, and I can find nothing. There is gossip about deaths at pousadas (hotels) in Abadiania implying that it was JOG's army who went around killing people trying to get the truth out, but nothing about babies.   Until someone comes forward verifying that they did adopt a child via JOG, anything is possible.

             I honestly babies were not given to foster parents. I think this relates to Elsagate and how part of it was being used as an operation for human trafficking. I have seen decoded accounts of children being export sedated in containers. I think this is part of that and the people involved on this indicate this line of reasoning. I insist, we have no evidence that the babies were in fact being adopted.
 If Abramovic is involved in this then you can be sure that SRa is involved as well.

            Just because a baby is acquired in nefarious ways, doesn't mean the people "buying" aka adopting the baby in the end have any idea about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we look at money laundering as an example of how to make something gotten in a dirty fashion appear "clean" for re-use, logically we can assume it's also possible that these traffickers have ways to make it appear that these children were given up legitimately by their birth parents for adoption. It's pretty easy to falsify paperwork, especially for an adoption from a third world country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't doubt that many of these children are being used for disgusting pedo and satanic ritual purposes, but it can also be likely that childless couples are paying big bucks for a private adoption and are inadvertently ending up adopting some of these children without even knowing it.

               Thats a fallacy because you are not considering context. We are talking about a mind controlling guru accused of raping minors and ruling over a slave sex farm for producing babies and killing the mothers after a few years. And being visited by the number 1 witch in Pizzagate who made a documentary about his visit to this gurú combined with witchcraft.

                I'm not sure how you have completely misunderstood my comments, but it seems to be a running theme for you to get confused easily.
               </p>
               <p>
                I never said it's a positive thing to be stealing children and selling them for profit! What I said is that stealing and selling babies, who have been laundered to appear to be legitimate adoptions can be a big money maker! You don't think a pedo operation ALSO needs to make big bucks to keep their secretive deeds hidden and protected? Don't you think it's expensive to keep houses of sex slaves? Where does this money come from? Sure, people pay for the sex slaves, but if they can make $10k-$20k from one adopted infant, you don't think it's even crossed their minds to do that?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why are you shutting down this idea about adoption? Do you realize how many Americans adopt children from other countries? Are you just lacking common sense or are you trying to cover up something?

                      Have fun behaving exactly like ES, I'm betting he's cheering you on and joining the brigading. I'm fairly certain you're not him, but you sure act just like him xD

                      Not the first time you've cut out some context in order to smear, either - quite ironic, that other time, wouldn't you say?

            Investments are usually expected to turn a profit, disgusting as that is in this context. Child porn production and organ harvesting are the two statistically most probable uses from this perspective, while satanic sacrifice and consumption form a smaller, but not negligible percent.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would look for media companies close with John of God, as well as medical organizations, and more specifically any chiropractors that do collagen injections or "injectable fillers."
           </p>
           <p>
            The report stated that the women would give birth for ten years and their babies would be sold, however nothing has been said about abortions yet and that makes me auspicious. Maybe its an ongoing investigation and they can't talk about it.

            Something tells me this is the tip of the iceberg.

             Why would you abort? A proper baby is much more lucrative. 
I insist, they want us to concentrate on the raping aspect of this incident. We need to find out what was the real destination and purpose of the export of babies. This received a lot of back up from the satanic media for this very same reason. That is why abramovic visited him. This guy must have been the number 1 source for the satanic elite around the globe. This could be the next pizzagate if we can unmask it right.

             I also have to expose here that i am being constantly targeted and shilled in every post i make most probably by EsotericShade.

            Hi Angela, good to see you chiming in! :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Sabrina Bittencourt, the babies were sold via some guides who organized tours to the John of God 'Casa' in Brazil, and were based in the US, Europe, and Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think she has some witness statements of women who bought babies from this trafficking ring, and handed them over to the authorities before she died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, there are restrictions for legal adoptions, so not everyone who would like to do it is able to adopt a baby, so these might have been the customers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please see my post about the case:
           </p>

             Brazilian 'Healer' John De Deus Allegedly Held Underage Girls As Sex Slaves And Sold Their Babies. Allegedly, The Girls Were Killed.

           <p>
            (Would you maybe consider adding it to your OP? You will need a link, otherwise the mods will flair the post, see rules in sidebar. ;-) ).
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, I think the babies might very well have been sold to use them in rituals, or to buyers who intended to pimp them out to child rapists.

             Thanks. Still sounds quite shady. My guess is there were sold to pedofriendly couples or for rituals.

             Also please note TurkishDelighted is EsotericShade. He’s using part of my research to lure me and deviate attention of everybody. 
Remember what i told how to detect them?

             They took him away from a relative in Tex. with the help of CPS. Stole him away from a loving home. Not a rich woman but she loved the kids. There were two families they broke up to give them to those two evil women. I’m on phone don’t know how to post the link but I did a couple of posts on them if you check my history. Also check Voat Search. There were other posts. What they did to those Children is Monstrous and Evil.

              How sad. Apparently it's happening often in Europe as well. When CPS pulls a child from a home do you know if they have to go through the court system?

               Yes they do and sometimes it takes years to get them back. There are many articles of these cases in Medical Kidnap on their site. I get it in my mailbox and you can too.

                Hmmm, kinda like my credit card. I may purchase something and it is charged instantly. However, if I return it, it may take 3 weeks to credit my account.

                 They’ve got us coming or going. We just can’t win. This is one of the most dangerous things happening in every state We must stop this at all costs.

                  It is dangerous, and so few people know what's actually transpiring. The thought of that is so depressing. But I feel we can become better organized so we may make a difference. I'm joining the Neon Vest Movement. It's our only shot. Watch this short video and maybe you'll want to be a part of it:

                   This is a great beginning. They love using divide and conquer to keep us apart. You have made a wise decision being a part of this. We need to forget our differences and to remember we are all part of the human race. This is what binds us. I really hope this takes off.

               In the US, they do have to go to court within 72 hours of removing a child from its home. In most states, CPS needs a warrant signed by a judge to even remove children from the home in the first place. The only exception to this is if it's an emergency situation and there's no one available to care for the child- for example parents get arrested for committing a crime and they have their child with them. Cops and or CPS try to find a relative to come and take the child but if they can't, the child is "removed" from the parents.

               For the Hart children to have been adopted from the foster care system, the court ended up terminating their bio parents rights and then approving the adoption.

               Everyone gets on CPS, but really it's the courts who wield the actual power.
