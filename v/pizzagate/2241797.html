            I really don't understand people sometimes. They could end up dead or beaten but if they have a chance to be with someone famous, they take it. This permanent A list celebrity who is famous for entirely different reasons than when he retired from his profession hired an escort for a night. After she saw who it was she would be sleeping with, she has been seeing him almost every day for free and for all practical purposes is his girlfriend.

            I posted another comment for this story: I had checked out this story when it first came out. Early version differed from TMZ's. Anyway I concluded the pizza parlor seemed innocuous.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I didn't know or had forgotten how that specific term "secret pizza" has come up before in Pizzagate:
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a story from a year ago. It gives a link to an Amanda Kleinman video that uses the term and an imdb listing for a film Alefantis produced that uses the term.

            There's also a sketchy kids book called "Secret Pizza Party":

            Harvey Levin the boss of TMZ he knows all the dirty secrets he's also gay and very well informed. He can't for legal and safety reasons report everything he learns he'd be dead if he did that so he is probably hinting here that he knows more and if anything happens to him TMZ will be his deadman switch they will release everything about the Hollywood pedo ring if any harm befalls Harvey. He's smart that way.

             I think it's more than that. They're a media outlet and are careful with what they print (within the confines of what they do which is granted sensationalized).
            </p>
            <p>
             What I think they're doing is hinting they know more and using language to hint to others that OJ is an even worse creep than we ever imagined.

            "Secret Pizza" is a well known pizza shop within the Cosmo hotel in LV.  Hate to burst your bubble here but thistruly is "Just a coincidence".
           </p>
           <p>
            Now on your second point,  does TMZ know about Pizzagate?  How about this headline from last week.... IMO this is MUCHHHH more indicative of "soft disclosure" than anything else they have published.

             JA's Comet Ping Pong is also a well-known pizza shop. What you're saying doesn't prove or disprove anything. It's like saying a wife wasn't beaten by her husband because the couple was known in the neighborhood for thirty years and everyone liked them.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for TMZ, yes, they know and the story about OJ is a continuation of the slow release of info proving #pizzagate to be true.

            I wanted to post when the original story came out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The version I heard was that Orenthal Simpson was making trouble at the bar. The responding police were told he was at the bar but had been asking about 'secret pizza'! (Note this doesn't quite accord with the TMZ story as summarized by the OP.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon further research it seems they don't advertise the location of the pizzeria. You have to be in the know what floor it's on. There's a long corridor lined with framed record album covers. Web reviews indicate it's a good place to get a slice.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes sense to me they would mention the pizza place: If the police couldn't find him at the bar any more, check the pizzeria. Of course there could be a deeper, darker 'secret', but I haven't seen any evidence for that yet.

             No, what you say doesn't jibe with the TMZ story. According to them, it was the long line he was objecting to.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't say anything about the Secret Pizza Shop because I don't know anything about the Cosmo Hotel or this shop. All I know is that it's suspicious that OJ tried to get "serviced" and went to the bar to cause trouble about having to wait. Seriously, everybody stop and think about that a minute. If you're IN the pizza shop and there's a long line, wouldn't you complain to the management about the service and try to get a perk because you're a celeb? Why would you go to THE BAR to complain. You wouldn't. Not unless OJ was in the habit of GOING TO THE BAR to get things straightened out with his order for A SLICE!!!

              You don't have to order a whole pizza. You can order just one slice. Yes there are always very beautiful, young adult women in line taking advantage of a very cheap meal after enjoying the Day Club (luxury swimming pool with a DJ and top sound system.) Or before and especially after drinking and dancing at the nightclub or lounges, neither of which serve real food.

            I've been to "Secret Pizza" inside the Cosmopolitan. It's a very tiny. Would be almost impossible to find except for the consistently huge lines, despite being open almost 24/7. Hence the name. I think the "secret" is that the eatery is not widely advertised like the other casino restaurants.

            Top reputation for using fresh ingredients, hand tossed dough, real cheese, having an aroma of fresh garlic and spices, and a true value, especially considering the price. It's composed of a real pizza oven, a few employees wearing full-length, over-sized aprons and long pants.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting that OJ is writing a very detailed expose about the Kardashians, " a behind the scenes type of gossipy tale." OJ as an author? Wonder who he's using as a ghost writer.

             Hope he doesn't have too much pizza sauce on the keyboard. As for a ghostwriter, can't imagine any writer collaborating with that POS. The money would never be worth it.

              I know. I met the man at a party in the Hollywood Hills. 'Party materials" made him a rage-aholic. Scared me to death. Don't forget he's football player sized. Foul mouthed, and very verbally abusive to all young females especially if they were blond. There was also one waiting for him in the back of his limousine. Not Nicole Simpson, much younger. This was before his arrest for double murder.

               I can see him being very demanding also. He always was a prima donna, but that's how people treat Heisman winning football players. Plus he was in a couple of good flicks so there was that going for him. Two things always stand out for me though: (1) In reading about what happened with Nicole, it turned out that OJ raped her on their first date. (2) After marriage, she finally confessed to her mother that he was beating her and her mother told not to talk about it because it was "embarrassing".

            There is a Pizza place hidden in the Cosmo hotel which is not directly advertised anywhere. It is known simply as "secret pizza." I've been there before and as far as I can tell there is no child-raping going on, it's just a pizza place that's kind of hidden away. The Cosmo is set up a little differently from other casinos, rather than being spread out, it's got a casino on the first floor and then 4 or 5 floors above it of restaurants, shops and the Marquee nightclub. It's also a five-star hotel that may not want a low-brow slice bar for the commoners, so it's easy to hide on one of the higher floors and the fact that it doesn't fit with the rest of the ambiance explains why it's hidden (along with some reverse-psychology marketing).

              Ok well even if there is child-raping going on, you haven't provided anything to say that OJ was involved. And it's not really a "secret" pizza place, they have a damn yelp page. Calling it "secret" is a marketing tactic aimed at hipsters in a hotel with the hottest nightclub in Las Vegas.

               Comet Pizza had LOTS of reviews. And OJ was involved in trying to get PIZZA from this SECRET PIZZA SHOP.

                 It's idiotic to call names. I do it sometime z we're all idiots but....trying to show confirmation bias??? Please we are all biased as well as idiots. But please...it's called secret pizza. That's creepy. Oj was there. That's creepy. Oj got kicked out. That's creepy. So I got what I came for. The creeps!!! That's pizza for ya. Its absolutely relaevant because the emphasis is that it's not even secret. And it's pizza. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on. We do know that in Italian Casino means whore house and traffic as well. Put a grain of salt in your noodle.

               Ha! No! There was a shill post I didn't want to give attention to so I posted it in the archive bot post!

              <p>
               I do that quite often. Why give a shill attention? And it shows you're actually reading the post so thanks!

             This post is definitely an example of controlled opposition or confirmation bias. Not sure which, but OP is either a total idiot or a liar.
