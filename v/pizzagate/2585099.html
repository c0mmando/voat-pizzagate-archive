But do we understand that they may all be working together to confuse all of us? </p>
<p>Let me use Bourdain\'s girlfriend. Asia Argento, and her IG page as a perfect tool to destroy all these easily believable, but flawed and false narratives. It really wasn\'t difficult, because it tells the story of her life and her dark soul and gives insight into who Bourdain really was( is? because he may still be alive! ).

<p>What is the real truth right now? Who the fuck knows, for sure? Bourdain and Spade could still be alive and this may be a complicated side LARP because it is already weaving Hillary and Weinstein back into the narrative. One thing I know for sure, is not to trust anyone who is openly displaying Satanic allegiance and don\'t believe any of the people they associate with, either. The only power the Devil has is the LIE and the minions who follow him have inverted truth and the word of God in every aspect of life. </p>

               And of course there that Jimmy Kimmel pizza delivery skit with a classic triangle swirl in the background. Pedo-satanism run amok. I wonder how long has this abomination been going on to reach a virtual saturation point!!!

            DARIO ARGENTO is a famous horror film director in Italy.. but he didn’t just make horror movies.. he made SATANIC horror movies.. remember that the Illuminati use films to mind program the populace and put us in certain frequencies of mind.. his most famous movie is Suspiria

             Being an avid Horror buff I can confirm this. They are pretty much all satanists and many of them are actually pedophiles like that Director of Jeepers Creepers - Victor Salva - convicted pedophile.

            Is there any evidence directly that Anthony Bourdain was involved with pedos? By association, sure his GF looks like a hot mess. Maybe his GF is part of the psyop? Maybe his GF was a plant? How long have they been dating? From the articles I've read, it doesn't look like its been even a year, but I couldn't see a date.

            Maybe he wants some younger pussy. I never heard of the guy until today. I don't watch TV, so I wouldn't know. By the same logic. Americans by association are also involved with pedos. And so are humans. Going to have to have more proof than 1 association he's had for less than a year. Dude probably just wanted some younger pussy.

             some believe that auto-erotic asphyxiation is a hoax made by the CIA. Basically it is the ideal way to murder someone and make it look like a very humiliating suicide. Oxygen deprivation to the brain doesn't get you high, it just makes you pass out and possibly die. So no, auto-erotic asphyxiation isn't a real thing and people who do it are likely fooling themselves (obviously it is a real thing but the passing out part is in no way part of the experience, so unless the scene of the crime really looks like an accidental auto-erotic asphyxiation, assume it could be a murder. Carradine was likely murdered and his father was in Crowley's O.T.O.

             It doesn't really matter if you or everyone else does not believe in that stuff. THEY do. And not only do they very much believe in it, they practice all of the sick rituals and destroy REAL kids. I understand you stance though, the stuff they do is unbelievable.

              You're right, I do believe that there is a strong chance they get up to these things, I just don't believe in God or Satan being self-conscious beings. I also take issue with OPs claim that associating with Satanists means you're a Satanist. I know plenty and I'm not one. They're not all edgy kids either, some are serious about their practice.

               Satan.msans the illusion..comes from the sanskrit.sloka...saatan mahaa maay..
The illusion ie Satan is self.conscious..because we feed.into  it...the more we buy into the tell lie vision programming of fear and negativity ..they get our subconscious minds to control the self conscious illusion..amplified by us acting upon the programming in the cinscious state...
              </p>
              <p>
               ...the opposite is God..or i call it degi mahha maaya..the collective superconsciousness...which acys like the spaceman in interstellar ..timeless..spaceless..space time continuum...
When we wake up from the programming ..it wakes up with us ...itt has more of a pure connectiin with our souls. ...being the creative mass from which our souls consciously decide to take in an earth vessel and play the test...
The test is whether we can realsise the game is to get out of the test ..and leave this world ..
The accounting system which they control ..reflects this ...its a counterfiet carbon (666) copy of 
The mother matrix...ie devi mahaa maaya ..
This is why u see on madonna and child with the child on the left hand side ..signifying the left hand path...where we are kept in a child like state..
The brith title reflects.this ..it represents the claim of the child when born or brith into the debt accku tint systm
Utube : birth certificage stick market
              </p>
              <p>
               God and Saytan are very reeal..very real..u r the transceiver of it..u toss the coin for it with our choices ..
The main choice they want to.distract from us ..with prograaming into us to stay as a consumer tonperpetuate and amplifybthe debt system..
Consumer recreation.service ... They run the game..

               Can u guess how we can get out of the game of debt before we drown in it ..
              </p>
              <p>
               Its so simple ..even dorothy had the choice with her all along to get back to kansas ..
Till then we get distracted by Satan..the serpent i. The garden was called nacash ..not serpent ..it means sorceror or magician..

             Even Alex Jones is spinning some bullshit story that he was a good guy and about to expose the cabal with Elon Musk so they had to kill him. I’m not convinced. The guy was thoroughly a douche bag and his wife obviously too.

               Yeah Alex has really went off the deep end. It makes me suspect the worst for him. He’s an obvious Israeli shill at this point, with his Mossad ex wife.

             he admits he's an addict and that if he did kill himself it would be with a heroin overdose and yet in his last interview he was drinking beer as an addict i can say thats not a good idea i think he was a heavy drinker judging by the amount he drank on his travels for his show

            One thing it’s doing is making all these suicides about “depression.” People coming out of the woodwork to talk about mental health. Bc otherwise it might be odd to see a bunch of unexplained suicides??? Remember anon said there would be many celebrity suicides? Seems like it’s happening.

              The cabal's agenda is to put the public in a mental institution or in a wheelchair. Better that the public are dependants than competitors. The media are pushing this agenda with things such as South Park: Fractured But Whole.
