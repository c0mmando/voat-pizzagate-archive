            Glacier dental must have people associated with it, so look for relationships to pedophiles, orphanages,  organ donation places or with any known politicians or other pizzagate associates.

            Also, if these posts are being repeatedly banned, perhaps that's because there isn't enough evidence and these platforms are attempting to protect what could simply be an innocent business... until concrete evidence shows otherwise.

           <p>
            Not trying to rain on your parade, and I'm sure you will call me a shill, but my point has been the same since the initial commentary - we need something concrete to implicate/build steam.

             It seems strange to me, coming late to the party and catching up on threads, that so many sites would ban the same thing in unison.  Doesn't pass the smell test.  ESPECIALLY because there is no smoking gun.  If the place is innocent, then why all the fuss by moderators - it won't be the first time a  LOOK PEDO SYMBOLS CHECK OUT THIS PLACE thread has been posted my god there have been probably hundreds the mods have let go - used to drive  me nuts actually.
            </p>
            <p>
             So why such concentrated action on this place?  strange.

              Maybe because it was spammed across a number of boards in rapid succession? There wasn't any supporting evidence?

             <p>
              Someone earlier posted that they have not yet seen any proof that these posts had even been deleted. I'm not personally questioning whether or not stuff was deleted, but, it would be nice to see.

               I was passed a link showing it was deleted -

              You can see the list of DDS' right on the website... without any evidence of wrongdoing beyond a bad review and a bad logo, that's the equivalent of doxing those people.

             Agree..exposing a company to harassment is probably the reason for the censorship, but if there's not even proof censorship, as Millennial Falcon stated, yet all the outcry, it sounds like disinfo, prank, diversion for a waste of time, whatever.

              I stopped posting about voat on twitter about a month ago. Twitter was shadow banning comments about  voat pizza/pedogate links. Not all, but enough of them. So many compromised forums now. 
Look on here right now we have a waffle twat trying to push the bullshit about Trump/Comey! Sick ProPedo bastard!
Keep trying if you like not sure at this point anyone is seeing your messages over there.

            Reddit and 4chan have banned Glacier Dental have they not? Or is it 8 chan? Anyway I've been urging folks to proceed with caution on Glacier Dental so as to avoid a ban here altho VOAT seems committed to no censorship.

             We're committed to no censorship, but we're also still waiting to see a shred of evidence of anything suspicious related to Glacier Dental.  The G in their logo is just a stylized G made to look like a glacier (imagine that).  It is missing the second (internal) triangle of the boylover symbol.  Shipping containers are commonly used for storage.  A crematorium doesn't mean uppity child slaves are being disposed of.  This has disinformation written all over it.  I'm also still waiting for proof of all these alleged deleted 4chan threads.  (Reddit deleting would be no surprise and completely expected, although I haven't seen proof of that either).

              I agree, I defended the research initially because of the inappropriateness of 9 hour surgeries without the safeguards that a licensed stand alone outpatient surgical practice require.  Whether the facility is licensed and staffed with bona fide oral surgeons and anesthesiologists should have had followup. VOAT cannot be accusing legitimate businesses of kidnapping kids, harvesting their teeth and then burning the rest of their bodies in the crematorium next door. When I urged caution, that was challenged. This over exuberance needs to be curbed.  The whole business of symbols has gotten out of hand. Triangles are used as stylized mountains in advertising in Telluride, Vail and Jackson Hole ski resorts where I have traveled. Triangles are used to depict tents at camping resorts all  across America. Spirals have been used to depict sunshine in advertising all over Florida. We need some level heads here.

               There was no 9-hour surgery.  IDeliverPizza was misrepresenting it to further his hoax.  The surgery took a normal period of time.  She woke up
               <em>
                at home
               </em>
               at 1 am, because her fiance took her home while she was still passed out (presumably in the afternoon).

              focus on protests, raising awareness, and taking IRL action. the research phase is over. the smoking guns are already there.

              EDIT: on the other hand, there was the review:
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               My appointment started at 3pm and i didn't leave until almost 1 in the morning! They INSISTED on doing work I didn't want done until i gave in. At one point I started crying and telling them to call my fiance to pick me up, so they INSISTED I let them put me under so i wouldn't feel anything. I woke up that morning in my bed with blood all over my face and no clue what happened. Turned out, they didn't even let me wake up from anesthesia before having my fiance take me home. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME GAUZE! I strongly recommend you find a better dentist to go to.

               I mean, on the one hand, sometimes anaesthesia can produce really weird amnesiac effects-- as in, you're conscious but
               <code>
                record_memory.exe
               </code>
               ain't running--so there could theoretically be a mundane explanation for that woman's story ... but on the other hand, if you say "no" to a procedure, they
               <em>
                have
               </em>
               to let you leave; and if they didn't, that is at the very least a serious ethical violation of the "insta-lose-your-license" variety.

                That happened to me.  I was walking around and doing stuff but my earliest post-surgery memory was walking up to the door to my home.  (Someone else drove.)

                 No shit!  I was under the impression that those kind of effects were
                 <em>
                  super
                 </em>
                 rare, but I guess not, apparently.  Must be why they don't let people drive themselves home.

              Hat off to you MF, I think this is your best meme yet to destroy the pedo-gate investigation, focusing on Alaska keeps people as far away from Israel/Saudi as possible. Once your in Alaska, then its just normal to jump over to Siberia.

               LOL, that's an interesting tactic.  Try to blame the person who exposed the hoax.  I was practically the only one on Voat being skeptical about it.  I have an inkling that this was YOUR hoax, and that you are an alt of "IDeliverPizza".

              This. Thank you. A lead to look into is one thing... but re-posting the same thing over and over again without any actual evidence of wrongdoing seems counterproductive. As the shills have readily pointed out, some self-fulfilling prophecies/assumptions and confirmation bias only serve to weaken our cause.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I "pounced" on this the other night... I didn't mean to suggest that there is nothing here. Only that we should look into it carefully to see if there is anything else. I even identified an originating URL, isolated the registrant, dug up their background along with people related to them and couldn't find anything of significance. All the way down to some of their personal social media profiles...
             </p>
             <p>
              Circumstantial evidence is fine in my opinion, but, right now this is based on a shitty logo and a terrible patient review/experience. If you truly believe there is something here, dig!
             </p>
             <p>
              I did. Just didn't find anything.

              I've been vaguely following this. I've done plenty of logos and ads etc. This Glacier logo is very amateurish, we used to see this quality when somebody enlisted their kid or whatever who had some "artistic" leanings. I'd have to say this wasn't purposely done to look like a pedo symbol.
             </p>
             <p>
              The capital "G" lends itself to that "look" already and then it's been (attempted at least) stylized. Also, the "L" at the end of Dental ... they're trying to tie it in, looks-wise, with the G.
             </p>
             <p>
              Looks like a pre-desktop publisher sketch, or "free-hand" logo. (Now everybody and their mother is a writer, a singer, a comedian, a designer, on and on, due to the internet.)
