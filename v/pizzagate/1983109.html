<p>Whether you are on the side of the prosecution or the defense, the Fran and Dan Keller case may very well be the greatest miscarriage of justice we have seen in child sexual assault cases so far this century.  If their exoneration is unjust, the $1.7 million in taxpayer money the Kellers will soon receive only adds a monstrous insult to the victims, their parents and the public. This result was obtained by a relentless high profile defense lawyer who worked for free and also ran the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association.  Numerous appeals over many years whittled down the prosecution\'s case without retrial, and the defense finally hit pay dirt with the installation of a brand new D.A. who acted to exonerate the Kellers before her bottom had barely warmed the seat of her brand new office chair.&quot;  <br />

<p>This is the first paragraph in a longform fully sourced and linked article written to sceptically examine reporting and media propaganda currently flogging the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; and witch-hunt narrative using the Keller case, specifically Jordan Smith\'s Intercept article of June 21, 2017. Smith has been an apologist for the Kellers and a primary mover for their defense for many years. &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; and &quot;witch-hunt&quot; are the catch phrases of choice used to discourage any reporting of SRA and child sex trafficking rings such as is done every day here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Because of Voat\'s 10,000 character submission limit, I could not post this work without chopping it into several pieces. Luckily I found a place to post the article in it\'s entirety on a new platform called Telegraph, which is not a forum, but a possibly very useful new tool when posting to forums such as Voat. </p>
<p>Here is the actual submission - <a href="http://telegra.ph/17-MIL-AWARDED-TO-KELLERS-BY-DA-RUBBERSTAMPED-EXONERATION-MEDIA-PUSHES-WITCH-HUNT-NARRATIVE-SRACHILD-TRAFFICKINGPEDOGATE-DENIAL-07-07">http://telegra.ph/17-MIL-AWARDED-TO-KELLERS-BY-DA-RUBBERSTAMPED-EXONERATION-MEDIA-PUSHES-WITCH-HUNT-NARRATIVE-SRACHILD-TRAFFICKINGPEDOGATE-DENIAL-07-07</a></p>

<p>I hope that this workaround may encourage others to report in greater depth than 10,000 characters if they are so moved. The Telegraph interface requires no account, is editable, easy to use, archivable, unmoderated and free. Thank you Telegraph developers you are indeed a praiseworthy example of a free speech platform.</p>
<p>We must all push back hard against how child trafficking and SRA is framed and defamed in the media, and one way to do that is to unravel the narrative of their propaganda, one sentence at a time, sometimes one phrase or word at a time, with supporting evidence. It\'s an exercise similar to untangling how the media misreported pizzagate to begin with, then stamped the entire topic with the label &quot;debunked.&quot; Such unraveling takes patience and some time to read, but I believe it is worth it to reveal the omissions and misrepresentations in Smith\'s article, which was widely picked up and quoted by other media without scrutiny. Even a media cynic like myself was surprised to see Smith\'s flawed piece published on The Intercept, which often carries serious articles regarding media malfeasance and establishment corruption. Why do Intercept editors allow Smith to misrepresent so much about the Keller case, if the couple suffered a true miscarriage of justice? </p>
<p>I welcome constructive debate and criticism, but I request negative commentors actually read the article if they want discussion with me. Critics, please note that I will be fully dealing with the doctor\'s recanted testimony in PART 2, which is forthcoming, as well as the D.A.\'s decision. There are enough questions raised and worth examining regarding both of those topics that they required their own article.</p>
<p>NOTE ON SOURCES: There is a list of links at the bottom of the article for reference, and also at the bottom of this post. So if I reference The Intercept article, or Cartwright\'s work, for example, and there is not an immediate link, you will find the link at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>PART 2 - The upcoming Part 2 will provide a timeline of the Keller\'s case, along with a look at the D.A.\'s decision and an in depth look at Dr. Mouw\'s make or break testimony, which helped the Kellers get both convicted and released. Then a look at the real consequences to the public discourse on SRA/child trafficking/pizza/pedogate as a result of flawed reporting which seems directed at bringing the Satanic Panic and witch-hunt narrative to a new generation.</p>
<p>I\'d also like to make note of the strange way my previous two posts on the Keller case <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1957669">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1957669</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1956145">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1956145</a> completely disappeared from browsing after falling off just the front page of the HOT section. Whether it is some form of &quot;shadowbanning&quot; suppression, or a glitch - it had the positive effect of focusing my attention much more intently on this topic. </p>

            Award-worthy work, VieBleu!  You should write a book.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm calling up your old posts on this because they contain a lot of excellent information, including research into the Kellers' attorney and who was putting up the money for the defense:

            Thanks for taking a look, maybe when you have more time.  There is a lot of eye popping stuff.  From the article
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             OMISSION 7 - MISSING 28 PAGES OF THE POLICE REPORT SMITH FOUGHT FOR
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In The Intercept Smith says that she and the Austin Chronicle waged a court battle to obtain and publish "full and unredacted access" to the police report, and Smith claims the police fought hard "to keep it a secret". In the name of transparency, Smith is a hero, right? So why decline to share the first 28 pages of the police report with the public?  Are we to follow Smith's example and accuse her of wanting "to keep it a secret"?  Because the part we do get to see contains a whole lot of eye openers - Fran's convicted paedophile brother, reports of parents finding the day care locked, with Fran off premises and Dan frequently alone with the children. Parents stating their children came in other children's clothes and underwear which should be highlighted as a very strange and telling violation - any day-care should be very critically scrutinized on that charge alone. These details are not "fever dream" material I'm sorry to say, but the realistic and nitty-gritty case reporting that accompanies child sexual assault. I suggest everyone interested read the report. It may be the only way the voices of some of these children and their parents will ever be acknowledged.

            abc is looking for the entire police report - 28 pages missing but Smith fought voraciously! she says so SHE could see the full report, then didn't share it all  , why not? (this is in my article forgive me for repeating).  I doubt if the trial transcripts are online - property of defense and prosecutors probably, but yeah it would be great to see.

            The "Satanic Panic" bullshit meme was a big deal in the late 80s-early 90s.  Since it hasn't been out there for a while, I thought it was pretty much dead in the popular nomenclature.  Especially in light of recent surveys demonstrating that over 90% of licensed therapists who see patients claiming to be SRA victims believe those patients.
           </p>

            Of course, the CIA's False Memory Syndrome Foundation is still out there

             I have a quote for part 2 the lawyer who got the Keller's off for free, no legal fees, says he is sure another "moral pain" is inevitable so he wanted to get this decision.  They are prepping to spring any of their own who gets convicted for pedogate stuff   sheeesh, do kids even have a chance ever...

               As part of the keller exoneration, they got something like 30 psychologists to say there is no SRA it's all a fantasy led by someone namd James Wood I believe.  I think that group may be False Memory Syndrome affiliated.  Need to look further into that.
              </p>
              <p>
               This case just keeps opening into more and more avenues.  I think it is a real nexus of the propaganda push.

            "When you read the police report of the Keller case, the investigation reveals what actually looks the opposite of a "panic." Instead you find numerous busy working parents stoically accepting their kids back from day care with "anal/vaginal" rashes and yeast infections, strange and sexualised acting out behaviours, fears of Fran Keller and her "hate care" and two reports of kids who seemed drugged, or unable to be woken when taken home. The door at Fran's Day Care was locked when parents came by and children were usually brought out to the curb to waiting parents. You also find out Fran had a brother serving time in a nearby jail for child sexual assault. Dan wasn't the designated care taker, but children and babies were often left alone with him. Most alarming, most of the parents interviewed noticed their children came back to them wearing different panties, underwear and outerwear than their own. "Children’s parents had been noting that children returned home from day-care wearing their under clothing inside out or wearing other children’s underwear and sometimes having wet hair. Reasonable explanations were always given and at first it was not enough to create alarm."
           </p>
           <p>
            Just WOW.  It's difficult to imagine parents being so clueless about the people to whom they entrust their most precious.
           </p>
           <p>
            My initial impression is that this journalist Smith (a crypto J name but may be a pseudonym) and the County DA Moore are probably satanists themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is an intriguing case.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention, VB!

            Weird, I saw this on the news (I'm near Austin) just today. I haven't read everything here yet OP but I was fairly riveted by what the (local) news was saying.

           <p>
            Edit: What are you saying, the guy is innocent or not?

             Hey bop!  I'm intrigued by what you heard/saw on the news - more celebrating this pair?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a couple and to my mind there is a lot more shady business surrounding this trial.  I believe they are guilty of at least aggravated sexual abuse as charged.  Look at the confession of both Fran and Deputy Perry (follow the link to the main article to see all that)    and tell me what you heard on the news!   abcdef a commenter here is interested in tracking down the FULL police report.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think Jordan Smith is guilty too, of spin reporting.  and there's probably something behind her motivation over years to free this pair and flog the witch hunt narrative.

              Sorry I am late to the party to read this post as I have been moving.  Fantastic post and I agree that the MSM is gloating over this case as a victory against Pizzagate type people out there.  It is interesting when you read these stories the victims tell it does not matter if they were 20 years ago, a different country, etc. They all seem to carry the same theme. Feces, urine, sexual abuse, terror and outlandish stories involving animals, and maybe cartoon type characters. I think there could have been someone in a gorilla costume and his arm or finger was cut off. So if a child talks about a white rabbit abusing her, or a gorilla, people will immediately do an eye-roll and write it off the victim as having a wild imagination.  Looking forward to reading the other ones.  Thanks.

              Yeah it was local fox news on Houston TV this morning. Yes they were saying he has been innocently in prison for almost 20 years. Wait, I think he was saying it "felt" like he has been in prison for 20 years. Cloud over his head. It was indeed a couple. I remember you posting something on this, I believe, before. I was interested cause it was Austin. They were giving both sides though, so I was confused. When I saw him talk, though it was quick, I got a weird feeling he was lying. Apparently it's becoming a big story. If I remember anything else I'll let you know. I saw the little girl, clip of an interview, head obscured, they were asking her questions. The dad was saying how a kid can "say anything."

                 guess what?  they tie into this - but it will come up in part 2.  Texas attorney that was best buddy and member of the same defense lawyers association got them off and won lawyer of the year for it the same year the Keller's attorney got them sprung and won the same award.  smells like a racket to me.

                  It's not Rusty Hardin (defense attorney) is it? Or Parnham? I was on a jury for Parnham. He gave me the creeps. Slick. Whatever the case, yeah it's corrupt. It's about winning at all costs and public persona/appearance and career.

                Thanks I will. It did seem like it was being spun. That's the way you felt after the report. Towards their innocence. For some reason I wasn't convinced, though I just saw a snippet. Reminded me of Jon Benet.

            Wow! Upvoat. I hope everyone can check this out because I think this case is extremely important.

           <p>
            This is very thorough, well researched, and well written. I can't wait for part 2.

            You're so right about the satanic panic. Similar tactics have been, and will continue to be, used to discredit our work.

            It is very disappointing the Intercept would be involved in printing this. Glen Grenwald is seen as pushing the narrative to open up the government secrets.

             Glen Greenwald himself pushes hard to counter fake news media spin - he is one of the few reporters I saw deconstructing the "Russia stole the election narrative.  I hope if enough light is shed on Smith's atrocious reporting, The Intercept might have to address it publicly.  Unfortunately comments are closed on her article, but editors can be emailed here

              She lives in Austin.  That speaks volumes about her.  Texans think Austin is crazy weird.

              For background, here's an interesting article from October 2013 by pizzagate researcher Yoichi Shimatsu about Greenwald and his "boss," Pierre Omidyar:
              <a href="https://davidshurter.com/2013/10/26/saving-agent-snowden-from-his-handlers-greenwald-and-omidyar-by-yoichi-shimatsu/">

              </a>
              It's difficult to gauge to what degree Glenn Greenwald operates independently.
