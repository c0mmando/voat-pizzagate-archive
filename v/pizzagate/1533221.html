            "Snake-in-the-eye" as part of Sigurd's name denoted a physical characteristics. He was born with a mark in his left eye, described as the image of the Ouroboros (a snake biting its own tail) encircling the pupil of his eye. The snake mark had been prophesied by his mother Aslaug, the daughter of the Valkyrie Brynhildr.
           </p>
           <p>
            In modern times, it has been suggested that the mark in Sigurd's eye was a result of a congenital mutation of the PAX6 gene.

            Coloboma the eye of George Soros and Madeline McCann, they both share a congenital mutation of the PAX6 which Ashkenazi Jews are more susceptible to and I would venture many of the royal families due to limited gene pool.

            Is this where the term The Brotherhood of The Snake arises?

            " In 867 AD, The Vikings from Scandinavia, appeared near Kiev (north shore of the Black Sea), and eventually took the city from the Khazars the Turks/Jews. For some years the invaders lived side by side with the Khazars, but thereafter they put the Khazars to flight, at roughly which time the phrase, “Ashkenazi Jew,” was heard for the first time in the regions of Germany and Hungary.

            In The Year 2000 There Were Seven Countries Without A Rothschild-Owned Central Bank: They were Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Cuba, North Korea and Iran.

            "Yet Baphomet is a far, far more complex symbol. You've probably seen the image of Baphomet used as a stand-in for Satan, whether that's by would-be Satanists or paranoid Christians. ... Today, it is commonly accepted that Baphomet, similar to the Old French word Mahomet, refers to Mohammed, the Prophet of Islam."
