            No, there is no concrete evidence.  However; there is more than enough circumstantial evidence to spur an investigation if said investigation was not being blocked from the highest levels.  Remember that Al Capone was convicted on tax issues, but that doesn't mean there wasn't gangster shit going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is what, in my mind, legitimizes the investigation:
1)  Look historically at the proven ritual child abuse cases.  They all sound pretty similar and Pizzagate is no different.
            <br/>
            2) Proven pedo symbology as well as pedo art, and occult rituals right out in the open. As Joe Rogan said "Me and my friends never even joke about drinking semen".  Also, why is Podesta so interested in pedo art?  Normal people would not be interested in that crap...
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Obvious code in some of the emails.  Granted, some probably were actually about pizza and pasta...but the "playing dominos on cheese or pasta" and the Luzzato emails are obviously code for something.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) And significantly, we have the guilty behavior of the accused.  If Comet was just a restaurant, they would welcome people who were peacefully periscoping inside...that is free advertising and confirmation that it is in fact just a pizza restaurant.  If the original Besta logo was not pedo related, why change it?  Just come out and say "That is freaking ridiculous and I am not changing my non-pedo logo due to some internet conspiracy."
           </p>
           <p>
            5) There has been confirmation from more than one source that the Clinton foundation was involved in child trafficking.  (FBI anon and multiple within the NYPD that got to see the contents of Weiner's laptop).

            Pizzagate is a honey pot, the fact that AIPAC owns USA and controls politicians with child-sex black-adymail is an open secret.
           </h1>
           <p>
            To believe that a public pizza shop runs child sex slavery in DC is insane.i
           </p>
           <p>
            The MSM already thinks JQ-PUBLIC are idiots, Pizzagate will prove to the word that internet private researcher cannot be trusted, which is the agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA/FBI/CIA/MOSSAD have run the USA using Hitlers ppl ( operation paperclip ) since 1940's, MSM are just dis-info, they all go to the child fuck partys.
           </p>
           <p>
            But party on garth its all a funny as hell narrative that so many are buying the meme

            Blue-Pill PP - 
U read about other ppl who read podesta wikileaks ( I have since day one, and I ran AI algo's on the dumps RNN/LSTM
U R told that because there is code words, and 4chan is obessed with cp, that cheese pizza means cps
U get the instagram dumps which could have all been a joke or fabricated and u run with it...

            Red Pill -
           </p>
           <p>
            U read the podesta dump ( I have )
U understand the scope of +300,000 emails in context, u don't cherry pick a dozen emails and run
U understand the true history of child fucking in USA and you know who controls it, the FBI/AIPAC to control usa politicians
           </p>
           <p>
            U understand that no way in hell do ppl of power go to a public restaurant to fuck children, this shit is done in private on place like Epstein/Trump Island; The elite are NOT stupid.no
           </p>
           <p>
            In summary the MSM is red-pill they know the truth, the blue pill ppl believe in fairy tales that FBI is good and that Hebrews never fuck or pimp children in the USA.

            The way the MSM has reacted to this event is at least suspicious. Even if you're skeptical about the idea of CP being an integral part of the elite society, it's obvious there is something weird (and most likely illegal) is going on

            If this were any other topic it would be fine to just drop it... but we're talking about innocent children.. the article literally says the FBI is on his side... HOW is it okay for the FBI to take the side of an accused child sex trafficker?!?! I don't care how outrageous the claims are, the FBI should not take his side, that is not NORMAL

            This is a reprint of the NYT article almost in full.

            What 'evidence' would quality?    Comet Ping Ping put up an Instagram account and created this 'fake news' themselves.   We are asking questions.   The authorities will investigate once Trump is in office.

             Blue Pill ppl think that a few mentions of pizza in emails and some instagram photo's of pp practicing occult in DC which is super common, only a 4chan nerd liviing in a basement and having spent his life on computer games, anybody that has gone to an art show in DC in the past 50 years knows that sex&amp;death is the theme, shock art is fucking old and DC is yes, insane
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem here is that 4chan,reddit, all these forums is ppl who spend their entire lives at a keyboard ( truly blue pill insanity ), living in virtual reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             So they were fed a tiny bit of truth and 4chan ran with it and created a hysteria where 25,000 ppl keyboard warriors went nuts,
            </p>
            <p>
             Too bad that energy can't be used for good.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, if ANYBODY in the virtuual world gave a shit about 'children' they would go after AIPAC/FBI who really does murder and fuck children, but of course that topic is verboten.
