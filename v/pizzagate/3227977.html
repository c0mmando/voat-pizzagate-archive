            When I was a kid every other year or so we'd visit my mom's family  in Las Cruces and while there we'd take a day trip to Juarez for souvenirs.   I remember walking across the Rio Grande from the El Paso and seeing the little kids with baskets on poles who'd catch the coins tossed by people walking the bridge.  And the donkey shows.  "Chew vant to zee a donkey schow?" was a catcall to my older brothers and male cousins.  It was obviously a very seedy place even then.  I'm talking these are memories over 50 years old.  Geez, this world is evil.

             I asked about the "donkey shows" in Tijuana. I was told it was just a street rumor, it didn't really exist and something like that would be illegal. Here's another thing, a woman having sex with a donkey would be killed from the act. It's biologically dangerous.

              Later in life I was told by my Southwestern cousin that the shows were/are real, but there's not actual penetration involved.  Rather, the woman "merely" stimulates the donkey.  TMI, I know. Ugh.

           <p>
            Im from EP. This has been going on for decades. Here's what is known :
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Women who work at maquiladoras (Tax exempt US factories) start going missing all matching the same descriptions. Dark hair, tan skin, raped.
            </li>
            <li>
             Police claim its the work of a single serial killer but there are mass graves into the 10,000s.
            </li>
            <li>
             the bodies are all buried in the same area and new bodies end up there.
            </li>
            <li>
             US offered FBI assistance in early 2000s because the murder/rape count was stacking so high. Juarez police (who are notoriously corrupt) and gov officials declined the offer.
            </li>
            <li>
             a few weeks later they pin the crimw on two mexican bus drivers who confessed
            </li>
            <li>
             the bus drivers held a press conference afterwards saying they were beaten into confessions. they showed their would including burn marks on their testicles where police shocked them to get a confession.
            </li>
            <li>
             police claim that the case is closed despite women in Mexico still going missing and ending up in the grave site.
            </li>
            <li>
             cartel wars break out. The city is a warzone, but the missing women don't slow down
            </li>
            <li>
             when the cartel wars slow down, there is a break in the case. not much has been released but what was said is the maquiladora leadership may be facilitating this for a wealthy group. little is known past that because it is ongoing
            </li>
            <li>
             Allegedly I have a family member who survived one of these attacks, however its hard to know if its the real deal or someone using the cover of the murders there to rape that distant family member. not much to say. skimasks and left for dead. however there is a child that can be dna matched if a suspect is found.
            </li>
            <li>
             common belief is the police are the ones doing it.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            as far as any satanism angle like what
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/CPSisCorrupt">
             @CPSisCorrupt
            </a>
            stated, no one knows for sure and there isn't much on the bodies to suggest otherwise. however dark magic has a strong underground following and I have known a few cops that say there are a seriously disproportionate amount of satatic crime scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I know about vertigo is it is a super popular nightclub that isn't as popular anymore bit is somehow still around.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snuff films are definitely a thing you can get in Mexico if you know people. there is a strong gorehound scene there. Whether the vids are legit or faked is another story, but you can see murder videos all the time for free from cartels online so legit snuff for sale wouldn't surprise me.

            <p>
             I have a few questions. Where or what is "EP". I'm assuming a city?
            </p>
            <p>
             My comments to the bullet points:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Women who work at maquiladoras (Tax exempt US factories) start going missing all matching the same descriptions. Dark hair, tan skin, raped".:
            </p>
            <p>
             A factory owner controls his hiring practices. That the factories are taking photo profiles of the victims leads me to the conclusion they are in on the murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Police claim its the work of a single serial killer but there are mass graves into the 10,000s."
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course attributing the murders to the work of one or even a couple killers is simply implausible at best.
            </p>
            <p>
             "the bodies are all buried in the same area and new bodies end up there."
            </p>
            <p>
             And yet, the areas are not police monitored. No one is every seen going in or coming out. No check points or searches, ever. Police are not looking for the killers.
            </p>
            <p>
             "US offered FBI assistance in early 2000s because the murder/rape count was stacking so high. Juarez police (who are notoriously corrupt) and gov officials declined the offer."
            </p>
            <p>
             They don't want an impartial investigation which is highly interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
             "a few weeks later they pin the crime* on two mexican bus drivers who confessed"
            </p>
            <p>
             Evidence? A confession is not enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             "the bus drivers held a press conference afterwards saying they were beaten into confessions. they showed their would including burn marks on their testicles where police shocked them to get a confession."
            </p>
            <p>
             Tainted confession, no evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             "police claim that the case is closed despite women in Mexico still going missing and ending up in the grave site."
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously it didn't stop. Nothing I can add here.
            </p>
            <p>
             "cartel wars break out. The city is a warzone, but the missing women don't slow down"
            </p>
            <p>
             Who won the war?  New players, same game?  Old players still in charge, no changes?
            </p>
            <p>
             "when the cartel wars slow down, there is a break in the case. not much has been released but what was said is the maquiladora leadership may be facilitating this for a wealthy group. little is known past that because it is ongoing"
            </p>
            <p>
             My take on this, Cartels working with factory owners to provide "services" for wealthy perverts.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Allegedly I have a family member who survived one of these attacks, however its hard to know if its the real deal or someone using the cover of the murders there to rape that distant family member. not much to say. skimasks and left for dead. however there is a child that can be dna matched if a suspect is found.
common belief is the police are the ones doing it."
            </p>
            <p>
             My belief is that this is a provided service.The young ladies are the product. Bringing them is the service. Dumping the bodies is part of the service. Cartels pick up the women and deliver. Customers rape and kill the women, survivors are dispatched by police and dumped with other bodies of victims killed at rape parties. No one is allowed to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your family member will have one of two stories. Either she was taken to a place to be raped and beaten to death and then dumped or raped in the general area she was captured and then beat to death and dumped. First option means it's part of the larger operation. Second option means it's a copy cat crime using the larger operation as a cover.   If she was dumped in the same general area as other victims then that confirms it's part of the larger operation which theory would be reinforced more strongly if she was taken to a remote wealthy home to be abused. If the actual captures beat her before dumping her then it's not part of the larger operation but merely a copy cat crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the video I posted it's likely the news stations are also part of the problem as they have skewed the news to help keep the crimes covered. Police, mayor, city officials, media are all corrupted by drug cartels.
            </p>
            <p>
             Young poor and attractive women are the product, rich wealthy perverts are the customers, procurement of victims is the service, disposing of bodies is the cleanup. Media and police work together to control the public narrative. And there you have it. A complete business model.

              i relooked up the body count and may have been off by a factor of 10. the last number I read is 300+ but I know for a fact the number was said to be in the thousands when I was in highschool. something happened with the number, though to be fair it may be separating related bodies to unrelated bodies of this crime.

              That's hard to say as cartels slaughter journalists and aren't fond of people asking questions. There is a lot of minor disputes with smaller factions but the 2 big players were the Sinaloa cartel (El Chapo) and los Zetas (ex Mexican special forces that began selling drugs). Hard to say who wins and who loses especially when you get to the smaller spin off cartels.

              you aren't wrong, not 100 percent right either. Cartels extort money from all businesses in juarez. the lines between cartel and legit biz can blur sometimes. The update only specifies a wealthy group and the management is in on it.

              they're distant, Ive never met them. My guess is copycat because copy cats have been found in Juarez doing this and using this excuse or offing their wives and blaming this crime.

              maybe but unlikely. there just isn't a lot of info, the victims are intentionally poor and look like most regular Mexican women to make it bland and unremarkable to investigators. I have a feeling people who get close to the truth go missing.

             <p>
              but yeah, its fucked. I can also answer questions about Beto O'Rourke and moontime pizza....moon tome pizza isn't very exciting. Beto is a piece of work and Im shocked he's in politics. The death blow of the weird tax shit still hasn't hit mainstream news making me think someone's keeping that in their back pocket.

               LOL. Thanks. I was straining my mind trying to think of a Mexican city with those abbreviations. Dummy me!
              </p>
              <p>
               So, conclusion between us is that factory owner connections need to be carefully looked at. All factories whose workers have been murdered, the names of victims and factory owners names listed and which workers were hired by which factories. That much is now clear.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for correcting your victim count estimation. I do wonder why they were telling school kids these inflated numbers. Maybe some of the teachers in "EP" were just spouting "facts" to kids and got it wrong. Anyways, maybe that's not so important as to why they would say that. Teachers are often not the best at facts.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
               So, we don't really know which cartel is currently controlling Juarez now? Are the murders still an ongoing problem? Are police being open about what's going on? Are they hiding the data now?
              </p>

               " Cartels extort money from all businesses in juarez. the lines between cartel and legit biz can blur sometimes."
              </p>
              <p>
               Sure, I get that. What's important I think is which factories the murdered ladies were working at and their hiring practices, such as taking profile photos. That's a dead signal they are actively cooperating with cartels to use their database as a "catalog" of prospective victims. They would also be able to tip off cartels to the address of the victims and times of work so the cartels could send out a pick up squad to take the victims off the street when they are on their way to work.

               One victim was actually taken to a news station before being killed. By now I have no problem believing the news orgs have been coopted by the cartels. Silenced and controlled. Fake news just like CNN.

               Also interesting is who is flying what airport in Juarez, where wealthy ranch houses are around Juarez and what might be interesting about Beto's family. Particularly his father.

                Ill start with the Beto stuff. Everyone knows he drunk drove killed a guy then daddy pressured everyone to back off. What's known in EP but not talked about is that there is shady unreported income with taxes they've been investigated for. Beto is a punk kid who thought he'd be the next break out star of Rl Paso (granted for music, not so much politics). Allegedly (don't know for a fact rumors) Beto used to deal. Nothing serious but there were multiple run ins with cops that dad pulled strings for.
               </p>
               <p>
                As for any pedo shit. I keep trying to say this on here but no one listens. There isn't much evidence there other than he played in a rock band a bit too long in his life.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've said this before about moontime pizza, it is located next to UTEP. it was a legit pizza place durring the day and a pubk bar at night. I would go there to see shows in my late teens. weird performers were the norm at the time cause bands needed a gimick to get people in. They'd do 18+ shows and occasionally show some shock footage (like a woman giving birth video that you can see on YouTube thats graphic). This was also en vouge for the time and area, so playing in a bunny outfit was far from head turning.

                If you wanna find the nastier stuff it more than likely is in money laundering and drugs. Beto has been caught doing dirty shit to sneak in illegals though.
               </p>
               <p>
                Look up when new mexico hav to have every government official replaced for corruption and the recent attempt in sunland park nm (next to juarez and el paso) to sneak a caravan through.
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 as for Juarez
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                things have calmed down, businesses are rebuilding but its a mess still. Juarez has always been dangerous, but durring the cartel war you could get caught in crossfire. it was a literal warzone. Its back to being calmer but you could still get arrested by corrupt cops for no reason or shanked in a bar fight.
               </p>
               <p>
                police in Juarez are corrupt as fuck. hard to blame them, step on wrong toes they kill your family or you. None the less they are part of the problem.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have no clue who controls Juarez. keep in mind sinaloa v zetas is a super simplistic way of putting it. Its like explaining Game of Thrones as Tygerians v Lannisters. I have no clue who or what is in control now. Hell we didn't even really know who was in control back then. Narcos are narcos to normies and you don't ask much else

                 Thanks. Everything you commented on makes sense for me. For sure, Beto/Robert is just an awkward guy who never seems to have a serious deep thought. I think he's just trying to fit into a role he has no heart or mind for.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Basically, he seems like a tool for someone else. His father though, I think there's something there. He may be part of that Arizona political gang I have been hearing about. Tijuana was becoming so crime ridden a few years back that the federal government came in and took over police duties for a time. Lots of cops were drummed out of the police force on corruption charges. It's still fairly safe there as it's a major tourist attraction  but business is way down compared to the way it used to be before Obama. Under Obama two things happened, first, our economy sucked so that crimped the day time shopping to just things Mexican Americans would go down there to get and much less tourist shopping. Then, the navy forbid anyone from going down there for drinking parties so the night life was choked way down. They are hurting pretty bad now for income, so much, shop keepers will beg you to buy something. The pedestrian bridge used to be lined with scores of trinket booths but now there are only a few here and there. Then they changed the taxi area which was home to lots more small shops and moved the bridge crossing so it's all messed up now. Also, right now the caravans brought in thousands of "refugees" and I haven't been back to check it out but I can imagine it's hell down there now.

             Right. Thanks for the reminder. I think the rumor was that he had his throat cut by a boy/assassin he was diddling. Supposedly he was found fully dressed, laying on a bed with a pillow over his face. No autopsy as I remember it and his body was cremated? Check me if I'm wrong on anything. A very convenient death. Didn't pan out so well for the DNC.

            Friendly reminder that the children of three (!) former .Mexican presidents have been members of NXIVM, one of them , Salinas, seems to be the current head, after Raniere went to jail.

            Also, Raniere´-s first sex slaves, three underage girls, were from.Mexico.

            And, last not least, Epstein seems to have trafficked Russian girls via the Mexican border.

            This is appalling. There were instances of 7 yr old girls. It would be great to have the flight logs for that private airport landing they refer to where the rich Americans come in. Most likely groups of these sick fucks looking to rape torture and murder young teens. Too bad there is no kind of drone to harbor above these compounds or cameras to capture the men coming and going. Yes obviously the cops and politicians are involved in Juarez but don’t forget the cartels they reign on top with complete control of this. The video even mentions initiation of joining eluding to torture and killing a girl. These shit jobs these girls have down there in sweatshops take their photos for work are you serious? Catalogs end up in the US of these girls for men to choose from. Mexico is complete garbage for doing nothing to help stop this. Any private plane going into Mexico from the US should be closely looked at especially just across the border in dumpy Juarez. You could only assume they advise this shit on the dark web.

             Yes. Appalling and horrific. I've been lurking on the forums, watching Q and twitter for a couple of years now. Listening to all the rumors about trafficking and pedophilia. Watching this show certainly adds more bits to the puzzle. I wonder how much Q team and our military know about this. Remember, it was in court I think that Guzman talked about giving 100 million to the previous Mexican president. Then, Nancy Pelosi goes down there for a meet up and after that her and all her friends did an about face on the border to reduce security. Her hard stance against a border wall. She got a kick back from that hundred million? Is that why they went down there, to get a payoff from the cartel to ignore drug trafficking? And thereby empower the cartels which control Juarez and victimize girls for fun and profit? It's beginning to make sense now how these connections work. And yes, it would be highly useful to track who owns or charters planes that simply cross the border to land close to the other side, who and how long those people stay there and when they come back. Where are they landing on the US side? Highly interesting.

              LeeDoverwood......Nancy Pelosi was in Germany not too long ago too? Mafia family like clinton....recent conviction of cardinal pell at the vatican for pedaphilia ...........he was treasurer and money launderer..pope was in charge of covering for pedaphile priests ..they are taking a hit not only money wise but prestige. Watch for more convictions of mafia and drug busts.....they no longer have the money and protection.....They are converging with mormons on the QT. Only Kevin Annette covers this..very hush hush in US.

               Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventist Church, all have one thing in common. They all have Masons as founding fathers of their church. In the case of SDA, they had Ellen G. White whose husband was a high ranking Mormon. E. G. White copied some of her writings and ideology from Joseph Smith.

               "Although astonishing, It Is true. In 1977, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists presented a gold medallion to Pope Paul VI, as an expression of our close friendship with the Papal States."

            Serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, who claimed to be a member of a Satanic cult known as the Hand of Death (Lucas said the cult included prominent VIPs, including politicians, amongst its membership, which may explain why both he and his partner Otis Toole had their death sentences commuted by then Governors George and Jeb Bush in Texas and Florida respectively), described a ranch in Juarez belonging to the cult to which Lucas delivered children that he abducted in both the U.S. and Mexico for the purposes of child trafficking, Satanic Ritual Abuse and child pornography/snuff movie production, so it almost certainly pertains to elite child sexual abuse/trafficking (please see below).

              My username is what it is because Pittsburgh is where a lot of European outcasts settled that where kicked out of their towns for being disgusting. Many cults from Germany, England, Italy, and Eastern Europe settled in PA in the 1800's and early 1900's. It's all the same Sodomite garbage.

               Known for corruption during the revolutionary war .....evil stays in certain locations. Wasn't this the first state that openly prosecuted catholic priests who were pedaphiles? Note location and influence of catholic church in world wide pedaphilia rings?

               Also many of the blacks in Pittsburgh partake in voodoo. I've seen it. Pittsburgh is a major center for all kinds of debauchery such as the furry/bestiality movement. Many Catholic pedo priests are still abusing children. Many of the Protestant churches are just as bad. The children's book "Pickles from Pittsburgh," and Heinz ketchup are this Sodom's legacies of it's pedovore pedophilia. This city was founded on occult principles dating back to Babylon like thousands of others around the world are.

             The murders of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez since 1993 have received international attention, primarily due to perceived government inaction in preventing violence against women and girls and bringing perpetrators to justice.

            Many of those who were raped and murdered were underage girls, and the elite looked away, and thus facilitated the crimes.

            And probably the police, state attorneys, politicians and judges were even involved. As usual.

             Bad things were going on there even in the early '70's. There was a bridge from El Paso to Juarez and border crossing by Americans was easy. There were "dentist" offices on every corner. These were the fronts for prostitution. Also, drugs flowed easily into the U.S. from there.

Overlooked at times amid the all-encompassing violence were the unexplained disappearances of hundreds of young women, and it’s now obvious that the sex-trafficking operation brought to light at trial was hidden in plain sight. … Perla Ivonne Aguirre Gonzalez, 15, was abducted not long after the end of her shift at a fast-food restaurant downtown. Deysí Ramírez Muñoz, 16, was dismissed from her factory job without warning at 8 a.m. Her family suspects she was kidnapped on her return home, while changing buses downtown. Jazmín Salazar Ponce, 17, went to ask for a job at a shoe store downtown and disappeared.

Sick shit amigo. Its too late for me to get into details, am too tired, but let me know if should continue on the subject.

             Did the murders increase after NAFTA became law? Read about this years ago. Women waiting for buses early in the morning were raped and murdered , often.

              I posted a thread on pizzagatewhatever, take a look :)
Look into Black House Mexican Pizza. They have an abandoned local that is very suspect. Near the only Lodge/LDS temple in the city. It has barred windows and chained doors. No one is making pizza out of this local... So what do they store there?

               One man wrote a fb review, saying it was "rich" pizza. On his fb page, he wears a mason ring. It's tied to the elite/masons and probably the usual money laundering/child procurement operation.
