            Thank you for bringing this up. This has been a concern of mine from the beginning. And now I've learned that many of the support programs (including child protective services and even some social workers themselves) are often part of the sex trafficking rings, where can these victims go? And the suspected number of victims is mind boggling! They're going to need longterm and extensive emotional therapy and possibly also physical therapy for their injuries. They'll also need homes, clothing, schooling, food, etc. And love. Lots of unconditional, safe love. And how will they not have major trust issues? Due to the sheer number of people who will need assistance, I think we all need to be prepared to help in ways that right now we can't even imagine. The adult victims will be starting over, and they may not have family available to them. As for the children, sadly, we can't assume that their families will be financially equipped to help them sufficiently. Also, recovering damages from civil suits takes an enormous amount of time and resources. That's the average civil suit. THESE victims will be fighting against the most powerful people on the planet who have nearly unlimited resources. It won't be much faster or easier for class action lawsuits, either. We as citizen investigators may have another important role to fulfill after the victims are rescued-- we may have to fight just as hard for their recovery.

            Demand reparations. There will be hundreds if not thousands of victims. Victims and if they died then their families will demand more than prison time for the perps.

             My concern is what if the victims have no family members or worse what if the family is/are the perpetrators of the crime? It's just very concerning to think that some of those who are rescued will just go back into the system. We as citizens definitely need to demand harsher punishment for those convicted of child abuse and trafficking.

            Lots of psychotherapy.  Its gonna be a emotional rollercoaster parallel to
Trying to care for a severe drug addict or someone with a dibilatating
Sickness.  You will see promising days and then uncertainty things will get better.  Many just wind up back being exploitated and abused.

            Very important topic. I was horrified when I read this article. We -as a society- are not equipped to help victims bc it seems that hasn't been the priority. We have a system that encourages, perpetuates these atrocities. How do we help? I have no idea but I want to. Have there been any "good" organizations that really fight human trafficking and help victims?

             My thoughts as well, I'm very concerned because I as a citizen have no idea where victims can turn to without being victimized again.  I'm not sure of what organizations have or have not been compromised, and if I had the power to help house one or two victims I would but alas I'm in my early twenties in school so it'll be a while before I have the financial assets to do so.
