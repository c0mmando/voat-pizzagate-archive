            At about 1:15 Ms. Jenkins was walking around the hotel. But when Jenkins is next sighted exiting an elevator at 3:25 a.m., she is alone and visibly impaired, and staggers out of the elevator, briefly leaning on the wall for support before heading down the hallway.  So she drank enough in about 2 hrs.  to make her stagger and drunk.  At no point in the footage provided to CNN can Jenkins be seen walking into the freezer.  Now why did Andrew Holmes, say the Rosemont Police showed him a video with her walking into the freezer?  The last clip shows Jenkins stumbling through the hotel kitchen, which appears to be empty. She walks out of view of the cameras at 3:32 a.m., the last time she was seen before her body was found in the hotel's walk-in freezer.   A Kitchen?  I watched the video and there was not a kitchen and why would the kitchen be closed at 3:30?  Are they not preparing for a Brunch or Breakfast Orders Soon?  This stinks.

            There is another Gaming Site right nearby and these are both really close to O'Hare Airport   Really looking at this it looks like Party Central.  There is also Lutheran General Hospital nearby and it has a Trauma Center with a HELIPORT

             Another casino between Chicago and Gary, Indiana. Big tall casino/hotel right next to a little river (or inlet) off of Lake Michigan and it's in the seediest area that's purely made up of mills, shipping type businesses, excavating.... basically just very industrial; no housing or even trees around.

              Whenever there is the usual set up, hospital places of entertainment and music, shopping and not near residential areas, it points to a perfect set up.  An airport of heliport at the hospital is ideal as well.  Gary, Indiana is another place there is a lot of the same going on, very poor area with little kids in a one parent home, unattended after school, etc.  Recipe for Disaster.

            OK, found a different article that tells a little more.  I am going to look up the casino now.  Also if someone wants to look up the shopping mall and see if there are any missing people..... Also this Andrew Holmes in the article is a little too insistent for people to not look into the case, seems he is saying it looks like she walked into the freezer, which he says the policed showed him that video.  What video is that?  Also what party was she at, I remember reading she was at a party given by the hotel, but cannot find it now.

              Lots of teens hanging out in malls.  No matter where they live nowadays, that is what they like to do.   Casino, Shopping Malls, Hotels. Airport, Hospital with Trauma Center and Heliport.  Can you think of any reason why the freezer was still plugged in when the kitchen looked unused?  And why it did not have a safety latch on it or lock?  This is really a strange one, imo.

            If you guys pay attention to the video you'll see it's heavily sliced and in some parts There's an actress playing her. 
She was thicker than Kenneka, Hair different, clothes different, shoes and watch.

             If you go to Lipsick Alley and Search for her name there's a similar thread to this one. At the end of the posts you'll then see pages all by the same author/handle with 2 vid links.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a lot of extra info you are missing. In sum the victim's 2 very jealous girlfriends sold her to several perps for a gang bang and murder on live FB with a snuff film being made at the same time. Then her body was put in the working freezer until it could be picked up and used in the organ sales market. Selena Gomez, a known alcoholic, had an organ transfer at the same time. Not a coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a FB feed of her screaming for help from her 2 traitorous girlfriends who had turned up the music on full blast so no one could hear her. They had tricked her into going to a big party. They wanted expensive faux designer handbags.
            </p>
            <p>
             Watch the 2 linked videos. The 1st one thoroughly and slowly goes over the facts of the case including the FB feed. The 2nd vid by the same host is a follow-up with additional info.  There are extensive comments after both vids. The best of them are combined in posts at the end of the same LSA thread.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that no one could find the exact name of everyone who owned the hotel. It's suspected there are organized crime investors/owners. After all why would a cold, newish, obviously hooked up and in working condition freezer be standing alone not immediately near a location where food was being stored? Or even prepared?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also note that Chicago is run by those with a certain rep. That of course includes anyone connected with LE and government. So will all of the owners and hotel management team be sued for not protecting the victim, a hotel guest? Some of those directly involved with her murder as well as the 100 lb young woman worked at least part-time for the hotel. That's why there's been such a huge cover up. Need FBI involvement.

            Freezing a body is a great way to preserve the integrity of all of the organs.  Not sure about the eyes.  Those can usually be popped out anti-mortem.

            I had my brother in law who's from aurora area at the house talking about this. Like it was some party at the hotel and may have been lured there by one the girls she went with, who also worked there. He also said there were different videos on Facebook posted by family going around hearing her call for help?! It may be an exaggerated story but seems to have a different tone and that was 9 am Thursday.. IDK I haven't searched anything, just read this post.  Wouldn't surprise me to have a coverup. she may have been cornered and trying to get away from certain activities?

             Yup, the party was being thrown by someone who used to work at the hotel. There was a good 40-50 people in one hotel room, so it was pretty obvious they were throwing a party. Why this was ignored by the hotel owners and staff is beyond me. The girl who used to work there was just a front desk clerk, it's not like they turned a blind eye to this because she was someone important or something. Also, if you watch the raw footage, it's pretty clear that the girl in question is looking for someone and left the party on purpose to go find them. What they told her they were meeting for, I have no idea.

              I've been following this since the Monday after she died. There wasn't 30-40 people there. There was 3-4 girls and 3-4 boys. She went with her best friend who went live on FB during the party. She is wearing mirrored glasses and you can see a girl giving a guy a bj in her glasses. One girl (maybe Kenneka-the one that died) asks for help, like she was being hurt, and the girl turns up the music. You can also hear the girls discussing $200, like they solicited some guys to give them $200 for sex. Kenneka was taken to the party and didn't know about this. Also the girl with the glasses WORKS at the hotel (currently) and she got the room. There is video footage of the girls walking around the hotel around 1 am, and Kenneka looked sober. Then there is the video footage of the Kenneka stumbling around the hallways around 4:00 am. What has been altered from the original video is that you can see 2 men following her- in the police version you don't..What they think happened to her is that she wandered in the basement kitchen and the two men grabbed her and raped her. Being as intoxicated and drugged out it's possible they killed her during the act and dumped her in the freezer. Or, they threw her alive in the freezer and she couldn't get out and died. There is no mention of organs missing, but she was found naked from the waste up. I don't think this has anything to do with organ harvesting or Pizzagate. I think she was roofied and two young men found her walking around wasted and took advantage of her. This is what I have understood so far, I've watched the video from her friends during the party and their pleading innocent after she was found on their FB pages. Sorry to spoil the mystery, but this isn't what you think it is. It was stupid kids doing illegal activities and it went too far.

               Wow, thank you. Just goes to show that literally everything I read from official news sources was wrong.

               This even got to the conspiracy sub on reddit. That might not seem like much, but it means that 'mainstream' is getting interested and even THEY are calling bullshit on this story. Further research, coupled with your post and info, has lead to a better idea of this area. This Hotel is sketchy as FUCK. There are so many first hand accounts and online ratings for this place that makes this place look like a seedy nightmare.

                Well, I tracked down her "best friend" on FB. Everyday she makes public posts about how sorry she is and that she had nothing to do with her death. She supposedly tried to kill herself. This is her best friend and the live FB feed she made earlier in the night. Check out her glasses,you can see a guys pants around his ankles and a girl kneeling in front of him. Watch before she starts to rap, you can hear a faint '"help me" and she turns up the music and starts to rap and dance. There is an enhanced audio of it too on YouTube. I'm not proclaiming to 
know the truth, only check the stories of the people that were there.

                . This video is of the original footage put out before the police got a hold of it. These girls proclaim there were two men following her. (In their hip language)

            Took over 24 hours and drunk. Who knows what else was put in this girl's drink with research chemicals and such. Keeping body cold? Sounds like organ harvesting.

             My exact thought.  When she is walking down that hall you do not see her anymore.  So, we do not know who may have grabbed her.  Maybe she was trying to find her way out of that awful place.  I hope I remember to look up the former research on that casino.  Will have to look that up.

              Would love to help you out, Carmencita; it's just that I only know the area just from driving by on the toll road because I live in a different area of Chicago that isn't very close to Rosemont. Like this part of town isn't my stomping grounds at all. I just know that there's the concert arena that's very large, an outlet mall, lots of hotels and convention centers, and mainly it's close vicinity to O'Hare. It isn't a good part of town by a long shot. It isn't the most dangerous area of Chicago and, in fact, I'd walk around and feel safe.... it just isn't high-end &amp; classy by a long shot.

               That's already a big help because now I can look up all those different places.   We know there is a casino where unfortunately a lot of poor people looking for that one shot of good luck.  Also concerts is where a lot of teens attend as well as outlet malls.  We also know that having an airport near is a good place for organ harvesting. This imo,  is one of their  perfectly arranged Crime Centrals.  Now maybe there is a Children's Hospital, or Orphanage, or something Child Related nearby.  That is their MO.

                 Thank you.  I am trying to get to that.  I am very involved with the research right now on the posts of

                 </a>
                 in posted in pizzagatewhatever.  It is a mind boggling amount of clues, evidence and information.  I am waiting to get more news as well in regards to the tape, which the family now feels was tampered with.  That was my first thought as soon as I saw the girl walking down the hall and then whoops! the tape just cuts off as she turns the corner.  EDIT:  Please check out his posts in pizzagatewhatever.  Exceptional.

             Since you have it all locked up, why don't you give the police in Rosemont a call.  So because she is a black "chick" she is stupid?  This is in an area we have researched before.  It is in the vicinity of a large casino that is also known for trafficking.  There is something else going on here besides as you say a stupid black "chick".  Which imo, is totally uncalled for.

               We don't know HOW she got drunk.  They ply them with liquor before they rape them to get them what they want them to do.  Have you not paid attention to how it is done?  You have been on here over a whole year.  I think you have more sense than that.

                  Were I there, near the body or bereaved, I would be respectful. Was curious enough about our rituals involving the dead to ask my question.

                   Yes, there are some we need not respect, those we know that have made others suffer horrible cruel acts.  I am sure you agree on people like Dahmer and his ilk.  Those are people that have been reported on.  This young lady we know nothing about.  It seems the hotel was not interested in assisting until the cameras showed up.
