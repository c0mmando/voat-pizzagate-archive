            There might be a lot of people like me, who do believe there is something to it, but are new to these forums and don't really know how to contribute. It took me over a month to even comment on here because I've been so wrapped up in educating myself about everything.

              Thanks, as appalling as this entire situation is, I'm glad I'm here too. Just hoping I can contribute eventually, in some way, because I don't think there is a much greater purpose than protecting children.

              I think anyone with a conscience has to at least look into this, the problem is if they look in all the wrong places and believe the MSM. As someone who stopped listening to them long ago, I found you guys pretty easily, but I do worry that there are many others who won't. So I am wondering how best to get the word out? Instead of trying to completely convince people myself, I have mostly been trying to convince them to just do their own research, especially outside of MSM, and join the convo here. I keep trying to convey that any and all allegations of child abuse should be taken very seriously and investigated thoroughly, with absolutely no exceptions. It's something that you should never just take somebodies word on, or dismiss outright because it doesn't sound plausible enough. There is so much proof of pedophile rings, there is just no excuse to claim the impossibility or even improbability of it anymore. The fact that all the major news outlets are content with telling us "there's nothing to see here" when there hasn't been an official investigation to prove or disprove these allegations is the biggest red flag possible. That alone should make anyone question their integrity and do some research about it elsewhere. Even if you don't believe in #pizzagate, or are not convinced, you should still support an investigation proving whether or not children have been harmed. And if the authorities won't do this, and the MSM won't call for this, than I guess we need to do it our damn selves. Grateful for all of you who feel the same way and have done so much already. Keep up the good work.

               the most effective way I got people to become concerned, is to link them the pizzagate documentary. The channel name "TitusFrost" reuploaded the video. It had 240,000 views before youtube took it down.

            Saw it polled for the first time and 50% of Trump voters believe in Pizzagate.  That's, what, 25-30 million people?
