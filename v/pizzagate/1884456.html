            I just posted an article with some more research on this. I am glad I am not the only one that saw this and got a 'ding' from hearing Skippy!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have forwarded it to the Justice for Cathy Cesnik Facebook group. What they do with it is up to them. Creepily it seems to involve both Podesta brothers...

             Someone told me that he studied to be a Jesuit priest. Here is the only reference I could find on that.

              Interesting. In my research I've found the higher level Jesuits are involved in some pretty sick stuff, Luciferian stuff.. Good to hear others are making connections and putting things together. The police sure aren't.

             I passed it to them as well. Thank you! Maybe if several people send them the info, it will spur them to look into it. Someone posted a pic of him in college to this post and he had a moustache.

             May be total coincidence but how many men walk around with a name like Skippy?

            Thanks you for reposting this.  I was really shocked to see that name.  These episodes are right up our alley with the sex ring being run by a priest including the LE.  Throw in someone named Skippy and all I can say is this should not be missed by anyone of us if at all possible. Let's hope when people in Baltimore see it it will jog their memories.  Anyone remember a young man  named Skippy, from the 1960's.   OK, so I looked up where Podesta studied to b a Jesuit and it must have been Georgetown since he went there and it is a Jesuit School.  I also looked up the distance from Georgetown Univ. to Baltimore and it is only 42.8 miles.  Anything is possible, as we well know.

             Podesta studied to be a priest?!?!?
            </p>
            <p>
             I know nothing about Catholicism so this might be a really dumb assertion but the priest who was Sister Cathy's best friend/secret boyfriend was a Jesuit. Are all priests Jesuits?

              No not all of them are Jesuits.  The Jesuits are quite a group .  They are known as The Society of Jesus

              &gt; As you might know pope Francis is a Jesuit. Georgetown U. is Jesuit.  Who knows why he studied, he is so screwed up we don't know why he went there now do we?  These people go to Church to keep up appearances while they committ their heinous acts. I had a feeling there might be a connection with the Jesuits and the story.

             Podesta went to Knox College in Illinois but he did study to become a Jesuit at Georgetown.  Where did he go for his summers?  I tried to find out if Fr. Maskell was a Jesuit.
