<p>Orwell was briefly taught French by Aldous Huxley. Huxley was friends of Alice Astor (check that BL).

<p>Of course Parsons was connected to Oppenheimer, who worked with Richard Feynman, declared as the second Dirac. Feynman was one of the noted speakers of the Esalen institute, which we shall return to shortly. Parson leader of the Agape Chapter of the OTO and connected to none other than L.RON HUBBARD, founder of scientology.</p>
<p>Did anyone see the bizarre photograph of Suri Cruise with questionable adult novelty candy of a sexual theme? I digress.</p>
<p>Part 2
“The work of the laboratory culminated in the creation of several atomic devices, one of which was used in the first nuclear test near Alamogordo, New Mexico, codenamed “Trinity”, on July 16, 1945”</p>
<p>That will be an unholy trinity then, yes yes?</p>
<p>Interesting #opdeatheaters are using the image of ERIS a mind control victim as their emblem. The little girl with the apple inscribed with K which stands for Kallista. Eris outside of the discordant Greek Goddess, was a character in Robert Anton Wilson (friends of Leary and speaker at the Esalen institute.) The book features, the implication of mind control by way of electric shocks being issued, until the female responds satisfactorily to the name “Eris.” The book was designed as a “perception changer” and they do explicitly mention this, within the book itself. It’s about sex magic, in part.</p>
<p>It is rumoured Sharon Tate visited the Esalen the night prior to her death. Interestingly, Hunter S Thompson worked as a care taker for the place. A journalist who was living with Thompson at one point noted his attempt to have her watch a snuff film – to her disgust and at which point she left the premises.
●http://www.pw.org/content/memory_hunter_s_thompson_postcard_louisville_kentucky
Even more interestingly, the name Hunter Thompson is mentioned by a victim of what could be described as SRA and child snuff films, in which it is alleged a man by the name of Hunter Thompson was apparently holding the camera during the filming of one of these evil happenings. (see Franklin Cover-Up)</p>

<p>Does Bill Hicks say what I think he says at 2:13 of this video?</p>
<p>“Well as far as the 12 year old girls, keep up the good work”</p>
<p>Well they do say part of the programming is the minds desire to whitewash authority figures… Bill Hicks is called a prophet, a saint, what else? His production company Sacred Cow comes from Sacred Chaos, which brings us back to discordian programming and why Nixon’s former advisor Frank Gannon, handled Bill Hicks.</p>
<p>Ping Pong this is reality calling.</p>
<p>Well Burroughs had a saying for it (not that I trust him ONE BIT – after the wife shooting, dodgy going ons and strange meeting with Kurt Cobain prior to his death) 27 as in 72 names of God?</p>
<p>“A paranoid-schizophrenic is a guy who just found out what’s going on.” Burroughs.</p>
<p>(Although William Burroughs attended John Burroughs school, they are apparently not related in blood but there is an interesting photograph of the schools namesake (John Burroughs) with Henry Ford and Thomas Edison. Henry Ford “American Hero”, ironically received the highest nazi honour. He was also mentioned in Mein Kampf and gained industrialisation inspiration from, wait for it… The animal slaughterhouse “disassembly” line in Chicago.
●In 1938, Ford was awarded Nazi Germany’s Grand Cross</p>
<p>Let’s consider this quote: “while there are slaughterhouses, there shall be battlefields.” Tolstoy</p>
<p>The nazi death camps often contained abattoirs and accounts from Hitler’s chef conclude he was not a vegetarian by any means.</p>
<p>Part 3
Edison was up to shenanigans relating to the work of Tesla. Who’s technology was used on 9/11 2001, exactly ten years after George Bush Senior mentions The New World Order and on that day his son Dubbya sat reading “my pet goat” upside down in a school, while exotic weapons and very likely microwave technology (which accounts for unburned paper tumbling down the streets of New York)
Tesla moved towards vegetarianism in his life interestingly.</p>

            This thread mentions real/valid links and data points, but they are not fully explored/connected here. Eg" Esalen -&gt; Huxley -&gt; Tavistock etc etc etc. Also the Manson murders factoid is incorrect as far as I am aware. Charles manson apparently visited Esalen shortly before the murders.
