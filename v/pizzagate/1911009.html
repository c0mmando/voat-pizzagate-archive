<p><em>Summation: Seth Rich’s murder is central to Pizzagate. The Wikileaks email drop started Pizzagate, and if Seth Rich was the leaker, then he’s the one that deserves the credit for exposing the truth of what was going on in the dirty world of the Cannibal Elite.</em></p>
<p>There have been quite a few threads already posted about Seth Rich’s murder. I hadn’t intended to post about it, but I came across something that I haven’t seen discussed. It relates to a couple of my earlier posts. One was about Jamie T and the other was about the Pegasus Museum and what Pegasus might symbolize. In the Jamie T post, I noticed so many shots of construction sites that it made me wonder why the pics were taken. JA’S group doesn’t usually do things without having a specific agenda. And in the Pegasus Museum post, I wondered aloud if we weren’t missing something. I feel very strongly that we are. Here are the links to those posts and what I found:</p>

<p>A few nights ago, I stumbled on a blog I’ve sourced before. It’s called Popville and it’s endlessly informative. In this case of Seth Rich’s murder, it came through again. It’s dated July 10, 2016 and here’s the link: </p>

<p>The blog is about the shooting of Seth Rich, but the real beauty of this is the comment section. There re a lot of remarks, and they all point to a central issue which is that the exact same section of the block of Flagler was problematic. They all indicate that the DC police were aware of the problem and that they’ve done nothing to stop the neighborhood from being terrorized. They also expose another angle which is that the DC Water construction is exacerbating the violence …. allowing it to flourish. Numerous comments call out DC Water for not using due diligence in providing lighting they’re mandated to provide. Hence, the street is “pitch black”. Here are just some of the comments that illustrate citing DC Water as an active player in making the street unsafe: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The neighborhood has been terrorized by a group of criminals for the last month, all incidents – same pattern. Unfortunately, the last one left no witness. What will be the tipping point for officials?”</p>
<p>“The neighborhood construction impedes the cops ability to canvass the streets, offers hiding places for criminals  …  Crimes near the construction zones have been going on since they first started. Attempted rapes, break-ins and muggings … it’s just more concentrated in the last month.”</p>
<p>“last evening waking down Flagler at 10 pm it was pitch black. None of the lights DC Water says were installed were on.”</p>
<p>“Lights are out on the walkway at 1st and V as well. DC Water is going to get its butt sued off at some point.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting to note that two days later (July 12), the situation has not even been rectified. </p>

<p>I’m going to highlight some crucial points: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I noticed that the east-side sidewalk on the 2200 block of Flagler Place is still almost completely dark as one walks north towards Adams Street –see attached photo. Additionally, the sidewalk dead-ends due to DC Water project fences that continue to block access to Adams Street. This morning, I walked down the stretch and could see that the light fixture on top of the DC Water fence is missing lightbulbs –see attached photo. It’s beyond my comprehension that such a situation would exist given what has happened in this area in recent days.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was more than outraged at reading this. Because of the construction, DC Water turned the street into a DEAD END, and every person walking down that street into a potential victm. It is beyond comprehension … as Is the DC Water’s issued statement. You’ll find it quoted in this blog and it rings as a talking head talking doublespeak and droning, “Blah, blah, blah …” </p>
<p>The talking head’s name at the bottom of the statement is a George Hawkins. I’ve never come across that name before and was curious about him, so I went dumpster diving and was more than surprised at what came up. </p>

<p>This announcement is dated August 5, 2016, LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER SETH RICH’S MURDER. Is the announcement the firing of George Hawkins for doing such a wretched job? On the contrary, it seems he was rewarded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“White House Appoints DC Water CEO George S. Hawkins To National Infrastructure Advisory Council”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now why would a man that has failed to provide minimum safety requirements for the citizens of Bloomingdale be being rewarded in this way? The timing is just so so so suspicious. And further, why would someone incompetent be given such an appointment? Maybe because he wasn’t incompetent. In fact, maybe he was excellent at doing his job. Maybe this is exactly what was supposed to happen. </p>
<p>The “tunneling” project targeting Flagler, Adams, V, First, and Thomas streets was soundly criticized by the residents, but the project was “pushed through” because of flooding the previous year. As we all know, flooding can easily be caused by someone backing up the drainage systems. The conditions can be pretty easily reproduced, but there’s this “tunneling” project (did I say “TUNNELING”) again?) and the very charming Mr. Hawkins showing his true colors. Just read what he said to a citizen’s concerns: </p>

<p>Yes, he has a whole team of lawyers! Might makes right, and this bastard was given this cushy NIA position?  Awesome! Can’t have enough bastards in key strategical positions, now can we? And in terms of the area, the violence is still going on. This despite the project being concluded: </p>

            She joined the local Bloomingdale web community and from reports virtually confirmed the MDC has the store video footage - which I think Rod Wheeler confirmed to George Webb.

             I think it's astounding that if there is footage, that no stills have been released. The quality is sometimes pathetic, but I'm constantly amazed that citizens do recognize the perps even from the grainiest/most pixelated videos. Again, the parents are silent on this. Does this mean, the DC police do not have anything on film? Or they do have something on video, but the parents are so passive and docile that they never raised a fuss about why these aren't being distributed to the news media.

            You know, while there has been a rather dramatic increase in crime in the Bloomingdale area it really hasn't been all that violent. Being robbed at gunpoint is a terrible crime and I guess qualifies as a violent crime but in actuality until Seth Rich's case, no one was beat up or injured or killed by these robbers. There are fake guns readily available that are identical to the real thing that could  have been used in the "silver gun" robberies for all we know. What I'm suggesting is the DC police wants us to believe that Seth Rich's  was a predictable and logical extension of what was already occurring in that neighborhood  and that's just not true.  Seth Rich was the only white homicide in DC for 2016 per other posts and in an affluent neighborhood at that.  So his death was very unique.

            Before this disappears below the horizon, I think I might have found the beginnings of when this "sewer system" overhaul tunneling was put into place. I did some digging on our little friend George Hawkins. I had to laugh when visiting his site:
            <a href="http://georgehawkins.net/">
             http://georgehawkins.net/

            There's a pdf I found where Anacostia Watershed Society filed suit against the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) about sewage spillover. If you do a search you'll find that four non-profits joined force to get the sewage overflow problem taken out from the WSSC hands. It seems one of the "problems" was that the WSCC was respecting property rights:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Although WSSC has completed the majority of this work, it has been unable to complete a sizable portion of the work due to delays in obtaining necessary permits from governmental agencies, and the need to institute condemnation proceedings to obtain access to private property to perform sewer work.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What's really interesting is that this affects national parks. Do they mean Rock Creek Park? Hmmmmm ....
           </p>
           <p>
            There's another ruling:
            <a href="http://wamu.org/story/11/07/26/dc_water_gm_says_ruling_could_affect_water_bills/">
             http://wamu.org/story/11/07/26/dc_water_gm_says_ruling_could_affect_water_bills/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The ruling allowed "skimmer" boats to be purchased and used. There were two non-profits in on the ruling. They're not named, but I'm wondering if one is this Anacostiia Watershed Society.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             D.C. and Environmental Protection Agency officials had argued the 2007 pollution caps were sufficient to make the river clean enough for swimming and boating. Two non-profit organizations disagreed and filed suit.

            This really needs to be looked into. The budget was pushed up to a billion dollars.

            So here we have contemporaneous and citizen-sourced evidence that backs up what the MPD has said, there had been increased violence including a series of armed robberies in that area.

            About a week ago, someone was trying to tell me it was an affluent and low-crime area.  This is why you are getting downvoated.  In the conspiracy version of Seth Rich's death, there's no possible way his death could have been just street crime.  These comments show his death was very likely part of the crime wave right in this area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite simply your post undermines the conspiracy theory that presidential politics had anything to do with Seth Rich's death.

             Absolutely not. And the downvoating is pushback. Nothing else. This seems to be a shill attack also. You attempt to bend a post to a certain narrative, i.e., that Seth Rich's death was attributable to street crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nowhere in this post have I said, implied, or insinuated that. I've done the opposite by saying that a promotion to a cushy key strategic post seemed like a reward. Further, I questioned if it was.
            </p>
            <p>
             In case you are not a shill (doubtful, but possible), let me restate what this post is about: Seth Rich's death was murder, but given the level of violence in the area ... and given this was a "tunneling" project, it seems that his murder was caught up in a bigger picture ... a bigger purpose to DC Water forcing themselves into this area and burrowing underground. Skall, an advocate for the community, was one of many that argue against the project (yes, a link was provided). His and other's concerns were shrugged off by George Hawkins &amp; Co., BUT .... every single one of Skall's fears came to pass.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now my guess as to what the tunneling project was about: First, it was a way to establish new undetectable routes out of the area. From the previous thread I posted (the one about Pegasus Museum), we can see that the area is littered with bordellos that the police area doing nothing to closed (why would they care about young girls being forced into prostitution/human slavery?) The routes are essential to moving fresh meat in and out of the area. Next, it allowed a perfect environment for eliminating gang-related competition. Gangs are part of the enforcement system of The Cannibal Elite. The Cannibal Elite chooseth and unchooseth who is given these nuts-and-bolts assignments. If a gang or individual does not go along with the program, they are eliminated from the human trafficking/drug going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank you for the pushback. This really does tell me that I am onto something.

              I'm saying the website you link to backs up what the police have said about this murder, that this was street level crime.  Your link shows there is a lot evidence to back that up.  You, yourself point out it was a dark, dangerous place with a dead end.  Given that Water Projects are probably planned months in advance, it doesn't make sense to they did the project to create a trap for Seth Rich.    The project was probably planned and in place months before a DNC hack became an issue.   The folks pushing the Seth Rich political conspiracy have specifically been claiming, it was a low crime area and your post destroys that idea.   If you google seth rich affluent neighborhood, you get plenty of links like this.

              Websites that are actually in Washington, D.C.  don't make this claim.  This is from the Washington Beacon.

               The killing happened at 4:20 in the morning on Sunday, July 10th, near the house Rich rented with friends in Northwest D.C.. Some reports describe Bloomingdale—the neighborhood where the killing occurred—as "affluent," but this is a partial truth at best. Bloomingdale is a recently gentrified part of Washington, and was until only a few years ago the scene of regular gun violence and a robust narcotics trade. As recently as 2012 there were signs posted in the neighborhood by the D.C. government stating that people arrested for buying drugs there were liable to have their cars seized. Today, it still borders unsafe areas, and is easily the kind of place where a criminal, or group of criminals, could prey upon an unprepared young man who had been drinking.

               Yeah I looked up more info on this once and it turns out the First Street Tunnel water project was not just months but years in the making and there were a million public planning meetings about it and everyone in the city knew about it long ahead of time. It's basically a flood control project to deal with poor drainage in that neighborhood that is at the bottom of a hill with a reservoir at the top and like everybody in the neighborhood had to worry about basement flooding during storms. The water utility had been supplying homeowners with devices to halt wastewater backups as a stopgap solution during the years the flood control project was being planned and financed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course this is all normal, ordinary stuff dealing with basements flooding and homeowner's insurance and aging city infrastructure and that's too mundane for pizzagate because they want everything in DC to be about occult supernatural Satan magic wielded by "elites" and can't imagine just normal people being there.

             If you look at something close-up, you sometimes can't see what caused it to happen. But get an aerial view and voile! Let me reiterate that in 2013 (link provided in original post), the community advocates that included Skall laid out a gloom-and-doom scenario of what would happen if the DC Water "tunneling" project were to be enacted. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CONCERNS CAME TO PASS ... EVERY SINGLE ONE. If these community residents saw that handwriting on the wall, other governing officials had to be able to see it also. The fact they ignored the massive amount of violence that was set to take place leads me to believe that they not only knew it would happen ... they wanted it to happen.

            Ok QuantoKitty you never responded so I'm going to have to call you out in public.
           </p>
           <p>
            QuantoKitty when you read between the lines of your post you're not really condemning the DC Police. You're attacking a certain race of people who live in that area of DC. You know the type, they rarely have the kind of problems I have in the summer with my fair Irish-Norwegian complexion which on numerous occasions have made the skin on my nose feel like the crispy top of a Thanksgiving Turkey.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're basically saying those fucking [insert N word here] killed Seth Rich. Now given the overwhelming evidence that, duh, the Deep State had Seth killed for leaking details on the Demonic Clown Fraud that evidently runs the DNC I find your post incredibly offensive.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact when the war's over this is one of those posts Historians will consider a hit below the belt. Your opinion of poor black people is fucking disgusting and the fact you're such a Racist you didn't think twice before throwing them under the bus makes me want to fucking vomit.

             I don't think quantokitty was suggesting what you're suggesting she/he? was suggesting. Darkmath you usually can see a bigger picture, I'm surprised you're not seeing this one. The evil forces in DC have set up this road to be a criminal activity hotspot on purpose. They keep the lights off, make it a dead end. Put a giant building in the way to block it even more. All being in an affluent neighborhood that presumably get much foot traffic. They make the conditions favorable for crime so that their own bad behavior gets blamed on the exact type people you were blaming in your response. See how well their cover works?

            I'm sure there are problems. Every major city has problems, but they make a great excuse. Also, how did they get to be problems. Think what they could have wanted to do with this area.

            Crime being covered up by lack of lights on street ect... I can see it helping a criminal, however, this could only have been a "oh hey there is no lights on _street lets dump him here", other than that not likely any thing but an annoying city issue.

            *p.s. 
IMHO I do not believe the voater fraud issue was the real issue that Seth was leaking, that could of been exposed by alerting Bernie's people or setting up a glitch in the app. *

             I agree - it's more than voter fraud.  George Webb was suggesting the voter data had concealed ratline rows [he corrected to columns] with an over representation of Doctors - who he thought were being used to distribute diluted heroin.

             Except that it was well-known in DC that this was a problem area, so it was more than there's no lights on. There were dead ends meaning he'd be trapped. I'm also worried about that call to his girlfriend ... Kelsey was it? I thought she was broken up with him. That's what the story was ... that he was upset and drinking because of her and then he's talking to her when attacked? Very suspicious. She needs to be looked into.

              I agree, that girlfriend is suspicious!
I still think someone set Seth up to leak the emails. They may not have done so to get him killed, but Seth did not do this all on his own. Heck, this may have been planned for yrs, to get someone in there?
Reminds me of the story about the CIA, recruiting young Muslims here in USA to radicalize them, then have them commit a terrorist act. Then the CIA has "no clue"

               That's a great point. But I believe, at this point because of what I've read, his girlfriend was a devout HRC'er. Could be she's snoopy and maybe found out something. Could be she was snoopy at the behest of someone involved in the DNC to confirm what Seth Rich was doing. This is conjecture, but we don't know what pieces were used and that phone call ... troubling. Here he is not speaking to her, and he calls her at 4:00 in the morning and presumably wakes her up? Yeah, that'll get in her good graces.

                    I agree with you. Coincidences signal fabrication, in my mind.  Too many of them and it starts to look like fiction.

             I didn't even know there was that subverse. It's fine. If people don't want to upvoat, it's up to them. "We" pizzagaters should be controlling what we like, and f they don't like, it's fine. I'm just glad it got pushback because that's always nice and means it's valid.

             Yeah, I didn't see the original post so props to whoever spotted it first. I am glad I found time to post this. It's crucial we expand our thinking in what was going on there. It ties into something else that I haven't had time to post either ... this week ... I'm promising myself I'll get the other post up by the end of next week.

              I think that thread was more of a 'call to action' to look into these comments on the board discussing the state of Flagler.  And you've done that... so kudos : )
             </p>
             <p>
              Especially interesting is the connection you've made to CEO George Hawkins. I wonder if he has any SEIU, 32BJ or interesting people connections ?
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “At an earlier meeting with DC Water, one resident approached DC Water General Manager George Hawkins and suggested that the construction on Flagler could bring up legal issues and trigger a lawsuit. According to Skall, "[Hawkins'] response was, 'If you’ve got legal issues, bring them on. I’ve got a whole team of lawyers.'"
              </p>

                “It’s our view that our job as a union is to make sure that all workers, regardless of their immigration status, can share in the wealth that they helped create in this country,” says Jaime Contreras, president of SEIU Local 32BJ, on E-Verify. “We believe it’s unfair because it targets the most vulnerable workers in the country.”***I think this is someone to look into.

                "Backed by SEIU members, they unfurled LIUNA banners.....Hey!  Remember those two guys that were found shot in SC the day after Seth was murdered?  When I first researched Aguilar I found something that listed him with LIUNA.  This is a Red Flag I believe.  I can no longer find that page. I tried but can't find.  I still have a sense about those two.  I also read the police think they  could have been MS-13 Gang Members.  I remember one of the Anons telling us not to pay attention to them.  I think that is wrong.

               As to ties, yes, it'll be interesting to see which group he's connected with. It's impossible to advance in that swamp without having powerful allies.

              Antytime:-)   Just gonna throw this out there.  Could be nothing.  Were they aiding and abetting the JA tunnel project or continuation of tunnels?  I am not good at tech stuff or building  stats but besides to just a new Kill Room or whatever he was building, could he have been making an opening/connection to tunnels?  This opens much discussion and research  Thank you for an excellent Post.

            Seth Rich wasn't killed on Flagler. And don't worry about crime in that area. Seth Rich was murdered by the Deep State for leaking DNC secrets. That was no mugging.

            Because if we don't wake the fuck up and take back our government then they're going to start WWIII in Syria to put an oil pipeline through it irregardless of the fact we'll all be radioactive dust particles when it's all done. The problem is your average psychopath is missing large portions of their brains associated with higher thinking. That tends to trip them up at times and should be of great concern.

             This pipeline theory has never made sense to me.  So you make a, what, 10% saving on shipping costs.  It is more vulnerable than a fleet of oil tankers.  Construction contracts might be the reason.

              I'd bet there are many reasons for the Deep State doing that. One is to support Israel no doubt. Another is to fuck with Iran who are the people that really run Syria.
             </p>
             <p>
              Doesn't matter how many reasons though, they're all bad for America and we need to get the fuck out of the Middle East immediately.

                 That's ok. Allow me to explain. The Deep State's entire defense is built around Andrew McCabe concocting a story that "The Russians!(tm)" and not Seth Rich hacked into the DNC on orders from Donald Trump.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As long as Andrew McCabe is running the FBI he can keep up that charade.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So yeah, I don't mean to be harsh but it's time to wake the fuck up now because the Deep State can't stay in power because raping children is wrong. Let's just all agree.

                  So this asshole nobody ever heard of is behind the Russia story inundation, not Jewish led news media outlets? Well fuck me let's go get him and avert ww3. America will still become a socialist debt slave society with a Jewish elite, but hey
