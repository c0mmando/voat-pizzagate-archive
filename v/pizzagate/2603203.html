            CPS is absolutely no good in my eyes and needs to be audited probably before anyone else and the fact that it's not already audited regularly should come to a shock to all parents. I'm not a parent myself but if those fuckers got into my house I would cut their nasty dick beaters right off. Then rub it in their face in pride. Fuck them.

              You know how God said the first will be the last &amp; last will be the first? Well that I think that's referring to us and the elite because they are in front doing their rituals right now, but it's us who will all watch them in a circle for a final ritual to see them burn for once. 
I hope God excuses the gigantic bong rip I take to rejoice in that and laugh like they laughed at us. Won't even feel bad. They called it upon themselves. If they're hardcore enough to do that to people, then they need to be hardcore enough to step up to the fucking plate themselves and not be such fucking pussies if suffering in rituals feels so fucking great.

               I think anyone that thinks what they are doing is so great, then they are really a weakling.  I propose that if it comes to their burning they will cower like little babies, for they have been protected and molly coddled all their lives.  Ha.  I shall relish it too.

                If they think power comes from their rituals then they obviously think it's great enough to keep doing for centuries while not realizing all their doing is just wrecking the world unnecessarily when they already have more than the world will ever be able to even realize they don't have in comparison to the elite.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I can't fucking wait for the tough guys to be in the center of the circle of once feeling the effects of what they are doing before everlasting hell takes over for them unlike every little innocent child who screamed for help in the center of it because I have all the faith in the world God himself has build their homes in heaven while simultaneously vomiting out the elite for the disgusting shit that they are.

                 When I read the beginning of your comment, I thought of some crazed power monger in the movies that has run amok.  In movies they plunder and ravage everything in their path with no end in sight.  They are crazed, demonized just like how  we imagine the satanists.  They have been doing this within their families for centuries, some of them.  They control their children as we see with the Royal Family and the Rothschilds and Bronfmans.  Power is a powerful aphrodisiac.  We have allowed this to continue because being better than they are, we never thought that humans could do such heinous things.  What they are and have created are Family Cults.  They have and still are committing SRA within their own families.  They pimp out their own children, and when the child does not want to participate, well we know they will be sacrificed.  This puts us at a much Higher Level than they are..  Visualize the worst Vampire movie you have seen.  They are Satanic Monsters.  I am scared too, but I will keep fighting them.  I keep thinking the more good that is done in the world the more it counters evil.  We have to keep doing good.  It's what the devil hates. God is on Our Side, not theirs.

                    I would also like to add something that actually made me feel much better when I learned it. And that is that the devil cannot read your thoughts only God can. Therefore demons could only learn from observation over ages. They may be more intelligent than us, but they are definitely none the wiser. Sure they know the nature of people that existed since day one &amp; they may seem powerful but you still have the power to deny them everything to watch them flee with their tails tucked between their taints. Maybe we're "lesser beings" but how come we're powerful enough to avoid them? Seem it's my power they want. He just wants me to give it to him freely with the freewill I have.

                     If they are so smart and powerful, more than we, then why do they need steal ours?  I think I know, they never have enough.  Greed.  Yes, we do have the power to resist their evil.  Which also brings to mind how much smarter and powerful we are than the high level elites.  THEY were not strong enough to resist his evil.  They succumbed and sold their souls.  WE give them their power by putting them on such a high level.  The do not deserve our adoration it just feeds their Narcissism which encourages evil, imo.  Its a vicious circle.

                      Absolutely, why can't they just be happy knowing they have more than everybody? Greed. It's just a bunch of idiots following more articulate idiots who know how to fool you faster than you can discern it for what it truly is. It's just sad.

                       The fact that they can't be satisfied and are so filled with greed, more greed than many others, theirs is one of Evil Greed.  This is even more proof that the devil exists, for only someone that has sold their soul, is capable of  such vile and monstrous deeds.  They are the devil's disciples.

                         YES.  Look over here, while the Real Thing is over there.  He has been there all along and the more people realize this the more power we will have.  The power will be transferred.  When people worship the devil he gains power and so do his followers the luciferians.  We Must Take Away Their Power.

            OMG I just realized the reason they keep airing these TV shows with teen mom themes and shit is because they want to up the influx of babies being born to feed them to moloch. I'm literally never having kids myself.

             Children are wonderful.  I worked with a bunch of them quite a few years ago in a school.  Don't refrain from having one, raise it right because we need all the good people we can get.  They are damaging as many as they can.

              They are wonderful, we all used to be kids too so I take that most the people here are largely raised correctly so I agree that we need more like us but at the same time knowing this exists and knowing I don't have kids and the government knowing that I was here would only make me even more paranoid to have them because I feel like they would be even more targeted and even more punished for what research I do because I feel it's the right thing to do but in no way takes away from the disgusting nature of this world.
             </p>
             <p>
              From being aware of this I in no way want to continue my bloodline because why would I want to live with knowing any of this can happen to them? If I feel so strongly about it now, could you imagine how strongly I would feel if I knew I had them? Bro I'm ready to fucking choke someone to the fucking ground intimately so I could see justice leak out of the persons eyes myself. Because a court doesn't do shit but dilute everything. Why would I bring a child into this world willingly if I'm already aware. I don't mean anything I say with disrespect because I know you're a parent and I believe wholeheartedly that you're a great parent because I've see you fight the fight on the good side since the first time I got on voat and realize many already had kids before becoming unaware I'm just speaking from my personal view point. So I hope you don't think I don't respect you because I do, completely.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of this of course come back full force to what you said before to them trying to damage us as much as they can and I agree with that too, they are trying to establish an army of singletons, who are much easier to control and fear into doing what they want because one is weaker than a few and it's always strength in numbers but while they are trying doing these rituals there's just no fucking way that's happening for me. I just don't see a fucking way in hell I would have a kid knowing which time I came into existence &amp; while also being aware of it.

               I don't have children, wish I did, and yet I can see your side of it.  I thank all the people on here that have raised well adjusted children and will make sure they are as awake as we are.  Yes, this is a very trying and evil time.  But I am glad to be here and am lucky to be one that knows the truth.  I respect your decision.  We cant all think the same, that's what makes this such a beautiful world.  Yes, I still see it as beautiful, for there are so many more of us than them.

                I'm sorry I thought you did because you were saying I shouldn't be discouraged from having them. I'm just scared shitless and would rather take the punishment myself without having to involve anyone else if that makes sense, especially someone like my son or daughter which I would love to death if I had them so I would blame myself for everything if they were in danger.
               </p>
               <p>
                So to avoid that I would need to just avoid from starting a family with kids in the first place if I'm aware and have this unique opportunity to at least do something good with myself other than just enjoying myself &amp; exploring empty pleasures like every other fuck who happened to repeat the cycle. I know life is a journey and everyone is in a different placing in that journey but I just can't imagine doing the right thing then being punished for it only to receive nothing but that punishment for it &amp; involving someone who should have never even heard of this into the punishment with me, it would seem entirely unfair.
               </p>
               <p>
                For what it's worth Carmencita, I think you definitely should have kids because you have far more faith than me. While I'm clearly unprepared.

                 You don't have to have children.  You can become someone that helps children when ever you can.   Whatever your talents, find a way to affect their lives.  If you can't become a teacher, then volunteer to help poor children with reading, there are programs like showing children how to cook, grow vegetables.  When I was in High School I helped children with their reading and handwriting.   You can help children immensely by donating food to food pantries for many families are very hungry.  A child cannot learn when hungry.  Find a way to help children where you live, for they are our future.

            This is not failure, it is intentional child trafficking. Rip the child from the parents, put the child in foster care, when the girl in foster care has a child, take the child away.  Many go before the same judge. This pathetic. We are supposed to believe is all a big misunderstanding.

             It's horrible to think about but it is an Assembly Line Baby Factory.  Keep them in the Family Way.  I want to just throw up whenever I think about what they are doing.  They can just keep doing this to the same families for years and years if they are not stopped.  I knew that people were bad, but the things I have learned in the last year are just beyond believable.

            This kind of crap is why I decided to never become a social worker. The "system" is so ready to pounce on any mother who is struggling in some way. Take the kids away and they may never see them again until the kids come looking for their mother as adults.

             Yes, and I am sure their minds are poisoned against her.  You can just break down sobbing if you let go.  I am researching right now about a priest and it is stomach churning.  I don't want a medal I just want these Bleeping Pervert Monsters Locked Up!!!

              Locked up, would require a non-pervert monster judge, and lawyer, and police.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's likely not going to happen.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you have to make up your mind if you are going to do something that is going to end up costing you everything to take one or two of the evil bastards out, or if you want to keep your life as is and let things keep getting worse.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the same choice we all must make, and for myself and most others the choice is, keep with my own life.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I wasn't physically disabled it might be different. Even as is if I could somehow do something I would.
             </p>
             <p>
              But that feeling of powerlessness we all have, its doubly bad when you're disabled.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thats just an empty excuse though when talking about what monsters are doing to children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our civilization is dying. This is the proof. I wonder if a new one will form from the ashes or if all is going dark in the west.

               I have more faith than you. Your situation is different than mine. Those of us who can fight them and make a difference must do so. All of us must do what they can in their own way. We must push for CPS to go down in 🔥 flames. I will never give up fighting. We must fight for those that can’t. Do what you can by spreading the word of their filthy crimes.

             Yes, sometimes you have to deaden the pain to read and post this stuff.  That's what I have to do.  Then all of it sudden it all comes crashing down on me at once.  That 's when I take a short rest.  Breeders is what they have turned the CPS, DCFS, what ever it is in your state, into.  I just said to someone else it may be a Baby Factory for all we know.  Sometimes I can't even either.

             This is girls who have aged out as well. Just being a foster child means you have a 48.8% chance of your baby being taken by 2 years old.

             That is always a good idea unless you are raped.  You do not have the choice of abortion if you are in foster care.  They want your child.  They have total control of you.  I hate to think of it but they may be turning Foster Care into a Baby Factory.

               I was thinking of taking their first born, but they are surely ccopies of them.  Throw them all in the Navy Brigg.  Worse than a jail cell.  I want to see really tough charges for raping children.  I just read something about how they are keeping certain foster children in mental care centers way longer than needed.  I bet they are feeding them drugs like crazy to fatten Big Pharma.

             I doubt it. There aren’t many CPS workers that are men. They may well have been abused by their foster parents or fellow foster children. But unlikely it’s CPS workers.

             You certainly have come up with a very plausible situation.  The networking within the agency is surely monumental with many have each others back.  Covering for each other is how they have kept this under the radar.  It is now coming out Thanks to

            Wow! The same social workers and judges who took them as children are being targeted !? Guess this fits right in with the systematic abuse we are well familiar with . They prey on the disfunctional families that they created in the first place .

             From what I have seen they take the drug addicted children, and the ones born with defects, and treat them on the taxpayer dollar as well as making the people who created the problem more money through lending and charities for tax reasons.

             The debt system controlled by the bench and banks creates an artificial.scarcity of money..this creates stress in society and individuals ..and are more prone to statutue violations..
The big brother reality tv series clearly reveals their method of control and conflict.

             They managed to hide even their human farms in plain sight. I would've imagined some underground facilities or atleast some dirty warehouse in the middle of a jungle, but NOPE! no need, let the U.S legal system handle all that infrastructure and just drive by to pick up the product with no more excuse then a quick visit to the kangaroo court.

             Yes so much of this going on everywhere.  Sad.  People are so taken in by the MSM and the Fakers that talk about the Immigrant Children and those lies, and they do not realize that this is happening in the same way within a 3 letter agency CPS.  Remember that in some states it is not called CPS.  I learned while researching that in Chicago it is DCFS and there are other ones in other states.  But the Crime is the same.  Child Protective Services.  What a Misnomer.   The furthest thing ever to protecting Our Children.

                I dont even post about politics on FB anymore because it would be EVEN MORE BS if I did with people wanting to argue with me...I see enough without it so let the cat videos commence more cat videos...and trash info. That is as political as I get and interestingly enough..NOBODY SEEMS TO GIVE A DAMN ABOUT IT. Hence why there is so much of it on the planet!! Like I said SELECTIVE OUTRAGE. Keep clutching those pearls!
