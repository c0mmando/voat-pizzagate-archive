            people thought it sounded like him on the video and then went into the discord of that site and talked to the owners and they said it was Podesta, but that obviously means jack fucking shit and we have absolutely zero concrete evidence that this is Podesta. The best thing we have is that video doing a voice comparison. The owners of this sick site could be trolls doing some weird publicity stunt, but the fact that they deleted that weird video titled "dad.mp4" that depicted a kid in underwear rubbing what appeared to be shit on himself while shivering in a cold shower really makes me question everything. I think we stumbled across some sort of pedo shit, but we don't know what it is as of yet. we need to get that weird bearded, doctor guy with connections to Unicef to talk about everything he knows.

            How about the origin of WorldCorpo.net - I must've missed this. I'm assuming that wherever this came from/whoever posted it, has a good understanding of the origin of the content. The precursor video was super creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not going to connect any dots without additional proof to go on. Right now it is very suspicious, just wondering about the origins.
