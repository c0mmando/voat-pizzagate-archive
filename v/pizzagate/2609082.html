In this &quot;joke&quot; he talks about how he lies a baby down to sleep and the &quot;oops baby is dead&quot; he then goes on to act as if he is holding up the dead baby and then proceeds to throw it on the ground and starts to kick it all the while the crowd laughs?? </p>
<p>Could this be part of trying to normalize this sort of behaviour?</p>
<p>The next one that sickened me even more is he goes on to &quot;joke&quot; about people that pester him while he\'s working. He says &quot;So here I am working away and this pesky bloke shows me a picture of his 8 year old daughter and there\'s 3 ways I could react to this..&quot; he describes two of them and then the third one is quite sickening he says &quot;Well I could look at the photo for a bit too long and start thinking, oohh, oohh she\'s quite a pretty young girl, mmm&quot; he then starts to bite his lip and act as if he\'s being aroused by the photo.. WTF!! That shit ain\'t funny and yet the crowd loves it!! </p>
<p>He also makes a reference at the start that the place he grew up in is now filled with murderers and pedophiles he says &quot;well it was filled with pedophiles until the murderers killed them all.. well not all of them, but most of them.. there\'s still a few there..&quot; Still a few there?? What pedos does he know in his old town?? </p>
<p>This was all rather sickening and I feel it\'s being made acceptable because he is meant to be a &quot;comedian&quot; WTF is funny about joking about kicking dead babies and being sexually aroused by a photo of a young girl??</p>
<p>So after reading this tweet that links Ron Howard to all this and says watch for anyone speaking out against Trump.. then I spot this tweet from John Cusack that of course Ricky himself liked.. </p>

            I used to like Ricky Gervais when he’d do a radio show with Karl Pilkington (a legend) but he sold out to Hollywood and here’s the example.  Any celebrity who has one eye symbolism and devil horns in his pictures has clearly made a deal with the elite.  Fuck him but it’s a shame.

            , every major claim in your thread needs a supporting link (Rule 2). Can you please edit this to include links to the Ricky Gervais material? I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair to do so.

             I just checked and it's a Netflix only special so I wont be able to link to the material as its not on youtube so feel free to take it down! Just thought I'd make people aware of the shit these people talk and then the crowd loves it, probably because they don't know any better.. I mean some of the jokes in it are funny but to try and "joke" about a dead baby and kicking it around and then being aroused by a photo of a minor is just sickening
            </p>
            <p>
             And howard had a show back in the day that GetWellIan tagged to me, just the intro is sickening, full of young kids almost burlesque dancing.. He should be copping it!

             He was feminine looking in his youth but that was all the New Romantic rage back in the 80s.  I don’t think he is transgender.

            I don't think you understand the purpose of dark comedy. The jokes aren't made for normalizing the actions, they're to lighten people's seriousness surrounding every waking minute of their lives. If I make a 9/11 joke, does that make me a terrorist? If I have a shark party when a shark kills one person, does that make me a trans-shark?
           </p>

            The whole point of his joke is that he never wants to see kid photos. How much of an explanation do you need? You don't have to think it's funny to see he's not trying to normalize anything other than stopping parents from sharing photos of their stupid fucking kids. This is over-sensitivity, sir.

              I make jokes like that sometimes too. Its necessary. I watched it too, and do still have suspicions about Gervais however.

              You misunderstood what I said. You said it yourself, life is shitty for many people. Dark humor makes us laugh at the terrible stuff for once, not to make us appreciate shitty things, but to make them less overwhelming.

            People that say sick things about people and also do sick things with animals, like hurting them go on to bigger and worse things imo.  If he thinks this stuff is funny, what does he do when NOT on stage?  NO a normal person does not say things like that.  There is something else going on here.  He is a real sicko and possibly worse.
           </p>

            The reason the people love it is because they are afraid not to laugh.  Political Correctness.   OOH MPeoG.  Someone might think I don't think this is funny.  OOH!  People are such Cowards today.  Stand up for your morals, already.  Dumb.

             Yea that's why I decided to post as it's making this sort of behavior "acceptable".. What? Just because he's a comedian he's allowed to talk about kicking dead babies and being sexually attracted to minors? It's this sort of shit and these sort of people that are corrupting the minds of their followers. Its should never be acceptable to laugh at someone "joking" about this sort of shit, it's exactly what starts to brainwash people in to accepting that committing the actual crime is normal.

            Gervais is pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            His relatives worked in care homes and he thought making fun of mentally ill people was amusing. Makes you wonder what the Gervais family joke about behind closed doors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now I just think he has a nasty sense of humour and fame has filled him with arrogance.

             People need to be made aware of this shit and the people that find it "funny" and "joke" about it need to be named and shamed. Comedian or not the shit he says I do not consider normal..
