At the time of the conversion Friedman requested a waiver from this violation, which was granted about 10 weeks later.[17]

               What I've gotta wonder is what is it about GDS which prompted botman to try poisoning both the topic of GDS and &lt;redacted&gt; by association... The mind surely boggles... it's like they don't understand the streisand effect, or, perhaps they just hing the poisoning will work.

               1) You still did not denounce Satan. Why not?
              </p>
              <p>
               2) You still did not accept Jesus Christ as your Savior. Why not?
              </p>
              <p>
               3) You cannot deny all of the nonsense submissions you made about Racine despite calling it the Root of Corruption. What was your grand conclusion to your multi-part series?
              </p>
              <p>
               4) You can say what you want about Carmencita and Fogdryer, but they know The Truth about Racine was shared since The Beginning. They have been here a long time. You can try to fool new users who don’t know these things, but anyone who bothers to dig can easily find The Truth. Whatever happened to Srayzie and Shizy by the way?
              </p>
              <p>
               5) MercurysBall2 is a good researcher and also knows The Truth has been shared about Racine for years. They have many posts about Weill Cornell, but they never attacked The Truth in the process like you did.
              </p>
              <p>
               6) You went crying to the moderators for help, then stalked The Truth outside of Pizzagate, then came back here to make sad jokes and appear as some kind of false authority of the Pizzagate forum.
              </p>
              <p>
               7) You continue to flail wildly in desperation begging for the moderators to help cover your tracks and censor The Truth. Why?
              </p>
              <p>
               Tell everyone here - why did you just run a search for Racine to then stalk The Truth on TheAwakening on a submission about Sustainable Development, or was that a mere coincidence you showed up there to tell everyone ‘don’t believe this shill’?
              </p>
              <p>
               Or are you going to try to deny you did that?
              </p>

               Even Satan is disappointed in you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Will you denounce Satan now for all to see and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior? Why not?

                , who writes the programs for your bot? When it directly answers questions (as above) I have a hard time believing it's a program. I've yet to see one that good. So human! Well done.
               </p>
               <p>
                &amp; yeah, Satan is probably disappointed. After all, his greatest trick is to convince the masses he doesn't exist.
               </p>
               <p>
                But

                is showing his ass to anyone more intelligent than the blind sheep. IF argosiv is working to cover things up, Satan should be disappointed in his damn self.  Satan, bro, can't you find someone to be a little less obvious &amp; a little less sloppy? You're slippin' Satan, your slippin'.
               </p>

                , if that's NOT your intention, I don't understand why you're so bent on discrediting the Racine idea. Triple T (yes, folks, dude above &amp; all his alts) pisses me off regularly. I'm not sure why he goes at it like he does.
               </p>
               <p>
                But on the majority of issues he brings up, he's correct.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you think he's not, why not encourage research his ideas, debunk him, &amp; get this motherfucker out of here?

              Remember when you admitted to drinking blood and Satan worship, argosciv? Did you ever denounce Satan and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior? Why not? Will you now?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would you call for help from the moderators? Are you attempting to get them to censor and ban The Truth? What about your long series of submissions all about Racine that were full of nonsense, and only meant to distract and obfuscate The Truth? Wasn’t that an attempt to “poison” research about Racine? Do you forget how many submissions you made about Racine calling it the “Root of Corruption”?
             </p>
             <p>
              How long did you post these before members of this very Pizzagate forum ended up dead?

             <p>
              How long before this comment is deleted and this account is banned by the moderators who swore they only ban and delete comments from bots? We are not a bot. Bots don’t respond like this.

             <p>
              The Truth about Racine has been shared since The Beginning. You aren’t the first one to discuss Weill Cornell. Did you not have time to research Mason Lab, the Johnsons, The Young &amp; The Guest, or the Knights of Pythias yet?
             </p>
             <p>
              Who are the other schools in Qatar and how are Georgetown and Marquette related?

             <p>
              Why do so many attendees of the Georgetown Day School end up at the University of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin?

              Not Everyone can be Saved, but you can share The Truth and help to expose Weill Cornell, and that is better than nothing.

              Yeah I'm sure I've read about it before, seen it along the way with various research... if not otherwise in relation to your SearchVoat results. Gonna paw through that now to see if anything jogs my memory. As for purged names... no promises but I may or may not have a dig and see what turns up.
