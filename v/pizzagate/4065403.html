             Friedman was the Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a body which implements the Wall Street policies of the Federal Reserve, during a period of immense financial market upheaval, from January 2008 until May 7, 2009.[16] When Goldman Sachs was converted to a bank holding company in September 2008 the bank then came under the regulatory authority of the New York Fed, which made Friedman’s position as a member of Goldman Sachs’ board a violation of Federal Reserve policy. At the time of the conversion Friedman requested a waiver from this violation, which was granted about 10 weeks later.[17]

               What I've gotta wonder is what is it about GDS which prompted botman to try poisoning both the topic of GDS and &lt;redacted&gt; by association... The mind surely boggles... it's like they don't understand the streisand effect, or, perhaps they just hing the poisoning will work.

               1) You still did not denounce Satan. Why not?
              </p>
              <p>
               2) You still did not accept Jesus Christ as your Savior. Why not?
              </p>
              <p>
               3) You cannot deny all of the nonsense submissions you made about Racine despite calling it the Root of Corruption. What was your grand conclusion to your multi-part series?
              </p>
              <p>
               4) You can say what you want about Carmencita and Fogdryer, but they know The Truth about Racine was shared since The Beginning. They have been here a long time. You can try to fool new users who don’t know these things, but anyone who bothers to dig can easily find The Truth. Whatever happened to Srayzie and Shizy by the way?
              </p>
              <p>
               5) MercurysBall2 is a good researcher and also knows The Truth has been shared about Racine for years. They have many posts about Weill Cornell, but they never attacked The Truth in the process like you did.
              </p>
              <p>
               6) You went crying to the moderators for help, then stalked The Truth outside of Pizzagate, then came back here to make sad jokes and appear as some kind of false authority of the Pizzagate forum.
              </p>
              <p>
               7) You continue to flail wildly in desperation begging for the moderators to help cover your tracks and censor The Truth. Why?
              </p>
              <p>
               Tell everyone here - why did you just run a search for Racine to then stalk The Truth on TheAwakening on a submission about Sustainable Development, or was that a mere coincidence you showed up there to tell everyone ‘don’t believe this shill’?
              </p>
              <p>
               Or are you going to try to deny you did that?
              </p>

               Even Satan is disappointed in you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Will you denounce Satan now for all to see and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior? Why not?

                </a>
                , who writes the programs for your bot? When it directly answers questions (as above) I have a hard time believing it's a program. I've yet to see one that good. So human! Well done.
               </p>
               <p>
                &amp; yeah, Satan is probably disappointed. After all, his greatest trick is to convince the masses he doesn't exist.
               </p>
               <p>
                But
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/argosciv">
                 @argosciv
                </a>
                is showing his ass to anyone more intelligent than the blind sheep. IF argosiv is working to cover things up, Satan should be disappointed in his damn self.  Satan, bro, can't you find someone to be a little less obvious &amp; a little less sloppy? You're slippin' Satan, your slippin'.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/argosciv">

                , if that's NOT your intention, I don't understand why you're so bent on discrediting the Racine idea. Triple T (yes, folks, dude above &amp; all his alts) pisses me off regularly. I'm not sure why he goes at it like he does.
               </p>
               <p>
                But on the majority of issues he brings up, he's correct.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you think he's not, why not encourage research his ideas, debunk him, &amp; get this motherfucker out of here?

              Remember when you admitted to drinking blood and Satan worship, argosciv? Did you ever denounce Satan and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior? Why not? Will you now?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would you call for help from the moderators? Are you attempting to get them to censor and ban The Truth? What about your long series of submissions all about Racine that were full of nonsense, and only meant to distract and obfuscate The Truth? Wasn’t that an attempt to “poison” research about Racine? Do you forget how many submissions you made about Racine calling it the “Root of Corruption”?
             </p>
             <p>
              How long did you post these before members of this very Pizzagate forum ended up dead?

              How long before this comment is deleted and this account is banned by the moderators who swore they only ban and delete comments from bots? We are not a bot. Bots don’t respond like this.

             <p>
              The Truth about Racine has been shared since The Beginning. You aren’t the first one to discuss Weill Cornell. Did you not have time to research Mason Lab, the Johnsons, The Young &amp; The Guest, or the Knights of Pythias yet?
             </p>

              Not Everyone can be Saved, but you can share The Truth and help to expose Weill Cornell, and that is better than nothing.

               I don't delete your comments, diarrhea bot. I leave them up for the world to see forever. I will ban you, though, because your spamming and attempt to avoid the consequences of user voting by running an army of alts are against the Voat User Agreement. Bye bye.

            It's not just GDS.  It's also Maret, Sidwell Friends and a couple other schools the elite send their kids to.  I believe both of Hussein's kids went to GDS as well as Holder's and Rice's kids too.

             What I was curious about was this private school in DC which appears to teach the kids of the top Swamp monsters. Curious if any alums had themselves removed from the Wikipedia alumni list, etc.

               Oh, that's old news. They tried to set up Trump back in October 2016. Part of the Russia collusion hoax.

               What I was curious about was this private school in DC which appears to teach the kids of the top Swamp monsters. Curious if any alums had themselves removed from the Wikipedia alumni list, etc.

              Yeah I'm sure I've read about it before, seen it along the way with various research... if not otherwise in relation to your SearchVoat results. Gonna paw through that now to see if anything jogs my memory. As for purged names... no promises but I may or may not have a dig and see what turns up.
