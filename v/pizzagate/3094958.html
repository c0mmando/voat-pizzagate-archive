<blockquote>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are to have their own household, in a split from William and Kate\'s royal personnel. The Queen has agreed to the creation of a Household for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and given permission for it to be based at Buckingham Palace.  As part of the shake-up, Harry and Meghan have named high-flying PR guru Sara Latham - who has worked for Bill and Hillary Clinton - as their new dedicated head of communications.   
</p>
<p>She founded her own company - the Latham Group - in 2006 and more recently had been a managing partner at London-based PR firm <strong>Freuds</strong>, overseeing global corporate accounts. </p>
<p>Her LinkedIn page also shows her working for Philip Gould Associates, a polling firm founded by a New Labour aide, in the mid-2000s</p>
<p>Ms Latham, believed to be a British-American dual citizen, worked in the White House in the <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> era as an assistant to the President. She also served as an adviser for <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>\'s failed 2016 presidential campaign, according to her online CV.  In addition she was recruited into British politics in 2005 to help <strong>Tony Blair</strong>\'s Labour party in that year\'s general election campaign. Subsequently she worked for Labour MP <strong>Tessa Jowell</strong>, who was then Culture Secretary and responsible for planning the London Olympics.

            Clement Freud was a Knight of the Realm like  Jimmy Savile.
‘Sir Clement Freud made a huge contribution to public life in many different ways,’ declared the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who got to know Freud when he was Rector of the University of Edinburgh and Freud was Rector of Dundee University.
Eight days later, at the funeral at St Bride’s, in Fleet Street, Brown read the lesson from St John’s Gospel and gave an address to a starry congregation 
that included Stephen Fry, rock star Bono and an assortment of Freud’s fellow panellists from Radio 4’s enduring panel game Just a Minute.
He (Freud) was a familiar, larger-than-life figure punting heavily at the races
(He had an )ostensibly happy marriage that produced five children (and nearly 20 grandchildren) including multi-millionaire PR guru Matthew Freud, whose former wife was Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth.
Matthew has certainly followed the family’s dissolute, libidinous path. While married to his second wife Elisabeth, with whom he has a son and a daughter,he had another child with one of her close friends. Elisabeth even cradled the child in her arms, not knowing the father was her husband.
Another of Clement’s children is Emma Freud, TV presenter and partner of Four Weddings And A Funeral filmmaker Richard Curtis.Emma and Matthew’s other siblings were Nicola, Dominic and Ashley.
           </p>
           <p>
            His early life
           </p>
           <p>
            The grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and brother of artist Lucian, Clement was born in Berlin in 1924, but fled to Britain with his Jewish family when the Nazis came to power.
After the war he trained as a chef at London’s Dorchester, before being made manager of the glamorous Martinez Hotel in Cannes.
His rise to fame
With his finger on the capital's showbiz pulse, he helped propel a number of young acts to stardom and later boasted of being the first person to book the now disgraced entertainer, Rolf Harris.
As one of the country’s first celebrity chefs, he became a regular on TV and became a household name thanks to a series of dog food adverts in which he starred alongside a bloodhound called Henry.
Political power
He later moved into journalism before beginning a 14-year career in the House of Commons in 1973, where he shared an office with Cyril Smith, who was subsequently exposed as a serial paedophile.
Accusations of grooming and sexual abuse
Two separate women came forward to allege that he groomed and sexually abused them when they were young girls.
Freud spent years abusing a girl who he brought up as a daughter, and violently raped a teenager while he was an MP.
His widow, Lady Freud, has apologised to his victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            The western Algarve, with its bucket-and-spade resorts, wide-open verandas and patios, and laid-back security, had become a teeming hive of paedophile 
activity.
One investigator said he knew of 38 child sex abusers living in the area; and between 2005 and 2009, the children of seven holidaying families were reportedly subjected to sex attacks — five before three-year-old Madeleine was taken from Apartment 5A at the Ocean Club, and two afterwards.

            How Clement Freud invited Kate and Gerry McCann for lunch after Madeleine disappeared

            Madeleine McCann Detective Accuses ex-PM Gordon Brown and MI5 of Epic Cover-up — The Podesta Connection
A former detective who led the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has sensationally claimed that MI5 helped cover up her death.
Portuguese former police chief Goncalo Amaral, 56, told an Australian documentary that British secret agents “for sure had an involvement” 
when Maddie vanished at the age of 3 in 2007.
Mr Amaral also astonishingly claimed that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was involved in the cover up.
The former cop worked on the case when Maddie went missing from the apartment the McCanns were staying in in Praia da Luz while Kate and Gerry ate dinner with friends.
He resigned six months after being removed from the case but wrote a book using police files as he put forward a theory she had died in the apartment.
The McCanns have dismissed this comments and Mr Amaral produced no evidence to support his claims about either the former Prime Minister or the British security services.
The documentary, billed as a “landmark television event”, also suggested that a new key witness – who worked at the Praia da Luz resort at the time of Maddie’s disappearance – was being sought.
The Podestas were staying close-by, at a pedophile friend’s villa and match Police sketches of kidnappers
Police sketches of two suspects believed to be involved in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, that took place in Portugal on May 3rd, 2007, 
have made their way around the Internet recently, and they depict what appears to be a drawing of the Podesta brothers.

             How the many facets of Keith Harris have turned him into the City's Mr Fixit
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Business Profile:
             <strong>
              The former head of HSBC
             </strong>
             's investment bank is now running Seymour Pierce
            </p>
            <p>
             When Keith Harris, the engaging chairman of the stockbroker Seymour Pierce, turned 50 on 11 April this year, his friend
             <strong>
              Richard Desmond, owner of Express Newspapers
             </strong>
             , give him silver replicas of the three trophies Mr Harris's beloved Manchester United won in 1999 - the European Champion's League, the Premiership and the FA Cup.
            </p>
            <p>
             Slightly more embarrassingly, Mr Desmond also had a pile of first editions of The Sunday Express on a table at the party in Mayfair's Langan's brasserie, where guests included Adam Crozier, former boss of the Football Association.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Seymour Pierce, with a workforce of 60 compared to the 7,000 he was in charge of by the time he left HSBC, seems to have breathed new life into Mr Harris. He looks in rude health after the grinding time at HSBC and the roller-coaster ride that was the Football League, when his tenure coincided with the collapse of ITV Digital and the ensuing unravelling of its sponsorship deal with the 72 Nationwide League football clubs.
            </p>
            <p>
             That episode is still raw. Mr Harris hopes Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, and
             <strong>
              Charles Allen, his counterpart at Granada
             </strong>
             , who set up the doomed venture, will get their "come-uppance". He thinks they might, in the form of shareholder wrath surrounding the proposed merger of the two companies.

            Maybe the solution to all of these coincidences has been the simplest all along:  the reason the Clinton's are always around, never held accountable for their myriad crimes and most importantly, was not supposed to LOSE is that they have been installed and backed by the Brits all along.  Because they KNOW they are protected.  Think about it.  It makes sense.  Never supposed to lose indeed.  Why hasn't Trump had a state visit with our "biggest ally" yet?  Thinking the UK has been installing our Presidents for quite some time....

             The origins of G4S can be traced back to the Danish company Kjøbenhavn-Frederiksberg Nattevagt (Copenhagen-Frederiksberg Night Watch) - then merged with Securicor. Securicor managed detention at Manchester and Heathrow. In 2005, Nick Buckles became the CEO of G4S.

              Thanks for the ping!  Hmm.  ISS.  If you notice that wikileaks email came from J Palmieri who was mentioned in our research as a possible person involved with the Seth Rich murder.  Jennifer would be more than familiar with Clean Up.  SEIU is known for having their more shady employees such as MS-13 members doing Clean Up for the Dems etc.  ISS is also Clean Up.    Also remember Podesta requesting Wet Works also as a Clean Up for Scalia.   Just a thought.

            Here's another little gem I recently found:
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Charles got money from an Armenian-Russian oligarch who is buddy buddy with Putin, and who happened to sit on the board of Joule.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep. That's the same Joule company were Podesta served as director of the board.
           </p>
           <p>
            The oligarch happens to be a good friend of the Clooneys btw, and Prince Charles and he are running a student exchange now. Armenian pupils visiting Britain.
           </p>

            Here's the draft of a post I've been writing.

            Awful pick when it comes to Megan and Harry! However they were always going to be split from William and Kate. However they were always going to be split from William and Kate William and Kate are in line to be king and queen and have a furry different set of rules and competence required. Harry will never be king so he can be more of a PR person for the Royals and have fun. So disgusting though that he chose Clinton PR people.

            So, the front page of the Daily Mail continues to instruct us on  the schizoid collective consciousness of the UK's Deep State with the false flags and cooked up stories from operatives and simple minded useful idiots.  I'll give a simple example, I've already pointed out the coincidental links to New Zealand of Prince Harry's and Meghan Markle's communications staff.  Then, here comes TV presenter Kate Garraway to add to the chaos of the New Zealand bombing story:

She it may have been who pointed Mandelson towards Lambton Place Health Club, where he is often seen on the treadmill chatting to Lady Antonia Fraser. She and her husband, Harold Pinter, new Labour's greatest literary grandee, live two minutes up the road in Campden Hill Square. Blair's favourite huntsman, John Mortimer, is but a "view-halloo" away. Also in Notting Hill, you will find Lord Hollick, Blairite proprietor of the Express, and David Sainsbury, generous new Labour donor.

             ...There are red herrings, too:
             <strong>
              it is said that Peter Mandelson offered to babysit for his neighbour Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg, a power alliance that is probably not too threatening
             </strong>
             . Norman Lamont can be found in Kensington Park Road, but then he surely bears as much responsibility as any Millbank spin-doctor for getting new Labour into power. It’s more difficult to fit in Tony Benn, who has lived in the area for years. It is not impossible to imagine the Prime Minister strolling down Westbourne Grove on a Sunday morning on his way to chat to

              Lord Jenkins
             </strong>
             about the Third Way, waving merrily to the gawping Okay Yardies, only to spot Benn coming back from the newsagent, and having to dart into Cafi 206 to hide behind Mariella Frostrup.

He became deputy director of communications for both Meghan and Harry and William and Catherine in December, after racking up nearly seven years of experience working with two Government departments.

             Bing furnished the plane to Clinton on that trip to Korea ala Lisa Ling and her sister.  He got stuck paying for it to the tune of 200K. 
But it also implicates Dow Chemical.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to her biography on the Milken Institute's website, Latham "led the political strategy and execution for
             <strong>
              the 'super surrogates,' (Obama, Biden, President Clinton) and ran the campaign’s covert running-mate selection process, announcement and general election plan.
             </strong>
             " Latham is also often referred to as the chief of staff for John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman.
             <strong>
              Latham even played a pivotal role in Podesta's infamous email leak during the 2016 presidential campaign. It was Latham who forwarded the phishing scam onto the IT employee asking if it was legitimate.

             She was in President Obama's orbit as well. USA Today reported that Latham had

            <p>
             Her stint at Freuds was a homecoming for Latham, who had been a director at UK PR firm from 2003 and 2005, and per PR Week, she returned last year to lead the company's

             I just checked out your image of the Linkedin profile.  I find that the list of people on the right side of the screen under "People also Viewed" tend to through up new connections ..  On your image there is listed a Jenny Biggam, owner of the7Stars.  I predict that's another rabbit hole..

            As usual, Thanks for putting things together. I can only add my own comical/common sense viewpoint to this, in that, these rats are deserting the ship, and hiring people that are loyal to them by blackmail?  "Ms Latham, believed to be a British-American dual citizen, worked in the White House in the Bill Clinton era as an assistant to the President. She also served as an adviser for Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign." So why else would they hire her? She failed at her job. Second time is a charm? They have nothing left but failures. Where is Karl Rove? They cannot go outside of the circle to hire anyone relevant because of contamination risk. Not only that, but people inside the circle are realizing that their used to be great lives are in extreme jeopardy.
