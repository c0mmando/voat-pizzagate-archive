              Yes I agree.  It was too painful for me to point out that the last one with the garbage can is called Waste of Space, as though a child was, to someone, just "a waste of space."  Sick.

            <p>
             Elliott I. Portnoy (born November 1, 1965) is an American attorney and the Global chief executive officer of Dentons—a law firm that launched March 28, 2013 with the combination of US/UKMEA firm SNR Denton, Canada's Fraser Milner Casgrain and Europe's Salans, and is now the largest law firm in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2009, Portnoy was named the top D.C. lawyer in the category of "Lobbying Law" by the Washington Business Journal.[16] He was also recognized as one of the nation’s top lobbyists by Washingtonian magazine, which also credited him for the growth of Sonnenschein's lobbying practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1988 while studying at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, Portnoy founded the organization Kids Enjoy Exercise Now (KEEN) with his wife, Estee Portnoy, and expanded it to Washington, D.C., in 1992. KEEN is a nonprofit organization that provides sports opportunities to children with severe and profound disabilities. Starting in 2006, the organization expanded beyond Washington, D.C. to eight U.S. cities.[21] Portnoy also serves on the board of directors of several non-profit foundations including the MetaCancer Foundation.

               The sensational Carroll Foundation Trust and parallel Gerald 6th Duke of Sutherland Trust multi-billion dollar corporate identity theft offshore tax fraud bribery scandal which is encircling the HSBC Holdings Plc Chairman Mark Tucker has disclosed that the Dentons international law firm has been named in this case of international importance.

             </p>
             <p>
              Sources have confirmed that the explosive Scotland Yard criminal prosecution files contain forensic specimen exhibits of twenty eight forged and falsified State of Delaware and UK Companies House “registered” Carroll Trust Corporations “centered around” the Dentons law firm fraudulently incorporated Urban Finance Corporation Ltd.
             </p>
             <p>
              **Scotland Yard leaked sources have said that the Dentons law firm “sponsored” UK Companies House “registered” Urban Finance Ltd group **structures were effectively utilised as a diversionary corporate smokescreen for the embezzlement of two hundred million dollars of Gerald Carroll’s huge treasury investment holdings which were held at the Queen’s bankers Coutts &amp; Co and Barclays Bank City of London branches.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Carroll Foundation Trust files are held within a complete lockdown at the FBI Washington DC field office and the Metropolitan Police Scotland Yard London under the supervision of the Commissioner Cressida Dick QPM who is known to have an intimate knowledge of this case which stretches the globe over a staggering sixteen years.

               Ex-Sidley partner cleared in tax case as CPS admits ‘wholesale failures’ while Dentons partner leaves following harassment inquiry

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Former Sidley Austin partner Matthew Cahill, who was accused of tax offences, has had all charges against him dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted to ‘wholesale failures’ in its disclosure process. Meanwhile, a Dentons partner accused of sexual harassment has left the firm following an internal investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cahill’s charges related to investments he made in Zeus Partners, a film scheme setup by HSBC, which HMRC deemed to be fraudulent in December 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cahill and a KPMG partner, as well as a JPMorgan banker, were the only three investors to be prosecuted out of a wider group of 400 individuals who had invested in the schemes. However the charges against Cahill were dropped in July 2017, before he had even filed a legal defence.

                 So is it Pablo Miller that did it?  This could be P Miller.  Should also read what happened to the woman when she looked into Miller.  Her whole system broke down.  I may look at Murray's blog more often.  Forgot how Woke this guy really is.

                  Well, there is some speculation that it might have been.  Reading between the lines of Murray's latest tweets and blogs I think he knows even more than he's letting on.  Interesting times.  More to come out I'm sure.

                 I truly believe Jose M.  was an evil pedo.  Also I would def follow Murray's advice.  He is One Smart Cookie.  Remember that he is the one that said Seth Rich passed those emails to in the park.  He better watch his back.  We know about what happened to Assange's lawyer.  He committed suicide by jumping in front of a train. Thanks for the links, am looking now.

                 Brain's getting fuzzy but I remember researching him and there was some little site that had info about Caracol being owned by a bigger co. who is was working for (there goes the brain again) and the claimed when they found out they immed sold it.  I always wondered if that was just a crock.

              Susan Alice Buffett (born July 30, 1953)[1] is the daughter of Warren Buffett. She is also an American philanthropist, her charitable work has focused largely on the Sherwood Foundation, formerly known as the Susan A. Buffett Foundation, an organization in Omaha that provides grants in public education, human services and social justice in the interest of promoting the welfare of children from lower-income families.[2][3][4] She is also on the boards of the Buffett Foundation and Girls, Inc.[2][5] According to a 2010 interview with her brother Howard Graham Buffett, Buffett's philanthropic focus has consistently remained on children, education and family issues,[5] but she has also committed to other causes, including Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa, a non-governmental organization dedicated to various improvements in Africa.[6]

               Warren Buffet is an evil piece of shit and no doubt at the top of the global human trafficking pyramid.  His role in covering up the Franklin Scandal and his vast railroad and transportation holdings ( trafficking ) are giant red flags.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, his name has been ubiquitous in the MSM for the last 2 months, as a PR campaign is underway to anoint Sainthood.

                Yep to all of it.  I am sure much has been scrubbed.  He tried to buy a Greek Island with some Italian guy and claimed it was a Bus. Venture.  Bull.  It was found out that it was not going through Berkshire Hathaway which is his Investment Firm.  So either there is some Hanky Panky going on with this Ital. guy or they are trying to hide this Bus. Venture.  What were they going to do on or with this Island?  Hmm.
