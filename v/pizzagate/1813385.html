            Here is the major problem facing what he is trying to do. Let's say he does film and document. Which film or doc distributor who is NOT compromised would distribute his film??? I'm not being pessimistic, just realistic as I know a thing or two about the film business. If Conspiracy of silence was suppressed, he will be facing the same thing. I wish him luck, but the funding may be better used on doing that for social media. If he can put out something along the lines of 'Loose change' he might have a chance, but that takes intelligent filmmaking minus the emotion as to not be blindsided by your ultimate goal.

            Speaking as one who was tortured as a young child I can tell everyone that cares to care, the tormentors are far from human, you actually see the darkness in their eyes. They also have an unmistakeable grin to which I interpreted as saying, "We are your gods, and you our slave till death". I can testify to the fact that even after physical freedom, "our slave to death" continues on. These torturers paint images in the mind of the young victim that rarely, if ever vanish. I often reflect on our Prisoners of War, then I look into the mirror of the soul of a child so young that not even one single coping mechanism had yet been developed. If I had the ability to reach out and touch the rest of mankind and transfer just one small bit of the pain so they would understand, I would not do it. No matter what, compassion precludes me from such an act.

            I hope he is the real deal.

            I would think it possible to produce a rough pilot episode from his contacts and a smart phone.  The idea seemed to be to film pedo arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Infowars would probably help initially with editing and production.  Several bloggers have put together amazing videos with little more than an iphone and a laptop in their bedroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            He does alas tick all the boxes, were he placed as controlled opposition.  TPTB are nothing if not sneaky!
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't in any way want to rain on your parade private, and I completely identify with your frustration and outrage that nothing appears to be being done in relation to the pizzagate/pedogate allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sawman probably needs to put his head back above the parapet and explain his next steps. I would expect this to happen at the end of the month when this funding round completes.
           </p>
           <p>
            One can only hope there is some truth in Chaos Theory - that a butterfly flaps its wings and over time and distance causes a hurricane.  I feel so grateful to the guys who have organised the demonstrations and so inadequate in my own contributions and would feel ever indebted if Sawman comes through.
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked at
            <a href="https://americasfund.me/resources/terms-of-service">
             https://americasfund.me/resources/terms-of-service
            </a>
            and rooted around the site a little.  Costs of 5.4% seem reasonable as these things go.  He has raised just over $125,000 towards a $500,000 goal over a month with six days to go.  I feel an overwhelming urge to contribute.  What's to lose - a few handfuls of dollars?  It is a one way bet.  He might be the snowball that starts the avalanche.
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering I have spent some 1000 hours down this rabbit hole - something MUST be done!

             Very much appreciate your thoughts as always, Silver. I also don't know if Sawyer is 100% legitimate, and let's wait and see. However,  the push back we receive here on our forum when anyone with any audience  tries, is telling, I feel, and makes me want to push back to see how, exactly how much and which people push back. It's an eye opener, always!
            </p>
            <p>
             You know you're right, why don't we ask for a pilot? That's a GOOD idea.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not discouraging people of course who have an alternate opinion on this, we are all frustrated as you say.
            </p>
            <p>
             I appreciate alternate ideas. However I see those who appear out of the blue when someone's name is mentioned, as I'm sure other genuine people do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks Silver! Let's live in HOPE

            Arguments that Sawyer is in this for the money are laughable. In the history of entertainment, no one has ever become richer from diving into the deep end of reporting on child sex trafficking and slavery. I believe in siding with our better and more trusting angels. I'm taking him at his word to do whatever he can to contribute to this ugly war that is thwarted here and there by do gooders who imagine they'll save some kid in a dungeon if only they can keep a few more bucks out of Sawyer's war chest.

            You're donating to a future documentary, from what i understand. That is Craig Sawyer's goal, to make a doc to raise awareness. He's not going out and directly busting pedophiles. There are other people raising money for docs too. Personally, the one that will  feature Becki Percy and other survivors would be my pick for donations.

             Some random guy from Federal Way, WA is asking for 50k to produce the documentary and when he made a submission here he didn't have a portfolio or anything to show his previous work as a 'videographer'. Not only that but he didn't have any break down of what will be spent where which makes you wonder how he came up with the 50k estimate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Becki says she vetted him and has proven to her that he is a 'born again christian'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at the guilt trip clickbait title he gave this submission -

             I agree V. The point is that a few people are asking for donations, and god knows we don't need peeps to tell us where we'd rather spend our money. What really bothers me is the negative energy here whenever this man appears. This (I have no affiliation), makes me push back.

              It is possible that the responses to Sawyer is based in sound reasoning, not shillery. We will see in time. I don't personally trust him at all. I hope that isn't construed as negative, just my opinion.

               I appreciate your thoughts and will ponder them, Z, thank you, I appreciate you. Are you agreeing with evineluvr on this, or have you different reasons? I find it extremrly difficult when all the people with large voices are thwarted, personally.

                I find it frustrating too! Ive been burned so many times though, and have had to realize that it is the voice with the most impact that TPTB will seek to control. We really don't have any heroes, except people like Howie.

            Pizzagate does not need a leader, a face, a voice, celebrity, or any other entity with a big audience. This comes up again and again and is always bad.
            <br/>
            What makes you think someone with a big voice is going to get anywhere? This new guy, and everyone else I'm supposed to follow and not dare criticize. Do you think tptb are going to let them get anywhere? They are either controlled opposition, doing it for selfish reasons, or are going to get cut down.
            <br/>
            I get the idea that we need someone to reach tons of people at once. But pizzagate's strength is its dissemination of efforts. They can't keep us all down, they can't control all of us. I'm not a shill for not opening my wallet every time someone says they are going to solve this mess for us.

             We don't need a leader, no. To spread the word, to red pill people, to rally people to the cause we do need imo. I don't believe everyone who comes aboard is controlled opposition, at all. Do you not believe famous and big faces feel the same as us, disgusted by what we've discovered?
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe if you have uncovered evidence then you need people to disemimmate it. We are all one hand. What I ponder is, why you are discouraging people who are helping the cause, collecting funds for a project which will expose it?

             4.HoneyBee is not saying that she doesn't encourage Craig Sawyer, but that in these days and times, nobody can be trusted 100% and I have to agree with that. I would say I trust him about 80%. However, he's been putting it out there and if only for this, I have to support him. I didn't say financially, but I wouldn't criticize him on simple theories such as he has an IMDB profile or he was on InfoWars. Yes he was, and he was on a dozen other Alt-Media channels.

              The Seal Team 6 membership is WELL DOCUMENTED.  In fact, it was in my post (that you conveniently ignored/cut off).  How DISHONEST of you.

              Anyone who has read my posts here knows that I am talking about JEWISH BLOODline, NOT THE RELIGION OF JUDAISM.

             <p>
              Sawyer is an ACTOR and PRODUCER of TV shows.  That alone is de facto evidence that he is JEWISH.  Non (BLOOD) Jews DO NOT GET acting and producing careers.

              He also has Jewish craniofacial morphology.  He looks a lot like fellow Jews Chuck Norris and Richard Boone.

              HoneyBee recommended CAUTION, which is EXACTLY what I wrote.  Stop putting words into my mouth.

              Finally, I have no agenda here but TRUTH.  If you can't HANDLE THE TRUTH, then that is NOT MY PROBLEM.

              I trust her just as much as I trust Sawyer. They both seem to be helping Pizzagate for now. Why discredit one and not the other when there's absolutely no proof that either of them is guilty of any wrong doing? The only difference is that he didn't say he didn't trust her. Only she did... kinda. That something to think about.

            As Craig Sawyer reports, forces are against him as follows -
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              they will attempt to disparage my name and reputation
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              they will attempt to interrupt the organizations funding
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              they will do ANYTHING to ATTEMPT to STOP us letting the masses know what's going on
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>

             Everything CS has said may be true HOWEVER... The 3 reasons you list I would expect him to say whether opposition or not.  It doesn't pass the smell test. First off why on earth would we bank on the Seal T6 cred when we know our own Gov. executed the whole team as expendable? As some have already pointed out, it doesn't take a shit load of money to make a quality vid, not to mention many here have ON THERE OWN DIME, produced some pretty damn good info vids. Anyone with a lick of sense could have read the posts here and come to the same conclusion as reason 2 &amp; 3. And before U go and judge me I will tell U up front I am on the MF'king fence.  The words ORGANIZATION &amp; GO FUND ME &amp; I'm a SEAL do not shake the money tree with me.  Had he earnestly came from any other direction he more than likely would have mine and many other's support.  That said I pray he's the REAL .DEAL but using AJ and a few others for recognition is just not, lets say cutting mustard.  Time will tell... and I have a laundry list of many who used KIDS as a ploy to tug on the hearts of many to empty pockets but the kids never benefited..Your support for Sawyer is admirable, just don't throw "Caution 2 the Wind" be careful Friends!

               A google image search of Knights Templar cross shows they are square. Research shows flared crucifix shaped crosses as found on Sawyer’s logo are not Knights Templar, since this particular cross cannot be found on any official Knights Templar websites or on websites that discuss their history. Research indicates no connection whatsoever between Sawyer and the Knights Templar. You knew this but included the rumor because you thought it had great potential to be damaging.

              <p>
               Even if he were Nights Templar, implying that all Knights Templar members were/are always evil or bad is preposterous. There are thousand page books written about the Knights Templar and their thousand year history, and it’s safe to say that without them, we’d all likely be bowing down to Mecca right about now instead of fighting the good fight, not that history is remotely your strong suit. You cannot dismiss all Catholics, Mormons, Jews, Templars, Boy Scouts of America, or any other organization simply because it exhibits fraternal elements. There are good people to be found in all these groups.

               That’s not his resume you cite at blog.uspatriottactical, but let’s pretend it is. It is indeed littered with 33’s, all two of them. Mind you, one of the references is to the number of Air Marshals working at the time of 9/11, and so is the other when it says "Sawyer was one of those 33" so technically, there’s one reference to the number 33. Now unless Sawyer was also in charge of hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration (which oversaw Air Marshal service prior to 9/11) and somehow managed to hire exactly 33 Air Marshals to have on hand for the occasion of September 11 2001, having all one of them references on his resume is called a coincidence, barely. Curiously, his actual bio on his official website is also littered with 33’s, all one them too.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Sawyer is an Anglo-Saxon surname. The notion he’s Jewish without presenting a single shred of verifiable proof is intriguing, especially when his IMDb bio describes him as a Southern Texas boy. Even if he was Jewish, noting this would only speak to your prejudices, which are well known.
              </p>

             <li>
              <p>
               Seal Team Six is not basically CIA at all. Seal Team Six is Navy through and through, but has indeed run joint exercises with CIA, for example hunting down Taliban fighters in Pakistan, but these particular kinds of joint operations in the field are quite unrelated to the aspects of the CIA which are rogue.
              </p>

             <li>
              <p>
               You say "CS lauds his CIA and MI6 connections" and go on to cite a one hour video as if the reader is supposed to watch the whole thing on your advice to perhaps find the three second reference to which you allude. Curiously, there is strong circumstantial evidence that it’s not there. You say "13:45 (AJ in his deepest, most gravely voice)" but there is no Jones speaking for ten minutes before or after this mark of the video. By design (hoping no one would actually vet your reference) or by accident, you’ve got the wrong video, not just there, but further down your post when you say "AJ says he donated $10,000 to the effort (15:42)" yet Jones says no such thing for three minutes before or after this mark. Even granting that you merely made outrageous errors in post construction, there is no $10 000 reference at the 13:45 mark of the earlier video either.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               You imply there's an inconsistency between Jones's pledge of $10 000 and Sawyer's actual claim of $100 000 and is therefore cause for concern. Did you know that one Alex Jones indeed pledged $100 000 on air in front of millions of people? However, if you can’t get at least half of your video citations right, there's no compelling reason for anyone to direct you to the exact Alex Jones Show date and time to find this reference.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>

             You know what makes me go hmmm...? When someone produces whole cloth nonsense about an injured Navy veteran trying to do something to mitigate child sex trafficking and expects anyone to recognize that nonsense as anything other than a steaming pile of horseshit. You thought nobody would scrutinize your amphigory.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have to confess that I've never seen anyone quite as inept as you at everything forum related, even deception. I mean calling Sawyer out for 33's is virtually a classic and may well stand as the most spectacular forum fail of all time. It's too bad more people can't witness your ineptitude. To be brutally honest, I'm kind of looking forward to your next production, but you've set the bar so low, I can't imagine you outdoing yourself.

             Once the organization is up and running, I'm going to volunteer to help investigate in my area. I'm going to record everything and make multiple copies and send one to V4CR and we will see if he real or fake.

               That's one wacky dude who wants Canada to cut all ties with Britain, or something like that. Not a reliable source of information at all.

                 I think Vindicator is referring to Kevin Annett. The one that I mentioned to you in a previous post that went rogue on the SRA victims and supported the CIA-fabricated "false memory syndrome" to discredit them. I linked a source there as well to support my argument. Remember?

             say I am, which I'm not, working for Craig's org? I would be honoured! As would much of the genuine PG Voaters here, I imagine. A famous man with immense connections, on our side, what's not to love? Why are you so disparaging against him when you say you're on our side? Curious as to your background, maybe you'd like to share with us?

                 I would say, if you're WITH the movement, why are you disparaging people who are trying? He's already put his ass on the line, surely ? MAybe you can tell me exactly why you're so against someone who, by all accounts, is on our side?

                   If he is, as you say, affiliated with these, he is still putting his Rep against them. If he doesn't come up with the goods, okay?! But if he does? I don't understand why you are against him from the outset.

              Alas, comments are a free speech zone, so unless someone is literally posting adspam or the same comment over and over in the same thread, it doesn't meet Voat's definition of spam. No matter how boring and predictable the comment may be when you see it over and over, day after day, no more convincing no matter how many times it's posted. If it's any consolation, consider that IF people were winning the argument, they wouldn't be posting the same comment over and over again. :-)
