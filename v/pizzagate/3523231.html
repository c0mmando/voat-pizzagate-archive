<p>The government said Mack made around $75,000 by hiding 75 foreign student-athletes who were in the country illegally.</p>
<p>A federal complaint alleged Mack conspired to hide the foreign student-athletes from the Deparof Homeland Security and profited from it.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges Mack &quot;knowingly and intentionally entered false information regarding whether these foreign nationals were in compliance with their F-1 student visas.&quot;</p>

<p>Federal investigators said Mack helped coaches and recruiters circumvent the student visa system by saying students were &quot;properly enrolled and maintaining a full course of study when she knew the information was false.&quot;</p>
<p>The academy ceased operations in 2017.</p>
<p>Mack will be kept in a low security facility because of her health and will serve a year of supervised release when she gets out.</p>
<p>As for the coaches who were named in the case, there was mention of other investigations taking place, but it\'s unclear if they will be prosecuted.</p>

            Holy Wow! Just saw reviews for this school under a Zillow app. Good reviews except for two and are they doozies.  One said Great place to have your Children fondled WHAT? The other one said the Children are never in class. Holy Moly.

             We think alike. Have not found anything on the two being related but Allison’s father is with LA Opera and a tenor. He is a voice teacher. Hmm. Access to students. Still trying to find extended fam. Info. I use duck go and when I look up her dad the screen goes black. Never happened before. Wonder if this is systemic within the family. Would be a shocker to find Evelyn is related. There is a big tip off that high levels are involved when a short sentence is given.

              Found my computer doing strange things when I first started following Q drops. Sometimes would be redirected to a Russian porn site. Several times computer started buzzing super loud when I tried to type qmap.pub. Someone knows something for sure.
