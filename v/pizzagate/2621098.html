            <p>
             When Rick Frechette became a Passionist priest in 1979, his goal was to minister to the spiritual health of humanity. Little did he know that one day he would also minister to the physical health of orphaned children and the needy.
Born in 1953, Frechette graduated from Assumption College in Massachusetts with degrees in math and philosophy. He next attended St. John’s University in New York and studied theology as a seminarian, and was ordained a priest in 1979. After a few years as a parish priest in Baltimore, he met Fr. William B. Wasson, founder of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos™ (NPH, Spanish for “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”) and worked in Mexico in 1983 at an old hacienda that had been converted to a home for nearly 1,000 orphaned and abandoned children. As a priest and administrator, his next calling was to Honduras to help establish a second orphanage for NPH.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also founded the St. Luke Foundation which creates dignified jobs in social service fields including 29 street schools, water delivery to the slums, hospitals and clinics and burying the unclaimed dead from the city morgue.

             The aging white SUV that Solá was driving got stuck in traffic, authorities said. Though there are varying accounts of what happened next, two men approached the vehicle. At least one of the men shot Solá and a passenger in the front seat. The men took Solá's purse and fled. 
"Isabel's loss is immense," Fr. Hans Alexandre said at Sacred Heart Parish, where Solá's prosthetics ministry is based, Vatican Radio reported. "In doing this, they didn't just kill a person. They killed the hopes of so many." 
On Saturday morning, Fr. Enzo Del Brocco, a U.S. Passionist missionary, celebrated Mass at a chapel. In a homily honoring the feast day of St. Gregory, Del Brocco focused on the verities of faith, life and the eternal. But he also honored Solá and asked, "Who would kill someone who was helping the poor? Why?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Landry said Solá's prosthetic work was only a part of her mission. Solá had "managed to find donors to build schools in remote and disadvantaged areas," Landry said. "She worked in the training of teachers for these schools."
             <strong>
              Pope Francis mentioned Solá and her dedication to the people of Haiti at the canonization of Mother Teresa on Sunday in Rome.

             By the time we arrived in Haiti, after a stopover in Miami, we had missed three landing slots at the airport. Aid agencies — genuine aid agencies — from other countries were being turned away, refused permission to land. But we still got a slot straight away. The guy who ran our charter seemed to think that the Scientologists had some real influence with the US Government, who were assigning the slots.

            I volunteered at her Children's Home in Port-au-Prince in the late 90's.  I didn't see anything suspicious.  Besides sick children there were a few older orphans.  I was there 3 months and never saw any of them leave.  The nuns were not bad to the kids, but not at all warm.  They seemed more interested in each other and doing their "god duty" and rituals than showing any loving to the kids.  Of course one can get compassion fatigue, I understand that.
            <br/>
            I was at the time at the end stages of rejecting religion.  (I wasn't catholic but interested in the question of God and suffering) My time in Haiti convinced me that if there is a powerful god that god is not good.  Her ideas that suffering is a gift from god I found particularly abhorrent, but I don't know if the nuns there subscribed to that.  I think they enjoyed their own fellowship and were doing the work to insure their own salvation, nothing more.

            When qualified doctors visited the home, however they found that the medical care provided was very poor.  Most of the volunteers had no medical knowledge and yet had to make medical decisions because there were no doctors available.  There was no distinction made between those who were suffering from curable and incurable illnesses so people who might have survived had they been given access to treatment were left to die.
           </p>
           <p>
            Needles were re-used so many times that they became blunt and they were not sterilized between uses.  In 1981 when the state of care in her facilities was challenged she said ‘There is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot, to suffer it like Christ’s Passion.  The world gains much from their suffering’.  This shows a very cynical use of the poor to further the ends of others.

            That's just for starters.  There is more.

             YES.  Mother Theresa herself was not a Holy Saint as jorge wanted us to believe.  She did not treat poor people very well.  From what I have read (albeit a few years ago) the money was probably going to the Vatican.  Just like they are taking money from all the charities.  I am sure there are many other imposters.

               Yes, I remember that article Hell's Angel.  A perfect choice for jorge bergoglio.  And pope john ll.  I wonder if she was really a woman, she looks more like jorge.  He was involved with disappearing babies in Argentina, they had something in common.

               I believe he was silenced! As was William Cooper, Robin Williams, Joan Rivers (for saying Michelle was a Tranny) JFK, John Lennon.... the list is endless! But they cannot silence all of us. Their days are numbered. Expect new false flag attacks and new divide/rule stratagems - Michael Moore has been Resuscitated by his handlers for another round of Left vs Right.

               The guy smoked and boozed to an insane degree so he pretty much Darwin awarded himself.

               He was a moronic Trotskyist who was only negative on Mother Teresa due to his hatred of any religious figure with good PR.  He wasn't some hero bringing awareness to child abuse in  religious charities.

                He rejected Trotsky later. If you read anything he wrote about...well, anything, you would know he doesn't blindly hate religious celebrities. She was a monster and he wanted to expose it. That's it. She had good PR because of the same fake garbage on TV today, the same that gave the White Helmets a fucking award. In short, you dumb.

                 Yes, he switched from being a Trotskyist to being basically a Neoconservative in all but name, which is essentially the same group rebranded.  In short, you dumb.
