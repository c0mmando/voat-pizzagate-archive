            No, you didn’t address my rebuttals.   You offered half-baked, incomplete, disjointed scenarios that were out of context.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Alefantis' Imgur feed? He has a sick sense of humor. His business has a lot of screwed-up artwork on the walls. Welcome to every metropolitan dive and punk-show venue on the coast.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is not a question of humor, it’s a question of implicating  children in situations that would normally render the CPS on one’s doorstep.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think:  what what in the butt, your dad will tell you when you’re older - catapult.  That’s only one example of many.  This is a reference to a person's taste and interest and that’s what you people call funny??   There is child legislation, which is properly implemented and applied is put in place  to protect children from this type of bullying and abusive objectivity in the name of humor.  Sadly, the world has been compromised by liberals like yourself.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Why would you call that place family friendly and bring kids there?" Guess what, the punks grew up and we had kids, too. And it doesn't matter how many bands show up in ski-masks making jokes about Jared from Subway; getting "the creeps" from someone isn't justification for accusing them of being part of a pedo ring.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The punk show referencing children in sexual positions,  with phallic shaped objects in their mouth, along with videos that show obvious torture pictures etc, etc  means that those parents should be investigated for providing an unsafe environment for children.   Guess what,  torture is still illegal in the west, along with those pics in vids such as  Neutered noel, and other child pedo poster symbology and pictures that state  children are welcome!!  Guess what,  pedos and cp is still illegal in North America.   This is not some funny joke that doesn’t matter.   Maybe the punks should have spent a little more time checking laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore,  I don’t think people are accusing the people you’re referring to in your above comment as being involved in pedo rings,  but rather being involved in activities that shows a taste for child sensitive material,  so sensitive that  Ben Swan and others can’t put it on t.v.  because it’s not appropriate.  Why?  Because it refers to a child abuse  (for fun is irrelevant)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             People in politics have kids and grandkids. People in politics throw a lot of social gatherings. Why would she describe them as entertainment? Because kids are fucking entertaining (not to mention a handful). You don't need to be a pedophile to love children, but you do need to be an asshole to dislike them. (The "raw and uncut" is probably just another example of this kind of "grandma" humor.) Pool? Kids like to swim. If there's a pool at a party and I'm a kid and I'm invited, you can bet your ass that I'll be swimming.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well,  saying that kids are fucking entertainment may have been a freudian slip,  or more accurately a Clement Freudian slip? I’m 57 years old and never in my life have I heard old men have children for their entertainment while in the pool.    If  the kids were these old men's  grandkids I could understand it better,  but it would be worded more along the lines of saying,  I’m sending your grandkids for a visit.    Yes kids are a handful, which is why they aren’t actually something that would be entertainment,  like a musician.   I’ve never heard of old men being entertained by someone elses children as an actual   activity.   You are outrageous if you’d think any  non-deviant minded  person would think otherwise.  As a matter of fact,  in any normal family if this happened it would trigger the awareness  that something is very, very wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there’s a pool party and you’re a kid you can bet your ass that you’ll be swimming?   Again,  a fruedian slip?    When I was that age I would not want to be swimming with a bunch of old farts.   Did these children know these old men?
            <br/>
            Answer me that!!
If so, how well did they know them?   Depositions and signed affidavits all round are needed on that one.
Most children would want to go to a pool party with  OTHER  children,  not with old men.  As a matter of fact,   that would actually discourage  children rather than appeal to them.
            <br/>
            Did these children  not have a pool of their own?   Answer that!
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Show me evidence that those three kids have been physically or mentally abused. I'm sure one of you has already called the CPS on her. Or are you afraid that the CPS will just sell them into slavery?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It’s your job to provide  mental health evaluations and questions of all the children. If you don’t know the mess CPS is in, then I’d refer you to Nancy Schaeffer’s testimony.  Sadly,  her and her husband are dead.  You might also want to check out a research review of their mysterious death.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Here is a pizza-related map on a handkerchief.JPG Since Podesta and his ilk like italian food so goddamn much, it's no shock that he might have something like this and have left it lying around. As for the rest, nobody seems to know about the circumstances of this house, the realty deal, the agent, etc. Literally everything concerning this has been total speculation. The "map means jizz" theory is based on nothing, and the "code words imageJPG used to justify it now was obviously created after-the-fact. (Note that pillows aren't on that list, so no matter which way you slice it, this whole e-mail is debunked as far as I'm concerned.)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You aren’t able to relate  pizza to a map.   I’ve eaten  itialian food, namely pizza,  all my life and I’ve never eaten with a map, or anything associated with a map.   However,   code words associate sex  with maps and pizza with children.   You can try to deny that all you want at your own risk of looking amazingly stupid or naive.    Honestly,  I don’t think you’re either stupid or naive,  I think you’re cunning and manipulative with no sense of moral compass - trying to normalize something that is not funny,  not normal and not legal.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dominoes was mentioned in another e-mail in a perfectly normal context. This is like saying "Do you think I'll be better at Skyrim on liquor than I am on beer?" I'm guessing they had a legit pasta party (my friends and I used to have a pasta-and-movie night once a week, people do it, it's normal) and the dude lost at Dominoes.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It should be apparent to even you that your answer is nonsense.  Would you do better on liquor or beer  at skyrim?   What are you babbling about?    You’re  GUESSING!!   Yes,  that is your first problem of many.
So you’re trying to convince us that they had a  ‘’legit’’  pasta part and he somehow  used pasta and cheese in an obscure relation to playing dominoes?    Explain in detail how that game works with cheese and pasta.   Especially since every idiot knows that pasta and cheese is code.
           </p>
           <p>
            You haven’t explained why they’d have SOMEONE ELSE'S  children for entertainment when they could spend quality time with their own grandchildren !!   These are busy men and I’m sure if they’re being entertained by children they’d rather it be their own grandkids that they know and love, and with whom they’d like to have as much time as they can together. 
Any jury would question the relationship of kids for entertainment in context with the  art photo of the little emaciated boy bound up and hanging in torture in torture ropes from the ceiling,  or the children who are lined up in a row,  hands behind their back,  sad little looks on their faces with pink bottoms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain that now.  You're imagination is wild, however it's not the actual truth of these people,  it's not their  answer.   It's your imagining.   You're imagining wouldn't hold up in court because you aren't them.

            It would be unfair if someone was killed before having a public trial.  If we get lucky, some of them may end up receiving the punishment they deserve via capital punishment.  Take your east coast skepticism and contribute to this community or get the fuck out of here.

            EastCoastSkeptic, I am sorry you feel that way. Rule 4 is designed to keep
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            focused on facts -- things that happened and things that people have said -- and prevent posts that are nothing more than the opinion and thoughts of the OP. You are welcome to include your opinion and thoughts in posts on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , so long as you first focus on facts you can link to. You could easily rewrite this post as one linking to examples of the "witch hunt" you posit...assuming evidence of this exists. Take a look at the comment section of Podesta's twitter account for starters. If he's just an innocent guy, it would really suck.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, in fact, I remove posts every day that attempt to brand businesses and charities who happen to have a swirl, butterfly or heart in their logo as Pedo-signaling members of the cabal with no other evidence at all. The submission guidelines requiring a demonstrated relevance to Pizzagate backed by linked sources are what allow me to do this.

            it may take wingnuts looking for clues in music videos and presenting them as potential leads.  This is shit the FBI doesn't have to do now.  Why condone it, after being discussed on these boards thins that are more relevant gain attention, we don't know how many FBI or others are here getting leads.  If it is just 1 and they find some links to people in pictures or what not they will use it.  You passing off critical inquire into sick shit is just a means to bolster the the pedo adgenda.

            Please repost this with a random link about PG being debunked and thus the mods cannot remove. Its a very well articulated piece enveloping everything I've wanted to say myself but lacked the time and patience. These people need to really see this and chew on the hard crunch of reality. Please don't let this be in vain. Grab a link and copy and paste. Please!

            There's your problem.  Spend more time researching or take a remedial comprehension course,  or both.

             you're not trying to solve a crime, but rather looking for a crime where there is no evidence of one.

           <p>
            Wrong.  Looking for indicators that might force the pathetic legal system to investigate.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is more than enough of that.

           <pre><code>every single one can be easily explained, and I will gladly accept the challenge to offer 
simple explanations for any which are presented.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Aaah,  but if it's so easily explained then  those who are involved should be doing the explaining.   Get it?   Not some nobody who  is defending them based on personal data which you don't have and that's why an investigation must be done.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain why Tamera Luzzatto said Uber Service would bring her 3 grandkids for these old farts entertainment in the pool.
            <br/>
            But how can you in all honesty expect to give a simple explanation when you aren't these people and can't speak for them?
           </p>
           <p>
            And don't pull some stupid idea out your imagination.  Tell the exact real reason, provide data and witness depositions, not some made up possibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Explain what Clinton Foundation means by a pizza pac.   Not what  YOU  think it means based on your own position to defend them, but on what  IT ACTUALLY MEANS.  And provide actual proof of that,  texts, emails,  paper, personal conversations and all related supportive data.   If you can't do that then your'e a complete idiot defending something you know nothing about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Witch hunt?   lols.    Revenue Department can pull you in for an audit with no explanation needed and virtually an anonymous tip to the revenue department can produce an automatic audit.   Do you also believe that they're witch hunting if and when they do this?
           </p>
           <p>
            aaah,  but ask for a child investigation when there is more than enough information that shows abnormal behavior and you call it a witch-hunt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually, I don't want you're answers, I want their answers and data submitted, depositions of all people implied by non-partisan multiple investigators over a  long period of time.  But if you're serious there's a website offering $25 grand if you can provide data to explain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go there.

           <p>
            You're real bias here is that you've been completely desensitized and normalized to anything that  indicates inappropriate behavior toward children.   Your mentality  also explains why pedophilia is mushrooming due to legislation and programming to desensitize and normalize such behavior.

           <p>
            You can't be serious.  You have to be fucking with me.  You can't seriously think any of us want this to be true.  We want children enslaved in pedo rings?    No,  we don't want it to be true.  Sadly,  we just want a full investigation from multiple non-partisan investigators.

            I'm sorry, but sending emails that describe your affiliation and support, and active engagement with  someone who uses  blood, semen, mothers milk,  mock cannabilsm  and god knows what other shit  (literally)   in rituals along with  a connection to child torture photos  has

             nothing

           <p>
            I'm sorry that you're moral compass is so broken that you can't seem to recognize societal cause and effect long term.   Enjoy your shit world, because that's what you're   so-called   religion is providing.

            That said, I agree with your final paragraph... but a lot of the compelling stuff mixed with the false "smoking guns" and downright kooky nonsense that bubbles up are all simply data points and talking points. I don't think the active contributors feel that they are responsible for the creation of a bullet proof legally sound offensive dossier. The active censorship and immediate "debunking" occurring in the MSM and on various social networks is like nothing we've ever seen before. Not to mention the handful of threats that have come to light as researchers got "too close" with a few sensitive topics (i.e. Pegasus and Alefantis)
           </p>
           <p>
            So, while I don't necessarily think you are a shill... because you are suggesting a much more refined approach, I would certainly enjoy your insight/explanation on the quotes/comments above. Especially since you offered to explain them and to-date, no one else has been able to.

            You are correct about some of what you say.  There is some crap here, yet they're also irrefutable details that expose and implicate multiple republicans and democrats.  This is similar to the shit that the South Korean ex-President is going through and closely tied to the issues exposed in the Franklin Scandal in Nebraska.  You are trying to help pedophiles and occult secret societies with your stance.  Think about that.
