<p>&quot;A Connecticut hotel owner who had a “sex dungeon” hidden at his business was arrested after** he attempted to buy a preteen girl for “slave training” and “limitless sex” for two days**, police said.</p>
<p>Simon Hessler was arrested Tuesday after investigators set up a sting to nab the 46-year-old man during a child prostitution and human trafficking investigation. <strong>Hessler was caught attempting to purchase a 12-year-old girl for two days in exchange for $500</strong>, the Hartford Courant reported.</p>
<p>The preteen girl, however, was a “very petite narcotics officer from East Hartford.”</p>
<p>Police began investigating Hessler in October after they discovered he sought photos of young Mexican girls for a “casting couch interview,” the newspaper reported, citing the arrest warrant. In conversations with Connecticut state police Det. Samantha McCord, Hessler revealed he had a dungeon he used to train slaves. The alleged sex dungeon was “an elaborate sado-masochism room with multiple beds with whips and chains and handcuffs on the wall.” It also included a metal cage with a padlock.</p>
<p>Hessler shared with the detective several photos of the dungeon, which was located in Hessler’s business, New England Hospitality Management.</p>
<p><strong>The hotel owner eventually asked McCord to bring him a “DCF/foster kid”</strong> so he could train her in his “slave quarters” and have sex with her, the police report stated. He allegedly asked for the girl to be dropped off at a trailer parked in the Manchester hotel parking lot where she is left handcuffed with a black hood and on the floor.</p>
<p>Hessler was arrested once he pulled up to the trailer. Police also recovered 11 flash drives from Hessler’s house after they contacted his wife who asked if her husband had “done something with underage girls.”</p>
<p>Hessler was arrested and faces several charges, including attempted felony to patronize a prostitute and second-degree attempted sex assault.</p>
<p>He is being held on $1 million bail and expected back in court on Dec. 12.&quot;</p>',

No worries, Trump is comin for them  one day, yeah?

            I did some research on newspapers.com and found a lot on Simon Adriem Hessler.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, and most importantly, he was a close friend, neighbor and boss to Clyde F. Wilson, who killed himself after shooting at police when he ignored a restraining order from his estranged wife and started an argument at his home with his oldest daughter. Was Wilson involved with Hessler in child sex trafficking back in 1997?

            Man shoots officer, kills self at house
Estranged wife called Bloomfield police for help
By LIZABETH HALL 
Courant Correspondent
           </p>
           <p>
            BLOOMFIELD -- When Jonnette Shea frantically called police for help early Friday morning, she knew her estranged husband had a gun. What he was going to do with it she didn't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            A half hour later, Clyde F. Wilson used that gun to wound a police officer and then kill himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police are trying to comprehend why a man to whom, friends say, family meant everything killed himself after a shootout with police, with his children at home.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Even in bad times, his family came first," close friend and neighbor Simon Hessler added. "He never would have put his children in harm's way."
           </p>
           <p>
            According to police records and reports, his wife was not so certain. Earlier this week, Shea obtained a protective order barring Wilson from their home at 15 Stillman Road after he was arrested in connection with an argument with his oldest daughter during which he pushed his wife.

           </p>
           <p>
            Days later, about 3 a.m. Friday, Wilson defied the court order, breaking his way into the front door. Shea, her children and her 5-year-old grandauehter were there, police said.
           </p>
           <p>
            By then Officer Eric Kovanda, 26, and Officer Charley Simmons, 33, had arrived. Hiding in the darkened house, Wilson turned his attention to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guided only by flashlights and Shea's voice from an adjoining bedroom, the two officers crept down the hallway. In the glint of the flashlight, Simmons saw Wilson raise a gun. At Simmon's order to drop the gun, Wilson started shooting. The officers ran in opposite directions. Wilson followed Kovanda, firing three bullets. One hit Kovanda in the hand and ricocheted up his arm as he was trying to break down a door. Kovanda fired two shots back, police said, but Wilson was not hit, police said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The shots stopped, and then there was one more," Bloomfield police Lt. Steven Weisher said. "It was very fast. The officers were both directly in front of Mr. Wilson. One realized that he was there and his gun was raised. He was ordered to drop the gun. They moved for cover. It's a nightmare."
           </p>
           <p>
            In all, six shots were fired. The gun Wilson used was a 10 millimeter, Weisher said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kovanda, who is married and has a young baby, is expected to recover full use of his hand and arm, police said. He was released from St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford Friday afternoon and is

           <p>
            Wilson, a custodial supervisor at a South Windsor cleaning business, was pronounced dead at 4 a.m. Friday at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford. His EMPLOYER and a close friend and neighbor [HESSLER] said Friday violent outbursts were uncharacteristic of Wilson.
           </p>
           <p>
            Court records show that Wilson filed personal bankruptcy in 1995. It was approved a year later. 
Wilson and his family had rented the yellow split-level house for several years in a quiet, upwardly mobile neighborhood of empty-nesters and young families.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some neighbors said the Wilson family did not fit in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neighbors complained about Wilson's dog, on at least one occasion calling in the dog warden. Other neighbors complained about the bustle of activity of a large household where people were coming and going and Wilson was repairing cars in the driveway. The Hartford Courant
           </p>
           <p>
            For several years, he worked at Admiral Cleaning and Maintenance Inc. in South Windsor. Mike Bar-nett, an owner, described Wilson as a conscientious and obliging employee who did not take his profo-lems to work with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            "He would go above and beyond what we asked," Barnett said. "He was the kind of person who if you said you needed anything, it would be done. 'I'll take care of it.' This is a real shock. It's very sad." On his spare time, Wilson rebuilt cars and helped his neighbor, Simon Hessler, with house repairs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hessler is described as Wilson's neighbor, good friend AND EMPLOYER which means Hessler was co-owner with Mike Barnett of Admiral Cleaning and Maintenance, a perfect cover for pedophiles to hunt for victims.

            Interesting to note that Hessler lists Richard Branson and James Caan among his Interests/Influencers on LinkedIn:

            </a>
            .   com/in/simon-hessler-a098b982/  (Broken link needs spaces removed due to banned domain) (Scroll to the end "Interests" and then click "see all" and again scroll down to see remaining "influencers.")
           </p>
           <p>
            Reminder that Branson and Caan were also named as odd LinkedIn "interests" of the Ketron Island mansion owner with a mysterious room that was lockable like a safe featured in this

             We are aware of a trend dubbed "pedo clustering".  It's most evident in the 5000 block Connecticut Ave NW DC (CPP, LRF, P&amp;P, Parasol, Besta, etc.).  But we've seen it in a community in AZ, most likely Broward, Bucks Co. PA, etc.
            </p>

             Where there are pedophile-type operations, there are usually a lot more related activities - look at dentists, pediatricians, daycare, therapists, etc.

            Another Connecticut trafficking ring: " Westport man set free after guilty plea in sex trafficking guilty case"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Trefzger and two other men had been charged last year with involvement in a sex-trafficking ring, which authorities said had been forcing young men with mental disabilities into prostitution for more than two decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trefzger, who was accused of patronizing the ring, accepted a plea deal Friday after agreeing to testify against Robert King, who police said masterminded the scheme, and Bruce Bemer, said to be another of its longtime clients."

              Sure! Rothstein was an NYPD Detective for about a decade and a half. He explains in the interview that the NYPD is full of white-hats (essentially) and when he was assigned to work on prostitute cases, they first began realizing the horrible things that were going on in the "underground." They had to develop completely new tactics and work in utmost secrecy as opposed to a regular law enforcement office. Eventually, the State Secret's Privilege shut down each one of their cases. NYPD is a world-wide police force, the largest in the world (or one of the largest), and, at least during the Franklin Scandal which Rothstein did work on, was operating on that scale.

               Ah good. Yup, I know the backstory.  This is the Prince/NYPD vector.  Goes back to Kerik days.  And Giuliani.  NYPD has a larger intelligence arm than the bulk of countries around the world.  Also is the only police agency with S2A weaponry.

                 After 9/11 Guiliani built a network, in conjunction with his "quality of life" laws, meant to turn NYC around from what SF is now.  It worked.  Until Bloomberg, now De Blah Blah.

            Excellent news! This reminds me of two things:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) An article from
            <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/11/gay-talese-the-voyeurs-motel">
             The New Yorker
            </a>
            from two years ago about a man who owned a motel in Colorado I believe. He was a voyeur and made holes in the ceilings of the rooms so he could get off while watching patrons undress/have sex/whatever.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) I know a woman in NYC who is a paid BDSM dominatrix. She told me that all up and down Sixth Avenue in Manhattan there are underground sex dungeons (like the one she works at). She is of age and is engaging willingly but it makes one wonder what else (or who else) can be bought in these secret dungeons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks again for the good news! Each pedo has a horrific impact on countless lives. So taking down one has positive ripple effects for generations.

            I have been in contact with these nasty fucks for years by proxy. I have tried to gain evidence on these fucks but wow you do not want to get caught by (((them))). They prey on the week and think they are untouchable... Coming from someone who has spent a lot of time behind bars I hope his asshole gets run dry in a federal pen.

              1) He is a businessman/hotel owner = elite

             <p>
              2) He ran a trafficking operation, selling 'slaves' to customers; probably for twenty years (see one of my comments above), probably this victim was not the only underage victim.

                Who said it didn't? It would. But obviously that's only part of the equation. You have to show they are actually abusing children, not just trying to raise awareness and save lives. Since Day One, here, we've been targeted with confirmation bias posts designed to bait researchers into targeting legit businesses and decent individuals, and smeared with bullshit articles in the mainstream media claiming we were "alt-right extremists" brainwashed by conspiracy theories who have ruined the lives of innocent upstanding citizens like Jimmy "chickenlover" Comet.

                That is why this community chose the submission rules it did and has repeatedly chosen to keep them, and why we are serious about enforcing them.

                Sure...if there is evidence he is helping keep the pedo Satanist cabal in power by abusing kids. If he's just a hero doctor saving children's lives by doing organ transplants that would make this sub look a bunch of crazed witchhunters on the attack, then no. That would not meet the requirements of Rule 1.

                    That would be great evidence to provide, if you want to establish the AMA is an arm of the pedovore cabal.

             Look at that one photo on his Facebook page of him standing beside the girl in the short dress with his arm around her. I’m cringing. I think she may be his daughter as her face looks like the older version of the pic of the two little girls who I’m guessing are his daughters. Sadly, there is no doubt in my mind he hasn’t been abusing his daughters. This guy is beyond SICK.

              Unfortunately, you might be right. :-( No way that a guy who has been torturing, raping, and selling underage girls for 20 year wouldn't rape his own daughters as well. :-( :-(

               Yes and his wife’s words were “does it have something to do with underage girls”. She knew and obviously didn’t care. I’m trying to find his wife’s Facebook page as the heavy article talks about it but her name isn’t listed. Who is the girl in that photo with him it’s distrubing. This guy comes across so squeaky clean but there is an employment gap and I’d like to know what he was doing during that time and how he acquired the cash to purchase the hotel.

                Yes, his wife also gave the police in her house the 11 USB sticks. She knew what the guy did. Also, there might be more people connected to this trafficking network. Employees of the hotel must have known what was going on.
