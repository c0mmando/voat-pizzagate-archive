            I'm sorry. I don't understand. Are people really saying he's a cannibal. Is this real. And I'm totally red pilled but even if it's real I'm just not quite at the point where I could believe it. You're going to need absolutely con rete evidence. Even then I would vomit all day. Someone ELI5.

            Could Spez's supposed cannibalism be a trap to make it look like we accuse everyone we dislike through insane conspiracies? The comments I saw cited were less than 24 hours old. And we're talking about someone who is able to go back and edit other's comments - who knows what else they might be trying to do to make us look crazy?

            I've been following pizzagate since day one.
           </p>
           <p>
            This recent influx of cannibalism posts are completely idiotic, and it's being spammed unnecessarily. Sure, make one post and discuss it there to your heart's content.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you find
            <em>
             any
            </em>
            actual evidence then okay make another post. The fact that this is suddenly being pushed in comments all over the place where it's completely out of context is a wee bit suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the process of investigating a conspiracy is making connections, even if a bit vague, and brainstorming until you can determine which connections are meaningless and which ones are significant. You're trying to get a bird's eye view and see if you can come up with a theory which actually makes sense and which can explain the evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            We aren't dealing with cannibals, we're dealing with pedophiles. There's an enormous historical precedent for VIP pedophile rings, and there's a clear explanation involving blackmail and the multi-billion dollar international child trafficking industry. I've never heard of any VIP cannibal rings. Huffman being a cannibal for no reason and then posting about it on Reddit makes no sense unless you care to explain what would motivate it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the sake of argument however, since we're forced to speculate about what happens at these parties, let's say there are instances of ritualistic murder combined with some minimal cannibalism (they probably want to avoid getting kuru). It's purely ritualistic, it's not a motivating factor in VIP pedophile rings which causes them to form, and at this point there's nothing to actually indicate that these people are eating flesh, especially not the dumbest pizzagate collage I've seen yet (and that's saying something).

             This 100%. The two elements of this investigation that could derail it are the cannabalism and satanism aspects. They grab headlines, sure, but it's BS and it completely delegitimizes everything else by sending into the very fringe of conspiracies. The most solid leads we have are not even closely related to cannabalism or satanism. Jesus. Also, spez never admitted that he is a cannibal, not that I've seen. Yeah he mods the

            Looks like you are a beginners regarding this topic. The topic is not new. Ever heard about MK ultra ? Ever heard about the bohemian groove ? The franklin cover up ? And so much similar affairs all around the world. 
We're talking about the fact that our world is controled by an occult elite who deals with Satanism, child sacrifice, child sexual abuse, cannibalism and all the worse things. Try to explain that to a normal person. Even with the best evidences, they won't believe you because its too brutal for their paradigm. Their representation of the world is so chocked by what you say that it instinctively reject it. Thats why NYT articles dont even need to "prove" anything. They just need to make an article saying that " its fake " and the masses are GLAD to have a "Trustable media" reassuring them on the issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok i'm being a little too pessimistic. I hope too that this story will become mainstream so people start realizing how their paradigm is COMPLETELY wrong about the way the world works.

             Have you ever watched someone forced come out of their normalcy bias like under the threat of external violence or overwhelming information? It's rough and MOST handle it poorly. You're going to see a lot of "normal" people either in actual shock or violence in the streets. People you would think you could count on to be civilize. These same people will be fighting against it tooth and nail until the second they snap too. It has to happen but we should not rationally be looking forward to it.

              Yeah, it's not pretty. Have had to see it happen to many friends and family and aquaintences. I have seen 3/(about 25) people that I've seen wake up around me, end up being checked in and out of psych wards. They didn't start off crazy, they just couldn't handle the truth about who controls this reality.

               I think media are programming us to have accepting views of childrape, like i feel uncomfortable as fuck watching a disney cartoon or just look at the bronies, maybe probably i'm just crazy.

               I'm sorry that happened to them, and hope they're dealing with stuff better now.

               Though for some people, like people who are woke but not experiencing a mental breakdown due to the enormity of what they have learned, I think that being sent to a psych ward is a way to control opposition and make them seem "crazy" so nobody believes them.

                absolutely. I know one of them was definetely too close to truth. Even in the psych ward. He was brilliant, very well educated and extremely wealthy. He was being watched closely.
