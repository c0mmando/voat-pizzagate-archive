<p>This is a humble offering in honor of FUCK YOU, JAMES ALEFANTIS MONTH OF JUNE. It came about while stumbling about on the web. I ran across something calling itself the Mint Museum. Located in Charlotte, NC, my hackles were immediately raised when I found that good ole Tony and Heather Podesta appeared on 2008 Donor List. Let’s see, did they donate the naked teenage photos or the Dahlmer pose? Both would be so appropriate for a museum touting themselves as Leading the Way. What way is that? The one to hell? </p>

<p>The Mint Museum has appeared on the VOAT/PIZZA WATCH radar before. One time had to do with “Farmhouse Chic Brunch” at Halcyon. </p>

<p>Anyway, I started doing some searches and about the first one I came up with was this one. It was a Masked Gala hosted by Present Age Ministries (yes, if you didn’t have a mask, you could purchase one at the event). This was more than a creepy idea. Who holds a masked ball in honor of human traffic victims? A clever title did not tie it all in -- UNMASKED: Revealing the Truth of Human Trafficking. Makes you sort of happy you never knew about it, right? </p>

<p>You’ll notice an image appearing, but if you hit VIEW DETAILS, you see the wildly inappropriate one used to advertise the event. Remember, this is for human trafficking victims, folks. Looks like a pic a tawdry romance novel would use. </p>

<p>Please notice two things: (1) It’s at The Mint Museum; and (2) that tickets are available at presentageministries.org. Three and four things actually. The third is this part: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Attendees are encouraged to come dressed up in formal attire, including a mask. Masks will be avialable for purchase at event.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the typo in “available”, does anyone else think it’s peculiar that these fighters of human trafficking are encouraged to wear and buy masks while wearing gowns? All I can think of is Eyes Wide Shut or the Rothschild’s party pics. You just know someone’s going to be wearing deer antlers. The fourth thing is about the curious word “Unmasking” being used. Isn’t it around this time that the Obama administration s unlawfully wiretapping a political opponent and Ms. Susan “Nobody Messes wth Me” Rice is requesting permission to “unmask” Trump’s key people. Of course, Mr. Hot Dog Man simply loosens the restrictions on “unmasking” U.S. citizen’s identities so nobody goes to jail, but the Present Age Ministries deserves closer examination, but for now, I’m posting for those so inclined to figure out what the hell this was about. </p>
<p>I started looking for other Christian human trafficking organizations that had tie-ins with Mint Museum and/or the Maryland/DC area and found that the name Jeanne L. Allert came up strong. Seems she got a calling to “help” these poor victims and is touted as a saintlike figure. Of course, you know when the elite and media praise someone like this, we need to be suspicious, so first the very tangential way Allert got onto my radar. It seemed she was one of the speakers in various seminars. The link I’m providing is to The Wednesday Morning Group, a Unitarian Church-driven series. </p>
<p>Main website: <a href="http://www.wmgroup.org/">http://www.wmgroup.org/</a>

<p>You can see a brief bio posted, but the link to Allert’s own site, and her shelter The Samaritan Women, is here: </p>
<p><a href="http://thesamaritanwomen.org/about-us/leadership/jeanne-allert/">http://thesamaritanwomen.org/about-us/leadership/jeanne-allert/</a></p>
<p>There’s her squirrelly background and her association to several universities; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeanne has an eclectic career history: from high school English teacher, to instructional designer, to technology director, to Internet consultant. For fourteen years she owned and managed a successful consulting practice serving trade and professional societies in their use of Internet technologies. She is an i
nternational public speaker, technical trainer, industry author, and has served as adjunct faculty for several universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you go to the Annual Report, you may get a kick out of seeing who was on the 2013 Board of Directors:</p>
<p><a href="http://thesamaritanwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2013-Annual-Report-Edited.pdf">http://thesamaritanwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2013-Annual-Report-Edited.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scott Lange, Vice President, Philanthropy of MedStar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MedStar? Where have we heard that in the news? And is there someone else she knows that we might have heard of? Yes, but let’s get to what she “accomplished.” </p>
<p>First, the Maryland Attorney General’s Office formed the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force (MHTTF). Here’s what is said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“MHTTF was formed in 2007 by the Attorney General of Maryland, the State’s Attorney for Baltimore City, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and is chaired by five committees. … MHTTF law enforcement efforts include establishing roving operations to identify victims and traffickers, deputizing local law enforcement to assist in federal human trafficking investigations, and providing training for law enforcement officers. MHTTF also seeks to deter human trafficking through outreach to persons who might be victimized by traffickers.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, all I can say is they’re the world’s worst task force since human trafficking has done nothing, but explode in that area. But guess who’s a member of this little “coalition”? Our little Jeannie. But how did she get appointed on the lucrative money train that doesn’t seem to do any good except snag lucrative speaking engagements? Well, there is on Friends of Brian Frosh’s Committee: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.brianfrosh.com/get-involved/stay-informed">http://www.brianfrosh.com/get-involved/stay-informed</a></p>
<p>I can’t stress to you, fellow pizzagaters, how imperative it is for us to get involved. These key people are turning over and corrupting our way of life by this kind of legislation: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-bail-opinion-impact-20161012-story.html">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-bail-opinion-impact-20161012-story.html</a> </p>
<p>The above is a link to this jack ass Brian E. Frosh attempting to subvert the bail system. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All are possible results of an opinion issued this week by Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, who concluded that keeping people in jail because they can\'t afford bail is probably unconstitutional.The opinion, written in response to a request by five Democratic delegates, calls into question the state\'s long-standing practice of letting courts set high bail as a way of keeping some prisoners in jail. If the state\'s highest court were confronted with such a case, Frosh warns, it would likely upend the state\'s system of pretrial detention.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he goes on that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Preventive detention is OK, but what\'s not OK is for somebody to be in jail because they can\'t afford to get out,&quot; Frosh said in an interview.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So preventive detention is OK? Then why is he eradicating it! Think about it. A mass murderer is broke, but a judge can’t impose a high bail because he can’t afford it? Does that really make sense? And it’s only one of the other … in other words, judges can or can’t do it. It’s not okay to say preventive detention is OK, and then argue it isn’t. And think of the impact on human trafficking. The judges won\'t be able to hold anyone. </p>
<p>But what else has Frosh done? Well, this: </p>
<p><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/06/who-has-kept-trump-from-destroying-american-democracy-so-far.html">https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/06/who-has-kept-trump-from-destroying-american-democracy-so-far.html</a></p>
<p>Yes, the idiot filed suit against Trump re: the travel ban. Note this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson spearheaded the fight against Trump’s first travel ban, more than a dozen other attorneys general quickly joined his efforts. Two in particular stand out. In Maryland, Attorney General Brian Frosh was required by law to receive permission from Larry Hogan, the state’s Republican governor, before filing suit. Hogan withheld his permission—so Frosh informed the legislature, which promptly changed the law, empowering Frosh to sue Trump.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, so THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED THE LAW TO ACCOMMODATE THIS! It’s outrageous … and there’s more: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-md-frosh-sues-trump-20170612-story.html">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-md-frosh-sues-trump-20170612-story.html</a></p>
<p>Yes, this idiot is now suing Trump over “foreign payments”!!!! That’s a weird way to describe what happens when someone has a legitimate global business that people frequent! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alleging that President Donald J. Trump has engaged in &quot;unprecedented constitutional violations,&quot; the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia sued the president Monday over payments his real estate empire has received from foreign governments since he took office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Attorneys General Brian E. Frosh of Maryland and Karl A. Racine of Washington — both Democrats — filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the first time a state government has sued Trump claiming those payments violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>In closing, e need to get busy and get serious. If you follow the trail of human trafficking and the people involved are the same ones trying to derail America and what we’re trying to do. I have another example coming up. Yes, it’s one of JA’s buddies. I’m doing it because I know JA hates it, and because I got enormous pushback from a thread I posted. I figure every time I get pushback, I’m going to post something else. Don’t care how many votes I get or don’t get, this is important to me.</p>',

           The above is a link to this jack ass Brian E. Frosh attempting to subvert the bail system.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “All are possible results of an opinion issued this week by Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, who concluded that keeping people in jail because they can't afford bail is probably unconstitutional.The opinion, written in response to a request by five Democratic delegates, calls into question the state's long-standing practice of letting courts set high bail as a way of keeping some prisoners in jail. If the state's highest court were confronted with such a case, Frosh warns, it would likely upend the state's system of pretrial detention.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Then he goes on that:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “Preventive detention is OK, but what's not OK is for somebody to be in jail because they can't afford to get out," Frosh said in an interview.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So preventive detention is OK? Then why is he eradicating it! Think about it. A mass murderer is broke, but a judge can’t impose a high bail because he can’t afford it? Does that really make sense? And it’s only one of the other … in other words, judges can or can’t do it. It’s not okay to say preventive detention is OK, and then argue it isn’t. And think of the impact on human trafficking. The judges won't be able to hold anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
           But what else has Frosh done? Well, this:
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/06/who-has-kept-trump-from-destroying-american-democracy-so-far.html">
            https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/06/who-has-kept-trump-from-destroying-american-democracy-so-far.html
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, the idiot filed suit against Trump re: the travel ban. Note this:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            “While Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson spearheaded the fight against Trump’s first travel ban, more than a dozen other attorneys general quickly joined his efforts. Two in particular stand out. In Maryland, Attorney General Brian Frosh was required by law to receive permission from Larry Hogan, the state’s Republican governor, before filing suit. Hogan withheld his permission—so Frosh informed the legislature, which promptly changed the law, empowering Frosh to sue Trump.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Yes, so THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED THE LAW TO ACCOMMODATE THIS! It’s outrageous … and there’s more:
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-md-frosh-sues-trump-20170612-story.html">
            http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/bs-md-frosh-sues-trump-20170612-story.html
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, this idiot is now suing Trump over “foreign payments”!!!! That’s a weird way to describe what happens when someone has a legitimate global business that people frequent!
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Alleging that President Donald J. Trump has engaged in "unprecedented constitutional violations," the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia sued the president Monday over payments his real estate empire has received from foreign governments since he took office.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Attorneys General Brian E. Frosh of Maryland and Karl A. Racine of Washington — both Democrats — filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the first time a state government has sued Trump claiming those payments violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.
          </p>
          <p>
           In closing, e need to get busy and get serious. If you follow the trail of human trafficking and the people involved are the same ones trying to derail America and what we’re trying to do. I have another example coming up. Yes, it’s one of JA’s buddies. I’m doing it because I know JA hates it, and because I got enormous pushback from a thread I posted. I figure every time I get pushback, I’m going to post something else. Don’t care how many votes I get or don’t get, this is important to me.

             It may not be a surprise to you, but I'll bet it is to a lot of people. I know when I used to see the word Christian used, I would take it to heart. Now? Not so much.
