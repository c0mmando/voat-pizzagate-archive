            This should be interesting. Fingers crossed that it's handled appropriately and that no key witnesses go missing or get 'cold feet'.

            FYI - you only give immunity to the much lower level crime when compared to the more serious crime they are seeking to file. Also, you only give immunity if the person has info that will lead to the prosecution of the target person. Immunity is extremely tough to get, especially from the LADA. Why offer immunity if the information doesn't help you? (sidenote: This is why it was so weird comey offered immunity to DNC higher ups and then chose not to prosecute... Also weird that he got to "choose" whether to prosecute and not the AG). 
I think they gave the prostitutes immunity to get the John that killed one of them.
LADA probably does not follow pizzagate or understand the magnitude, however, it could unravel quickly in front of them.

             No way that they're not aware of #pizzagate. Not with PedoWood calling the shots. Then there's the strange legislation that's passed in Californication lately. Totally aware, but they're in a tricky situation. The Cannibal Elite can't say how they really feel which is that they could care less about anyone, but themselves and the members of their sick cult or that their hierarchy demands that there are lots of vulnerable victims around for them to take advantage of. They feed off vulnerability. So they bend and re-open the investigation because this is gaining traction and they can't be seen on the wrong side of an issue regarding race even thought they're always on the wrong side of the issues regarding race.

             I'm very curious to see if this leads to shedding light on the allegation that Ed Buck told the police what to do. There had to be someone he was calling and there was a good guess by factfinder2 (think that's his/her name). How was Buck controlling the police if, in fact, he was.

            <em>
             should

            be covered more in depth by the MSM, but it won't be.

           <p>
            Also a useful tool in redpilling minorities/blacks. This DEMOCRAT fetishized black men and the thug/druggie lifestyle that is prevalent in black communities. Not only is it an abrupt intro into pizzagate but all true conspiracies as well.

             Thanks for the good words.

            <p>
             Yeah, this really
             <s>
              surprised
             </s>
             shocked me. Did not see this coming. With all the videos that might come into play, plus social media accounts, this could tie into other people. Don't know if Buck is expendable. Would they sacrifice him to do jail time? It doesn't seem so ... not with the money he's thrown their way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Have no idea how this will play out. The only pessimistic view is that they're doing this to lure whoever will talk to open up. Then they get the names, the videos, and anything else is out there. They keep them under wraps of being "evidence". I don't think that would play out given the enormous pressure Gemmel's mother is applying. She's very articulate and she's tapped into the sex worker's community. They see and hear a lot of things, and are connected to people out of their economic strata.
            </p>
            <p>
             We'll see. I really hope Gemmel receive justice. He knew he was being used.

            In previous information on this, there was a city council member that stated openly that other victims
            <em>
             wouldn't
            </em>
            receive immunity in this case. It was suggested that was a statement of witness intimidation. Is there any hint that council member could be charged? Donuts to dollars there is some dirt on that guy.

             Who knows? It could depend on how this plays out. If he's complicit in this abuse, then, yeah, his ass is out there hanging in the breeze. If he was trying to protect someone, and using his position to do so, again, maybe. But if he was shooting off his mouth, or if nothing can be proven, then you have one more pass being given.

                I'll pray for the best but I am not optimistic. There have been high profile deaths in Hollywood with direct pizzagate connections as well as massive corruption. They were never properly investigated. Instead a patsy was found to take the fall.

                 This is exactly right. The only thing different about this is the unique positioning of the victim and the scrutiny they're under. Those male prostitutes have spoken to Gemmel's mother. If what they have to say, or show (remember video &amp; social media exchanges &amp; phone messaging) is contrary to the narrative told, there's gonna be hell to pay. She will not let go of this, nor should she. I read those diary excerpts. It gives a very small sampling of what her son was put through. And Gemmel was her son.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you juxtapostion the way she's acting with the way Seth Rich's parents acted, such a huge difference. This mother wants to get to the truth and I hope she does.
