<p>What continues to boggle my mind in all of this isn\'t just the people who do this shit, but all the people who cover for them while they\'re doing this shit.  I would like to think that most people who have knowledge of something like this going on would report it to the appropriate authorities.  (Of course, now we\'re all finding out that &quot;the appropriate authorities&quot; seem to actively cover this stuff up some significant portion of the time.)  I would like to think that if a coworker of mine asked me to hide some of his nefarious shit, I would not only NOT hide the stuff, I\'d be scanning copies of it then forwarding it to any and every authority that I thought would do something about it.  This isn\'t freaking rocket science here!  Have the moral compasses of the vast majority of humans suddenly gone completely haywire?  Or have they long been haywire and I just didn\'t see it?  I\'m afraid I am becoming completely disillusioned.</p>',

            Keepr1, I am sorry to tell you this. There are no safe places! There are no trust worthy officials! There are no benign politicians and 6 out of 7 cops are real bad at their job! So stop being disillusioned, Pick yourself up and get back in the fight. This is one of those fights where it is OK to die fighting and what is more, none of us can  afford to lose this fight. If we lose, we lose our children!

            Knowing accomplices should be gone after as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people covering for them is the only reason this exists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about the alternative. Let's say they are not the reason this exists. That means everyone involved at every level acctually is a pedophile, highly unlikely.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ones who support it by association are the reason they get protected, why things get sealed and hidden away from us every knowing, they cover up crimes.

            They enable child rape.

            They have always been around.  It's just that now their agenda is so far advanced that they are decloaking themselves and it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also important to note that people tend to work in the fields that they are good at.  Js happen to excel in math and science, so you will find many working as physicians, bankers, astrophysicists, etc.  Js ALWAYS cover for fellow tribe members, even those living in other countries.
