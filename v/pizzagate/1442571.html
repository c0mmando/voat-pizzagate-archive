<p>So I guess that leads me to ask you guys, if they\'re all pedophiles who happen to have cannibalistic behaviors like some people like to claim, who are the victims of ritual abuse in this situation?

            Okay. I feel like this is coming together now, though. Still creeps me out seeing Comet's Instagram pictures. It's going to end up being another Peter Scully situation, isn't it?

            Where does the corrupt DOJ get the numbers from because the corrupt FBI doesn't track child abductions.  I wonder why.

             Child abductions are different from child sexual abuse. Over half of abductions conducted by non-family members involve sexual assault, and this DOES come from
             <a href="http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/MC19.pdf">
              DOJ statistics
             </a>
             . BUT, I wouldn't doubt that oversea child abductions are poorly tracked or not tracked at all, just like how I mentioned Peter Scully, because most likely these are young girls given out for prostitution and I wouldn't doubt that they would be distributed overseas.
