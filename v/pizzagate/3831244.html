           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Saturday, May 16, 2020
            </p>
            <p>
             Files opened
            </p>
            <p>
             C ORONAVIRUS continues to shake the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Especially in the USA , the situation is not very bright. The economic recession has already started in Europe. In China, VIRUS is back! In this very climate, Trump has added a new one to his strange exits. Trump, who accused the World Health Organization of being the pawn of CHINA and declared that he cut financial support, raised the bar even more: "I will have a very important statement about the World Health Organization soon, in 24 hours or next week ... World Trade Organization" I am not satisfied with the actions of the country. They treat China as a developing country. In this way, China enjoys many rights that the USA cannot benefit. We could cut our whole relationship with China.
            </p>
            <p>
             This option still exists. "Trump, DEEP AMERICA , was putting the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization next to CHINA, placing the OLIGARCHY in the UK at the back ! And thus, the definition of the war! b already was!
            </p>
            <p>
             more ...
            </p>
            <p>
             United States, the President focused Trump together a new debate in recent days. Gear was raised.
            </p>
            <p>
             President Trump, "James Comey who headed the FBI, remained loyal to Obama. He hid information from me and presented it to Obama. This was OBAMAGATE . "Trump actually brought Pizzagate to the center, saying Obamagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, Trump did not make this plan ... Trump plans to gain strength before the campaign by revealing the Pizzagate scandal that will include his opponent Joe Biden in the election.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate was a major London reflection, including former US presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and his wife Hillary Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             John and Tony Podesta, who always stood alongside these names, were also close to London. Of course, as I have written for months, JEFFREY EPSTEIN , SORNED DEATH is at the center of the job ! From this point of view, it is understood that DEEP AMERICA found a very strong mine . They will use it to the fullest . 300 businesspeople in 41 countries are now at risk. Those at the top of the world know this! In that league there is no such thing as "coincidence" . The 300 endangered businessmen were also chosen to discover, grow and make the Rothschild family difficult .
            </p>
            <p>
             There was an important Turkish businessman that John Podesta met during his training at the Faculty of Law at Georgetown University.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, the Turkish businessman, who made an important donation to the university, established a close relationship with his 2 partners, John Podesta. He was a close friend of 3 Turkish businessmen, famous entrepreneur James Alefantis. Who is James Alefantis? The owner of the pizzeria Comet Ping Pong, where that famous Pizzagate scandal happened ... John Podesta naturally trusted 100 percent of the 3 Turkish businessmen who were close friends of James Alefantis. Because James Alefantis is one of the few who know all the dirty secrets of Podesta.
            </p>
            <p>
             Apart from that, he also loves James Alefantis personally.
            </p>
            <p>
             The importance of Turkish businessmen emerged in Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turkish businessmen were assigned before the American delegations visited Asia. In fact, the Rothschild family was increasing in Asia by using the power of the United States. This was the complete puzzle. Now Deep America will not target only 3 Turkish businessmen. 300 businessmen are also on the list.
            </p>
            <p>
             21 names in the primary target list!
            </p>
            <p>
             The remaining 279 businessmen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claims are in this direction ...
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to be a power in a country, you should take the businessmen under your management ... This sentence is the summary of a speech by Jacob Rothschild in London in 2010. Not only the Rothschild family did this. States have gone along the same lines. George Soros also established events in all countries using the American state power and the power of the Rothschild family. Open Society Foundation was the visible side of this power.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was also the invisible side of the iceberg.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the reasons for George Soros getting closer to Deep America is Pizzagate ... Many partnerships have emerged between "American Bridge Pac" and "Comet Ping Pong", where Georges Soros sent his biggest donations. This situation worried Soros. In fact, Obama and Soros were on the same side. So also with the Rothschild family ... Now he faces it. But Soros is also worried. Because after Deep America completes the big operation, will it penalize Soras? Most likely yes. Because Deep America has been damaged in many countries in the past years. The person accused of this situation was George Soros. Of course, we must also understand what Soros offers to deep America and promises for the coming period.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if the operation grows, there will be no SOROS in the final !
            </p>
            <p>
             The effects of coronavirus will now decrease in the United States. Some steps need to be taken before this starts.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why Trump always says "Obamagate." Barack Obama may face an end he never expected. Because there is a very important unity of forces against Obama. Obama became the center of more hatred than Bill Clinton. Obama also voices the government's mistakes in the fight against Coronavirus. This seems to have little effect. Because the media where the Rothschild family is active does not care much about Obama's statements.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ignores it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did the Rothschild family also kick Obama out of the game? If the attack were directly to Bill Clinton, would the reaction of media outlets close to the Rothschild family be different! I guess yes ... they wouldn't be silent like this ... Those living in Washington and New York are fighting the hardest of their lives. This is true for both sides.
            </p>
            <p>
             Businessmen feel insecure despite having money. We are at a time when even money cannot provide security.
            </p>
            <p>
             This started with Coronavirus. However, it will not end with the end of Coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oddly enough, PIZZAGATE or OBAMAGATE is targeting the center of power that defends Wall Street. More DEMOCRATS and UK over them ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Producing America squeezes Wall Street, which has a voice in the world over money. It does this with the power of intelligence ... The Pizzagate incident is a road that goes back to Buckingham. Maybe there are those who forget! "Why is the scandal called PIZZAGATE ?" Let the answer to the question ...chain ranging from Soros Obama, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew Pedophilia is accused of pedophilia ... in the event PASSWORD as PIZZA ID 's were used. When the cheese passed in the sentence, the girl meant the boy when the pasta passed. Famous names were giving PIZZA ORDER IN THE LOAD AMOUNT when they were going to organize a party ...
            </p>
            <p>
             James Alefantis, the owner, was the center of the business. And famous names fell into that pit. Now, as the big showdown approached, all were brought to the table via CORONA ... I still have no word if you think that everything is spontaneous in the world. But it is also true that there is a big mind ... WAR!  Within everyone ... Directly or indirectly ... Look at what will happen. The rest is fairy tale.
