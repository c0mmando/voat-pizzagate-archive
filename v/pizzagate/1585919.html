           This is the angle that I believe is the most reasonable, the role of Allefantis was to of course supervise and facilitate many meetings via Comet. The angle that the presence of whatever highly illegal acts were simply used as blackmail/control material seems to be the most plausible especially when you consider the former romantic link between Allefantis and the CEO of Media Matters. Media Matters is a dark enough name to those in the community, however they also have many public initiatives one of which is simply stated as " incubate a new generation of liberal pundits", the Progressive Talent Initiative trains potential pundits in media skills" I think we can speculate as to the level of incubation required to ensure that nobody reveals any of the secrets.
