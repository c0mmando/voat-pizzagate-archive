<p>Highlights from the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Christian mission field is a “magnet” for sexual abusers (a new source for possible leads?)</li>
<li>Protestants can be very arrogant when pointing to Catholics (I totally don\'t believe this at all.........)</li>
<li>Mission agencies, “where abuse is most prevalent,” often don’t report abuse because they fear being barred from working in foreign countries</li>
<li>Evangelicals often frown upon transparency and accountability as many Protestants rely on Scripture more than religious leaders, compared to Catholics.</li>
<li>Too many Protestant institutions have sacrificed souls in order to protect their institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Another article that pretty much regurgitates the same information:</p>

<p>However, it is some of the comments that were most interesting:</p>

There was a Baptist youth pastor who came from a church in the southern states who abused 5 or 6 boys in 2007 in the city that live and the local newspaper not once printed anything about it. At the same time this newspaper was running stories of alleged abuse by priests decades ago. So this doesn\'t surprise me that abuse does happen in protestant churches, it isn\'t being reported like the catholic abuse has been.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not shocked by this whatsoever.</p>
<p>And this comment:</p>
<blockquote>

The Catholic Church is a big target with deep pockets. There is no doubt that many of the accusations are legitimate and those that are guilty should be kicked out of the priesthood and tried as the criminals that they are, but there are false charges also. Some may be from those who hate the Church and some for want of money, and some because of both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insurance companies, child advocacy groups and religion scholars say there is no evidence that Catholic clergy are more likely to be involved in sexual misconduct than other clergy or professionals. Yet ongoing civil litigation of decades-old cases against a church with deep pockets keeps the Catholic Church in the headlines.</p>
<p>“There is no plausible evidence that Catholic priests are gangs of sexual predators, as they are being portrayed,” said Pennsylvania State University Prof. Philip Jenkins, eminent religion and history scholar, and a non-Catholic who’s studied the church’s abuse problems for 20 years.</p>
<p>Jenkins said there has been no formal study comparing denominations for rates of child abuse. However, insurers have been assessing the risks since they began offering riders on liability policies in the 1980s. Two of the largest insurers report no higher risks in covering Catholic churches than Protestant denominations.&gt;</p>

           <p>
            To find out that many if not all of them are possible SATANISTS/ILLUMINATI and child abusers is even worse!

            Like a mentioned a long time ago, maybe it is better to have a "personal relationship" with God/Jesus rather than emphasizing any particular denomination or doctrine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most if not all of the religious leaders are part of Freemason/Illuminati secret societies.

                there are tares among the wheat, so nothing new there,

            On June 25, 2002, Dolan was named the tenth Archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[citation needed] He was formally installed at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on August 28, 2002. Dolan said he was challenged and haunted by the sexual abuse scandal in that diocese, which broke during his tenure[13] According to WTAQ news, "An attorney says at least 8,000 kids were sexually abused by over 100 priests and other offenders in the Milwaukee Catholic Diocese."***I don't know, this is pretty brutal.  Boil in Hell Dolan.
