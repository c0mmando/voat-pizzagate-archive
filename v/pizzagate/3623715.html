            First I have to say, we probably cant do much... even if I say what I think, only these elite groups can stop each other. freemasons are a break away government. Their aim is the movie 'idiocracy', a nation of pleasure seeking idiots, and &lt;5% total population elite group. Jewish have that idea too but its god driven. Muslims want 100% of everyone as the elite class. China's got their own version but I think they are less devious. They want a gradient of 20% elite, 50% middle class, 30% underclass. The last two have to cherish society and the top 20% shape it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the pizza gate part and freemasons. If they believe that the population are wild animals, they would lean towards pizzagate. To them it doesn't matter because we aren't in the 'club', and they own us. So yes, freemasons in particular see us as wild animals. animals in human form. I think freemasons probably were pagans aka cannibal cult. They likely clash with the jewish elite group.

            You are welcome to post about the connection between Freemasonry and child trafficking. We have much posted about that in our archives. However, you need to adhere to the submission rules the folks here have repeatedly voted to keep. Rule #4 requires issues with moderation of the sub be discussed in the subverse created for that purpose,

             EDIT: I had completley forgotten how kind and helpful vindicator was to me one time when stressing how vast the instagram cult is. Encouraged me to format things for emphasis. And i forgot that of course. I came back here and decided to shit all over the mod because i was trying too hard to fit in and too lazy to make sure its up to standard. I know there is no mod talk but I had to say that its not fair You been vindicated

              Thanks for editing, jookie. And thanks for this comment. :-)  We are doing the best we can with a terrible subject. It gets to people sometimes and they show it. No sweat on this end. I try to always assume the best intent.
