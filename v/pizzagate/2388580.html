<p>&quot;As part of his attempt to justify his actions, Harris has claimed the young girls, and their eight-year-old sister whom he also took in but did not formally adopt, were threatening to kill his family.</p>
<p>Harris, who has three biological sons, said the eldest girl, who was eight, said she would \'kill everyone in the family\'.</p>
<p>He took the death threat so seriously, he said, that he, his wife and their three sons barricaded themselves in a separate room at night for safety.</p>
<p>Harris also claimed that another of the girls \'crushed a family pet to death\', further convincing them to get rid of their recently-adopted charges. </p>
<p>He did not specify what kind of pet it was, nor whether the three-year-old or the six-year-old was responsible.</p>
<p>He decided to give them to a &quot;friend&quot; who proceeded to rape the five year old who we\'ll call Mary. His name is Eric Francis. Eric was a preschool teacher at Growing God\'s Kingdom Christian playschool. What did the Senator say in response to the public outrage?</p>
<p>&quot;He then added: \'You don\'t know what we\'ve been through this past year. You have no idea what my family has been through. I don\'t care what the people of Arkansas think about me.</p>
<p>\'I don\'t care if I lose my position. I care what my wife thinks about me, and I care what my three sons think about me.\'</p>
<p>He also kept receiving money.</p>
<p>&quot;It was also reported in the story that the Harris family \'continued to accept adoption subsidy money even after giving the children away.\'</p>
<p>Also, the child rapist then gave away the little girls, so this is the third time they went to a new &quot;family&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Francis lost his job at the school while in custody of the girls due to performance issues, but Rep. Harris and his wife did not take the girls back at that point.</p>
<p>At some point before he was arrested and after his firing, Francis and his wife gave the two girls away to another family, where they are now living.</p>
<p>These little girls keep being moved. I think this whole case is Child Trafficking. I believe the Senator sold the girls to a pedophile ring. The Christian School covered everything up. They also were falsifying the girls being at the school on many days. So they would be signed into the school but not be there. They were taking the little girls somewhere.</p>

<p>&quot;According to five former workers at Growing God\'s Kingdom, the West Fork preschool operated by Rep. Justin Harris and his wife, Marsha Harris, the couple\'s two young adopted daughters were often signed in at the school on days when they were not actually in attendance.</p>
<p>The workers contacted the Times independently of one another after reading our initial March 5 story that revealed the two girls — we\'ve started identifying them by the pseudonyms &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot; — were sent by the Harrises to live with another family only about seven months after their adoption was finalized. They were ages 5 and 3 at the time they were &quot;rehomed&quot; in late 2013. Mary, the 5-year-old, was then sexually abused by the father at the new home, Eric C. Francis, before the sisters were moved to a third family in early 2014.</p>
<p>Mary and Annie lived in the Harris home from approximately October 2012 to October 2013. The five former employees — none of whom were willing to use their names on the record at this time — worked in various positions between 2010 and 2014. Some said they quit under amiable circumstances, while others were terminated.</p>
<p>&quot;The girls were there maybe once a week at the most, then they weren\'t there at all, and they were still signing them in like they were there,&quot; said one woman.</p>
<p>A second worker, who worked for another company that contracted with the preschool, said &quot;those little girls hadn\'t been in the school for months when I left, but they were saying they were.&quot; Though not a teacher, she had direct contact with the children at the school. &quot;They told me to sign them in when they weren\'t there, and I refused. I said ‘I’m not doing that.’ &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people know what’s going on but they’re afraid to speak out,&quot; said a third former employee, who worked at Growing God\'s Kingdom for three years. She said that whenever Mary and Annie would come to the preschool, it was &quot;for maybe 1-2 hours at most&quot; and even then &quot;they were kept so separate from other kids.&quot; The Harrises, she recalled, &quot;said to put [Mary] in the roster every day, even if she wasn\'t there.&quot;</p>
<p>An attorney for the Harrises did not respond to a question about whether Justin or Marsha Harris ever directed employees to sign in the girls as &quot;present&quot; on days when they were not at the preschool.</p>
<p>A fourth employee said she has recently contacted the state Department of Human Services to report that the girls were falsely signed in at Growing God\'s Kingdom. &quot;I\'m not sure if they’re looking into it,&quot; she said. She noted that the cameras in the preschool are supposed to generate a permanent record, so the state could possibly compare attendance rosters with that video record, if it still exists.</p>
<p>The fifth employee, who interacted with the girls directly, said, “I talked to the teacher about it. They said they were told to do that: ‘Marsha told me the girls had been bad and coming to school was a luxury and they were not allowed to [come to school].’ ” She also said she believed Growing God’s Kingdom received money for the falsified sign-ins&quot;</p>
<p>Why would the teachers and staff at this school illegally report the children were there?</p>
<p>I think &quot;Growing God\'s Kingdom Christian School&quot; is linked to a pedophile ring.</p>',

           This happened in 2012. I think this whole case involves child trafficking. The Senator adopted two little girls, whose names they won't publish. They were six and three. However he said they were disobedient and "threatened" his family (little girls). So he gave both little girls to a "friend" who was a preschool teacher at Growing God's Kingdom Christian School. The "friend" Eric Francis proceeded to rape the six year old. The school covered up and falsified the girls attendance at the school many times, signing them in when they would not even be there.

            The extreme behaviors reported about the girls- hurting family pets, threatening murder- are definitely possible in kids those age, and would be dead-on symptoms of Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is most often a result of extreme abuse and/or neglect.

            So here's my question.... Why does the usg office of personnel management (OPM) push adoption services in their guide services booklet? I downloaded that piece of rabbit hole diving party and was astounded at the tone of the information. So maybe normalizing gov't employees as orphan saviors and child advocates makes this Crap even Bigger with participation levels that I am having a difficult time wrapping my head around.....

            I just felt compelled to make account to state my thought.

           <p>
            Keep up the excellent info gathering folks! You are doing God/good things.

             Are you saying that the government literature is sort of pushing government employees to adopt children? If so that is a red flag.

            I agree.  I also think "Growing God's Kingdom Christian School" is linked to a pedophile ring.  It's as plain as the nose on your face.  This is so easy to figure out if you have researched anything on here.  It all falls into place.  The very sad thing is those sisters keep getting horribly abused and raped wherever they are sent.  What in the world are they thinking?  How can they ever be well adjusted adults after so much vile and perverted acts over and over by every family.  This is really sad.  And they also are separated from their other sister.  A very bad idea.  I wonder what has happened to these poor little girls.

             All these cases being led to sexual abuse, along with the torture by locking a child in a hot car for hours. It's obvious in plain site. Those poor little girls are going to have many mental issues they are going to have to overcome when their older. No matter where they seem to go someone is sexually abusing and raping them.

              I am in contact with someone that has suffered horrid abuse and crimes.  It never stops.  If they can get the proper help, they can learn to come through, but help is outrageously expensive and medical insurance does not pay or only covers a certain amount.  Also these type of psychiatrists that help with cognitive memories are hard to find.  The father of the two girls that were abused by Nassar, that lunged at him is donating the money people sent him.  He is donating, but I hope the org. is a good one.  Every time one of these abusers is arrested, profits and personal assets must be seized and donated to a reputable org.  to help the victims.
