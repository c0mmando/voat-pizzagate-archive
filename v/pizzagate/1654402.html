            Most states won't even let people into the courtrooms.  Closed courts so the public doesn't know how unlawful the unconstitutional courts are.

            CPS = Child PROFIT System they make a fortune stealing kids and selling them into the pedo network. It's very big business. Sadly none of the kids are ever seen again they all vanish their paperwork is kept secret from the parents. No parent ever gets their kid back the courts are rigged against the parents. I believe the kids are eventually killed. They never grow up you never hear about any kids reaching adulthood even under new names. They are terminated after they are used for the sex parties. Their blood is drained and sold so are their vital organs. Very Big Business $$$$$$

            Over the past few years, Whiteout Press has published the heart wrenching stories of dozens of parents who have had their children wrongly removed from their care by an out-of-control government agency. The practice has become so rampant, we’ve been forced to publish multiple stories at once rather than dedicate one article to each horror story.
Make no mistake, child removals have little to do with protecting kids anymore. Instead, billions of dollars in government contracts and an ever-growing army of highly paid caseworkers seem to be the main objective of this heart-breaking epidemic of government sanctioned kidnapping. Here are the latest letters to Whiteout Press from desperate parents and grandparents.

            This website has several testimonies about the problem and calls it Medical Kidnap
           </p>
           <p>
            My son David Ealy was abducted by57 armed and dangerous U.S. Marshals secret service Dayton Ohio police and MONTGOMERY COUNTY CHILDREN'S SERVICES DEPARTMENT David Ealy has been held hostage since2013 The U.S. Marshals and several state of Ohio agents including governor John kasich attorney general mike dewine and state representative fred strahorn and department of job and family director Cynthia Dungey juvenile judge NICK KUNTZ MAGISTRATE KIMBERLEY HARSHBARGER have been sued for conspiracy and allowing the abduction of my son David was 3 months when he was kidnapped April 2 2013 and have not been seen since The agents on March12 2015attempted to blow up my automobile while in Atlanta Georgia the conspiracy is real the United States of America is still under International Rule and SLAVERY against the American Blacks and minorities please respond back with any ideas about getting my son back thank you very much    - Larry Ealy   March, 31, 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            "They have an agenda to medicate as many children as they can, to label them with mental health disorders, and to stop anyone who stands in their way – at any cost."
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the commentors, "I grew up in foster care, it was a terrible experience. So many cases where I was over medicated, rushed to hospitals with false illnesses that it is on my records with that hospital. Only one day after I gave birth to my daughter Cps comes rushing in with police officer present. They said they had nothing to hold against me as a new parent but had "concernce" because I was abused asa child and could potentially be abusive.......... Well for one I have nothing on my record, I am in college, and I am drug free.......I take care of my baby. I do not have time for their home visits and classes......please PLEASE someone help me with any advice or suggestion to stop their harassment. I do not want my baby subjected to having her family ripped from her and be placed in the abusive system that fails to protect children."
           </p>
           <p>
            Another says, "... I thought cps was supose to help children, was supose to put familys back together and if thats not possible then to put the children with family! Do you know how much it costs a family member to take custody of thier own flesh and bloode? Someone needs to help us, no one will believe us and if we had money to fight them then we wouldnt be here cuz they only pick on the ones that dont have none! I miss my grandsons so much, and I seen the pain they put my daughter through when they took them after she tried so hard for 11 mo to get them back. And never messed up once!!!!!! It breaks my heart when I wonder what her oldest son was told and what he must be going through right now and her youngest will never know her! You cant imagine the pain and I hope youll never have to feel it! All for a little money, well alot of money that they get for stealing and selling our babies. I dont know how they live with thier selves! Please help! They are a disease and need to be dissolved."
           </p>
           <p>
            And
           </p>
           <p>
            "I had a taste of this when doing monitoring for court-ordered visitations. The families were simply brutalised by the CPS/DCFS and family court systems. There was no real help offered, just fines and more fines, court costs and more court costs, useless, inadequate uninterested attorneys, neverending mandatory classes that were impossible to get to, inhumane restrictions on visitation hours, whole families afraid to challenge bias, ignorance, and whim for fear of angering social workers......the list goes on and on. How about a 14 minute (I timed it) lecture and threats from a social worker (with a masterks degree as she repeatedly pronounced) who insisted that a can of Comet on a kitchen counter was so unsafe as to warrant removal of children from home? The American people need to wake up - yesterday - and start recovering their rights as citizens. It's not enough to complain we're becoming a police state.....we already are."

            We can be glad that our minds are open enough to be able to take it all in.  Many cannot and I am not exactly faulting them because not all of us are alike.  I am in a group of people that are very involved locally where we live and those are the ones that upset me the most, but I have to realize that they cannot get through their heads that thinking they have kept up with everything, they must now realize that it is all a big lie.  Yes, you are right that is the hardest part.  We are the ones that will have to do all the pushing.

            I hope your prayers are answered.  This would be the best scenario.  But I too am hoping that there will be some break soon.  I think something will happen with the Trump Adm. but right now we can see that a few of his picks have been bought out or threatened already.  Eventually all will fall in place and then maybe only then can all of this move forward.

            I know, but I am not giving up.  My sister in law refuses to believe the Clintons could ever do anything like THAT.  The whole world needs a BIG red pill.  But I do have two friends that are listening, need to talk more but have decided to red pill a little at a time, for that is how I have been able to deal with this.  I did not learn all this in one day and that is what kept my brain from exploding.  Another friend believes, but cannot bear to hear about it.  So, little by little I think it will take hold.  That is our hardest endeavor.  Red pilling the world.  At this point we must start reporting these things to our local FBI and local authorities.  Smaller communities I believe will have more luck.  Larger cities may be too entrenched in this whole mess.  This should be a discussion.  Of course we must keep doing our research, but what is the best way forward, for LE is dragging their feet.  Or do we give it more time to sink in?

            I think the Alex Jones interview is distracting from this story. If Pence's buddy is a pedo, this is not really totally out of the blue for PGers. It is however very sensational and PERSONAL. It draws people in more and even to disbelievers is more digestible than the CPS revelations (which to be fair were posted all the way back on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            The DHS insider thing is the REAL story. If you check my thread about Polk county bust and possible brushfire evidence destruction ploy, someone has posted a linking an at-risk child psychology/wellness program to the general area going back decades. Kind of disgusting. Kind of exactly what DHS insider is talking about.

             CPS is mentioned by the DHS insider...the last part of the Q&amp;A.
            </p>
            <p>
             He says:
            </p>
            <p>
             "If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate."

Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate."

              How... on earth... could
              <strong>
               anyone on this forum not be familiar with CPS and its central US-based role in Pizzagate
              </strong>
              ? I am very, very surprised, however, that CPS issues are not getting the top votes, as CPS-related problems, including their placed "missing" children... are the very heart-center of Pizzagate for American Children.

              Nancy Schaefer tried expose Clinton's Adoption and Safe Families Act for its true intent.   That's where states get a bonus of $4000 to $6000 for each child they take away from parents.  The elites need a steady flow of children.  It is much harder to get natural parents to let their kids be used.

             This is disgusting at best.  What do we do about this? Just writing about it on here will not solve the problem.  If we go out on the street spreading this news they will think we are nuts.  They already do.  I have tried to red pill people slowly, but even that gets me weird looks.

               Some are getting ready to blow this all wide open so there is that.  I am scared for them.  But the time must come for LE to step forward or be exposed themselves.

              If you have personally been victimized by CPS (or family courts in general) you can gather your evidence of public corruption and/or civil rights violations and go to your FBI office and show them your proof.

                Seriously? Please go into details. If you cannot, please leave links that you found in your research of successful lawsuits against CPS. We ALL love to hear such heart-warming, fireside-worthy stories. It's a bit like the satisfying feeling of roasting marshmallows. Lol. But seriously, please, please tell us more!

                  I am sorry about your experience! Please only answer if it is comfortable, as of course I am interested in knowing more. So... you sued as an adult? You found your family after the 5 y/o abduction and sued as an adult, or did your family sue when you were still young and lawfully brought back?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And to think... all these cases of people are posting pics of themselves with signs showing their birthdates and who they are seeking. Once they find their families, one can imagine that a few more lawsuits, as a consequence to the pedoCPS, might slow down their terrorism just a tad.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Parents can teach their children, as young as possible,
                  <strong>
                   all
                  </strong>
                  identifying facts: name, family's names, address, all family's birth dates, etc., etc., etc. And not so much verbally for "social fun," but much more importantly to recognize all letters(/numbers) for
                  <strong>
                   proper, full spellings with clear spelling variants too.
                  </strong>
                  And I advocate that they learn much more, but it probably serves few to share a full course here. Not only that, but it makes lawsuits more expensive when such info is already known by the pedos from their unwelcomed lurking on open forums.

                   Hi, i don't want to  go any deeper into my own experiences, but here is an  excellent article just written that talks about psychic spies used by the CIA:
                   <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=66235">
                    http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=66235
                   </a>
                   the article does not say this but, the esp abilities are passed down from the mother through the mitochondrial dna... runs in families...Celtic bloodlines.

               I have not, but what I am saying is how do we make Regular Joe aware of what is going on?  People just do not believe you when you tell tell them.  How will we stop this stuff?  Just report it to the FBI? I am hoping and I believe they are reading everything on here and hopefully it will all come out.  I also believe in fairies.

                Lawsuits, of course.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here's a nice starter guide:
                <a href="http://fightcps.com/2010/12/03/how-to-sue-cps-in-federal-court">
                 http://fightcps.com/2010/12/03/how-to-sue-cps-in-federal-court
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                And another for a few starter court cases to look at:
                <a href="http://kidjacked.com/legal/handbook.asp">
                 http://kidjacked.com/legal/handbook.asp
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                People can think through, far head of time (for if that 'time' ever happens), exactly how they will quickly gather tons of money for a top-notch, private attorney to sue for top-notch dollars in damages. Paying a full retainer will get you representation much faster than relying on an attorney to work for future pay out of damages. Everyone has a rich uncle, at least, or others even closer: family, friends, or even a generous boyfriend or girlfriend.
               </p>
               <p>
                People I know used to be afraid, but when studying how much money can be won from these cases and how it is done, the fear subsides.
               </p>
               <p>
                Preparation and money ready for legal fees (and the more the merrier; the other side must pay out the nose too) makes all much more "palatable." In fact, hate to say it, but just as there are some people out there looking for the next car to hit them... there are some out there who know they will win against CPS and have wealthy family/friends ready to quickly invest in their great odds (and if needed, for just a small percentage of the returns).
