<p>Serge Monsant believed that the elite are attempting to implement a New Age religion with the Antichrist at its head and start a New World Order, via a technologically-simulated Second Coming.  This is interesting in light of the fact that the cult of the illuminati communicate with evil aliens and worship an alien satan, who they believe will come back to rule the world. Monsant\'s two children were taken from him and his wife, and the next day he died of a heart attack, even though he had no history of heart issues.  He said:</p>
<p><em>Classification of Christian children, as they plan it, are to be used as human sacrifice. Where? Within the black mass ceremonies, they will participate in any kind of sexual orgy, some to be kept as sexual slaves.   
    Classification 2, which is the classification of prisoners to be used in medical experiments ....    The 3rd classification is the classification of healthy prisoners for the international human organ center ...</em></p>

<p>Milton Cooper was a former member of a secret society.  He said that Bush (and any member of Skull &amp; Bones) makes a declaration of allegiance to the cult, before anything else.  Therefore, Bush was never acting in the best interests of American citizens, but for the new world order which the elite are pushing for.  He believed that aliens &quot;manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult&quot;, and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them.  Cooper was shot in the heart during Bill Clinton\'s reign.</p>',

            Validate Shmalidate.  I think these idiots (Bush &amp; Clinton and Friends) believe this stuff because they have been indoctrinated for decades by the Satanic Leaders of the Secret Societies.  Those are the ones that are causing these problems.  They are brainwashed and are taught to inbreed which causes more insanity than already exists.  We must expose these societies and their leaders.  They must be taken down just as the elite.  Wait.  Hillary and Old Lady Bush will start looking Old Lady Rothschild (Phillipine).  Gargoyles.  Due to their devilish satanic worship and habits (if you know what I mean).

             Akhenhaten introduced monothesism to Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
             To a large extent, our knowledge of Akhenaten's life and times begins in Akhetaten, the city he built for himself and his religion, not that the site is particularly well preserved. In fact, it's not. Later rulers antagonistic to Amarna culture, the social and religious institutions Akhenaten imposed on Egypt, intentionally destroyed Akhetaten along with the records of Akhenaten's reign. Ironically, however, that program of destruction saved the city and its founder's name for posterity, and for the most part its preservation depends on the fact that the city rose and fell very quickly. The reason for that stems from the enormous scope of change which Akhenaten attempted—a dramatic shift in religious, political and social traditions—and that meant he had to have an entirely new, fully functioning capital from which he could run the country without the weight of tradition bearing down on him and holding him back. Revolutions often have to "seize the day" and proceed quickly or else they don't get off the ground at all. Moses and Abraham are the same person, they are Akhenhaten.

             RED THREAD "With regard to the ancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the seed in the earth."

             Immune system of organisms improved (blood leukocyte composition increased). improved regeneration of tissue seeds stored in the pyramid for 1-5 days showed a 30-100% increase in yield soon after construction of the Lake Seliger pyramid a marked improvement of the ozone was noted above the area seismic activity near the pyramid research areas are reduced in severity and size violent weather also appears to decrease in the vicinity of the pyramids pyramids constructed in Southern Russia (Bashkiria) appeared to have a positive effect on oil production with oil becoming less viscous by 30% and the yield of the oil wells increased according to tests carried out by the Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas. a study was done on 5000 prisoners who ingested salt and pepper that had been exposed to the pyramid energy field. The test subjects exhibited a greatly reduced violence rate and overall behavior was much improved. standard tissue culture tests showed an increase in survival of cellular tissue after infection by viruses and bacteria radioactive substances show a decreased level of radiation inside the pyramid there are reports of spontaneous charging of capacitors physicists observed significant changes in superconductivity temperature thresholds and in the properties of semi-conducting and carbon nano materials. water inside the pyramid will remain liquid to minus 40 degrees Celsius but freeze instantly if jostled or bumped in any way 666 and the Triangle

It was a shade favoured by fashionable Alexandrian women, including some in the royal household. Presumably Cleopatra's own auburn hair had set the trend, maybe enhanced with a vegetable colorant such as henna."

             The proper name Jesus /ˈdʒiːzəs/ used in the English language originates from the Latin form of the Greek name Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous), a rendition of the Hebrew Yeshua (ישוע), also having the variants Joshua or Jeshua.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the classical theologians Clement of Alexandria and Cyril of Jerusalem both stated that the Greek name Iesous was allegedly Jesus' original name itself and that the name was not a transliteration of a Hebrew form.

            <p>
             Matthew 1:21 provides the beginnings of the Christology of the name Jesus. At once it achieves the two goals of affirming Jesus as the savior and emphasizing that the name was not selected at random, but based on a Heavenly command.

             Modern scholars such as Peter Partner and Malcolm Barber agree that the name of Baphomet was an Old French corruption of the name Muhammad Alain Demurger, however, rejects the idea that the Templars could have adopted the doctrines of their enemies. Bookseller, Freemason and Illuminist Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733–1811), in Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden, und über dessen Geheimniß (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were Gnostics, and that "Baphomet" was formed from the Greek words βαφη μητȢς, baphe metous, to mean Taufe der Weisheit, "Baptism of Wisdom" Lucifer (/ˈluːsɪfər/;[1][2][3] loo-sif-ər) is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:12). The Vulgate translation uses the Latin word lucifer, but with a lower-case initial,[4] The Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale), occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means "shining one, light-bearer". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος(heōsphoros),[12][13][14] a name, literally "bringer of dawn", for the morning star. The word Lucifer is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as lucifer, meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing"

             Reference: " Chronos spent eternity devouring his own children to prevent the curse from coming true. This story had much to do with the shaping of Satan's destiny as a devourer of souls at the gates of Hell. In medieval times, there were many biblical artworks depicting a demon swallowing human souls at the gates of Hell. "

             In these times, the act of idol worship and sacrifice, both human and animal, were commonplace to pagan peoples. In the Hellinistic-Greek versions of the Bible, a place famous for sacrifice, "Hades" is renamed into the Hebrew word, "Sheol." However, sheol was not a place created from Hebrew mythology. Sheol, was in fact, a place outside of the city limits of Jerusalem where the garbage was burned daily. In the new testament, this place was also called Ghenna, in the Valley of Hinnom. In this valley, once resided the ancient cult of Moloch, whose traditions are found as early as the 3rd millenium BC. This cult, performed human sacrifices of children to appease their pagan god. This is similar to the method of Chronus's tale of devouring his children. Moloch, was a giant statue-like idol that was in the form of a bull, was a giant metal machine*, hollowed out and filled with fire. The human sacrifices were placed in the hands of the god, and raised to the mouth, where they fell into the fire.

             Reference: " Chronos spent eternity devouring his own children to prevent the curse from coming true. This story had much to do with the shaping of Satan's destiny as a devourer of souls at the gates of Hell. In medieval times, there were many biblical artworks depicting a demon swallowing human souls at the gates of Hell. "
            </p>
            <p>
             In these times, the act of idol worship and sacrifice, both human and animal, were commonplace to pagan peoples. In the Hellinistic-Greek versions of the Bible, a place famous for sacrifice, "Hades" is renamed into the Hebrew word, "Sheol." However, sheol was not a place created from Hebrew mythology. Sheol, was in fact, a place outside of the city limits of Jerusalem where the garbage was burned daily. In the new testament, this place was also called Ghenna, in the Valley of Hinnom. In this valley, once resided the ancient cult of Moloch, whose traditions are found as early as the 3rd millenium BC. This cult, performed human sacrifices of children to appease their pagan god. This is similar to the method of Chronus's tale of devouring his children. Moloch, was a giant statue-like idol that was in the form of a bull, was a giant metal machine*, hollowed out and filled with fire. The human sacrifices were placed in the hands of the god, and raised to the mouth, where they fell into the fire.

             Akhenhaten introduced monothesism to Egypt.
            </p>
            <p>
             To a large extent, our knowledge of Akhenaten's life and times begins in Akhetaten, the city he built for himself and his religion, not that the site is particularly well preserved. In fact, it's not. Later rulers antagonistic to Amarna culture, the social and religious institutions Akhenaten imposed on Egypt, intentionally destroyed Akhetaten along with the records of Akhenaten's reign. Ironically, however, that program of destruction saved the city and its founder's name for posterity, and for the most part its preservation depends on the fact that the city rose and fell very quickly. The reason for that stems from the enormous scope of change which Akhenaten attempted—a dramatic shift in religious, political and social traditions—and that meant he had to have an entirely new, fully functioning capital from which he could run the country without the weight of tradition bearing down on him and holding him back. Revolutions often have to "seize the day" and proceed quickly or else they don't get off the ground at all.
Moses and Abraham are the same person, they are Akhenhaten.

             RED THREAD "With regard to the ancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that they used to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing fans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice was offered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that the victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain, dismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the seed in the earth."

            <p>
             Immune system of organisms improved (blood leukocyte composition increased).
improved regeneration of tissue
seeds stored in the pyramid for 1-5 days showed a 30-100% increase in yield
soon after construction of the Lake Seliger pyramid a marked improvement of the ozone was noted above the area
seismic activity near the pyramid research areas are reduced in severity and size
violent weather also appears to decrease in the vicinity of the pyramids
pyramids constructed in Southern Russia (Bashkiria) appeared to have a positive effect on oil production with oil becoming less viscous by 30% and the yield of the oil wells increased according to tests carried out by the Moscow Academy of Oil and Gas.
a study was done on 5000 prisoners who ingested salt and pepper that had been exposed to the pyramid energy field. The test subjects exhibited a greatly reduced violence rate and overall behavior was much improved.
standard tissue culture tests showed an increase in survival of cellular tissue after infection by viruses and bacteria radioactive substances show a decreased level of radiation inside the pyramid
there are reports of spontaneous charging of capacitors
physicists observed significant changes in superconductivity temperature thresholds and in the properties of semi-conducting and carbon nano materials.
water inside the pyramid will remain liquid to minus 40 degrees Celsius but freeze instantly if jostled or bumped in any way

             "The red hair of the Germanic tribes conquered by Caesar was particularly prized for this purpose. It was a shade favoured by fashionable Alexandrian women, including some in the royal household. Presumably Cleopatra's own auburn hair had set the trend, maybe enhanced with a vegetable colorant such as henna."

             The proper name Jesus /ˈdʒiːzəs/ used in the English language originates from the Latin form of the Greek name Ἰησοῦς (Iēsous), a rendition of the Hebrew Yeshua (ישוע), also having the variants Joshua or Jeshua.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the classical theologians Clement of Alexandria and Cyril of Jerusalem both stated that the Greek name Iesous was allegedly Jesus' original name itself and that the name was not a transliteration of a Hebrew form.
            </p>
            <p>
             Matthew 1:21 provides the beginnings of the Christology of the name Jesus. At once it achieves the two goals of affirming Jesus as the savior and emphasizing that the name was not selected at random, but based on a Heavenly command.

             Modern scholars such as Peter Partner and Malcolm Barber agree that the name of Baphomet was an Old French corruption of the name Muhammad
Alain Demurger, however, rejects the idea that the Templars could have adopted the doctrines of their enemies.
Bookseller, Freemason and Illuminist Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733–1811), in Versuch über die Beschuldigungen welche dem Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden, und über dessen Geheimniß (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were Gnostics, and that "Baphomet" was formed from the Greek words βαφη μητȢς, baphe metous, to mean Taufe der Weisheit, "Baptism of Wisdom"
Lucifer (/ˈluːsɪfər/;[1][2][3] loo-sif-ər) is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:12). The Vulgate translation uses the Latin word lucifer, but with a lower-case initial,[4] The Hebrew word, transliterated Hêlêl or Heylel (pron. as HAY-lale), occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means "shining one, light-bearer". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος(heōsphoros),[12][13][14] a name, literally "bringer of dawn", for the morning star. The word Lucifer is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as lucifer, meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing"

            Cooper's book contains copies of official government documents citing Aquino and the Temple of Set:
            <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_nwo.htm">
             https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_nwo.htm
            </a>
            I love the part where the government document states that Aquino 'has sexual identity problems'. This I take to mean that he is a fetishist and likes to dress as a woman.  It also states that he frequents prostitutes to feed his hunger for sadomasochism, and that he is bi-sexual..

            "Milton Cooper was a former member of a secret society. He said that Bush (and any member of Skull &amp; Bones) makes a declaration of allegiance to the cult, before anything else. Therefore, Bush was never acting in the best interests of American citizens, but for the new world order which the elite are pushing for. He believed that aliens "manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them. Cooper was shot in the heart during Bill Clinton's reign."
