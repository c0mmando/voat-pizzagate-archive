<h2>About Together for Girls</h2>
<p>Together for Girls is a large worldwide government and private partnership, launched as a <strong>Clinton Global Initiative.</strong>  Their purpose is to &quot;end violence against children.&quot;</p>
<p>The partnership includes:  UNICEF, UNAIDS, UN Population Fund, World Health Organisation, USAID, the State Department, and many more, plus the Canadian government and those of 15+ countries in the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa and Asia.  Private partners are Becton, Dickinson and Co., the CDC Foundation, and Cummins &amp; Partners.</p>

<p><strong>World Vision</strong> is listed as an international partner in Together for Girls\' main activity, the Violence Against Children Survey (VACS).  World Vision is alleged to be CIA (at bottom), along with probably most of Together for Girls\' partners.  The survey interviews people age 13-24 to measure &quot;the prevalence and consequences of physical, emotional, and sexual violence against children.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Violence Against Children Survey</h2>
<p>Through the CDC, TFG administers the survey all over the world.  I\'m focusing on Haiti.  The sample includes thousands of respondents.</p>

<p>The respondent questionnaire for <strong>13</strong> to 24 year olds includes the following topics: demographics; <strong>socioeconomic status; parental relations;</strong> education; <strong>general connectedness to family, friends, and community;</strong> marital status; domestic servitude; displacement following the January 2010 earthquake; <strong>sexual behavior and practices; sex in exchange for money or goods;</strong> pregnancy; HIV/AIDS testing; experiences of physical, emotional, and <strong>sexual violence; health outcomes associated with exposure 
to violence; and utilization and barriers to services.</strong> </p>

<p>In the right hands, <strong>the data can be used for good.</strong>  In the wrong hands, it can be given to Cabal think tanks to evaluate how their evil plans are going, and worse, sold to data brokers to start/add to profiles on the respondents. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, the Clinton\'s have long-standing close ties to the world\'s largest data broker, Acxiom.  Are dossiers and area information used by the elites to aid profitable decision-making about human trafficking and CP?  </p>
<p>When Bill Clinton was President he pushed for &quot;data vulture&quot; companies to have access to the personal information of Europe\'s citizens, see: </p>

<h2>June 2017 Cathy O\'Brien article on Haiti</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered the correlation between the <strong>Clinton Foundation, World Vision, and CIA/Jesuit Black Ops in Haiti?</strong></p>
<p>The Clintons are no strangers to charities being used as cover for their <strong>criminal operations.</strong>  Charities like <strong>World Vision and various Christian “missions” collecting money under the guise of helping Haitians</strong> instead notoriously lined pockets <strong>while funding black ops.</strong></p>
<p>Reverberations of <strong>Psych Warfare that began in Haiti under the guise of charities</strong> has permeated our society on many levels for decades, even <strong>to the point of altering human sexuality.</strong>  </p>

            The other sponsor that has a logo on the 2012 Haiti survey is the "Interuniversity Institute for Research and Development" (INURED). What a weird acronym, isn't it?

           <p>
            If you search "INURED" on google images, it will bring a lot of really disturbing images of abuse and mutilations. How could this research institute possibly not realize that their acronym (which they use to refer to themselves on their website) is synonym with one of the core tenets of physical, mental and sexual abuse?
           </p>
           <p>
            And here is their logo: a sun containing a 8-pointed star hidden in the pattern of lines.
            <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/650499087/INUREDLOGO_400x400.png">

           </p>

            The 8-pointed star is known in occultism as the Star of

             Ishtar

            , the babylonian goddess of love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, combat, and political power. Ishtar is discussed on this sub in several posts.

            Another high-profile and possibly equally salient use of a (fluffed out) 8-pointed star is the logo of the CIA

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting bit from the logo is the motto: "Konesan se Libete" which means "Knowledge is Freedom" in Haitian creole. Although this may sound like a healthy motto, I can't help noticing how this echoes strangely the latin aphorism "Scientia potentia est" or "
            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientia_potentia_est"'>
