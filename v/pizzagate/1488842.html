            They're hipster artists. Cycling is big with hipsters so I don't think it is that out of the ordinary for them to have cycling connections.

            I don't think cycling would confer much of an advantage to pedos compared to alternatives like walking or driving or transit. There'd be benefits but drawbacks too.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for cycling groups actually being pedocycling groups sure there's a possibility, but you could say the same for any group a bunch of people belong to.
