            They're hipster artists. Cycling is big with hipsters so I don't think it is that out of the ordinary for them to have cycling connections.

            I don't think cycling would confer much of an advantage to pedos compared to alternatives like walking or driving or transit. There'd be benefits but drawbacks too.

            As for cycling groups actually being pedocycling groups sure there's a possibility, but you could say the same for any group a bunch of people belong to.
