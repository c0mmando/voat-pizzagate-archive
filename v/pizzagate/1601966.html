            This is my experience as well, the good always wins.
            <br/>
            So why would we need to work it out knowing this in advance?
My guess is heavy addictions,,  cause this stuff is addictive as crack  (so I've heard crack is addictive - no crackhead here.)

            It's hard to accept that people are so involved in evolving science,  "art" of all kinds,  career and what they look like,  stuff, stuff and more stuff,   but could care less about children's rights.

            Society isn't evolving in the important matters - it's devolving.

            Thanks for finding that.   The summary was different than what is shown.  It was way more detailed.   I know because on other media someone suggested a description change and it turned into a very specific  detailed summary.
            <br/>
            It was passed around to people in different countries who said they'd pass it around.
            <br/>
            That's why I was real surprised to find only a few signatures but I didn't think about it until your petition weirdness.

            Laugh  or cry -  right now I'm leaning toward crying on the inside.
I can't begin to understand what retrobate degraded minds would not only give less than 2 shits about protecting rights for children,  but to know that people are sabotaging the investigation for protective rights of voiceless children  leaves me gutted.   likely the same people who are involved in child-find funding agencies.

            Don't hold your breath on that one. I had been following her before she left on Nov 28th, which she disappeared before that date. Then she allowed me to follow her, I got blocked by her for nothing. You have to careful not to breathe or she will block you. Another excuse on Dec 28th. Not she leaves right before 1/28 on a cave thing. I have bad feelings about it, so do others.  Just letting you know. The longer they hold off on this, does it cause more harm to children?

            I wonder how we can find out when the first  petition was taken down.   I wonder if it was removed just before the  Jan 20th inauguration so nobody in the new team could check?   Or, is there a new team reporting, or just the old team reporting updates.

            sorry,   I meant the link on the whitehouse petition.
I clicked on the whitehouse petition and  it's a blank page, but it was there last month when I checked its expiry.
            <br/>
            They can remove the page from an internet, but they can't remove the consequences of their retrograde choices.....eventually those turn around to bite them in their own ass.

            Yeah  I thought they kept  old petitions on file even if they didn't meet the quota.  The old original first petition  is gone as far as I can see.

            I finally found  the  2 month old  thread to the first pgate petition:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1439271">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439271
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't make the petition but it went global and shut down with a small amount of votes. 
A few weeks ago I checked on it and although it was expired it was still up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now I checked the link and it's nowhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do they delete the record of dead petitions after a few weeks of their expiry?

            I see the supression almost everywhere I look.  Murder doesn't have a statute of limitations.  Seaman said he would make no more PG videos until they were on trial.  Joe Biggs and Alex Jones were shut up.  Tzipi Mazuz went silent.  I feel we are all just being strung along and a massive coverup is underway.  Too many powerful people are comprimised by it.  And most people I know are so brainwashed by MSM they can't think for themselves. I hope something happens.  The Pedo blackmail entrapment and organ harvesting are the worst things I can imagine on this earth.   Children are innocent.  George Webb acting weird again, blaming everyone but our politicians and judges.  There will always be evil contractors and CIA but if our legislators and Justice system don't work, there is no hope.  PizzaGate and child murder has to be fully exposed for any progress.

             Keep an eye on Trump, Sessions, Chaffetz, and Gowdy. Trump is very sly, and he's not the same man he was a few years ago. But this has to be done carefully. Just as Trump fearlessly and ruthlessly hammered the entire establishment seated around and in front of him during the inauguration, and pounded Hillary at the dinner, he is not afraid to trounce and eliminate anyone. Trump is a family man.

             Edit: You should watch the clip about his hard-line, deep and strict Scottish Presbyterian roots (mom's side). It was the Bible his mum gave him that he took the oath with. I have been to the small island where his mom is from and where she attended church 'religiously,' a god-fearing people. (I know many of them.) He's slowly turning an eye back to his puritan roots, absurd as that may sound.

             “Who was this Gray Champion?” Nathaniel Hawthorne asked near the end of this story in his Twice-Told Tales. No one knew, except that he had once been among the fire-hearted young Puritans who had first settled New England more than a half century earlier. Later that evening, just before the old priest-warrior disappeared, the townspeople saw him embracing the 85-year-old Simon Bradstreet, a kindred spirit and one of the few original Puritans still alive. Would the Gray Champion ever return? “I have heard,” added Hawthorne, “that whenever the descendants of the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires, the old man appears again.” – The Fourth Turning – Strauss &amp; Howe

              This does sound quite absurd.  If you think this, you have been thoroughly conned by Donald.  Donald has always followed his father's very non-Christian ways including the keeping of mistresses.

              Thanks for that little bit of hope infusion.  Like taking the lid off the paint can, it has to be done a little bit at a time.  I am guilty of putting all my hope in Tzipi or George Webb etc and oversimplifying. I am learning just how difficult this problem is and no easy solutions but that doesn't mean something good can't happen.

               I edited my post. Good analogy about the paint. Trump right now is dealing with a host of issues. Yes, if 'something good' never happened, we'd devolve into barbarism beyond repair. It's like a cycle, good and evil. I love the Renaissance and the Great Reformation for examples, and the Great Awakening in America.

             This is just my guess,
             <s>
              but it could be that nobody is watching/running the site, and they might require manual "approval" of any petition that gets 100 signatures, after which it will activate and start to show the real number. That is just speculation; this is kind of the same thing how Youtube views get stuck at 301 for a few hours until the video is mirrored around the globe on Youtube's CDNs.
             </s>
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn't watch the video, so my apologies if he covers this.
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: I stand corrected, I didn't know other petitions worked just fine.

            This petition has also been shared widely on Facebook! This is bullshit! Maybe we need to start a Twitter hashtag with a link to this petition so people can tweet and verify they've signed, then the response can be counted? So frustrated!!!

             https://petitions.whitehouse.gov

            , an initiative launched by Obama in 2011.

           <p>
            We don't know who is running this site anymore; it could be that the same staff (contrator?) are still running it, or Obama's people are still running it, maybe the Trump team took it over, or perhaps it's not being run by anybody and on autopilot.

             IMO Trump doesnt seem like the kind of guy to take into consideration these petitions. has his own plans to deal with at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
             it was all Obama's idea for this petition site to make his administration look "transparent" and "listening to the people" - but I really dont think it will ever change the world or make much difference to this case using it.
            </p>
            <p>
             wonder if there was ever a study done on which, if any, of the petitions did he actually address in any serious way
