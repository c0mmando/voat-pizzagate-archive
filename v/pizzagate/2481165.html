            OP, I am flairing this post with a 24-hour edit warning - establish relevance to Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, please show a link for the company, a source showing MSD is requiring purchasing a specific backpack for students.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now this looks like disinformation.  Thanks.

             , since both the title
             <em>
              and
             </em>
             the body of the posts need to be edited, to show a connection to Pizzagate, I will remove the post per Rules 1 and 3 (please see sidebar).
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rule 3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate.
