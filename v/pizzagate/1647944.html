            , solid theory. Could you add a couple more links to support it? Like to Flynn and his son's comments about pizzagate? One of the shill disinfo tactics we frequently remove posts for violating Rule 2 is when they link only one of several claims in their submission (because the other claims are bogus and have no support). Your points have real world support you could link to. Please do provide them so this doesn't get taken down.

              Add the archives when you can -- maybe put a note in the post that sli.mg was down. Perhaps users have another suggestion.

               it's been down for... what... a couple weeks as far as I know. Whenever all the archive stuff went screwy and everyone started saying they were compromised/deleting PG8 stuff.
