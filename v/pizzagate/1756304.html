<p>I don\'t have the quote handy but Jean Michel Nihoul, purported ringleader of trafficking in the Dutroux scandal of Belgium, said something similar.

<p>Human trafficking is the backbone of pedophilia.  It feeds the insatiable beast during the age of mass communication.  It is amazing how it has seemed to float in front of so many faces, mine included, without our awareness of the horror of a customer base with a compulsive Marquis De Sade-like depravity. A customer base with the power to not only conceal and cover up, but to literally alter social interpretations and conceptions through different channels over many decades, if not longer.  Was &quot;120 days of Sodom&quot; a collection of accounts or gossip of the misbehavior of the elite during the French Revolution?  The Marquis sure was determined.  So much of what I have read echoes his tales in 120 days &amp; the revolution would have been the perfect setting for the politically connected elite to indulge in a debauched lifestyle.

<p>Most of my life I have thought of a prostitute as someone who sold themselves for money.  Never in my wildest dreams did I understand there were international networks kidnapping children and using mind control techniques.  That there were women having children to be raised into this... thing.  Some of it tied to blackmail at the highest level.  The horror involved just hasn\'t been discussed in msm.  Not like it should.  Once it sinks in ones mind, a logical person begins to realize why. </p>
<p>I would love your feedback, especially on the link to de Sade.</p>',

            nihoul is member of a loge ( mason shits ) and dutroux was a deliverer of kids for the freemasons. thats why dutroux wanted to have more than 99 houses so he could enter this elite club as a full member. the elite has always had their perversions in every form , in every timeline , so yeah for sure de sade is not just a novel.

            This interview is very useful for putting the human trafficking picture together.  This eyewitness also backed up the point made by Kendall on Doctor Phil about human trafficking being such a big part of major sports events (such as the Superb Owl and the Olympics).  Apparently the combined sex rings of SA didn't contain enough trafficked girls to feed the huge demand during the 2010 SA World Cup and they had to resort to abducting local girls.  We should publicise this aspect of "the bread and circus" sports events and promote a boycott of the sponsors, until the host cities clean themselves up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disappointing to hear the churches he appealed to help the trafficked girls were mostly uninterested.

            quite an interesting interview - he speaks so casually about chaining or tieing up a group of girls to a toilet, abusing them, raping them, not feeding them and drugging them.   And he was one of the better ones - at east he tried to get one away.
