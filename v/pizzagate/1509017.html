<p>402 children are missing in Virginia. Over half of these children have no picture or no date of birth.

How can someone make a missing person report without a picture or age? 
It gets worse. 
182 children have disappeared in the state of Virginia in the last 60 days.
That\'s more than 6 children a day. 
Why are press keeping this quiet? Where are the amber alerts? Who are these children?
Population 8.3 million. Highest rate of missing children in the country. 3x higher than any other state.
To put it into perspective, NY is missing 69 in children in 2016. NC is missing 20. PA is missing 40
Every one of those children in other these states have pictures and DOB. Every single one.</p>
<p>we\'re missing 66 children just in the last 10 days. Hear about this on the news?
Almost all of them disappear from three different locations. Richmond area, Norfolk/Va Beach area, and Fairfax/DC area.</p>
<p>I scrubbed the internet clean trying to find a MAP of where the children go missing. Maybe detect a hotspot. There isn\'t one.

            Do you think it could have anything to do with the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children?

            I noticed children in Haiti and the USA really go missing after natural disasters.  That's normal, to some extent.  But shouldn't the Katrina kids have been located by now?

            Someone pointed out to me that the 402 number might include missing Adults.  I did a search at www.missingkids.com/home and found the number in Virginia to be 284.  Your 182 in the last 60 days is accurate.  Where did you get your number from?

            Doing some more research. They claim VA does things differently tht's why the numbers are skewed. I call BULLSHIT. 
1/1/1990-1/1/2016 - total of 83 kids missing. All have pics and DOBs
1/1/2016-present - 300 kids missing, most only a name.

            going by what virginia is saying about using a more comphrehensive data-base that also includes runaways, then they are the only state using this!! i researched all 50 states on the  The National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children using the dates 12/16/2016 thru to today 12/21/2016 , most states have no missing except for 1 in new york and 1 in another state, but virginia has 47 missing in a 2 week time period!!!  further more, looking up and reading missing children in other states, many say  that child might still be in the area, meaning they are runaways. so does this prove that the other states "do" put runaways in their state data-base also,like virginia or not?? all this said there are 47 kids that are missing in virginia since 12/16/2016!!! no way to skew that fact.

            In short the Virginians use this statistical register a lot more comprehensively than other states - but look at the youtube vid for a more granular assessment
