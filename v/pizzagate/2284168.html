            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire MONTH ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

               Q was talking about attacks on Trump's base. The US country music crowd fits that demographic: nationalistic and mostly conservative in their values. Also there is the Saudi Arabia connection to the Las Vegas shootings, in which commentators have been quick to posit that the shooting was simply a distraction so that the assassins could escape, based on minimal evidence. The FBI's intense interest in what was at first glance a local state matter should also raise red flags.
              </p>
              <p>
               The church shooting also has evidence of state participation as the shooter should have been barred from obtaining firearms legally but this wasn't the case.

            CDAN had an interesting blind about his trip to the Hefner mansion underground vault, where there was a huge collection of photos, videos, etc. of celebrities.  Possible connection, given the recent Pamela Anderson seeking out Mike Pence in late November?

               Sorry -- PM = Playboy Mansion; honeypot = (in context) is a trap using sex (e.g., a Brownstone operation)

              <p>
               "Operation Brownstone, also known as a "Brownstone operation," is a reference to a theory that intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and FBI, engage in utilizing underage individuals for prostitution purposes with high profile targets, for the purposes of being able to blackmail those high profile individuals later.

               What I believe isn't important. Facts are that Tony was breaking the rules on influence peddling, although those rules hadn't been widely enforced in the past. I can't pick any holes in the story about John surrendering on the quiet, but it's only hearsay.

                Sure it is, we are discussing the credibility of the guy who made those claims.  He made two claims that are either true or false.  I'm not asking if you think Tony Podesta is in legal jeopardy.  I'm asking if you believe the claims he made are true.  I'm asking if you believe he is credible.

                None of Mueller's indictments have leaked. So far 4 people have been charged or plead guilty.  This LARPer had no details beforehand on any of those 4.  Why would he now?

                 It's not important in the sense that it's only my opinion. What really matters are the facts and the logical arguments which give those facts wider meaning. An opinion is essentially true because it is a real belief, but beliefs can be incompatible with reality given a long enough timeline.

                  Every LARPing thing he has done.  Played straight to the conspiracy crowd telling them what they want to hear.  Getting their hopes up.  Giving them something to wait on while Trump is now facing the prospect that his guy Flynn is now cooperating with the special prosecutor.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He's created an alternative narrative just when Trump needed it.     And I believe this LARPer might be close to Trump, but still a LARPer.

                   <p>
                    No.  His intention is give you some threads that in the internet spiders can scurry up and down and occupy their time to make little webs.  Team Trump learned early on on how to use paranoia of the conspiracy community to their advantage by creating new conspiracy theories to occupy them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Team Trump is not attacking the free press and the rule of law.   Trump personally didn't obstruct justice when he tried to get the FBI to drop their investigation of the criminal Mike Flynn.  No, these are all lies told by the corrupt Deep State.  And Trump is a strategic genius who is fighting back against them.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It's a giant, giant problem that Flynn is cooperating with Mueller.  Trump is going to try to find a way to fire Mueller, and it's because of Mueller's integrity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In fact my personal theory is that Q's job is to create alternate narrative for all the stuff coming down the pike.  Once Mueller started issuing indictments, the indictment talk turned to Clinton and Huma and John McCain.    Saudia Arabia?  Flynn was pushing a deal where the Russia and the US would cooperate to build nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia.   A deal that would require US sanctions to be lifted.  Flynn worked as a consultant for one of the US companies in the deal.   He continued to push this deal while in the White House.  Russia would give Saudi Arabia the nuclear fuel by the way.

                     This can result in good information since it's subject to independent analysis and verification.  Having theories about power structure is all well and good, but unless they can withstand rational criticism they're unlikely to be of much value to anyone.

                     The problem is that in a global context it's the fictions of statism which form the basis of corruption. Trump's intent appears to be honourable, but he's the commander-in-chief of a federation of states, not a country with a direct connection to the law of the land. Declaring the law of the land to be something different doesn't change it's real nature and qualities, which are expressed as the practice and consent of the people.

              Yep, and it was proven wrong. LARP for a fucking month, paid by Soros and spammed on every single fucking social media network. Retweets by BOOMERS, of all people, should have proven this.

              what i am wondering... did he pay 7.8 million to hide a film/blackmail OR did he take a 7.8 million dollar bribe and was there a film. I just think the 8mm has escaped everyone and he also says enjoy the show indicating there is a show/film. So its my guess that is what that means right now.

            Some part of me feels like at first this Q post thing had some legitimate points - now it seems like its veering off into Larpsville.. Lots of vagueries and no substance anymore.

             It was always a LARP. We proved it a month ago. The government will never arrest itself. Jews won’t go down, ever, until they’re exterminated.

              You know what, I might have to recant on this one. He predicted False Flag and less than 24 hours later we just got the Manhatten subway explosions. Perhaps I was incorrect.
