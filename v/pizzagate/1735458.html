            Setting up an orphanage in a rich neighborhood sounds a little nuts to me in the first place.  What?  Did they think the rich people were going to just walk in and adopt from there?  It all sounds confusing to me.  The story just does not add up.  But why did they leave there with such a good set up with the tunnels right below?  Maybe there is another way they get the children into the bus station now and down into the tunnels.  There is some kind of trailer next to it in the picture.  This could be done at night.  I think this definitely calls for more digging.  Could be a lead, yes.

            No, I do not.  I wish I did.  Maybe someone will see it and provide it.I am sure the picture was posted before Christmas.   I did a little research on it and now I remember that someone said the habit of the nun looked like a Carmelite nun.  Carmelites take a vow of poverty and do not speak to anyone.  But I cannot remember if that was debunked or not.  Again I think there is a Carmelite convent nearby.  But this could be a fake convent.  Who knows?  They can set up anything in DC.

            Could this be connected to that picture that was shown on here?  The one with a nun out in front of CPP?  Many wondered what she was doing there.  There is also an order that runs a day care in the area.

              YAY!  That's her.  Thanks for coming to the rescue. Ask and you shall receive. You can always count on a member to save the day.  I don't think it was ever resolved as to what order she was with for sure.  If she is with the Jesuits or The Marianists that is a real find.

                I don't remember exactly how or where I got that info from and I can't find the proof anywhere right now, but I do remember she was from the Carmelite Order.
