<p>The Boy Scouts of America has locked away in its &quot;perversion files&quot; the names of 7,819 scout leaders who allegedly preyed on boys, a lawyer who is representing the sexual abuse victims claimed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The files, which go back to 1944, also include the names of 12,254 victims, said the lawyer, Jeff Anderson.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are numbers that were not known before today or ever revealed by the Boy Scouts of America,&quot; Anderson told NBC News. &quot;The scope of what was contained in the perversion files has dramatically expanded beyond what was known.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson said the figures came from Dr. Janet Warren, a professor at the University of Virginia\'s medical school, who for five years had worked on a contract basis with the Scouts to evaluate how they handled sexual abuse within the organization from 1944 to 2016. She had access to review the files as part of her work. Warren revealed the figures in January while testifying in an unrelated child sex abuse case that took place at a Minnesota children\'s theater company, he said.</p>
<p>But while the Scouts have acknowledged keeping the files, they have so far resisted demands to release all of the names, Anderson said.</p>
<p>&quot;They may have removed them from scouting, but the Boy Scouts of America have never alerted communities that this scout leader, this coach, this teacher is known to be a child molester,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;That is the real alarming fact that needs to be mentioned today. It\'s systematic and across the country.&quot;</p>
<p>NBC News reached out to Warren for comment, but there was no immediate response.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Scouts apologized &quot;to anyone who was harmed during their time in Scouting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At no time have we ever knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we mandate that all leaders, volunteers and staff members nationwide immediately report any abuse allegations to law enforcement,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The Scouts said that all instances of suspected abuse are reported to law enforcement, that &quot;all of the names on the \'Anderson List\' are publicly available&quot; and that &quot;all of these individuals were removed from Scouting and reported to law enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>The Scouts said that &quot;decades ago&quot; they had &quot;adopted some of the strongest barriers to abuse&quot; and that the safety and protection of the children were its &quot;top priority.&quot;</p>
<p>Slammed by numerous lawsuits and facing mounting legal costs, the venerable nonprofit organization, which has been around for over a century, warned in December that it was considering filing for Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>“We have a social and moral responsibility to fairly compensate victims who suffered abuse during their time in Scouting, and we also have an obligation to carry out our mission to serve youth, families and local communities through our programs,” the chief scout executive, Michael Surbaugh, said in the statement at the time.</p>
<p>Anderson also said his law firm, using publicly available documents, including legal settlements and news accounts, had been able to compile a list of 130 former scout leaders in New York and 50 more in New Jersey who were removed from the organization and whose names appeared in the available &quot;ineligible volunteer files&quot; maintained by the Scouts.</p>
<p>Anderson released those names Tuesday at two news conferences.</p>
<p>NBC News and other news outlets first reported the existence of the &quot;perversion files&quot; in 2012, when the Scouts released 1,247 cases of known or suspected child abusers in response to a lawsuit by two Portland, Oregon, lawyers.</p>
<p>Those files detailed cases from 49 states from 1965 to 1985. And they revealed the hardball tactics that attorneys for the Scouts used to defend the organization, as well as the legal hurdles that scout sex abuse victims — like clergy sex abuse victims — faced when they tried to sue for damages.</p>
<p>Later, The Los Angeles Times released a database that tracked 1,900 cases of suspected scout sexual abusers spanning 1947 to 2005.</p>
<p>Anderson said he was convinced that there even more cases are in the files &quot;that are being held and hoarded at the Boy Scouts of America headquarters.&quot; He said he intended to sue the Scouts on behalf of the victims to open up those files.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t know how many of those people were ever charged with crimes,&quot; he said. &quot;I don\'t know how many of them are still alive.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson is best known for publicly releasing lists of Roman Catholic priests who have been credibly accused of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Last month, he released a 185-page report that listed the names of hundreds of accused priests in Illinois, along with six nuns and a handful of lay people.</p>
<p>Anderson said his team used the same methods to pull together the list of priests that he used to compile the list of scoutmasters in New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>His list includes two scout leaders who were accused of running what, according to a Nov. 15, 1983, article in The Star-Ledger newspaper of Newark, New Jersey, was alleged in court documents to be a &quot;cult&quot; involving at least 35 teenagers.</p>',

            When the Bryan Singer expose came out a few months ago, there was an article that came out the same time on a teen star, my brain is a sieve, I think it was Brad Renfro. It described how the boys were recruited into Hollywood using priests and places that work with troubled boys. I wish I had bookmarked it because that quote made the entire pedowood ... boys ranch ... church trafficking click.  I will attempt to find this article again

            Priest and Boy Scoutmaster committed sexual abuse as both.  There are surely more out there leading double lives in order to partake of their sick perverted needs.

            We should try to find some info about the cult the two boy scout leaders mentioned in the last paragraph were running.

             Nutley: Satanic rituals
            </p>
            <p>
             In a 1983 case, a pair of Scout leaders from Nutley emerged at the center of what authorities described as a Satanic sex cult where underage children were lured with drugs and alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the cult leaders was identified as a 19-year-old Eagle Scout named Michael Abidiwan, who belonged to a troop sponsored by the Franklin Reformed Church in Nutley, the Scout records say. The other was identified as 22-year-old John Sileo, who had been an assistant cubmaster of Pack 45 before Scout officials found he had a “neurological impairment” and revoked his Scouting registration, the records state. A police investigation found that the cult involved 35 boys and girls, aged 15 through 17, who were subjected to satanic rituals, sexual abuse and various forms of humiliation, including being forced to wear dog collars and lap milk from a bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both men were indicted by an Essex County grand jury on charges of aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of children, the Scout documents show; they eventually pleaded guilty to lesser charges. Abidiwan was sentenced to five years’ probation while Sileo spent more than a decade in prison, the documents state. Neither could be reached for comment.
