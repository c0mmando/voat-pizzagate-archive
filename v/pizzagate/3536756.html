            Brice Taylor who wrote Thanks for the Memories was a mkultra presidential model. She was very respected in those circles as Henry Kissinger was her handler.........she spoke to groups in the California university system. ......something of a prize and genius.She was given to Ronald Reagan. .......got pregnant and had a baby with him. She writes in her book that queen took the baby for the good of the world. Not a stretch of the imagination when you look at the very young photos of her and Prince Andrew. He looks like none of the royal family but very much like her. They have a very distinctive look in their youth. There was talk that he was not Phillips child as well......"Royal Report

            Andrew - Bastard And Aids Victim?
           </p>
           <p>
            Doubts about Prince Andrew's fatherhood have been going the rounds ever since the Princely Gelding was conceived and Prince Philip did a lengthy runner on the royal yacht and did not come back until a few days before the birth. The Greek lothario, of course, did not go unaccompanied - with full approval, even connivance, of the Queen who was at the time having it off with Lord Carnaervon (then Lord Porchester, her racing manager). Porchester, so top racing people allege, is Andrew's real father. But as Buck House have constantly declined either to deny it or to prove it is not true with a DNA test, you can never be entirely sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the Queen also had it off with old sods like Anthony Blunt with whom she used to play amongst the Royal artistic archives."

             British police defend decision to not pursue Prince Andrew sex trafficking claims
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             British police on Thursday defended the decision to not fully investigate sex trafficking claims by Prince Andrew’s accuser — something she has blasted as “corruption” in the highest levels of government.
            </p>
            <p>
             Virginia Roberts Giuffre has long claimed that Jeffrey Epstein made her have sex with the royal three times, including in London in March 2001 when a now notorious photo was taken of them together.
            </p>
            <p>
             Giuffre claimed on Twitter this week that London police told her they would “forensically examine” Ghislaine Maxwell’s house, where she claimed the sex happened soon after the photo was taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Next thing I hear, just like the FBI, they were not allowed to pursue the investigation,” she wrote Monday, calling it “corruption in the highelevels [sic] of gov.”
            </p>
            <p>
             London’s Scotland Yard confirmed Thursday that in July 2015 it “received an allegation of non-recent trafficking for sexual exploitation” involving convicted pedophile Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Officers assessed the available evidence, interviewed the complainant and obtained early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service,” Commander Alex Murray of Specialist Crime said in a statement.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Following legal advice, it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We therefore concluded that the MPS was not the appropriate authority to conduct inquiries in these circumstances and, in November 2016, a decision was made that this matter would not proceed to a full criminal investigation,” he confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The decision was reviewed in August after Epstein’s death in his Manhattan lockup, the force said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Our position remains unchanged,” Murray said Thursday, saying UK police would be open to help other investigations if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The MPS has liaised with other law enforcement organizations but has not received a formal request asking for assistance in connection with this allegation.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Giuffre’s claims — and the photo of her with Andrew — proved central in him being axed from royal duties following his disastrous attempts to explain the scandal during a BBC interview.
            </p>
            <p>
             Andrew has strenuously denied the accusations and insists he has no recollection of ever meeting Giuffre.
