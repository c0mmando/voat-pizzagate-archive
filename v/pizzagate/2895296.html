            categorically false.  and no one really believes that because paraphelias like attraction to children are simply not that common.  Clearly you have been duped by the euphemism of "grooming" for prostitution and drug-dependence.   Because you are just not very bright.

             Faculty of Public Health president Professor John Ashton said more and more children were having sex before 15.
He held up official figures which showed up to a third of teenagers were having sex before the age of consent at the time.

            WTF, "teenager"?!  if youre not 18 youre LEGALLY a "CHILD" goddammit.  I suspect Prof Ashton is a pedo.

            damn that's a lot of "child sex" going on, probably 1/5 of the population are pedophiles right, wtf
