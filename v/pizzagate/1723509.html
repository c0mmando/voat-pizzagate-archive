<h1>Why we are not advertising either of the Pizzagate Protests</h1>
<p>This post began as a reply to <a href="https://voat.co/user/sound_of_silence">@sound_of_silence</a>, who created a graphic and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1720947">asked that we post it</a> to help publicize the two upcoming protests. After much discussion among the mods, we have decided not to, and have removed the March 25 poster from the sidebar as well. Hopefully, you can suspend your disbelief for a bit and hear what I am about to say. </p>
<p>Because <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> has sort of become the &quot;newspaper of record&quot; documenting the Pizzagate investigation during a time where <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1482030">just about every other site has completely shut down discussion</a>, it is really important that we protect the continued existence of the forum -- especially from the sort of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1690808">legal action that has shut down other sites</a>. To that end, we have a responsibility to point out potential threats we see that could harm users or Voat itself. So please weigh the following with an open mind...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Problems with the March 18th protest at Beyond Borders Haiti</h1>
<p>When we first considered promoting this event, we were surprised that someone would plan an additional protest <em>a week prior</em> to the one that had already been on the books for a while. </p>
<ul>
<li>Why split the potential crowd and media coverage between two events? </li>
<li>Why go to all the trouble and expense to fund, permit, and promote two separate events? </li>
<li>Why risk causing conflict between pizzagate investigators, and the plentiful troll-fuel it would generate?</li>
</ul>
<p>This last question was particularly apropos, as this just happened to come to our attention in the midst of a concentrated, organized effort to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1678736">ban prolific pizzagate investigators on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1657698/8109003">Reddit</a> and systematically <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1717948">defame and undermine</a> some of the most popular pizzagate &quot;broadcasters.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I looked at the organizer\'s twitter stream and saw this exchange: <a href="https://twitter.com/Charyoutree19/status/838543624509980672">https://twitter.com/Charyoutree19/status/838543624509980672</a>. From <a href="https://www.facebook.com/StndUpForTheChildren/posts/454780291519889">the permit</a>, it looks like he wants to protest at Beyond Borders Haiti for three hours before marching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The demonstration will begin in front of Beyond Borders located at 5016 Connecticut Ave NW and after a three hour protest there, we will march to the Whitehouse elipse . My permit for this event was approved by National Parks Services on 3-3-2017. Protest will end at dusk.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like an awfully long time to have an upset, frustrated crowd stand outside a charity to call them out as pedophiles, rapists and slavers -- plenty of time for Antifa types to rain down mayhem and start fights as happened recently at UCBerkeley and during the election at Trump rallies. </p>
<p>Given the <a href="https://twitter.com/_____JaYSoN____/status/839098663209156608">popularity of Based Stick Man</a> in the past couple of weeks, the odds of violence have <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BasedStickMan&amp;src=typd">intensified</a>. Why set up a situation conducive to it? Why pick such a confrontational location and stay there so long?</p>
<p>Well, my tour of his social media accounts revealed Mr. Gallant not only has an eye for cool graphics, but a taste for aggression. </p>
<p>He uses some fairly dark/threatening artwork, and calls his group &quot;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/StndUpForTheChildren/photos/a.452042111793707.1073741828.449872735343978/452861871711731/?type=3&amp;theater">The Anti-Pedo League</a>&quot;. Here\'s a <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6CzGVuUwAQtNxH.jpg">darker poster </a>of the event. </p>
<p>When I did this research March 6, the background photo of his Twitter profile was <a href="http://img.wennermedia.com/820-width/rs-91006-16696756-16696758-large.jpg">this picture</a> -- kids with falcons backed up by a posse of gunslingers, implying a pack of killers -- from <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-dark-tower-stephen-kings-comic-books-become-a-graphic-novel-20071005">a graphic novel </a>by Stephen King. Since mod <a href="https://voat.co/user/wecanhelp">@wecanhelp</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1710524">posted</a> about the concerns we had, it has been completely removed from Gallant\'s Twitter media, though the theme of <a href="https://twitter.com/Charyoutree19">armed resistance</a> remains.</p>
<p>Don\'t get me wrong -- I frankly think the kids with falcons image ought to be the official Poster of Pizzagate. It\'s cool AF and captures the feeling many of us have, the same spirit that made Based Stick Man go viral. That is fine for a meme, a tweet, a Facebook post, street art, etc. But the combined effect of the time in front of Beyond Borders plus the use of militant imagery to promote and set the tone for the event is problematic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially in light of what the supposed DHS Insider told <a href="http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/03/as-promised-by-our-dhs-insider-fbi-anon-resurfaces/">Victurus Libertas on March 5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. Will it get bloody?</p>
<p>A. Lets just say its flag weather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell, Mr. Gallant is a decent guy who simply couldn\'t sit on his hands anymore. I am not trying to throw shade on his character. I DO wish to remind people of the big picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Clinton Cabal and Soros-funded Antifa have a history of manipulating rallies in order to incite violence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Comet Ping Pong shooter was likely a false flag, and we are again in &quot;flag weather&quot; according to supposed insiders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That incident has been used to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1580566">debunk and suppress </a>the pizzagate investigation ever since</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The violence-loving deep state operatives who we believe started and maintain the trafficking rings are skilled manipulators <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/1355450">capable of LARPing</a> on made up sites, any of the sites we use as sources, or fooling the investigators who run them. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there was this language, also in the permit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I, Erik Gallant of Jackson MI, aided by a handful of dedicated others, have been the hub of this movement of concerned citizens from all over the U.S. and abroad who have pitched in their efforts to make this demonstration a reality, working hard day and night pushing our campaign on various online platforms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the emphasis on himself, his requests for money, his cool looking but dangerous imagery and melodramatic organization name (superheroes like the <a href="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/55fc8490dd08952d3d8b4735-1024-768/justice-league.jpg">Justice League</a>?) I am not confident Mr. Gallant would necessarily recognize if he were being manipulated.</p>
<p>Imagine the effect of turning this rally into a Berkeley-type riot. It would not only impact March 18, it would likely completely shut down the originally planned rally on March 25. Were we to advertise it here, we might subject Voat and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> to increased vulnerability to censorship through legal action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Problem with the March 25 protest</h1>
<p>Today we became aware that the March 25 protest, which will feature Titus Frost and David Seaman, also features a guy named David Surter who purports to be a Satanic Ritual Abuse survivor and the Anti-Christ (and is selling his book about it). From a <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1723214">post </a>by <a href="https://voat.co/user/WolvesandSheeple">@WolvesandSheeple</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this <a href="https://youtu.be/ED1qpa_IPUc">Youtube Video</a>. He goes on a 10 minute long rant talking about how he was raised to be the antichrist and put a curse on several people, including Johnny Depp. He also claims that the second coming of Christ or some otherworldly event will take place within two weeks, because he can &quot;feel it.&quot; This man is one of the <a href="http://davidshurter.com/?p=7498">advertised speakers,</a> and a [member of the &quot;steering committee&quot;](https://youtu.be/FmoUwySslaA  at the second march on the 25th. Take a look at his &quot;official&quot; website as well: <a href="http://davidshurter.com">David Shurter</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unclear how significant Surter\'s role will be. This protest lacks the confrontational nature of the March 18 event. It will be at Laffayette Park, a neutral location, and they are not promoting the event with imagery glorifying vigilante justice. They have raised most of their $10,000 goal. They plan to feed protestors, listen to speakers, and have an open mike. They also have security. For these reasons, we have much fewer concerns about this event being a manipulated.</p>
<p>To be fair, however, we removed the poster for it in the sidebar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h1>We are not saying stay away from these protests, or that the organizers are shills. People need to weigh that issue for themselves.</h1>
<p>But please be aware of the issues we\'ve pointed out. Despite the risk of unleashing a shitstorm and triggering everyone, I could not in good conscience allow these issues to go unremarked. Please be cautious if you attend the protest. We have to look out for each other, because the pitfalls are many.</p>',

           From what I can tell, Mr. Gallant is a decent guy who simply couldn't sit on his hands anymore. I am not trying to throw shade on his character. I DO wish to remind people of the big picture:

            <p>

           <li>
            <p>
             The Comet Ping Pong shooter was likely a false flag, and we are again in "flag weather" according to supposed insiders

           Imagine the effect of turning this rally into a Berkeley-type riot. It would not only impact March 18, it would likely completely shut down the originally planned rally on March 25. Were we to advertise it here, we might subject Voat and

           Today we became aware that the March 25 protest, which will feature Titus Frost and David Seaman, also features a guy named David Surter who purports to be a Satanic Ritual Abuse survivor and the Anti-Christ (and is selling his book about it). From a

He goes on a 10 minute long rant talking about how he was raised to be the antichrist and put a curse on several people, including Johnny Depp. He also claims that the second coming of Christ or some otherworldly event will take place within two weeks, because he can "feel it." This man is one of the

          <p>
           It is unclear how significant Surter's role will be. This protest lacks the confrontational nature of the March 18 event. It will be at Laffayette Park, a neutral location, and they are not promoting the event with imagery glorifying vigilante justice. They have raised most of their $10,000 goal. They plan to feed protestors, listen to speakers, and have an open mike. They also have security. For these reasons, we have much fewer concerns about this event being a manipulated.

           To be fair, however, we removed the poster for it in the sidebar.

           We are not saying stay away from these protests, or that the organizers are shills. People need to weigh that issue for themselves.

          <p>
           But please be aware of the issues we've pointed out. Despite the risk of unleashing a shitstorm and triggering everyone, I could not in good conscience allow these issues to go unremarked. Please be cautious if you attend the protest. We have to look out for each other, because the pitfalls are many.

            There are videos of David Shurter and Fiona Barnett on YouTube. Fiona is the SRA survivor from Australia.  If she thinks that Shurter is legitimate, then he is.

            I really wish I could go. I am really far away and if I wanted to drive there I would have to do like the astronaut lady and put my diapers on. Also I have a houseful of pets and no sitter.
And I really really really would like to urge anyone who goes there to control their own narrative! Do not wait for anyone to ask you a question,whip out your phone and start live streaming!!  If you see something going haywire go ahead and report about that too. But whatever you do control but narrative

            Dumb. I argued against these "all powerful" mods when they tried to smear the 3/18 protest. Now they're covering their dumb asses and suddenly impartial to either event. People are smarter than this. PG is way beyond investigation. It REQUIRES decent and unafraid men and women to stand up and speak out. Get your butt to the 3/25 protest.

            you succeeded at keeping ~600 demonstrators out of DC on the 18th.  your ridiculous, paranoid, divisionist fear-inspiring sticky is not "helping".  just stop "helping" and go back to "moderating".  we can think for ourselves.  we don't need your help.

            All that b.s. just to try to excuse the deceit. Like any of that shit matters if one more person is tortured or raped to death...I said death, cause some mf is always worrying to paralysis, about what might happen.
Shit is happening now

            1ew you do a great job of walking the fine line and getting good action for updates on this sticky thread.  I have watched what you have achieved and salute you.

            I also want you to know that there has been a different kind of pushback on this sticky - you may not agree with it -by some of us and you can see it by hitting this thread and sorting your comments for "new".  Also the "top" comment has been edited to show support for the second protest.

            I appreciate your sentiment here.  There has been some pushback against this ongoing forever misguided sticky.  STrong pushback and in many ways it is a propaganda piece that mods are refusing to diffuse.   Please see our efforts by going to this thread and sorting the comments by "new".  Also the "top" comment has been edited to support the protesters.  Thanks.  and upvote if you agree.

             c) People angry about this thread are now at least 20x more motivated to show up at the March 25th event, which I have been pushing on Twitter, btw

              what we all realize... is that you and anyone else here promoting a fear-division based narrative (which is exactly what the sticky post does), are controlled opposition. you obviously want a false flag to happen... that's why you spread fear about it.

              you want to advertise it without legal risk, then do that and that alone, in a new sticky.
             </p>
             <p>
              and apologize to the decent people who organized the first march... because apologizing for bullshit is what decent people do... are you going to be a decent person?

             • So solemn a start for such a simple question with such a simple answer… • Why would we need to suspend our disbelief to be able to listen well enough to understand? Are we all in such an overwhelming state of disbelief about the banner for the March on the 25th being taken down that we can no longer think straight without a reminder? • This could only be directed at a mob of hapless chimps who enter into a deafening, irrational state of shock at the first whiff a banner for a demonstration has been suddenly removed. • Except – there’s no one like that participating on

              v/pizzagate

             . The comments to the post prove that. What an insult to the community…. “suspend your disbelief”…. sounds a lot more like “you are getting sleepy… very sleepy”. • So, what could be the purpose of laying down a premise of fear in the outset of this discourse, by goading the reader with the suggestion that “deafening disbelief” is the obvious first response to an explanation? Especially when that explanation could have simply been, “Unfortunately we are not able to display either of the banners due to legal concerns beyond our control”? • What kind of forthcoming statements are going to require an admonishing, pre-emptive reminder to all us idiot chimps who don’t listen – that we the chimps need to put on our listening caps and prepare to exercise our best active comprehension skills? • What kind of statements would need that level of psychological preparation, and what would be the goal of the acceptance of those statements?

            <em>
             Nearly all the concerns in the sticky could have been resolved by a quick you tube search way back on March 6th. The rest was subsequently available in the dates leading up to the post; additionally, the organizer and a core volunteer were available and in contact with the moderators prior to the post. I’m sharing this rebuttal because there’s not only a war For Pizzagate truth, there’s a war On Pizzagate truth.

            It's one thing to express concerns for the well-being of fellow Voaters, but it is quite another thing for moderators to aggressively attack any variance from their edict.  Some moderators appear to have gone out of their way to stamp out any dissent from what they have decided is best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fine, I understand if you don't want to be legally liable, but the mods are not the pizzagate/pedogate research effort.  Mods should offer their opinion as we all do, but they should never aggressively snipe at others. I somehow missed the "construction worker" characterization of an organizer as though it were a bad thing and am furious.  You have really over-reached yourselves in this.

             I have asked the mod who wrote this post to now flair it "Accuracy In Question"
            </strong>
            as real world events have proven the entire write up about the first protest to be inaccurate speculation and demoralizing sophistry at best.  It is now troublesome that this discredited sticky is still planted in the spotlight here to discredit the next protest without apology .  The presence of this sticky discredits ALL protest, in meta.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mods need to be held to the same standards as the rest of the community when posting.  I do not believe this sticky accurately represents the current feelings of the community (shills not included of course) and should no longer be granted the priviledge of squatting on the top of our forum.  Remember, this forum belongs to the community and the mods, not just the mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apologies are in order to the organizer of the first march, who OP dismissed in comments as a construction worker who she questioned was "deft" enough to market his protest the way he managed to do

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1723509/8444288
            </a>
            with no support and actively negative top down concern trolling from what is supposed to be the forum of record for pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been accused of not being "graceful" about these issues by the OP, and I concur.

            We are not gracefully going to let this movement be hijacked by coddled fear based power-bottoms effecting a stifling of our energy and momentum.  Kindly flair the sticky inacurrate or remove to regular submissions and restore our executive summary for newcomers, who we hope to welcome during next weekend's protest.

             <p>
              Since I sent that to you Sound of Silence decided to take the sticky to task meticulously.  Go to the thread and sort comments by "new" or "top".  Please use your upvoat and downvoat.  I don't care about them but the mods put great store.  Downvoating the sticky will only help.  Thanks sorry this sounds like a PSA

            You forgot the best parts!  1. He was POISONED by the bad guyz!!1!!!  2. The bad guyz killed his best friend to shut him up but in defiance of their scare tactics and to honor the memory of his friend he begged EVEN HARDER for donations.  3. Twitter and YouTube are EVIL so he's now going to gab and vid.me exclusively.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you can believe he said he would protest
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo4746XZgw8">
             this John Mayer song
            </a>
            just to get some buzz?  What did John Mayer ever do to him?!

            <em>
             That last one was sarcasm for those that don't get it (especially since David's announced protest of gravity happened before the song was released).

             I appreciate your strong response.  I want to ask if you have time to look at this same thread and sort for "new" comments as some of us have pushed back on this sticky fairly strongly.  I feel this was a propaganda piece not a mistake by mods because they refuse to edit, modify, flair as inaccurate or take down even though proven inaccurate about the first protest.  Sound Of Silence has done major work dissecting this propaganda effort.  thanks for taking a look. the "top" comment was also edited to show support for this weekends protest.

              well , i hope allot of people feel the same as i do. but it will take time for most of them still have this "need" for
the same corrupt institutes to bring "peace &amp; justice" . everything is rotten , not only the justice system , but the food , the water (oceans) , the people ....
so we the childeren dont need anyone or anything for justice , we need to stand up together. that's what we need to use this website for.
to organize ourselves &amp; standup . although this website advertises with : have your say &amp; no censorship , while actually allot of posts are being deleted / moved
so allot of people will not read these posts. this is done because this place is an exellent control tool. thats why i believe several folks here are working
with or together with the pedos , secret services, etc. you see , "they" need the help of the poor people , although they have supercomputers monitoring every form of
communication 24/7 , with the best pattern recognition programs , NEVER  did they stumble upon any trace of pedophelia or humantrafficking ? really ? 
as long the narrative is along the lines of ; yeah justice we demand it ! and we apply it using the same corrupt people in the system , its ok , &amp; posts are not deleted or moved.
so what do you need me to do ? ask people they grow a pair ? stop being scared  of eachother ? try convince them they have to take part in a demonstartion ?

                weird that someone cares about points &amp; up or downvotes , no ? if its true its true , if not , not.
               </p>
               <p>
                i ve been sharing my strong opinion allot , only a handfull of people here are sharing the same opinion ,
almost all my posts have been removed / censored . im getting tired of repeating myself.
im getting tired of reading the same posts , posted over and over again. old news posted as new news etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                my opinion which is based on thruth , should be more then enough to let people see what needs to be done.
i dont believe in this voting thing , its another control thing , truth does not need control ! 
but i will see what i can do for you .

                   the failure of law enforcement to do their job and throw it to the public to do, all while they collect their salaries is one of the meta-infuriating things about this whole business.  So I'm right there with you.  I only try to remember I have not walked a mile in their shoes.   Accountability is definitely needed.

                    it takes a special mindset to want to do the job of "law enforcement". or any other kind of job with "power " over people
(priests/lawyers/judges/ceo's,etc all have potential to be psychopath ! yess even president trump !)
they dont want to throw it to the public for "help" or "backup" , they do it so the can "restore" the lost "trust" people have in government.
this is a very important detail ; this whole  case is the best weapon against slavery. thats why we need worldwide protests.

            I just do not see how we help anyone by being divisive, and it sounds like this is going to be divisive. That is why I did not go to the Beyond Borders event; I am well-aware of their ties to the Clinton Foundation but they pretend to care about children and many people (libtards) blew off the Podesta Emails. And we certainly do not need to be affiliated al la the MSM with some guy predicting the end of the world (or whatever) in two weeks; that just makes us look like crackpots.
I will just have to contact some people and get some guidance as to whether or not this is a good idea.

            Please keep up the good work fellas.  Please do not get discouraged.  So many of you all have done so much and will never get the recognition for the hard work you are putting in.  The work you all are doing means a lot to me and my family.  Don't give up!  I think history will remember this investigation and hopefully something good can come from all of this chaos.

            Hmmm. I did not know Titus Frost is going to be there. I plan to attend, but talk about awkward! He has sent out YouTube videos blasting David Seaman as a "#Zionist shill"; how on earth are they going to come together for this event? I am also turned off by the guy who thinks he "feels" something is going to happen in two weeks. 
SHIT! You know, we NEED to come together, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to do that, but given this information....
IDK.

             You'll appreciate this little exchange with the author of this "wrong side of history" sticky - at first I was just asking about a neg opinion submission about the march, then I decided to ask Vindicator to flair her own post that sticky as "Accuracy In Question" and it got more real from there -
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1723509/8469021">

            </p>
            <p>
             You are right, this place owes the organizers of the first march a real apology.  Letting that pass without the mods recieving any flak for that hit piece would be a real disservice to every single person that donated to the effort of the first march.

              To Vindicator** - you seem familliar with sororities - I am not. **I stand by my statement, your piece was a propaganda hit piece and it has done more to sow dissent and low morale here than anything anyone else has done or said here yet.

            Actuallyy Anrifa is falling apart. They have decided it was a farce and many have already left. Eriks march was cancelled. If Seaman has the antichrist in his march, its a bad choice. I suggest you guys could do a better job, so why dont you? The more the public is shaken up the more allies you have. You wont fight a war because you are afraid of the opposition? Wow. Wasnt the point to make opposition fearful?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes they will try flag attempts, censorship, defamation of character, threats, theatrics. It can only help your cause bringing the rats out of their holes so everyone can see the infestation. At least Erik and David are strong enough to do something besides play detective and wait like I do... waiting and wishing to God these freaks are stopped soon . They get my respect for that as a mother of a victimized daughter in a pedo gate pervert ring in Texas.

             No...it was held yesterday with a low turnout but with a certain positive effect. There are a couple of threads up showing videos. Some think it was unhelpful. I think they did a fairly good job of standing up to ridicule and sticking to the "investigate" message. I'm actually glad it was small, given the confrontational setup chosen. But from what I saw, they handled it well. Not a bad appetizer for the protest on the 25th, IMHO.

                LOL, yah.  I hope nobody tells you that I've been part of this since the beginning and David came around about a month later when he figured out he could profit from it.  But whatever, I'm sure you're waiting with baited breath for David's next delusional moment that everybody is out to get him and only your donations can save him.

                    The fact that you felt compelled to make a derogatory comment to me FIRST just for the mere mentioning of David Seaman tells me and everybody else here more than we need to know.  You've either been here since the beginning and know what's up or you're a late to the party poser who "learns" from opportunistic idiots like David Seaman.  Trust me, you've said enough.

                   <p>
                    But congrats on using the term "shill."  You CLEARLY are well informed and a MAJOR contributor if you can throw that word around half-assed without a shred of evidence.  Congrats!  Gold star for you!

            Thank you for this post.  While I would not consider myself a Pedogate researcher in that I have not added anything but occasional  comments to postings on this and other sites, I have read and watched extensively online about Pizza/Pedogate since mid-October, thanks to the efforts of people like you.   I feel, for me personally, that I should show up in person in support of all the  researchers who have tried, and who keep trying, to expose the ugly truth.   It is perhaps ironic that I first learned of Pizzagate through my two sons, ages 25 and 35.  Each of them had texted me a YouTube video about it on separate days.  My youngest son has off from work next Saturday.  DC is a 5-6 hour drive;  I am sure he would be game for the road trip, possibly even my oldest son, too, if he can get off work.   Frankly, I feel compelled to attend, but frightened to go alone.  Yet I will proudly go if one or both of my sons go with me.  My sign will say something about MAPs:  Moms Against Pedos.

            They want to show off for the Media.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they don't exist in the Media , they feel they disappear.

           <p>
            They feel only if we "show them" and the Media pays attention can it be fixed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless marches are a waste of time and energy.. Millions came out against the War, you never heard about it. 
Millions called in 50 xs a day to Congress. It did nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            You must think "out of the box " And that means smart and savvy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Media will never do it for you. They are paid to cover up the crimes.

            It's not necessarily the "right" thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you march in the wrong direction it could make things worse, not better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actions should be fruitfull. All the Liberal Activist Rallys / Marches are for "feel good" reason.. emotional , psychological reasons of the demonstrators.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even it it does nothing they want to do it? "I can't stand by. " "I can't stand it"
           </p>
           <p>
            That's stupid. You have to think and act smart to fix this.

             Good Interviews From Today's Protest #1
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of people didn't show up but this interview was conducted fairly and shows the level of total ignorance of the average Joe citizen regarding pedogate. Still the pedogate spokespeople were well spoken and answered all the regular questions about isn't this debunked in the media, if there were something to it the police would investigate, etc type questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you facebook it would be nice to comment and give these independent reporters some props or criticism, whichever you feel.
           </p>
           <p>
            At least they showed up and asked questions which puts them ahead of 95% of all media today and the PTB here at voat.

             I agree. I felt much better after watching Neal Wolf, the March 25th organizer, talking to people. He was the guy in the orange jacket. He was calm, straightforward, persistent, and patient, even when being laughed at and intimidated. He just kept calling them out on their 'smirking' and repeating his message to investigate. And he had brochures with pictures. Wish he'd skipped the "hotard" intsa, though. That is easily interpreted as not referring to the child.

              (Today's March - What A Scam!)    should be removed as it is absolutely unsupported by any factual evidence.

              Misleading, inaccurate title alone should be grounds for moderation..  I pinged earlier about this and no one responded as per usual these days.

               See the reply I just made to your comment in that thread. Unfortunately for us mods, the protests and our various attempts to raise awareness of potential manipulation in light of Vault7 and "DHS Insider" leaks raised a fresh army of zombie shills. Mods have been hard pressed to keep up with shitposts on NEW, and answer questions from legit users trying to figure out how to make their removed posts comply with submission guidelines. Inboxes are overflowing. Sometimes it takes a few days for us to get to them all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Camping out in comments telling mods they suck and narking on users whose sourced opinion you don't like in order to try to get it removed is petty, rude, unhelpful and makes you look like a shill trying to hurt the morale of a group already struggling in that department. I've half a mind to organize a mod vacation for a week and let you enjoy what this subverse would be like if we let the

                BTW your propaganda hit piece Sticky should be flaired for accuracy as well, as you completely failed regarding protest number one - it was not only very honest, but also peaceful.  You should be ashamed of yourself, and actually, I know you are somewhere in your bowels where your conscience still resides.
               </p>
               <p>
                Formally requesting you flair your Sticky "Accuracy In Question" because it is deeply questioned now all over the internet where PG is discussed - you guys certainly jumped the shark with that one and your "Vindicator" name will never be the same again.   Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just telling you "to your face" what everyone is whispering behind your back. .

                 Spoken like a stuck up, back-stabbing sorority girl, VieBleu; you are the only one whispering behind anyone's back. You clearly did not actually read the post. Or perhaps your reading comprehension just isn't there. Everything I linked to was accurate, and who is to say that this post calling attention to it is not part of the reason things didn't go sideways? You've provided no evidence of either "propaganda" or a "hit piece," as usual. Just more VieBleu cowardly shitting all over the forum, trying to make people feel bad.

                 Are you retarded VieBlue, or just entitled and arrogant? Do you not know that all the active mods here were users just like everyone else? We have no control whatsoever over the development side of Voat. Literally, none. You are a poisonous person, as anyone reading through

                 You want opinions and comments you don't like banned. You call people whom you disagree with shills. You make unsourced accusations constantly and seek out disgruntled users in an attempt to undermine this community. And you pose as someone who cares about pizzagate. You lack grace, discernment, respect for others and magnanimity. You have tantrums when your bitching isn't responded to as quickly as you like.

                  But you do have control over community annoucements and you should have told everyone this was happeneing.  you still do nothing to inform people about a very important component of the forum, and are deaf and dumb to the obvious problems it presents.  You have total control over all of that, and yet for days and days it is not addressed.

                  I didn't understand when I first came here that this was a total free speech forum, because the people here did NOTHING to prepare any information or direction.  Thus I wrongly assumed that like most forums bigotry, racism and homophobia and also vigilante justice would be grounds for removal of posts.  Once I was rudely schooled by Crensch and KevDude who are both universally reviled as you are well aware, I never asked for any deletion of posts or comments again.  So you are bringing up an issue that happened months ago at this point and is not relevant.  Also I never asked for banning, so that is a lie.

                  I don't seek anyone out, we bump into each other all the time just by being here.  And nothing undermines the community more than every misstep or planned move made to weaken it such as your demoralizing sticky post bashing the protest movement, taking away the 100 subverse comment points, and the constantly terrible modding that happens here.

                  I have been extremely graceful under the pressure here but you guys expect people to kowtow to you when you complain constantly about your jobs, your lack of pay, your lack of vacations, how hard it is for any of you to make a decision, how you have no power to do anything, how terrible people are to you and on and on and on.  Everything except just moderate reasonably.  I am discerning, I am capable and I have been way too nice as have many others.

                  Because pizzagate/pedogate is important, this place needs a watchdog, and every time mods turn a trusting and naive person who comes here to help into a calloused and angry fighter, like YinYangMom today as just one example, or nosy, a journalist, or many many others, someone has to be around to help them understand the duplicity they've experienced.  If you shape up, fine.  You'll see a difference in me.  So consider me a reflection of your ugly actions, you being every single mod that does not commit to moving this forum forward.  That's why.

                  I would like to say that as far as free speech goes, Voat does seem to stick to that principle no matter what.   I find the goings on of Voat management to be really reprehensible in many ways, but I am given the opportunity to dissent vociferously.  That makes us, for better or worse, a community with at least one underlying priniciple.  I have to give this website thanks and props for that.

            Surely you realize that voat is compromised right?  The mods on this forum are the self-appointed arbiters of information.  We only know what they show us to know.  Especially now that we can't easily search the forums.  (Yes, I'm aware it can be done, but newbs and the average person don't so they've made it impossible for the average person to investigate the boards,  which we all know is full of good info in spite of the mass amounts of shilling.) Like any effective form of psychological manipulation, they pretend to be hands off while actively directing the narrative.

            I'm not sure how to go grass roots on this.  How hard is it for someone who knows what they are doing to buy a website solely for discussion? I'm a Web idiot so I don't know.  But if you get one,  post it here and we can follow. Not allowing a protest to be "advertised" (or now even searched for) is equivalent to living in a nanny state. (Btw, ever heard all press is good press? Soros has, which is part of how this country got into this mess in the first place. It works.) Unfortunately we already live with a sick, pervo nanny. We don't need another one.

             thanks for this comment. Some have felt that pushback against this propaganda sticky was in order.  If you can, would you please look at a decontruction of the propaganda sticky by going to this thread and sorting your comments for "new".  Also the "top"comment has been edited to reflect the new environment, but the mods won't budge on their smear campaign about the first protest and there is an ongoing disagreement over their handling of it.  thx.

             Other fora already exist.  There's steemit, which has had a good deal of PG activity in the past (not sure about lately), and someone here started their own just like you suggested, a couple of months ago.  It looked OK at first but I didn't keep going back.  Voat remains my #1 PG stop, at least for now.  If it becomes unusable then people will definitely migrate (again).

            It's (((them))) getting out in front of something so as to limit the impact. Same thing they do with everything, same thing they did with t-party, occupy, anything else real youve ever seen pop up and as we can see, the Trumpians... swerving it back into the GOP, which of course was already hijacked before any of us were born...

            I  think VOAT and  the Mods  fucked  up  on  this big time-it  isn't perfect,  but it  sure as  hell is publicity that  this  movement  needs  and  is  part  of the momentum-I have very  serious questions about the  MODS taking this stance, and as  far as I am  concerned  it  lends  credence to the allegation   VOAT has  been  seriously  compromised

             yes well said!  there is an effort at calling on this malarky.  Please take a look at the pushback from myself and Sound of Silence and others.   hit the thread and the button for "new" comments.  YYM also edited her "top" comment.

             I find it interesting you think we have taken a "stance". We deliberately did NOT take a stance -- the goal was to draw people's attention to data and let people decide what approach to take for themselves. It's interesting that us asking people to think for themselves was a red flag for you.

             By advertising the protest in the sidebar, we were implying that it had been vetted and blessed, even though we knew nothing about it. That's a misleading message, so we stopped sending it. Our attempts to vet the events in order to be able to advertise them led to the findings contained in the post.

            I agree completely with the analysis and actions taken. PizzaGate mods have my respect and encouragement to follow the straight path and not get pushed and pulled off it by third parties with their own agendas.

            What are the chances Trump would actually Tweet about it? I assume he has fixed his timeline for disclosure. It would be better to coordinate with announcements of indictments to fill the news block about the charges.
Of course, how, when the CIA can see everything.

            Maybe others could go and warn the demonstrators of the dangers. Maybe divert them to go meet Trump or something.

            I think determining who our genuine allies (in positions of power) are in seeking justice for Pedogate, and putting (polite) pressure on them to move forward with the investigation is a way better plan. I help to run a conspiracy group on Facebook, and even still, I find myself regularly checking my rearview mirror when driving. I look both ways before leaving my home. You know that these people are everywhere. I am in no way on the level of someone like Roger Stone, who they definitely tried to either hurt, or kill, yesterday, but I ~am~ an outspoken critic of the Clinton Crime Cartel, and the evils these assholes perpetuate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, back to the point, I think that the marches are doing nothing but setting yourself up for retaliation. The snipers and FBI surveillance of Occupy Wall Street comes to mind. The protesters were putting red flags above their own heads and drawing attention to themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite my advocacy of the investigation for Pedogate, I don't need any more paranoia, just or otherwise, or worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've already told those close to me that if I was found dead, it wouldn't be from suicide, just in case.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really wish arrests would start, though. It's frustrating playing the waiting game. It seems like it's to the point where the buzz about the topic is wearing off, and that's bad. Keeping the conversation going keeps the hope for justice alive.

            Demand for answers from Authorities / President Trump on FACTUAL EVIDENCE found by concerned people who were vigorously researching the DNC email dump released by Wikileaks and found strange emails using what seemed to be a coded language. The researching of emails eventually led to the coined term for this unprecedented citizen investigation now known as PIZZAGATE.
           </p>
           <p>
            PIZZAGATE / PEDOGATE is not just a "USA citizen" investigation, it's not a DNC witch hunt, NO!! What the findings are bringing to light is that the problem of Human Trafficking, Pedofillia and a Satanic Culture seems to be running rampant across all forms of power positions, cultures who condone and or religions who are complicit or turn away the issue. The Pedofillia aspect is a Human Societal issue that needs to be addressed as is the Human Trafficking problem. The thing is all the positions and overseer's of these issues are CORRUPT and seem to be complicit on the same crimes they're supposed to be eradicating or keeping in check-from our society. Again, to be clear it is the PEOPLE of all parts of this Earth who are genuinely asking 'What's really going on here...on this Earth and why are the elected officials/authorities who are supposed to stop this blowing smoke in regards to ALL questions being asked about PIZZAGATE / PEDOGATE!
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the most important findings of PIZZAGATE is the OCCULT aspect!

            The 3/18 &amp; 3/25 Protests need to just be about what we as a people /human race are concerned about concerning all things PIZZAGATE/PEDOGATE and what we want done. NO VIOLENCE......NO VIGALANTE JUSTICE....Yet......

           <p>
            AGAIN going against the grain is going to hurt and feel uncomfortable and is always going to have opposition, especially against this enemy. But we the people must always think positive or have faith that WE CAN AND WILL BE UNITED AS ONE HUMAN RACE TO CONFRONT, BATTLE AND END THIS CURRENT DARK RULE.

            It reminds me of the Presidential election -  surprising everyone, the true will of the people in numbers can overwhelm all the negativity.   Keep strong everyone, and stand up for what you believe is right.   There is strength in numbers of caring people standing together.

            Never forget Orwell.
           </p>
           <p>
            In his novel 1984, the prevailing slogan of the party in power is "War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength".  In other words, true meaning, or truth, has been turned upside down to confuse, misdirect and control.
           </p>
           <p>
            The goal of the INGSOC in Orwell's narrative is to achieve total control over the people and, more importantly, over their minds."Freedom is slavery" also acts as a subconscious discouragement for anyone who might consider seeking freedom, whilst the last part of the slogan, "Ignorance is strength," encourages the people to accept as fact everything that The Party tells them, without using rational thinking. Believe and never question!

             Just remember they have the 'fast response teams' they were using during the election. They've known our plans for a while, and they will in all likelihood turn it into a farce to make us look bad. I'd recommend anyone who goes and sees it devolve into something that is not 100% guaranteed to help, try something else

             New phenomenon in Paris streets : groups of stray morrocan glue sniffing kids (most under 16) that came all the way through spain. They seem to be into prostitution too and the social services say they can handle the case, well, well...

            Very much agree with the assessment.
We should also recall that in Belgium after 300,000 or more came out into the streets for the March to support the children and the investigation -- spurred on (as I recall it) by the removal of the most effective investigator on the case -- that a new media campaign was waged against the children and the parents -- including a very intelligent young woman who had gone through these experiences which included having witnessed at least one murder of a young girl -- and the public then lost their confidence in everything they were doing.
The MSM turned the public against the families and this witness and it basically became a witch hunt against them instead of against the cover up going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best thing that can be done imo is to cause more of the public to become curious about what is going on and have them begin to explore the subject of Pedo-gate/Pizzagate on their own.  There are still many citizens in US who sadly will believe a "fake news" campaign.
Reaching the public isn't an easy job but I think one way to do it is perhaps to ask each of us who is informed to support the investigations and the children by wearing a white flower or emblem which someone might ask about so that anyone who is unfamiliar with this long-standing scandal can begin to understand in its entirety -- that is, going back 50 years or more with three investigations which have been stopped.
See:  Detective Jim Rothstein in interview with Jim Fetzer -
Rothstein also comments at the last of the interview that the military is too little mentioned as being involved in this trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's link to the interview
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnT5amf6Ys">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnT5amf6Ys
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the Watergate break in.  Also, LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And, just another aside on Watergate as a reminder that at the time our Congress would have known that there are TWO COPIES of every White House tape made by the Secret Service.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially, this was another example of government investigating itself which we see over and again here and with other countries.

              Most citizens understand human trafficking - sexual human enslavement -- and that we have trade routes coming through the US.  And they know that something is very wrong due to corruption of our government.
              <br/>
              They are also very aware now that in general the usual MSM sources can't be trusted.
They are looking for alternative news.  And finding it.

              300,000 people would only be about 6,000 knowledgeable people in every state.  Not much.

              Think everyone should be wearing a white flower pin/or actual flower in a WHITE movement.  Would cause people to ask Q's.

              No. I'm going to disbelieve his claim that he is the anti-Christ because if he was he wouldn't be trying to shill a book. He'd be slowly taking over the world and not exposing Pizzagate. If that needs to be explained to you, please don't talk to me. Crazy people get tedious.

            Aye! Agreed.  Very well articulated argument. An ever present omnipotent specter arose in my gut when I saw the advertisements for that 'event'. Who in their right mind would step directly into that den of snakes, on their turf, with the kind of egregore that exits in Washington DC? The place is an occult city from it's inception, and if the character of those people is anything similar to the 'we'll burn you out of your houses' type like Luke Kuhn who hangs out at Comet Pizza and likes to plan violent protests, combined with that snarky, arrogant and snobbish DC elitism, the ONLY way to fight these people is through humiliation and exposure from a distance because all I see coming out of an event like this is violence. These types of assholes will come out in droves with their v-necks, gorsuch and nordstrom winter jackets just to shove their pretend normal in your faces. I can just see the smug (dick lipped) condescension in Alefantis' face just thinking about the protesters that plan on showing up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've never heard a more dire warning from an insider as 'flag weather' - better heed that one urgently because you fucking know these people wouldn't hesitate to try and make an example out more than a few of us.

            I hate hearing that David semen is one of the front man for this protest I don't trust him one bit. He wrote a book on how to get us no matter what. He is hungry for attention  SOB. Also he has been pushing the bit coin like crazy and who is behind that it is funded by Soros. I think you would be foolish to trust him to lead this.

            Surter is obviously and nut job. I may be naive, but if Gallant and Surter would cause any problems at either today these protests, can't they be suppressed with a combined effort of multiple people like yourselves? If this really is a people's movement, all you would need to do is have a bunch of people prevent either of them from leading, speaking, or being caught in any spotlight. Obviously in a non aggressive way. If even 10 people attending these protests can agree to simply follow them in a non threatening way, it can really have an impact in preventing any issues. Examples of actions that can be taken can include: Preventing them from using a mic or any other voice amplifying device when possible, stand around or beside them if they are in a speaking situation, overwhelm media coverage on them by overpowering their voices with your own, passively direct them away from situations that would harm the integrity of the protests, etc...Obviously people can use their own discretion when deciding what is appropriate or not, but if Surter starts taking about that antichrist crap, a small group of people can easily shut him down quite passivly. Anybody else who takes a instructional or speaking position can be held accountable on the spot. If there are any journalist or  a news coverage, you should never allow just one person to speak or take the spotlight, especially if you don't know who they are. It should always be handled with a calm, intelligent, collective group of people, and keep each other's emotions in check. I think these protests can have a huge impact in terms of exposure, and if people have the motivation and will to go, it should not be jepordized or forfeit. Just my thoughts anyways.

            I'd like to float the idea of some ways we can engage in a peaceful protest:
           </p>
           <p>
            -White ribbon pins,
           </p>
           <p>
            -Place sticky notes with a targeted messages in random public places (#pedogate, #whiteribbon, #BustElitePedophiles)
           </p>
           <p>
            -White balloons in public places
           </p>
           <p>
            -A decent, non-partisan website to link to for those who see and inquire about our message, also to keep our effort on-message and on-track.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is anyone else feeling inspired to jump in with ideas?
           </p>
           <p>
            Violent protests in the streets will get us NOWHERE with busting the elite pedophiles and ending the suffering of children.  We have to stay a step ahead of the Soros-organized counter movement.  WTH can they do about us raising awareness with a white pin movement and sticky notes?

             I really like the idea of using the color white for pins, balloons, etc. Was that your idea or is that already a thing?
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe you could make a post suggesting the movement adopt that color.

              It hit me as I was reading YingYangMom's reply, talking about protesters releasing white balloons.

              White seems like the perfect color for the pedogate movement - fighting for the innocence of children, fighting against dark evil forces.

               Exactly! It is the perfect color for that very reason. I don't usually go for pins and stuff like that but the perfection of the use of that color has me kind of excited. I would break with tradition and actually wear a pin in this case. In fact, I think I may go get some white balloons and start placing them around with a very simple message of some sort directing folks to investigate.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for the idea. I really hope this catches on.

            Thank you! You are correct. Having two events so close to each other is to minimize turnout. It happened with the TeaParty. The second year there were two marches in DC, one week apart. The second one was Glen Beck's. So neither had as great a turnout as it could have been. It diluted the movement and I believe it was done on purpose. People might try to attend one or the other but not both.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also interesting that the March 18th organizer just joined twitter in March 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            The March 25th event doesn't sound like they got good speakers. It should have been better planned. I've never heard of feeding the protestors before. If it was a large crowd, there's no way they could feed the protestors, so I'm assuming they expect a small crowd, which will hurt the movement more than help.
           </p>
           <p>
            The event should be planned a lot longer. We should have law enforcement to be speakers who specialize in taking down this trash and we need someone who can lead with a great reputation and interested in pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was thinking about people like Mike Flynn Jr and James Woods, someone who's already involved in PizzaGate. Or perhaps someone who already has a stellar reputation. We don't want this to be political, so perhaps someone in law enforcement, but not compromised.

             This is the best idea I've seen. I think both events should be cancelled &amp; reformed into one big event like this sometime in the future  (maybe May 1st).

            Just my 2 cents in the matter.  If protest are to be done they should be about the children and to stop human trafficking.  Getting the major players in PG involved with make it political and muddy up the waters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make it about something that any rational person can get on board with and to protest against it would be virtually impossible.  This would raise awareness and not make the players involved seem crazy to non redpillers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes it seems that people are more worried about taking down the big fish and less with saving innocent lives which is what it should be all about.  Get people to look into this horrible crime and the chips with fall where they may.

              Not to toot my own horn but it would be quite genius if you could get all protesters to agree to this.  Then you could pick out shills because they would be the ones spouting the PG narrative.  A little reverse psychology at its finest!

            Those who fear what the Left is going to do will never do anything but sit behind their computers, the left is going to be there to disrupt because, that is what they do, they are the enemy, they are irrational thinkers, and irrational thinkers will stop at nothing to strike fear into the opposition....I suggest those who fear a DC march plan a march on the capital of their state, I believe that is a good idea for all of us as well, make a day of nationwide protest on every capital across the country.

             yes!  please look at the pushback that we have towards this now out of date negative propaganda sticky.  Please go to this thread and sort comments by "new" there is a dissection of this mod sponsored fear posting and also a request to mark it "Accuracy In Question" as they were completely wrong about the 1st post.  Also the "top" comment has been edited for more support for the 2nd march.  thx if you can use your votes to support.

              I disagree with your assessment......there is no proof of that, I have watched the you tube videos from the guy putting this together, and he seems very sincere.....who is to say who WE is?.....this is a united front, not an ego trip, I know better then you, finger pointing front......now the Left really loves that attitude.

               Why would someone set up a protest a week before an already scheduled protest for the same cause? The best answer I've heard to this question is to dilute the numbers like they did to TeaParty protests. What other logical explanation could there be?

                Because many are tired of sitting behind their computers to bring awareness to Pizzagate/Pedogate on voat, that time has passed, they are ready for action!......ready to be seen and heard.......those afraid of what the irrational left is going to do or say will never succeed, people are ready to do more then just sit on their butts and type.....we are talking about the suffering and murder of Children here!

                 You didn't answer the question. I understand people's desire to protest, I have the same desire. I tried to get the rules changed here to allow "meta" posts calling for protest and for complaints about mods. So don't try to paint me with your bullshit.

                  I answered the question, and it seems to me all you want to do is poop poop those wanting to protest, and make them out as the enemy, so we can agree to disagree.

            Yes, I have felt uneasy about this whole thing.  They will try to whip our people into a frenzy.  Some people will be able to stay calm and ignore, others will be so zealous in their cause and tired of waiting for action that they will be coerced  into going wild.  This is an accident waiting to be manipulated.

             You're absolutely right. I mean, most of us are pretty pissed off about this already. Add to that the fact that it seems to many that not enough is yet being done and it's a powder keg just waiting to be lit. It won't take many strong words to get people good and riled up. There is certainly no better issue to get angry and fight for.

              Yes, and at that kind of venue, in the heat of passion, it will be hard to tell who is one of us or one of them.  I am staying home because I think this will serve us no good really. I also think we should wait until things break and then take the bull by the horns.

            He sounds crazy...why would they pick him to speak.
He certainly makes this side of the story look a lot less credible.  Whoever brought him in made a huge mistake.
I can't believe David Seaman agreed to speak with him being there.

              People can now make pictures of David Seaman on popsicle sticks like those that were made when people supported Edward Snowden and can have the words "JEWS SUPPORT PIZZAGATE" or "JEWS STAND WITH PIZZAGATE".  Lets hope someone makes a few thousand of them and brings them to the protest because DAVID SEAMAN IS THE FACE OF PIZZAGATE!
             </p>
             <p>
              David Seaman needs all of our unwavering support during this troubled time and maybe we could even have vigil candlelight walk for David on the 23rd down Connecticut avenue?

             Please take a moment and check out the pushback against this mod action, we have asked for this sticky to be modified in light of the fact the first protest came off fine, and finally someone dissected their piece as the propaganda hit piece that it is.   Hit the thread and sort for "new" comments.  Also the "top" comment was edited.  thanks for your initial comment right here.

              Insert wackjobs at the forefront, co-ordinate bad chants, ridiculous behaviour, set up fights with anti-fa, start shouting racist/homophobic/ personal slurs, anything to discredit us. This cannot be a win for us. If it came off perfectly, the media just wouldn't cover it. But its far more likely they will infiltrate and direct it, and make us look like lunatics. We need mass dissemination, but we need to be smart about it, over computers, a letter posting campaign... that way tptb can't infiltrate..imo

            Listen..we are FAR more effective behind the scenes and raising awareness...we will have MANY protests to attend down the road when trials etc start..and they probably wont be protests but signs of support for prosecution, etc.  This is just beginning folks and we have a long period of DILIGENT WATCHFULNESS ahead.

I think that if Gallant really cared about the cause, he would add his gofundme money to the protest on the 25th and join forces with those organisers. Now is not the time for grandstanding or self-promotion. The cause should come before any individual's needs or wishes.

            This post is complete misinformation from the resident disinfo moderator, Vindicator. The March 18 protest is possibly an organic "good" protest. It could be a setup, I don't know. The March 25th protest is clearly the controlled opposition shill protest. Notice how Vindicator states the exact opposite, how the March 25th protest is the "safe" one.

            This is the perfect opportunity for them to make us look even worse and ruin any hope we have for bringing all of this to light. We need to maintain control over our public image. I never thought I'd be putting these particular words in a sentence together, but I almost wish we could have some kind of Pizzagate PR person/team. I honestly feel like if we organized structurally (similar to a large business) with different departments, it would help us a lot. Marketing/outreach could handle trying to get more people's attention, legal could make sure we don't do anything illegal and cover our backs if necessary, PR could handle our image, etc. Right now we're spread out all over the place and all we're doing is finding new info and posting it on a forum that is really only read by other investigators. Most of society doesn't take us seriously. We have no means to fight back as we are now. We need to organize. That's the only way to keep this thing going.

            At first I thought one of the demonstrations was a good idea.  The more I thought about it and the more data I got, the more I thought both were going to be infiltrated at the organizer level and at the street level.  I don't want to lend my voice when I can't control how it's being directed.  Further, we know that MSM will control the narrative via CNN, Washington Post, The Daily Show, Salon.com, Bill Maher and the usual editors of reality.    The people we need to reach are still in their echo chamber and will have their beliefs confirmed by edited footage of the demonstration.
           </p>
           <p>
            We do need action, but IMO effective efforts should be directed at further research of the conditions, laws and institutions that create and protect PG pedos, and developing state and federal action plans.

              Right but this is a fight and that's that happens in a fight anyway. I think there should be a peaceful protest. They are the media, they are going to try to curve ball us weather we stay in here on voat, it goes to mainstream or it goes to the streets. They are going to try to make us look bad no matter what we try to do, doesn't matter if you ask me. More awareness needs to be spread one way, or another. Fuck being scared of this. Time to see this as a battle and make moves, they aren't going to be made for us. I hope we all know this by now. Edit: besides they have already made protests outside of comet ping pong, fuck we care about them spinning a protest? Zit on your ass, it should be, my friend.

               Ignore the Media. It's a trap. You can't jujitsu them. They are too monolithic. Think of the head of Medusa - it turns you to stone.

                Absolutely love your Medusa quote, brilliant. 
I meant us bringing attention to this cause I a battle because no God damned person is doing their jobs to do a damn thing about it except regular people to expose this shit.
The protest isn't to win a battle. Bringing this all to light everywhere is the battle. Any way to do that should be people's goals. People are still going to protest either way because that's just what some people do. But like how do we get this on mainstream platforms or to those that just have never heard of it? At the very least some people see fucked up photos and think there is something there, or learn about it as something completely new out on the street. But who knows maybe protest isn't the best way. I don't know what the best way is.

                 This is a disinfo, misdirection war.  OP was completely wrong in all assumptions and slurs about the organizer of the 1st march.  The fear an inaction of ivory tower mods can catch like a nasty cold.  Remain true to YOUR instincts.  The "do nothing" people are on the wrong side of history and part of the problem.

                  Yeah I'm definitely not trying to do nothing, even something with smear is better than just staying quiet. BLM may be shit to some people, but so many people still know about it either way. Whether their protests win or fail in peoples eyes, you can't doubt almost everyone is aware of them.

                   Yep - Podesta's lawyer certainly made tracks to the first one.  You know he was told to go - lawyers don't show up to speak at protests unless they are getting at least billable hours.

                    Damn didn't know that. But one of their leaders was caught in a underaged teen relationship so who knows if thats connected to podesta? Did his people have anything to do with that leader?

               Protests dont do shit.
Protests are easily infiltrated.
Keep chipping away at the trust of the media, keep your grounded one to one conversations going. Keep digging. Times have changed, protests dont work. Action does.

                I didn't say we need to stop digging. But protests spread awareness. Especially when everyone on all fronts everywhere else is censoring it.

                 Oh yeah thats worked out great for the tea party, BLM, the occupy wall st, antifa, and literally any protest movement these days. Why do the same tired tactics that a) virtue signal, b) will be coopted, c) is not effective
                </p>
                <p>
                 Protests worked when the MSM was the only form of communication, like I said a 1000 sane people can reach a hell of a lot more people than a million retards with slogans and a cardboard sign.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ask yourself how did shias little demo work out? /pol/ used the same tactics the establishment uses to shut down anyone they disagree with... /pol/ is just better at it.

                  They at the very least spread awareness where otherwise it wouldn't have been done because twitter, facebook and MSM and other mainstream platforms are tight knit at keeping this info out. And circlejerking about in just a single forum and gab about this shit isn't exactly helping us soak more numbers, I'm just all for getting sjw type people to see this shit. But I'm for any ideas that help spread it to people that just wouldn't know otherwise.

                   Where ever appropriate, mention happenings to people... like say holy shit did you see that.. another senator arrested on child porn charges... or wow I hear there could be some more information coming out of that anthony weiner child porn case... or .. isnt it strange people who are investigating haitian child trafficking keep mysteriously dying...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Talk about enough happenings and more likely someones going to start talking to other people about it...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Compile information, be aware, talk to people about it...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This goes deep, but as long as we can keep digging and getting more people around us asking questions the better

                    Oh no I never saw it as a solution that will wrap up pizzagate or anything. Just another thing that ultimately helps spread some awareness. But those are all great ways to bring stuff up to people, I haven't had extreme luck with it as people just write me off immediately most the time when I mention it to them. It's probably how I'm doing it and maybe ordering stuff wrong, I don't know.
But I do still have to write up how I will tell others as I don't think I can just start with anything, probably start with art and stuff you're mentioning. I agree though.

                     I suggest reading up on some light marketing fundamentals, propaganda fundamentals, journalism fundamentals, persuasion fundamentals etc, not because I am suggesting we make and use propaganda or marketing but rather learn about how messages are crafted. If you can craft your message cleanly and succinctly you will find out your success rate will go through the roof

            Great discernment, excellent analysis. I commend you for your wisdom and loyalty to the case. If I may suggest, I believe the 18th March should be cancelled altogether. Stick with the 25th and ONLY protest in a peaceful manner near the WH. I remember the Dutroux related "Marche Blanche" that hundreds of thousands of Belgians took to the streets. It was amazing. And let thousands of white balloons go up in the air in honour of all the victims of child trafficking, sex slavery and SRA. It can only be done in a peaceful manner. It's the only way to be heard and to make a positive impression on the rest of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Since the first protest was fine and was a really good effort despite the fears of violent protests and MSM smearing, I strongly suggest that we
            <strong>
             double our efforts and SUPPORT
            </strong>
            the March 25th protests. We need to unite and march on. The kids need us!

             May I also add that even though they did get 300,000 + people at that huge rally...what really happened? What happened was 'sweet f*** all! The whole 'story' got buried and the criminals continue to do what they always have....I've seen the doco, all the investigators were sacked or swapped and the whole lot was hushed up...it's going to take more than just a rally....even IF you can get 300,000 + people to show up

               They've been doing this horrific stuff so long, virtually, completely unseen and have become so arrogant that they themselves opened this investigation up through their belief that they will/would never be caught...their first mistake. We don't know just how much evidence there was/is on Weiners laptop, we don't, really, know who is running the/an investigation...we just don't see the bigger picture...and it's pretty big...they are falling on their swords now. The evidence presented in this forum is obviously being collated by a number of people and circumstantial or not, deserves/warrants a thorough investigation...the engergies have shifted and everything that has been hidden is beginning to come out into the light...they can't hide anymore.

              When you're fighting for a cause that is this powerful and righteous, nothing should make you back down. Not the fear or reprisal, not the fear of how it could be used against you, nothing. You are fighting for the
              <strong>
               best cause in the world: children
              </strong>
              . Don't ever back down when TRUTH, JUSTICE and LAW are on your side.

             Is it "fair" to ignore one group because of what currently amounts essentially to not yet actualized circumstantial concerns regarding a completely separate group/event?

             This is not kindergarten and the goal is to help save kindergarteners. IDGAF if a few investigators get their feels tweeked if doing so might expedite the saving of a child and neither should any other genuine investigator for that matter!

              I understand the hesitation and fear that my fellow Voaters are having about a PG March possibly turning into an occasion for MSM trolling and violent Soros-paid protests to discredit our cause, I do. However, I do believe a White March is possible and should be held. The circumstances under which it should happen though should be well thought-out and prepared in advance. Organised groups from all corners of the US should be created at least a couple of months in advance. Once an elevated enough number of protesters is gathered, a date should be set for a March. White balloons, White t-shirts, flyers, posters, et al should be created and bought. When all is ready and done and the March is on, even a large group of violent protesters would stick out and look like outsiders and NOT part of the organised March. We need to stand out as a serious peaceful group. I'm sure it could be done. I'm sure of it.

                White is the colour of innocence. MSM will call it whatever they want to call it. Alt-Media will call it for what it really is. Do we really care about Fake News? 80% of the people don't trust what they report anyway. Does a good enough reason really exists, that should make us back away from such a righteous and just cause?

                 Yes. Msm spin is a good reason.
White = righteous and just?
I repeat my sentiments.

                  I appreciate and respect your point of view. There is so much one can do. In the end, it won't be me or you that will decide what will or will not happen, you know. It's the movement that will decide and I'll just go along with it.

               I like it. Peaceful and united, organized and as large as we can. Time would give us time to prepare well. I understand and appreciate that people want action, we want to do something, I agree with that too, however am so very wary of what
               <em>
                could

               happen. Maybe these marches can start off a chain. I pray so, and for all the brave souls marching in the coming days. GOD SPEED.

            One of my big concerns is that the protest on the 18th will turn violent (Soros has already shown an interest in paying rioters to make protesters look bad) and that will destroy any chance the protest on the 25th has of going anywhere. I don't really understand why the person who formed the protest on the 18th wouldn't try to merge protests. One big protest would be better than two small ones. Something about the one on the 18th just doesn't sit right with me. I don't think this is going to end well, but I hope I'm wrong!

                ? Sounds like you're just on here to stir up some trouble. The points I listed in my comment were perfectly reasonable. You don't have to agree with them, which is fine, but why are you now on here two days after the fact trying to argue about it?

                  Says the one who is on here trying to stir things up days later. I didn't want to be right. Let's try to remember that you and I are not enemies here. Podesta, Soros, Clinton, they're the enemies. The petty little side arguments don't do anything except divide us and weaken our strength as a whole. Unfortunately, Saturday didn't turn out well. I hope that the one this coming weekend is more successful.

            I notice a big force trying to talk people out of attending these marches..  They dont want them out in the streets where they maight get attention, rather have all those people contaigned at some forum wich only few people know about. Yes it maight get trolled by paid people.. Staying in a forum will get the word out? I think sometimes need to take some risk. I do hope everyone will be save.

             But you do realize that we are dealing with a billion dollar black market run by 
Psychopaths right? 
Why dont people protest against drug cartels ? Because they dont want their families to get murdered.

             I agree. This is cowardice. The guys (and gal) that protested yesterday stood their ground. The media that reported on them failed epicly to have the higher ground. All of their videos are littered in people trashing them for their obvious and lazy angle, and people praising the protesters for having coherent arguments.

             Though I do not trust the likes of Seaman to be as convincing. We need our most informed and charismatic speaking to the press.

             I feel the people pushing for it here and shaming others for thinking it's a bad idea.. Are all about manipulating the group to fuck -up.

             No we must use strategy to make others aware of whats happening.
The narrative can always be twisted and used against us . its called gaslighting and sociopaths use it all the time

               still waiting to see your all the people you reach out to on Twitter.  You do have a twitter account, right?  With more followers than fliers can reach in a week, right?  That seems to be your claim.  Can't wait to see it.  thx.

            This is a huge problem. The counterintelligence pro are waiting for this. Soros will have paid goons join in to rile up the g crowd then turn violent. You cannot advertise these events in this way. These guys are amateurs playing in a professional game. Especially if a guy like Shutter is claiming to be the anti/Christ. This feels uneasy

             These kind of people never let an opportunity go to waste and to make us look bad and crazy.  This will be a vehicle for their false flag fiascos and people are so asleep now sitting in front of their TVs ready to believe.  We must not give them another free opportunity to make us look like the "kooks" they are already branding us.  The CPP incident did enough damage. We don't need another one.

               I am hoping that the people that March on the 25th will have the brains to realize that the deniers may form better and less crazy opinions of us if we March Peacefully to show them that we are not just a bunch of loonies making up stories.  That we really care about the children.  That is the hope.  It is a beginning.

                You have to realize they will say whatever they are going to say.  They get a script and the Rothschild minions scurry to produce the talking points.  This march is for us.  We do this for us and the kids.

              Exactly. This is what HRC &amp; Soros &amp; Obama etc. are waiting for. They want absolute chaos. The lack of sophistication from the newest members to this investigation makes sense...probably younger less experienced. Trying to keep coming back and help direct eventhou am sent horrible messages like Shill and worse

               I agree. This could be the powder keg they are waiting for. 
What more can set people off violently than the disclosure of the systematic abuse of children

               I think also some of the lack of sophistication is due to the extremely emotionally charged issue that Pizzagate is. You're not likely to find a cause that will enrage as much as victimizing children. I think many people are just blinded by rage. Also, many people feel so helpless that they want to act in any way they can. I certainly understand this but, because this cause is so very important, there is an even greater need to act intelligently.

                David Seaman and entire George Soros funded cabal operate on the frequency of Fear and causing chaos.  If David Seaman is given the mic at the protest he will say he was nearly hit by 3 cars and that 10 guys wearing black were following him the whole day then shout at everyone to go home and "be safe".

                Yes I have. Everyone needs to calm down with marches. When you are dealing with people who would commit these crimes against children. They have no moral compass at all. They will stop at nothing to gain momentum. They are depraved. Those on this side are not. We can out think them. Can box them in as we have been. Make them feel hunted as they have hunted innocent children and others. 
Be passionate yes. Mob mentality no

                If this is true, that's pretty scary. Seaman's sources have usually been on point in the past, haven't they? But why can't he ever post some kind of proof of his "source"?

                    No worries at all, did I possibly miss a Tweet? I'm not reading this as 'I'm cancelling going to the PG demo' -

                  Ay yi yi! Thanks for sharing those tweets. All of these PG personalities are really beginning to nauseate me. I soured with Seamen quite some time ago for various reasons, but more recent months have seen the rise of all these names who seem to be becoming minor celebrities in the community. This makes me very uneasy. And I am troubled even further when I find that most of them are soliciting and receiving funding of some sort or hawking a book or other products.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For my money...I'm gonna stick with the many anonymous researchers who are in this only because it's the right thing to do.

                   From my perspective, there seems to be an attempt to herd the internet population that has been labelled as 'alt-right', so most of these personalities have not emerged organically at all.  If you look at the subscriber numbers to some of those channels, the average researcher/content producer of alternative news knows very well that the social media platforms are set up to suppress channel numbers.  Those personalities where the opposite happens always require extra scrutiny.

            It's a set up.  British intelligence is working with the Americans and some of the shills on this forum are of that ilk.  I didn't know much about David Shurter before but after seeing this particular post recently I think that he is cointelpro :
