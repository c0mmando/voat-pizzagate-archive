WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FIRST (in an over-simplified way)...
When someone breaks a law, that is a criminal act. States have criminal laws that usually cover things that are confined within the state (ie one person killing another). When criminal acts/actors cross state lines, then the federal government\'s criminal laws are in play. That criminal act has been done against the people of that jurisdiction, not just the stated victim. In essence, when someone is robbed, we all are wronged. Because we are a system where your innocence is presumed, the government, on behalf of the wronged People at large, must prove that the bad actor committed the bad act in court, with evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt. The entity that is deputized to represent the government in the criminal prosecution, is the prosecutor. At the federal level, you have the United State Attorney General. At the state level, you have the State Attorney General. At the county level, you have the District Attorney. At the city level, you have the City Prosecutor. Sometimes, in special circumstances, where there is an appearance of impropriety or conflict of interest, the DA can call on the AG to prosecute a state crime. At the federal level, when there might be this special circumstance, there is no one outside of the USAG to call on, so the USAG has the power to deputize a special prosecutor who is then given the powers of the prosecutorial agency for this specialized case.
OK, so... Once an alleged crime happens, the policing agency in that jurisdiction (city police department, county sheriff, federal agent of the FBI) will investigate and write a report. They bring the report to the prosecuting agency who then decides if they want to pursue a criminal action against the alleged bad actor. Statutes of limitation limit prosecutorial agencies from prosecuting older crimes, so as to incentivize policing agencies to act efficiently. This also ensures a more fair prosecution of the alleged wrongdoer who might not remember older events. Once the prosecutor decides that a crime has been committed, they convene the grand jury. The prosecutor then presents a portion of the evidence they have of that crime to the grand jury, and the grand jury decides if there is enough evidence to merely charge the bad actor with the crime. This is done because we don\'t want rogue prosecutors dragging people needlessly through the pain and suffering of a long criminal trial without some form of evidence. Once the grand jury decides in favor of the prosecutor, a formal criminal charge is brought before the judge. This formal criminal charge is called an indictment and it notifies the bad actor of the potential crime that the prosecutor will be prosecuting him/her on. This stops the statute of limitations clock, as well, because prosecution has commenced. Sometimes, indictments are sealed. Sealed indictments keep the name of the defendant bad actor secret from the public and many times, the potential bad actor. This is allowed so that prosecutors may gather more evidence of the current crime charged, other crimes that the bad actor has committed, or other crimes that the bad actor\'s partners have committed. Prosecutors do not want to tip off the bad actors because then the bad actors might destroy evidence before it is collected. An indictment is then unsealed by the judge once the secrecy is no longer needed (ie bad actor now knows because he was arrested, or even though bad actor has known, the investigation into his partners is now complete).
 Everything that happens in a specific court on a specific day is public knowledge, unless it is confidential/sealed. All scheduled motions/hearings/trials/etc. for a given court, on a given date, appear on the public docket/calendar, even confidential/sealed motions (which appear as &quot;SEALED&quot;). The database for dockets, federally, is PACER. It can be found at <a href="http://www.pacer.gov">PACER DATABASE</a>.</p>
<p>OK, now that we are all on the same page, let\'s get to my &quot;lawerly&quot; analysis.
We have been seeing/hearing all these different numbers about &quot;Sealed Indictments&quot; and the number being up to like 4000+ now. The problem with these numbers is that we do not know for sure if they are specifically indictments. I get that they say SEALED and that you search &quot;newly filed,&quot; but this might not represent indictments ONLY. An indictment is a type of motion. Motions must be filed with the court. For example, a new sealed search warrant on an old, currently sealed case might be picked up by PACER as &quot;newly filed.&quot; People who do not work with dockets that specifically have sealed indictments, might not understand that not every single sealed motion, newly filed with the court, is going to be a sealed indictment. That is the whole point of them being sealed, so information remains confidential. 
When cases are filed with the Clerk of the Court, they are given case numbers. These numbers generally follow a very complex pattern that I believe I have cracked over my many years of practice. They are sequential ;) . So, even in the SEALED cases, they need SOME way of tracking them. If you look on a docket with sealed cases, you\'ll see it will go like 17-456, 17-457, 17-458, 17-459. These are probably newly filed CASES/indictments. But then, all of a sudden, the docket will list 17-234 on the same date as the above listed cases. This is probably a newly filed MOTION. Once again, the sealings are meant to be/remain confidential, so it is not supposed to be easy to figure out. However, the court DOES need to have a system to track all of the cases. Methinks the 4000+ number is inflated. However, what we CAN do, is look at the same database, same search terms, same court across several years and compare the activity levels. The higher activity levels would tend to indicate higher levels of indictments, but by what percent, it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>11/1 - 11/27 DC District new filings
2017: 93 total / 69 sealed
2016: 69 total / 39 sealed
2015: 109 total / 68 sealed
2014: 76 total / 50 sealed
ANALYSIS: DC is all over the place</p>

2015: 8 total / 6 sealed
2016: 30 total / 12 sealed
2017: 238 total / 92 sealed
ANALYSIS: Nothing to see here... Move along people</p>
<hr />
<p>So, what is happening here? Well, even though DC people work in DC, many of them live in VA.
This is an extraordinary uptick. There are several extraordinary things happening right now, including Mueller and MS-13 crackdown. If this were related to Russia, the numbers wouldn\'t be so large. I mean how many people were really complicit with the whole Russian thing? Did Putin get 200 people on Trump\'s team to agree to work with him? Do they all live in VA? OR is the swamp being drained? Do many of the lobbyists live in VA? What about MS-13? One of their central hubs is in VA. Even though all gangs are involved with human trafficking, what is so special about MS-13? Ah yes, they specialize in not only minors, but young minors. They also worship Satan and are involved with human sacrifice.</p>
<p>So, that\'s it for now...
If you have any questions, feel free to tag me, so I am notified. I will try and answer as best I can, without doxxing myself too much.</p>',

            It's all about MS-13. Presumably the group used by the cabal to kill those who are not following the plan and/or the children coming over the border (undocumented). Although their might be the odd Madeleine McCann, children of documented parents (like the McCanns) are far too high profile. Undocumented children will be missed by nobody, and illegal immigrant parents have no recourse to highlight the issue. The same in Europe and the Middle East.

Open your eyes.
It finally came out that Rod/Bob were key players in the Uranium scandal.
Don’t you think POTUS would be tweeting about removal given clear conflict.
Why did POTUS meet Bob under the cover of FBI Dir interview?
Bob is unable to serve as Dir per the law.
Gowdy comments on Comey (history will ....)
POTUS has everything.
Not everyone is corrupt (fewer than you think).
Follow Huma.
Operation Mockingbird.
Priority to clean out the bad actors to unite people behind the America First agenda.
Many in our govt worship Satan.
Not about Republicans v Democrats at this stage.
Where is HRC?
Why is the NG called up across 12 cities?
Trust in your President.
God bless, Patriots.

Some of us come here to drop crumbs, just crumbs.
POTUS is 100% insulated - any discussion suggesting he’s even a target is false.
POTUS will not be addressing nation on any of these issues as people begin to be indicted and must remain neutral for pure optical reasons. To suggest this is the plan is false and should be common sense.
Focus on Military Intellingence/ State Secrets and why might that be used vs any three letter agency
What SC decision opened the door for a sitting President to activate - what must be showed?
Why is POTUS surrounded by generals ^^
Again, there are a lot more good people than bad so have faith. This was a hostile takeover from an evil corrupt network of players (not just Democrats).
Don’t fool yourself into thinking Obama, Soros, Roth’s, Clinton’s etc have more power present day than POTUS.
Operation Mockingbird
Patriots are in control. Sit back and enjoy the show.

            : Thank you so much for following up with a deeper dive into the year-to-year stats! As promised, I'm stickying this. Also giving it the QAnon Storm Watch flair.

            Do you think you could take a moment to break up the wall-of-text with a few paragraphs and maybe some subheads? Paragraphs require two carriage returns. You can give any paragraph headline formatting by clicking the "H" button in the formatting bar #6 from the right. Thank you!

            Virgina also seems to be the state with the highest number of missing kids per capita (source). As state in the article, "apparently, the state of Virginia has by far the highest number of missing kids per capita in the nation at 0.00467" I HAVE felt for quite some time that MS 13 could be pulling these kids off the street. Do I have proof? No. But somehow it sure Seems To Add Up.

             I remember Seth's murder was probably MS-13. The two guys who probably did it ended up dead in Myrtle Beach, SC. Got friends who live there, and crime there has really been on an uptick, and it is all circling back to MS-13 having a stronghold there. SC evidently is very hopeful that these gang members can be eradicated by Pres. Trump, because tourism is taking a hit with the crime there having gone up substantially. Myrtle Beach is a 6-7 hour drive from No. VA.

              TY for that name, Myrtle Beach.  I have been trying to remember all day.  Yeah, for some reason I can't forget the name of Carmelo, one of the guys.  I am convinced they are using MS 13 to do their dirty work for them.  There so called "Wet Works" as mentioned in the Podesta emails.  I always got down voated when mentioning this.  I believe that is the main reason Trump wants to build the wall, to keep out MS 13.

               Yes, I know you are right about Pres.Trump wanting to get that wall up because of them. He knows how dangerous they are...worse even than the ISIS camps all over the US. We used to go to MB, every year at least once a year. Last summer, it got so dangerous there, our friends told us wait until the authorities get it under control. It's still not under control there. Many Latinos moved there because the area had many building opportunities  because of all the hotels/motels and highway systems connecting to I-95. But then the gangs came in and tourism is way off.  When Mr Trump first got in the WH, his first tweets were about MS-13. At first I thought it was because of Mar Lago and FL, but quickly realized he knew who was doing all the gangland hits in FL, Chicago, LA, TX and GA/SC. And, of course, he had to know what happened to Seth. I believe he's a decent guy who hates seeing what these evil ones have let happen to our country. And I guess that is why his tweets sometimes show his utter frustration with these evil people almost destroying our nation  and he knows they are still trying, too.

                It is so sad when I think of all the missing children.  Va.  DC  and  St. Louis and any other cities, but Va. has the most missing children.  We hear nothing of this except on here.  Just Plain Shameful.

                 The Virginia governor is Terry McAuliff, who was DNC chairman before he ran for that office. He is big pals with Podesta, Hillary and other bigwig democrats like even Roy Romer, late of CO (governor 12 years) and LA unified school system superintendent  until he gave up there. Something doesn't smell right and all you can wonder is if Norfolk's port and the Chesapeake Bay makes it easy to steal and/or ship children easily from/to the state. Romer also was big with the Denver airport and the huge underground system it has. I don't know, but it just doesn't look right that DC area has the worst record of all the other states/areas.Also when you know about companies in the area that never struggled during the 8 years of horrible economic times, but it didn't make sense and you wonder if these places were money laundering......?

                  Yes to all of your wondering.  There are ways they ship and take in the trafficked children.  We have researched the shipping containers many times.  Also the ports and tunnels are very instrumental and yes, these businesses are money laundering as we know through mostly art galleries and expensive sometimes ugly art.  I think this all will come out but it will take time for it has been been going on for decades and as we know centuries with our slaves.

                    Hi!  I have missed your input.  I can't believe I have been on here for a year Today!  Amazing to me.  My dream is to be off of here in one year because we have had so much success that we no longer need to do our work on here.  But I know that is probably asking too much.  The Missing need us.

                     This will be my prayer during the holidays. I plan on coming back right now I am swamped with work obligations and family. It's easy for me to neglect real life this issue is so important to me.  2-3 more weeks and work will be wrapped up. I can't wait! A lot seems to be happening though I have been following on twitter and staying up to date.

                  I think MS 13 either has a different handle down here in Mexico, or they are so dang scary that they just aren't talked about. I am not suited for discreet street level investigations, but I got buddies to ask. Once I was talking about the Zetas (a northern cartel) in public and they got all nervous and told me to shut up about it...

            I guess they intend to flag Pizzagaters as mentally ill and start sending their Facebook friends and police alerts that the user is mentally ill and needs intervention. They may try to get people sequestered for psych evaluations against their will by getting the family to agree that the Facebook user is mentally ill. This is getting very weird...

            Hopefully people abandon facebook in huge numbers. There is no way to Opt Out of being scanned either. We need to start memeing that Democracy is a trick word and that a Republic is what we are supposed to be. That will be a hard sell to normies but Democracy is a trick word, just like the trick Democrats.

             The idea of Facebook proactively scanning the content of people’s posts could trigger some dystopian fears about how else the technology could be applied. Facebook didn’t have answers about how it would avoid scanning for political dissent or petty crime, with Rosen merely saying “we have an opportunity to help here so we’re going to invest in that.” There are certainly massive beneficial aspects about the technology, but it’s another space where we have little choice but to hope Facebook doesn’t go too far.

Essentially, the familiar argument goes, the public should just "trust us" as this is for our "safety" and we are benign and humanitarian, says Facebook.

               Ignore the resident "agent sabateur shill" aka donkeydich (naracistic exageration of his actual size ie micro dick) who replied to you. His agenda isn't about the kids. Its about framing us as white supremicists so the deep state can discredit us.

               Lots of words have been bastardized. "Sovereignty" is another example, and that's supposed to be the basis of the ability to make law, regardless of whether you're talking about a democracy or a republic.

               This is what Jews live and breath, the reason they get up in the morning: to LIE DECEIVE DISTORT GASLIGHT FABRICATE AND GATEKEEP with their JEWDI lingusitic mind tricks where chopping up an infant is a "choice," indeed a privacy right statutorily.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe when there's no Jewish brainwashing we can experiment with letting (net taxpayers) vote.
              </p>
              <p>
               You seem to resist the obvious conclusion that simply undoing  the Jewish sabotage would be sufficient.  No one is being asked to reinvent the wheel.  I'm asking you guys to stop being vain: there's nothing LOW-BROW about anti-Semitism, it is the NORM HISTORICALLY.  and obviously the Germans 18th cent- Nazis were brilliant in all human endeavors and it's a preposterous lie to suggest one of the most cultured nations would make skin lampshades, what a typical KIKE embellishment, so unnecessary and discrediting but they can't help themselves

            If this was related to Trump &amp; Russia it would of leaked by now.  I don't think it is mostly MS-13; as we have reports of Sessions roundup of illegals and deportations, usually ms13 members.  Probably a few ringleaders and maybe even a politician or two, La Raza signs were all around at the election and there was always violence next to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've kept hope and it hasn't even been a full year since he has been in office.  If there was a proper Federal Investigation into the Clinton's and Mueller was the catalyst it would make sense we'd never hear about it until the hammer drops.  Mueller's investigation had a couple leaks like the Tech CEOs saying Russia did pay Facebook to run pro-Hillary/negative-Trump ads.  His investigation also confirmed Uranium-1, tied Manafort to Uranium-1, also a gagged FBI agent.  Mueller has been around and involved, just like Rosenstein since Uranium-1, maybe he was an inside man the entire time knowing he couldn't do anything until someone like Trump was elected or maybe he is a swamp creature, who the hell knows.

            Don't forget their is also the issue of the illegal bathroom server, Seth Rich, 55k deleted emails, and everything else.

            I know you all see the craziness going on.  Mandalay Bay massacre -&gt; Trump visits SA -&gt; SA Prince, head funder of wahhabism was arrested, CFPB Mulvaney drama and Federal Reserve owns that, all the democrat donors/politicians/establishment types caught in sexual assault, rape, and other frauds.  The pace has quickened and they aren't use to it, they have no leadership.  If you've read wikileaks and bothered looking at other sources than the MSM you know the crimes that have been committed apart from just Pedogate.  You are all on VOAT for a reason, maybe it is the perfect honeypot

             I'd give you 10 upvoats if I could.  Great summation!  This CFPB thing is bigger than most think.  Warren stood about the best chance of anyone, other than Biden, of beating Trump.  She's the only one young enough to even realistically contemplate a run in 2020.  Guess what Pocahantas?  Not no mo'!

            .  I've hoping someone w PACER access would assemble a historical comparison.  As I mentioned in another post, MS13 is huge in NoVA and MD.  I've never heard of MS13 activities of any significance in DC proper.
           </p>
           <p>
            You also noted the large amount of VA-related sealed indictments.  It is worth noting that DC's daytime population swells from about 700k to around 1.5MM.  Those are all workers who do not live in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does the VA E court also cover MD suburbs?

            There's a huge surge in unsealed filings in VA. What are those about?

            Excellent work, by the way. Very much appreciated.

             Good point. Can anybody with access to the site provide names for us to run background checks? They might be partners or semi-partners of the Cabal members, if we find relations between the unsealed and the presumably sealed that'd be evidence that the storm is here for real
