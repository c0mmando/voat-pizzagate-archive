<p>This all rang a bell with me because I did a post a while back about a murdered Washington DC actress who happened to meet Prince Charles during that visit in 2011:</p>

             They are involve with AIDS vaccines that are suppose to help kids in Africa. Except, they have birth controlling features in the vaccines.  Also, trying out new viruses and they are used as their lab rats. If they can start an illness, big Pharma comes to the rescue. Like Zika. Guess what, suddenly verybody wants to get vaccine. Cash galore.

             Wow, this is a great lead. A whole lot more to unpack, but if you recall the so-called Chris Kloman scandal that Susan Alefantis was involved with when she tried to exonerate her Pedo friend, the strange thing was that most of the apologists were Smithsonian types.

             I also recall the Ponce de Leon apartments being nearby, very much plays into the theory as well.

              <p>
               Building on the U.S.-UK partnership, the U.S. Smithsonian Institution and the UK Arts Humanities Research Council are extending a successful history of partnerships by developing a new collaboration, based at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, focused on increasing the use of digital research skills in museums. Enhancing these skills will benefit areas such as data analysis, curating, and accessibility of collections, and will also further audience engagement. This work will help achieve new best practices in digital scholarship and the application of digital technologies at research-led museums.
