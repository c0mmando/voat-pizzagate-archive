<p>The OP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here\'s the premise (and please ask me for specifics and to elaborate in the comments, because doing so here means there\'s too much to dissect): The US/EU destabilize countries and privatize everything. This is done with &quot;pro-Democracy&quot; groups like Soros sowing dissent. As part of the destabilised country\'s interim, they oversee elections, and often appoint the person who will fit the agenda they want to push for the rest of the country. They also bankrupt the nation and as part of the IMF bailout terms and conditions, they have to accept privatization reforms.</p>
<p>All of their children\'s welfare groups associated with the US/EU also push for the privatization of child care. They emphasize foster care. The countries in which they did this (Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, Ukraine) became regions known as the &quot;fourth wave&quot; of trafficking. It didn\'t exist under the communist regimes.</p>
<p>For the first few years, these child welfare groups milked aid money from the revolving door between their organizations and those distributing the aid, like the EU Commission, USAID, etc. Once the &quot;humanitarian crisis&quot; angle dried up, they initiated step 2: the handover of their organization to the crime gangs. In Romania, for example, they freed the criminals as an act of pardon which means they know exactly who to appoint. These gangs then exploited the children--&quot;foster care&quot; became brothels, &quot;adoption&quot; became sale into sex slavery, and &quot;street children&quot; programs became forced begging.</p>
<p>These child welfare groups had partnerships with Italian municipalities. Similarly, organized crime groups trained under Italian mafias. It\'s also why we see Romanian children appearing in Italy. The partnerships of the orgs in the mid-90s align with the rise of the mafia, as do the trading routes. These child welfare groups are on record as having misallocated lots of donation funds, often for gifts, mysterious trips, and lavish events for government municipalities and their connections.</p>
<p>In Kosovo, the EU/US (under B Clinton) elevated Thaci\'s Kosovo Liberation Army. The guy\'s clan is a known child trafficker, organ smuggler, and the Albanian mafia today--many of whom were former KLA officials--account for some of the biggest human smugglers in existence. This includes for things like delivering kids for pedophiles throughout Europe. As to the US, many of Thaci\'s former KLA members are sitting in US-based embassies. Camp Bondsteel exists to shuttle out heroin and kids, if the need arises. This is also why the Albanian mafia does not operate in DC but does in other parts of Europe and the US.</p>
<p>I\'ve not researched past 2001, but the template of overthrowing leaders, installing puppet dictators, and privatizing the child welfare system is consistent with other areas in question like Haiti.</p>
<p>Albania/Kosovo also has deeply Satanic connections that I can discuss.</p>

<p>The same dude included additional info in the reply section:</p>

<p>Among the replies is a fellow goat: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>GET THIS TO THE TOP! Implicates the Clintons in the child trafficking/drug trade in the Balkans. This calls for an immediate investigation into all child welfare organizations, especially those tied to the Clintons\'/Soros, in war torn areas. Everychild is of particular interest in the Balkans, ties to Tavistock through Michael Rich, ties to Clinton/CF through Cheryl Saban. It was established by Western power players and is closely aligned with the government in Kosovo which is/was implicated in human trafficking.</p>
<p>This charity has had three separate names, The Romanian Orphanage Trust (1990-1997), The European Children’s Trust (1997-2001), and EveryChild (2001-Present). It has connections to Barnardo\'s which has a proven history of sexually abusing children and sending them abroad to pedophiles. <a href="http://archive.is/tXJld">http://archive.is/tXJld</a></p>

<p>Another thread in the replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can testify for the Kosovo part , and so should Carla Del Ponte</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_theft_in_Kosovo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_theft_in_Kosovo</a></p>
<p>as she was investigating this, but it was waaaay over her power.</p>
<p>She could be associate to Giovanni Falcone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Falcone">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Falcone</a> and prosecute Mafia , she could prosecute war criminals of balkans , but when she tried to prosecute organ trafficing in Kosovo, it went full stop.</p>
<p>And for pizzagaters, it has everything to do with pizzagate , well, not directly, but was crucial in formation of Clinton Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the OP replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YES! Organs are huge money. IIRC, most of the ones harvested got shipped off to Israelis and Middle Easterners for 40k a pop.</p>
<p>Then there\'s this bizarre piece of evidence that I found: the mayor of Tirana requested that this charity work in three places--one was Tirana the capital (which makes sense, even though refugee camps from here had trafficking issues), the second was Shkoder which became one of the worst spots for child trafficking up to Italy (90% of families didn\'t want to send their kids to school because it became too difficult to go outside), and the third was Peshkopi.</p>

<p>I looked up Peshkopi to see if it had any significance to trafficking. It didn\'t, but it was one of the yellow houses used by the KLA as a waypoint for organ harvesting.</p>

<p>Peshkopi had absolutely no other significance that I could find. So, why the hell would the mayor request a charity\'s presence there if it wasn\'t being used as a front for more nefarious purposes?</p>

<p>OP\'s reply to a deleted comment: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure: For one, look at the history of the Albanian flag.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDjlS2SaFME">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDjlS2SaFME</a></p>
<p>We\'re talking red shield (Rothschild), which is part of the Khazarian group allegedly trying to create the one world government. Then we have the double-headed eagle, which my understanding is that it\'s a Babylonian symbol to identify the &quot;unknown/unspeakable&quot; god that isn\'t identified by name.</p>
<p>Then you have Kosovo and its many dragon/snake references. Thaci is known as &quot;the snake,&quot; the US embassy in Kosovo sits in &quot;dragon neighborhood&quot; there, and even the KLA was known as the Drenica (or, dragon) group. Milosevic actually called Albanian leaders something like &quot;blood sucking vampires.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, and Kosovo\'s Dardania flag has interesting symbolism, too--it has the six-pointed star of David associated with the Bel-worshipping Khazarians, along with the seeds of life on its crest. I believe this is in reference to the rising/birth of a diabolical governing force in the country.</p>
<p>This belief is made all the more interesting by the Albanian flag removing its 5-pointed star at the end of Communism (the star being a symbol of keeping away evil).</p>
<p>Also, the Dardania region of Albania is believed to house &quot;chemically pure&quot; bloodlines on account of its mountainous region which led to a lot of in-breeding. This makes for a strong Albanian mafia that bases itself on family/blood purity similar to the Italian mafia (those two criminal groups have a bond, apparently... especially in the north).</p>
<p>Last, the trafficking route in the north of Italy is close to Milan, which is very close to the tunnel of Gotthard. Remember the satanic opening ritual there? Plus CERN? Maybe human sacrifices of kids via the Albanian mafia are going on there in order to bring forth the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>OP also mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also note: Marina Abramovich is allegedly a Serbian refugee who did several exhibits on Kosovo. I\'m pretty sure she\'s tied into this somehow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been very suspicious of the small channel island Jersey and what connection it might have to all this. The island is a very large tax haven worth roughly 2 trillion dollars. It\'s only 5 by 9 miles in size, so thats about 5 billion per square mile. Many elites hide there money here. Not only that but there is a history of large scale sexual abuse scandals and cover ups. I have been searching for connections between Jersey and Tavistock, Soros, Clinton Foundation, and what we are seeing in the podesta leaks. I did a Post on this that got some attention and some people digging but eventually died out. I\'ll link my post in case you didn\'t get a chance to see it. If you\'ve come across anything in your research that might line up with this please let me know or message me.</p>

            We're talking red shield (Rothschild), which is part of the Khazarian group allegedly trying to create the one world government. Then we have the double-headed eagle, which my understanding is that it's a Babylonian symbol to identify the "unknown/unspeakable" god that isn't identified by name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you have Kosovo and its many dragon/snake references. Thaci is known as "the snake," the US embassy in Kosovo sits in "dragon neighborhood" there, and even the KLA was known as the Drenica (or, dragon) group. Milosevic actually called Albanian leaders something like "blood sucking vampires."
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, and Kosovo's Dardania flag has interesting symbolism, too--it has the six-pointed star of David associated with the Bel-worshipping Khazarians, along with the seeds of life on its crest. I believe this is in reference to the rising/birth of a diabolical governing force in the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            This belief is made all the more interesting by the Albanian flag removing its 5-pointed star at the end of Communism (the star being a symbol of keeping away evil).
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the Dardania region of Albania is believed to house "chemically pure" bloodlines on account of its mountainous region which led to a lot of in-breeding. This makes for a strong Albanian mafia that bases itself on family/blood purity similar to the Italian mafia (those two criminal groups have a bond, apparently... especially in the north).
           </p>
           <p>
            Last, the trafficking route in the north of Italy is close to Milan, which is very close to the tunnel of Gotthard. Remember the satanic opening ritual there? Plus CERN? Maybe human sacrifices of kids via the Albanian mafia are going on there in order to bring forth the anti-Christ.

            I have been very suspicious of the small channel island Jersey and what connection it might have to all this. The island is a very large tax haven worth roughly 2 trillion dollars. It's only 5 by 9 miles in size, so thats about 5 billion per square mile. Many elites hide there money here. Not only that but there is a history of large scale sexual abuse scandals and cover ups. I have been searching for connections between Jersey and Tavistock, Soros, Clinton Foundation, and what we are seeing in the podesta leaks. I did a Post on this that got some attention and some people digging but eventually died out. I'll link my post in case you didn't get a chance to see it. If you've come across anything in your research that might line up with this please let me know or message me.

            So, let me throw something else into the mix - for this trafficking you need infrastructure, including technological infrastructure.  I just posted on another subverse some info that ties in with this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Implicates the Clintons in the child trafficking/drug trade in the Balkans. This calls for an immediate investigation into all child welfare organizations, especially those tied to the Clintons'/Soros, in war torn areas. Everychild is of particular interest in the Balkans, ties to Tavistock through Michael Rich, ties to Clinton/CF through Cheryl Saban. It was established by Western power players and is closely aligned with the government in Kosovo which is/was implicated in human trafficking.
            </p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ..As for Petraeus, he sports a NATO medal for former Yugoslavia. In 1999, he assisted in the planning and coordination of the bombings of Serbia as aide-de-camp to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Hugh Shelton. Before returning as an investor, Petraeus had already been present in the region in 2001-2002, serving as Assistant Chief of Staff of the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and as a Deputy Commander of a clandestine counter-terrorist unit charged with capturing Serbs wanted by the Hague, until September 11 redefined his priorities by turning jihadist allies into supreme enemies. “That was where his future course was charted” says Fred Kaplan in his biography “The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War” (2013, 65).
            </p>
            <p>
             His four-star colleague, Wesley Clark, NATO commander-in-chief during the bombing of Yugoslavia, also moved into big business (just like Odierno, McChrystal, and Mullen - remember that as early as 1961, Eisenhower had warned against the military-industrial complex). Wesley Clark chairs the Canadian group Envidity Energy Inc., which is negotiating, in the midst of controversies, the exploration of very significant coal deposits of Kosovo “liberated” by his troops. Although on the sly,
             <strong>
              Petraeus was KKR’s main negotiator in United Group's takeover in 2013. He met with Serbian PM Aleksandar Vucic several times, both publicly and in private.

            UpVoat &amp; Thank You! You have opened a nasty can of worms.  People and especially Children have been disappearing all over the world.  We know the reason.  Many have closed their eyes and ears and the media has convinced many that the numbers of the missing are much lower than they are in reality.

            Kosovo's prime minister is the head of a "mafia-like" Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe, according to a Council of Europe inquiry report on organised crime.

            This is a story that is not about race, ethnicity or religion. Some people will make it a demographic issue in order to obfuscate the ubiquitous nature of trafficking crimes involving children. What is the crime? The crime is murdering American children for the purposes of organ theft and shipment to countries such as Israel, Turkey, India, China, et al.
