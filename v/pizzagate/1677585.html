<p>But the main reason I post today is in regards to what I found researching pizza-hut commercials. From the nineties, pizza-hut had this ad campaign: Pizza head.

<p>There\'s subtext. Blatant subtext.

The pizza is consistently questioning &quot;hey, this isn\'t the right way!&quot; &quot;Hey, you\'re not really coach Steve!&quot;, I\'m paraphrasing slightly it\'s late; there\'s also instances where the pizza is torn around, abused (literally), eaten (in a peculiar way), torn in half, tested on by aliens (..I know right..); I mean it\'s under the guise it\'s just pizza so from a quick glance the commercial seems rather cute.</p>

            The FUCK?!!!!  This is exactly like the Mr. Bill shorts on SNL in the late 70s but Jesus, how unappetizing.  Depressing.  Disturbing! Not funny at all as it's an ad, not satirical comedy.  Mr. Bill and Spot were always getting pulverized one way or another but the shorts were not trying to sell anything except dank humor.  Big dif.  Still, I don't know if this pizza slice is really supposed to be a little kid.  I mean Mr. Bill was taken to be an adult. (Hence the title "Mr." even though he had a very high voice...) Then again this pizza slice is talking about not playing for a coach-mostly only kids talk about that.  I don't know.  Have to watch more to really see a connection to pedo shit.  I do have a very dark sense of humor and loved Mr. Bill and how "wrong" the grievous bodily harm was at the time but these ads are a huge turnoff to me.  Maybe I'm just getting old.

            I can tell you that the advertising industry is loaded with pedo homosexuals , esp. the Khazarian impostors who call themselves "jews" though they are not. Definitely a synagogue of satan there.

            a lot of creepy scenes in there for sure...like the doctor's office one.  The company itself doesn't have to be part of it, it may be the people who do the marketing, they tie it into movies like Star Wars.  So whoever coordinates the ad series for the movie or toy, whatever is being paired with retail franchises, those would be the people to look at first IMO.
