<p>Did you ever ask yourself what our goal is for the outcome of &quot;Pizzagate&quot;? Is it to have the elite arrested and answer to the crimes that they have committed? Is it to help the innocent from being drug into a life that they do not deserve? Or is it a combination of the 2? I ask this because you can not have &quot;Pizzagate&quot; if you do not have victims. My point is why do we get posts deleted that could possibly save a victim who has been kidnapped who could potentially be exposed to sex trafficking or worse? Are we just out to get the &quot;bad guy&quot; or are we out to help prevent the children/persons from becoming a victim as well. I am sure the mods will have to make a decision if they should be the good guy in this or just keep posts to the Pizzagate elite did or did not do this. Unless it changes here on voat I will most likely only post to pizzagatewhatever because posts will be continuously deleted. I do believe we need to start giving victims a voice. If it can\'t be done here I will find another website to do so. I have tried. God bless all and be safe.</p>

            We need to hear the stories of survivors and we also need to look at what's happening
from the highest perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            The very basis of MKULTRA is Mind Control we shouldn't forget --
We're not only trying to save the children, we're trying to save ourselves from an unaccountable government
which is corrupt and criminal and based in Nazi thinking/projects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our government/CIA was/is involved with torture at Abu Ghrab not because they suddenly wanted
to torture a hundred thousand people there or more, but because they were practicing the art for the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it is the same with MKULTRA and it's work with mind control enslavement -- they're practicing for the future.

            Goal  is  to save  these  children  at all  cost-what kind of species would  not  drop  everything to  protect their young from these   vile cruel savage SUB-HUMANS?  If I  knew 10 people  in  person on VOAT every one of them (except schills) would march with a  gun in their  hand to save a  group  of  children if they had  the  intel; To expose and disseminate  to The People who  these PERPS   are,  their  political  organization  and  to HANG (the  most merciful execution people  could tolerate for  these  SUB-HUMANS -either that or put them  in  an arena and let citizens have  their way-my preference), to raise the  MILITIA and  restore Constitutional Law, to take  back  the  stolen money, land, etc. from  those who  have enslaved  mankind for 1000,s  of years

            The goal is to end this...the elite control which has resulted in the ritualistic killing and raping of many of our children...it is for the victims...but really about you and me and changing our world.  Cannot change something you are not aware of, and I think we all have had a giant wake up call lately.  I feel the frustration in this post and I am right there with you.  We have done tons to figure this out and get it in people's faces...now what?  It is still going on...they throw us a bone every now and again.  We need to get active soon....we are waiting for THEM to change the system THEY built...ain't gonna happen...

            It takes a God (son of man) to take out a God (satan).  The whole planet is a victim of these wicked bastards.  I want them all pushed in a lake of fire.  I'm grateful that they were so nice to whord wealth from us because their stock piles will be given to the righteous.

            The goal is to raise awareness of and potentially end the practice of systemic child abuse, particularly in its relation to the heretofore "conspiratorial" and "unproven" context of satanic ritual abuse. We want to push the devil off the Earth back to hell so that Earth can ruled by a proper set of standards that do not include child sacrifice. Peace and love, the use of the human intellect to contribute to a harmonious existence rather than furthering a hellish and unnecessary one. That's what I want, at least.

            Personally I would settle for letting them go scot free in exchange for the whole truth.  They could still live out their lives in comfort like OJ Simpson.  I'd settle for breaking the VIP paedophile ring system and preventing future victims.  Actually no hang on I want full disclosure of all the hidden technology as well.  Open their DUMBS, luxury bunkers and other secret facilities.

            shit gets shilled against or deleted because the goddamned self appointed gurus and mods of this "movement" are cointelpro agents. They get paid to SHUT. IT. DOWN.

            People like David Seaman and Millenial Falcon are not on our side. I posted a thread that detailed the connections of NAMBLA and LGBT and it got deleted. This means we have fag enablers and NAMBLA defenders among our ranks. This is exactly why Hitler had the "night of the long knives"

             How about a link to the post MF removed, hook? So we can all see how you followed the submission rules and made a powerful research post backed by linked sources and the removal was purely gratuitous and arbitrary. Interesting you didn't include that link.

             The goal is to have every last one of the mf's answering to what they did in a court of law. They need to be brought to justice and pay for what they have done. First, we need names and what they did, second we need names of victims they did it to. third we need absolute proof without a doubt that they did it. Fourth, we need to be sure these victims are protected and they know they are protected when they come out. There is no other recourse. So if you know of a real victim, protect him/her if you have real proof and let's get it on. I was a victim years ago and i never never kept my mouth shut. My kid got taken away from me forever because i slapped her arm when she was 9yrs. 2 states said i could not not get back. Was accused of abuse. fought the courts and  I won. I live by this song:

              I never got my daughter back but I stood my ground and I fought the courts all the way. The more I fought the worse it got. But, I never, ever lost my right to say what i wanted to say or defend my right. I lost my child but i won the battle. i do not have a relationship with my daughter to this day but i guarantee you mess with her you got to mess with me first. she was an innocent victim. my relatives were dragged into it and they said just shut up and agree with what they say and i said no i did not do it i am not keeping my mouth shut  and that is the rest of the story. a cop accused me of kicking her, i did not do it/ they put my daughter in foster care then tried to silence me and say i did it. nope. anyway, it all happened in 1991 and i am still pretty much estranged from my family because i refused to plead guilty to charges of aggravated assault on an officer but that is ok. I fought 2 cases to the supreme court in south dakota before i was 30. The judge who took away my daughter lost his license to be a judge.and i pretty much lost my pro se appeal to the supreme court because if i remember right his daughter was in the prosecutors office. So the moral of the story is I lost my daughter to a corrupt judge's decision and he lost his license to ever practice law again. Clearly, my daughter was the loser in all this but I felt like I got my just reward. He will never be able to do this to anyone ever again.

              I'm glad you won the case.  They can use the dumbest pretexts to steal peoples kids.  FBIAnon (or someone claiming to be him) spoke about

               the corruption.

              It is good that it is being acknowledged more.

              thank you for your story, I am sorry that you and your daughter had to go through that crap. I am glad that you refused to back down, it is an inspiration to me and sets a great example to the courts who think they can fuck with people willynilly.

            One thing I do want to make clear about Pizzagate that it took me a long time to learn is children are not the only victims. Unfortunately, we have many missing adults in the US as well who are overlooked on a daily basis. Are some connected ???? Maybe we need to find out.

             True, there are plenty of adult victims.  That is one of the bad things with the name "pedogate" as they aren't always children and the abuse isn't always sexual.  Traffickinggate would never catch on though.

              It's very easy to get people to buy in to human trafficking as a cause.  Educate them well on the subject.  Then after that has settled in, throw them a little Pizzagate.  That's the leap most need to make.

               I just meant as a label Traffickinggate would never work not that it is weak as a cause.  Your description is the best way to introduce people to the subject though.  It looks like that is the approach Trump is taking.  Flynn was too honest and told his intentions too quickly.  If you take the Fabian strategy and slowly work your way to the worst of it the public will react better.

                Flynn is solid.  I believe him to be working behind the scenes with Tillerson at the heart of the mess - the 7th floor aka Mahogany Row.

             We are ALL victims. Every law and regulation that is in place to funnel money away from the people, and the peoples basic needs, is enriching those who use corrupt power against us. Judges that let rapists and pedos go are endangering all of us. Policies that reduce our rights, NSA spying, surveillance is undermining our health and our economic wellbeing.
            </p>

             Think about this: How, in a "democracy" can state secrets even exist and not be an anathema undermining the very Constitution? And this is given as an excuse to avoid FIOAs and hide all sorts of shit.

             The political structure of two contentious parties is designed to deceive us and see our neighbors as enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our foreign policy for DECADES has been creating unjust wars, enemies created that are no threat to us, in countries to extract  Imperialistic gain for a tiny corporate few using our military and our tax dollars and our childrens lives.

             Raping children is vile, but the raping of children to get away with all of the above? 
Well, how are we not ALL victims?

             But what about the victims?  We can't have our government sell, pimp out, and ritually abuse people/kids and then not offer them any compensation.  How many people would end up suing the government for grievances?  We would practically need our own court system to handle all of the cases.  Some of these people will never recover from what happened.  The least we can do is try to offer them psychological and medical care after what they underwent.

              It's not a matter of suing the government. The native peoples here have not been successful in this, nor the descendants of slaves, so why would the victims of satanic ritual abuse be treated any differently? The important part is that this needs to end.

              There are many rescued victims. It's not just publicly known yet. They will get extensive reparations. Some may choose to remain in the witness protection program and never be declared alive, dead, or even found at all.
