<p>In a recent interview, a world-renowned exorcist said the sex abuse scandal currently rocking the Catholic Church is demonic in nature and likely to get worse before it gets better. “We are in for a long storm,” said Father Gary Thomas, the exorcist for the Diocese of San Jose, California.</p>
<p>Fr. Thomas\' training in Rome was the subject of the 2010 book The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist by Matt Baglio. The book was made into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins in 2011.</p>
<p>“It’s only going to get worse,” Father Gary Thomas told the National Catholic Register\'s Patti Armstrong. “But as bad as it is, it has to come out. It is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>According to Fr. Thomas, the age-old taunt — &quot;who’s going to believe you?&quot; — is a Satanic message that is meant to silence sexual abuse victims.</p>
<p>“Convincing people that no one will believe them is what Satan says when something is so outside the bounds of what is reasonable as to be unbelievable,” Father Thomas said. “Reading the accounts of what those children in Pennsylvania went through [as detailed in the Grand Jury Report] we wonder, how could this happen?” he continued. “It’s other-worldly—outside what people thought was possible — that’s what makes it demonic.”</p>
<p>For far too long, Catholics have seen this real-life horror story play out over and over again in their churches.</p>
<pre><code> In an article about becoming the solution, Jennifer Roback Morse, Ph.D., founder and president of the Ruth Institute, pointed out that if abusers thought people would speak up and be listened to, they would not have gotten away with so much for so long. If people had listened to poor “James,” when he was abused at 11-years-old, the now 60-year-old man abused by Father Theodore McCarrick, would not have had to suffer in silence for decades. “James tried to tell his parents,” Morse wrote. “They did not believe him, against the word of a respected priest. James began getting into trouble, doing alcohol and drugs. The family thought Father McCarrick could straighten him out. They encouraged him to spend more time with their son.” 
</code></pre>

<p>Fr. Thomas explained why sexual abuse of children is especially heinous. “By sexually abusing children, Satan desires to destroy the icon of the kingdom of God. He wants to destroy the most innocent version of humanity, which is the child,” he said.</p>
<p>The priest said that in his opinion, behavior that falls outside the bounds of what is conceivable -- like murder -- is also clearly demonic.</p>
<p>&quot;ISIS is a satanically driven organization because they have a premediated will to kill as many as possible who don’t believe their way of life,&quot; he explained. &quot;Even drug cartels are demonic and often pray to Satan to curse their drugs and they refer to Satan as their father and pray to him. I’ve seen documentaries on this and attended workshops with government task forces and prayed over some of the cops because of what they are dealing with.”</p>
<p>Fr. Thomas called on all Catholics to pray and fast and to act to triumph over the evil. “It can’t just be the removal of a few,” he said. “It has to be a complete reshaping of the paradigm of the way our Church governs; we need a complete cleaning up. We need a lay commission to set up an independent study. The bishops can’t do it; they don’t know how to do it.”</p>
<p>Father noted that he fasts and prays before his work as an exorcist. “Prayer, fasting and the sacraments are efficacious,” he said, “but it cannot be without the intentionality of action that comes out of prayer. We want prayer to change us and we are praying for a change in the whole Church, all the way up. And we are also praying for the victims who have gone through decades of terrible trauma.”</p>
<p>Fr. Thomas said Catholics need to be strong and be prepared to persevere for the long haul. “We are in for a long storm,” he said. “The clouds are just starting. However, our primary concern must be the victims who have been violated and firmly and without doubt prevent new victimizations from taking place in the future. There can be no tolerance for sexual misconduct perpetrated by clergy or lay people within the Church now or ever again.”</p>
<p>In the video below, Fr. Thomas gives a talk on the nature of evil at Our Lady of the Assumption Church in Turlock, California.</p>
<p>Please listen to the video.  Fr. Thomas tells you in his own words about how he was skeptical at first of the exorcism and also how many have opened the doors to allowing these demons into their lives, many times through no fault of their own.  I will include the Review of the Book here:   <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rite-matt-baglio/1013475181">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rite-matt-baglio/1013475181</a></p>
<p>This is pizzagate related because an ordained  priest, a member of the RCC, is telling us there is truth to the devil and there is much more coming regarding the sexual abuse of Our Children and also other evils that exist within the church.   This is one of the most important statements in the article:

            The Catholic Church has been apostate since its inception hence satanic. Is definitely evident by their actions.

             There have always been bad actors.  It is the people that make up the Catholic Church.  The leaders are satanists not the people.  I will not let them hijack what WE believe.  Jesus was not satanic.  He was the beginning and always will be from now until forever. Amen.

            I feel as though the spiritual aspects of demonic entities being real (just as high vibrational, light entities are real + infinitely more powerful) are so often overlooked in pizzagate / cabal discussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I appreciate this article bringing that to light. All of this is overflow of a spiritual warfare that many can't see / feel in other dimensions.

             I agree.  Yes, there is a war between good and evil right now.  We all have to do what we can to spread that news and for people to start changing their ways.  The devil must not win this fight, at all costs.

            Catholic Exorcist, Fr. Chad Ripperger, warns about Pizzagate and occult activities of the elite
           </p>
           <p>
            Last week, Fr. Chad Ripperger, a well known exorcist and traditional Catholic priest, gave a series of (very well illustrated) video lectures on the prophecies of Our Lady regarding our times. In Part I, he discusses the Podesta emails. His experiences as an exorcist have led him to do his own research on the subject of the globalist pedophile elite. His consultations with other exorcists have confirmed his conclusions that we are in the midst of a cosmic battle between good and evil, and the Satanic forces are extraordinarily strong and resistant to the Church's rite of exorcism and prayers.

            Qanon in November of last year discussed Epstein and his temple being a Satanic hub.
It's HIGHLY likely this is where the majority of evil occurs, the number of levels below the temple are significant as well, numerology plays a huge role in this, dates are highly important.  In three days it will be September 11th which is seventeen years since the twin tower tragedy.  Qanon specifically mentioned the number seventeen if I recall correctly and it is purported their initiations take place on an ascension of a seventeen step pyramid, please check it out and let me know what you think:

            To protect the children the head of the Church needs to step down. He is no supporter of children's rights. See his record in Argentina when children of dissidents in the 1970s were ripped from their parents and placed in military homes.

             Bergoglio''s hands are dirty from the dirty war yes, and the involvement with the disappearance of two priests but his silence on these stolen babies is deafening.  He has had numerous letters from the Grandmothers pleading with him and he refuses them.  This is the next thing that must be Broadcast Globally.  Many have read of this but not enough.  This is a copy of when they took the babies from unwed mothers decades ago in England.  That is why the movie Philomena was made.  No wonder he throws out a few I am sorry words but does nothing.  He is guilty of the same crimes.  This pope must be held accountable for his crimes.  There is a criminal pope in the Vatican.  Or should I say devil?

             Tom Monaghan sent $1M to the Papal Fundation and his present was an audience with the pope.  The Papal Foundation is headed by Msgr. Thomas J. Benestad who has been named by the Grand Jury as a rapist.   The head board member is Cardinal Wuerl.  Yeah, you are in great company Tom.

              Just like Trump has to deal with the dirty to achieve some kind of victory, maybe it's the same with Monaghan. He was briefly an orphan during the 1940s, has a strong faith in traditional Catholic values (no same sex marriages, Catholic values emphasized in money investments, prayers before business meetings,etc). Often a tactic to confuse the enemy is to surround your enemy with "friends" that eventually do you in like Wuerl and Benestad. Just like Trump, it's going to take someone with money like Monaghan to fund a revolt. Let's hope so, otherwise not much to hope for.

               We sure could use some monetary help and someone with a Big Voice.  Possibly he could be the one.  This Protest being organized should be attended by anyone in the vicinity.

               They may have been forced to do this.  I find it hard to believe that Monaghan is not dirty.  I hope it is done in good faith but his connections to the Papal Found. are suspect.  Possibly he has no clue?

               did a post on the Papal Foundation, I believe or it was featured in another post. Hopefully he will respond.

             I totally agree.  I have not been attending Church but those that still do they have been EXTREMELY  lax in not pressuring their pastors.   Things are getting really Hot right now, so this is the time to put a lot of pressure on them.

             Yep.  If possible Catholics should make their way to the Huge Protest that is being organized.  Anyone near there, should attend.  Those that are not Catholics should have an interest in this as well.  There is much of this within other religions as well and it may scare the HE77 out of them too.

             We here know that is true.  There are always those ready to discount the claims of the Victim.  I believe though that it is changing.  This priests video is amazing and should be shared. It will spread the horrors of the abuse and also will open the doors to belief in the Victims and also SRA.   I am so sorry you have not received The Justice You Deserve. &lt;3

             The time has come for Catholics to find out what "The Blood of Christ" means. If they Know, they are already working to end this heinous travesty. If they don't, they're about to find out their whole lives are fake and their houses built on sand.

             You know that I agree to your full statement.  I am hoping that they will rise up at the Upcoming Protest and show up for the Victims.  But also push the leaders in their states and diocese to finally get to the truth.  All Victims deserve Justice, especially Our Children, but the seminarians too, that were so horribly raped.  God is crying, he has never stopped, imo.  The devil needs to be driven out of the Vatican.

              I am a Catholic and the good Catholic women and men in my circle reject and deplore all forms of evil.  We cannot let them tarnish the faith of the faithful with the rotten fruit of the bunch.

               I agree.  Throw the bums out and lock em up along with the rest of the pedophiles.  Some may deserve the death penalty.  I don't care who they are.  Men of the Cloth My Bleeping Arse.

               Cathy O'Brian mentioned, in Trance, Formation of America,  two well known TV evangelists being pedophiles . Figured one was Jerry Falwell. Read long ago that Jerry Falwell's college received more money from the govt. than PBS.Didn't save the link..unfortunately. A university professor told me of a mother of one of his students sending  her daughter to a Falwell retreat...Jerry , himself , pulled her panties down and spanked her leaving bruises.After one of our big hurricanes, he stated it was because of lesbians....all over the news... This seems to me to be just the kind of talent our govt finds and promotes..

               Oh yes, I believe there are priests that do not rape.  They are doing what they can like this priest Fr. Thomas.  He is trying to spread the truth without coming out against the pope imo.  If he does, well, I believe he will be gone in a snap. I think they are scared to death and know that they will be attacked.  I think they are quietly trying to work against the evil as best they can.  Look what happened to Malachi Martin who wrote Windswept House He ended up dead.  And a horrible death it was.  The truth never came out.  There are those that have said that he died with stakes sticking out of his neck.  The death I believe was ruled a heart attack.  I think a heart attack could result from someone sticking stakes in your neck.  These are trying times and if we know of good priests we should stand up for them.  Thank you for your response.

                I have several books by Malachi Martin &amp; listened to Art Bell interview him years back... He was a fascinating &amp; brave man. I've never heard this about him being killed. Any sources you'd recommend where I can read up on this?

                 I have this from a good source that I cannot pass on. You will not find it on the internet.  If you do, let me know.  I have tried. I don't mention this often because I don't have a source.  But I believe the people that told me.

                 Things are turning I believe it.  This has taken decades if not longer.  The twisting of the truth is in their plan.  We must stop them in their tracks.  I believe this is a very opportune time and moment.   We must support our good priests.  Vatican II was a turnaround with more of a push towards what we are being taught today.  The devil is in the house.

               That is why this report on Fr. Thomas is so very important.  He is trying to spread the truth that the devil lives.  The pope is the devil as far as I am concerned.  Too bad Fr. Thomas cannot go into the Vatican and drive out the pope.  Certainly I doubt that the Lavender Mafia would not allow.  Mixing the Catholic Religion with prayers in the Masque is a definite No No and tells us more about who the pope really is.

                Billy Graham was the same way. He didn't even believe Jesus was the only way to heaven if I'm not mistaken. Sadly, I've heard the same about MLK recently. A LOT of Illuminati / CIA operatives posing as Christians these days.

                 There are many trying to change and spread insane lies to change the teachings.  The pope recently said there is no heaven and no hell.  Wishing will not make it so.  He is still going there.  I believe he just may well be the devil himself. That is why we must get behind the truth tellers.  I looked up the book review on Amazon as well, and there were around 231 reviews!  Imagine that many people responded.  it has a 4.5 Stars Review out of 5.  The reviews are amazing.

                   Not surprised.  Just like they are rewriting our history books.  Yeah, they bunched together history and geography and are now calling it Social Studies.  Ach, Hello?   What we must remember if they change the Bible is the Golden Rules that our parents taught us and pass them on.  These should never change.  But that may be difficult since they are constantly trying to turn Our children against us.  Imo, This Is War.
