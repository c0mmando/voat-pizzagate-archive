<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/7nd6.png">http://magaimg.net/img/7nd6.png</a> A letter concerning how Gabe Hoffman threatened to sue a chilld abuse victim. Says quite a lot now doesn’t it? </p>
<p>Conclusion: I believe we managed to spook somebody with “Operation Poltergeist.” So the deep state activated one of their controlled opposistion assets to try to discredit the case...by going after Enty.</p>
<p>This is the second time “they” have tried to undermine this case. First with that false flag attempt last summer involving CIA asset Patrick Little. Now this.</p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.
Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days:
Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           A letter concerning how Gabe Hoffman threatened to sue a chilld abuse victim. Says quite a lot now doesn’t it?
          </p>
          <p>
           Conclusion: I believe we managed to spook somebody with “Operation Poltergeist.” So the deep state activated one of their controlled opposistion assets to try to discredit the case...by going after Enty.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the second time “they” have tried to undermine this case. First with that false flag attempt last summer involving CIA asset Patrick Little. Now this.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.
Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days:
Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            (Midas Report) shares the same address as another website called “BRIDGES FOR PEACE,” where you can “VISIT ISRAEL WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR COMPUTER.” It appears to be a Christian Zionist organization. Keep in mind that Alex Jones has admitted on air to being a Zionist and claims that his Jewish-born wife, Violet, is a Christian—obviously of the Zionist-based Protestant strain. Jones is surrounded by Jews in his daily life, whether it’s by his sleazy Jewish friends in Hollywood like Charlie Sheen or Joe Rogan, or his Jewish lawyer Elizabeth Schurig, who also represents the ultra-Zionist Bronfman dynasty, one of the most powerful families in the world. The Bronfmans are also connected to Khashoggi in several ways, including through the Iran-Contra affair and Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold mining corporation, founded in 1983 by Khashoggi and Peter Munk (Jewish). Bronfmans again. I am happy that NXIUM went down.

            Jump to 24 minute mark and read the news paper. The official medical report is Gabe Hoffman’s basis for saying she wasn’t raped. His claim is wrong because several doctors and even Heather’s manager are calling BS on the Congenital Defect claim.

            gabe hoffmans argument on entys podcast is that he paid 30 dollars to secure heather oroukes medical records and that after reading them he does not believe that she died from being repeatedly raped she died from an abnormal narrowing of the small intestine that went undetected i personally am not buying that theory as there have been too many eye witness accounts that say otherwise

            but is DISCOUNTING his own blinds and then CHALLENGING people that believe this narrative. Fucking faggot got some balls someone needs to straighten his ass out he's going to become a real problem for conspiracy researchers, not that he hasn't already. He's really destroying everything many of us have worked for out here by simply going after the obvious. He's a real fucking piece of work. Now he's even ingratiated himself with Alex Jones. This psyop is just beginning.

             Sorry, if there’s sarcasm to be meant, I’m confused. Still feeling kinda sick and out of it today.

             I never claimed Spielberg was a culprit in the main incident mentioned in that blind. I do get SUPER annoyed when I see stuff implying that he was one of the people that was on the set of Rocky Road. Hence OP Poltergeist to try to stamp out the misinfo/misinterpretations.

              That sucks, I hope you feel better soon. No sarcasm intended, Gabe Hoffman is causing problems for this theory when we know, through your research primarily, that Spielberg fits the bill and Hoffman is pretty adamant he's not involved.

               I'm having a tough time myself being satisfied with my first comment. I used some expletives I'm not proud of but I just get so worked up about opposition from places it doesn't need to come from. As much as I would like to reword it I'm sorry I'll be deleting that comment.

             I'm really at my limit with Hoffman's mouth. I keep trying to have to stem MY mouth and reply to his faggot ass when he gets lippy with everyone that interacts with him and then he blocks them, typical faggot and bitch ass move, retreats, then pipes up his big ass mouth with threats of suing or violence (UFC match). This guys is a complete dolt and UNINFORMED NONCE. Whatever they do for "the cause" is going to be nominal and uneventful, they're only claim to fame is taking Bryan Singer off of one project. Fuck your free movie and the millions you spent on it that you had to give away for free because the studios wouldn't promote it, which means you DID intend on trying to make a profit for your bullshit that was widely known. Fuck off Gabe Hoffman your a shit stain.

             Asking about travels to a foreign country is a valid point when it comes to Giardia.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no record as to if Heather ever traveled out of country.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main red flag about the Giardia infection is that only Heather got infected.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the route of infection was truly oral fecal, it would be more plausible that her and others in her family were infected.
