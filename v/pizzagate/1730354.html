            This woman is very pretty on the outside, but holy crap, what a weirdo.  I only watched the short YT vid from user #PIZZAGATE, but I don't think I need to see more.  Just another pervy, talentless "artist" like Abramovic.  Sick people make sick "art".

            "When she muted the video she says something with "...boys..." ,and the temperature... and stirring is about Torture.
 They keep looking to "Jake Blue",  he is the only one "not eating" and looking up at her.
When she is done with the "recipe" she disappears from the video Raphael looks down,and the "father"  look to the left,like if she just left with "Jake Blue".
Then the father turns the look to Raphael.
That's not all  I get from this, but I prefer not say anything else."

            She, once again, refers to "something that had happened" around 58:00, when one of her lovers leaves her. Because he can't take place in her strange life anymore. He talks about the little games with her teenage sons.
I am watching this for nearly one hour now and the whole video is abusive. Not in terms of sexual violations but she films her children 24/7, even though they don't want her to. This is a repeating pattern througout the whole film. And she exposes thosse videos for everyone to see. Nobody would be allowed to do so. You always need the agreement of your "filmed objects". She acts as if their sons would be her belongings. It really hurts to watch it.

            they are talking about the father in past tense and there is a little conversation between her and her father where he states: "I believe it's because of your circumstances, that you`re fighting as a survivor … but you are a taker, not a giver …" (around 41:45).
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone know what he is refering to? Why is Maria Marshall a survivor?
           </p>
           <p>
            She, once again, refers to "something that had happened" around 58:00, when one of her lovers leaves her. Because he can't take place in her strange life anymore. He talks about the little games with her teenage sons.

           </p>
           <p>
            Oh my! At 1:17:31 you see one of her sons in rage, saying "I'm leaving!" and her answering: "You can't leave. Without you there's gonna be no film."  Breaks my heart how she just cares about herself and her movie, completely forgetting about the support that her boys need.
           </p>
           <p>
            She even takes away the comfort of a save house, when she acts, as if someone broke in. She calls the police for this "piece of art" and never tells her sons that is was fake.  She hurts her boys in so many ways.

            This is a perfect example of why we need an archive system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately I'm hindered in my research by only having access to a smart phone, not desktop laptop or even tablet.
           </p>
           <p>
            However whenever you go to a PG related site archive what you see. It never hurts to have multiple mirrors and save things both locally and to the cloud, and not all in one place, but utilize different methods and sites.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example there are anonymous pastebin type websites, or even pastebin itself. You can of course use your Google Drive if you have one, but remember it's linked to you, and Google has copies of whatever you put on there. People don't understand that cloud storage is just a term for storing files on someone else's server. They have physical access to said server so it can be very difficult to find a trust worthy cloud server. This is why when using methods like Google Drive you should utilize multiple varying methods of encryption. Put the files in a password protected zip file. Hide the password in an image only you understand, various methods of cryptology.

                 There is nothing to find out so far. If you search the internet for a connection between both of them, the only link you get is this thread. Could we, maybe delete the comments about Ricky Dearman? He needs his own thread, for sure!
