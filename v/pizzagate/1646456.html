            You deny yourself the power of influence.  Cary on in spite of the circumstances.  Be brave and never give up.  Never feel as though our struggle is in vain.  Will you live the rest of your life in peace knowing that this whole thing weighs equally upon your back if they are not brought to justice because you neglected your duties?  If we cannot win it is only because one of us who was called did not answer that call out of fear, weakness, sense of futility, or any number of other reasons which are all imaginary.  This is a big fight, but they can never fight us openly!  If they do we are winning!  We got Trump in.  Did you expect it to work out so easily?  This is a war.  we will fight in this war and their will be struggles.  Thank God everyday that you were blessed thus far not to be a victim as others have been if that is your fortunate case.  Pray and fight that there will be no more.  Never allow the thought to be entertained that puts you back to sleep for it will be in the Devils service that you will be.
