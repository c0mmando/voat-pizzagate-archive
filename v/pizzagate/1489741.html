<p>We don\'t know if this website is a complete fake, or completely real, but whatever the case, it could change the world. Here\'s how:</p>
<p>If journalists write about it in a way that makes pizzagate look stupid, then it will be very bad. If they write about it in a way that makes it appear that Russia is behind it, that would be bad. If they write about it and say that we are trying to stir up trouble, it will be bad. Really, there is only one scenario that\'s good, and that\'s if they write about it accurately. The fact is that we don\'t know anything about it, and we are all curious, skeptical, and afraid for our country and afraid that there are people inside the US who want to undermine our democratic republic.</p>
<p>The one thing we are pretty sure of, is that it\'s not Russia. But the one thing the media has been lying about lately... is Russia.</p>
<p>Now, it could all be a big ol\' nothingburger.</p>
<p>BUT... a worst case scenario is pretty scary. It\'s right here if you want to read it:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1488889">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1488889</a></p>
<p>But let\'s hope that the worst case scenario won\'t happen. In fact, lets do more than hope.</p>
<p>I want to ask you to consider very seriously what is at stake right now. This is one of the most precarious situations our country has seen in a very long time. Our freedoms are this close to being taken away. Many people HATE Donald Trump, and would be frothing at the mouth to see him be taken out. Billions of dollars hang in the balance. Th entire world is wondering what will happen with the next president.</p>
<p>We can do something. We can demand that our journalists tell the truth, instead of the lies we\'ve been hearing. I say we jump in front of this, and in front of the electoral college vote, and in front of the FBI, and in front of the CIA, and in front of the media and tell them what we want.</p>
<p>Here\'s a couple lists of email addresses for news organizations and journalists. Please consider telling our story to these people. I\'m trying to get the word out, I know you are too. Here are the people who can help or hurt us. Let\'s give them some encouragement from our side:</p>

            Youtube poster Sargon Of Akkad posted an amazing, objective video on child trafficking that simultaneously makes a compelling case for Pizzagate without actually taking a position on Pizzagate itself. If you want to start the process of red pilling people to the real issue, the rampant pedophilia among the elite, share the shit out of his video.

            The American people, as a whole,  lost their faith in mainstream media organizations long ago. As a nation we must stand up to them and demand truth! We must demand they cut their ties to corporate interests and serve the people with fair, honest, unbiased reporting on the state of our country. But how? How do we create a movement of people large enough to create the change we all want to see? I am surrounded by people who are too burdened by life (unemployment, debt, heroin, meth, homelessness, illness, raising their grandchildren, etc) to educate themselves on the dire situation our nation is in. They don't have the energy or the drive to stand up for themselves anymore. To be successful on a national scale we need people willing to take a stand. And when I try to explain the reality of life in our country...they just call me crazy and offer me the tinfoil. Very soon the government will take away our right to free speech, and the people in my small town will not even realize it.
