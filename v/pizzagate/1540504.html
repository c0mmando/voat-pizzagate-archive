If the Colonial Dames and DAR are connected to pedophilia and child abuse, that might explain why citizen researchers are being silenced.

Please read on...</p>
<p><strong>Who is David Shurter?</strong><br />
David Shurter is known as a former victim of sexual abuse, pedophilia, and mind control. In the video below, he specifically mentions that many rituals and abuse took place at Hummel Park in Omaha, NE. He later mentions that the abuse is carried through generations and his family is related to the Colonial Dames. The Colonial Dames were part of the Daughter of the American Revolution (DAR). David was surprised to learn from his interviewer that there’s a plaque at Hummel Park dedicated to DAR. </p>
<p>The plaque (or marker) was recently rebuilt by the United States Daughters of 1812 in Nebraska in collaboration with the Daughters of the American Revolution who placed the Pierre Cabanne marker on the other side. Both markers were rededicated in a ceremony held October 11, 2008 (DAR Anniversary).</p>

<p><strong>What is DAR... who are the Colonial Dames?</strong><br />
The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) is a lineage-based membership service organization for women who are directly descended from a person involved in the United States\' struggle for independence. DAR was formed on October 11, 1890. Located in Washington, D.C., DAR Constitution Hall was built in 1929 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985.  
</p>
<p>The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America was founded in 1891 and is an American organization composed of women who are descended from an ancestor &quot;who came to reside in an American Colony before 1776, and whose services were rendered during the Colonial Period.&quot; The organization has 45 corporate societies and over 15,000 members. The national headquarters are at Dumbarton House in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p><strong>What is Hummel Park?</strong><br />
Hummel Park, which is said to be one of the most haunted places in Omaha, NE and rumored to be an ancient Native American burial ground, was once the site of a fur trading post run by Jean Pierre Cabanne in 1823. It was later named in tribute to J.B. Hummel, a long time superintendent of the Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a connection to Hillary Clinton?</strong><br />
Per the link below, [HRC] “earned numerous Girl Scouts merit badges and won community service awards from the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and was interested in politics from a young age.” This is a tangent, but Sasha Lord and others have been linked to the Girl Scouts by #pizzagate researchers recently. Also, HRC attended Georgetown University, was a Rhodes Scholar, and met Bill Clinton there. The Colonial Dames are headquartered in Georgetown. There are other potential connections with her father, but I\'m trying to keep this focused on the Colonial Dames, DAR, and Hummel Park. </p>

            Just have to add to the record here my own experience with the DAR.
           </p>
           <p>
            My grandmother, great-grandmother and aunt were all members of the DAR. The DAR in my town brought in a woman Army Colonel who was a doctor stationed in the Middle East during Gulf War I specifically to talk to their members about the systemic physical and sexual abuse of women forced to wear hijabs to cover the visible evidence. At the time, they were the only ones talking about it. Nationwide they also take care of Veterans in numerous ways, overseas, at the VA, and in homeless shelters. They are patriots who take the well-being of this country very seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there any evidence at all of any cases where the DAR was investigated for or charged with crimes in the past?

            Hmm. Well, I have an aunt and a very dear friend who are a part of DAR, and while I no longer would be shocked by anything, I KNOW my aunt is not a pedophile and my dear friend is quite outspoken against pizzagate, I would highly doubt she is either. I cannot speak to the higher ups but my aunt has always spoken highly of the organization that (supposedly) teaches patriotic appreciation to its members.
That said, probably anything is possible since the world is so messed up.
