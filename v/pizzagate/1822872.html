            Pizzagate will just be another footnote in Alt history. Nothing will happen to the perps, they rode out the storm, the people got bored and moved on, Trump got/ or was co-opted and turned on his supporters - the Elites won again!

             I have a sinking suspicion that a lot more info is coming in the very near future... my hope is that the snowball is moving too quickly. While the public search trends cooled down, those who are woke (like us, YouTubers &amp; Reddit/Chans) will not go back to sleep.

            Darkmath is right, now the hype has died down its time to continue to research and continue to slowly educate the masses until such time that msm will switch from disinformation to damage control. Hopefully we can prevent them doing exactly that by calling them out and push for reform but that's all a pipe dream right now.

             Agreed 100%... the fact that they continue to softly "fight" this and continually reference Russia/Fake News as the root cause means that there is still an active threat against the lid being blown clear off.

            Right.  I think it's good that you have taken the initiative to relay this perception into words we can all digest because I know that everyone has noticed this drop in viewership and participation.  And you are correct on every point,  it is simply fatigue,  there is more than enough information for the world to make  their own logical decisions,  maybe not necessarily arrests because as you have most likely ascertained by now this is a deep state operation,  wikileaks only provided the scratch under the surface for some to observe.  This fatigue is also overshadowed by the looming spectre of war,  which is always a sobering news item that detracts from all the rest.
           </p>

            Definitely take heart in the advice DarkMath has conveyed because God knows that's the truth.  Alefantis middle name is more than just a reference to himself and is a metaphor for the whole show,  we have struck sharply,  and swiftly,  at the Achilles Heel of the entire establishment.  Who knows how much time these revelations will take to rumble through the halls of justice none of us know anything except that it is awful slow, but the point is the people here and elsewhere involved in this WORLDWIDE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION is a pivotal,  poignant and prominent event in the history of the world and each and every one of you should hold that pride that is the spark of righteousness and God.

            It has been 5 years since the Hampstead Children shared their testimony and noone has forgotten about them,  likewise,  this will never go away either.

            Don't forget as well,  there will most likely be an enormous Pizzagate uptick we can ride from this viral phenomenon generated from Ronald Bernards testimony too.

            "It does not take a majority to prevail... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men."  Sam Adams.  Kevin Annet (ITTCS) said this in his podcast today.

            I don't think anyone said anyone's giving up on research, just that the public isn't maintaining interest in PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            I doubt if the actions or attitudes of any small group has much effect on the PG research movement or on world society. A lot of people have a lot of commitment to ending major corruption. I'm one. I've been at it since about 2000.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a popular saying by globalist Margaret Mead or someone about the power of small groups of determined people to accomplish great things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides determination, I think it helps a lot to have discipline, cooperation and sensible planning. Planning takes discipline you know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an example of a potential group plan:
           </p>
           <p>
            Goal: End major pedophilia corruption

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Recruit people to go into public office to end pedophilia corruption.

            </li>
            <li>

             Correct! You ACTUALLY read and understood my post... I'm not suggesting we give anything up, quite the contrary. It appears that some of the responses to this thread failed to understand/comprehend my message/concern.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like your thought process, and in fact, a good friend of mine is about to enter into the world of politics on the West Coast - with a strong track record, he should ascend quickly and he is very much on our side.

            We must remain vigilant, and I hope you are right Dark Math.  Unfortunately, the attention span of a human is now less than  a goldfish, so it better be on one hell of a massive scale when when it happens.  Drabs and dribbles are useless.  It has to be all or nothing.

           </p>
           <p>
            Well I'm sorry but that just isn't ok and is probably a shill tactic. Not accusing you but this is what they do.
Why do you think the elite "hide in plain sight"? They know that our thoughts and especially subconcious thoughts, create the reality we live in. We're constantly told humans are pathetic creatures, but we have literally all got fucking paranormal type powers inside of us. So they plant seeds in the minds of the masses that they're some huge, all encompassing secret society with supernatural powers and they're completley untouchable. That's the seed they plant in our minds. Putting 9/11 in the simpsons, all that kind of shit is how they bring their plans into reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there's anything I've learned from this it's that our positive thoughts are essentially what creates reality. It's why /pol/'s meme magic works, it's why they put flouride in our water, to calcify our pineal glands and keep us in chains and never reaching our full potential. They make sure we can't discover our third eye and the extreme redpills that come with it!
           </p>
           <p>
            I know for an absolute fact that these evil fucks will be brought to justice. Maybe not in a few months, thats ridiculous.
But it will happen soon, simply because I believe it. If you all start to believe it too then maybe we can hurry this process up a bit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Believe it or not but God is real, Satan is real and it's a very harsh truth to discover. But once you realise we can literally make anything we want happen with positive beliefs in good, we can achieve anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I'm just sick of seeing negativity and discouragement on this forum.
Do your own research into the third eye and things will begin to line up for you too.

             Great post and that is what pisses them off is we are like dogs on a bone.  Some people do give up, but others push on. Our goal is to present the facts and red pill the nation. We are going to win this. Justice will come maybe not today, tomorrow or the next, but it is coming. Whoop!

             Sorry you feel that way, this is:
            </p>
            <p>
             A.) Not intended to discourage... quite the opposite
B.) Not a shill tactic (it's not like I posted this to Facebook or some stupid shit)
C.) More stuff is coming, we're making progress, I was merely commenting on the public search trend diminishing... getting the masses involved is key. It's a call to action. We need more red pills.

             While your beliefs are yours and should be respected - I'm a realist. The religious aspects you bring to the table may work very well from your POV, but I'm interested in facts/cold hard truth and bombshells.
            </p>
            <p>
             People too easily confuse realism with negatively/pessimism on here. I don't need to research the third eye to have things "line up"... if this is the case and you are truly enlightened, please begin to post on Voat!!! Unique points of view and new submissions are what we need to keep the snowball building!

              I didn't mean to direct this comment only to you, sorry o.p. I was really just speaking my mind openly. I'll get used to posting though :)

              I guess at the end of the day my message is to think positively.
It's exactly what they don't want us to do. Believe they are on their way out and they will be.

              I too am a realist in my opinion. But the past few months and even years have completley flipped reality upside down for myself and a lot of others it seems!

            DarkMath wanted to join you in your reasoned but kick ass and take no prisoners responses. This seems like it has died down because Eric Schmidt Google &amp; Youtube literally demonetized and threatened everyone. Facebook as well hired a goon squad such as Snopes to scour posts and remove content.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are suppressing speech &amp; violating 1st ammendment protections. This country was built on fighting for these very principals. There are many white hats inside government that are trying to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no turning back from this and they know it. They are bidding time. As DarkMath stated Chaffetz was outed as a poser bought off as part of extortion 17 when 30 seal team members were killed in August of 2011. All bin laden raid Seal Team 6... dead men can't talk. Heroic service members just stepped forward last week to expose Obama &amp; HRC and others lies over the deaths of all these heroes. Bigger scandal than Benghazi which happened one year later. It has been suppressed all this time.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want your blood to boil find the video of Joe Biden congratulating himself &amp; Obama on the bin laden raid. Then a few months later watch how inside an airbase in the dark of night,  100's if not 1000 soldiers in military fatigues quietly remove the caskets draped in the American flag containing the bodies of at least 30 heros that were in one helicopter shot down in Afghanistan. Research extortion 17
           </p>
           <p>
            Cowards take advantage of children. They are caught and exposed and this will not be buried. Just saw today that independent researchers and media are focusing to expose Eric Schmidt. Since he likes to play puppet master as well as his companies. He also has a foundation very interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            So everyone realized these tech companies are a house of cards in many ways. That is the reason Trump went after the H1b visas they hire low wage from out of country and most of their workers are on brutal contracts with no benefits living in cramped apartments together. It is not what it seems. They have a monopoly and they want to keep it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suggestions: Remove Google from your apps. Choose a search engine like DuckDuckGo or some other one that does not sell your search results. Research Eric Schmidt &amp; google in wikileaks. He met Assange personally.

             Great post! My project today is banking. Big banks.  I have been doing research on the Krim kids' murders in Manhattan. Don't think nanny killed kids, but CIA blk hats. Daddy knew too much against Illuminarti. Had to put Daddy in place. Same with Aurora killings. Daddy was getting ready to testify so had to take his kid out of his PhD program and stuff him in prison.  These revolved around big banking just like Dutch banker said. Be very afraid of what they can do.  Just another piece of the puzzle.

            This shit has been going on for 5,000+ years. It isn't going to do a 180 in 6 months.  I'd love to see heads roll as much as anyone else.  Unfortunately, I think this is a true battle between good and evil and may go on beyond our lifetimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can give you a list of 50 names whose heads I'd like to see on a pike.  But the reality is, we may see few of these.  IMO, this is a shadow war against a shadow government.  As open as the kimono is, there are still some reactions we likely won't see.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay strong.  Read between the lines. Don't believe the media.  Question everything. Check BZO.

            The most important thing we can do is gather and organize the most incriminating and damning evidence and put them in a easily digestible context so that we can redpill as many as possible. We should also document all the censorship. The censorship is so much more damning because it just shatters the illusion of the media being anything other than a controlled propaganda tool.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we need to separate the disinfo from the concrete evidence.

            One problem is that an investigation o the antics of d.c. scum has opened up into a world wide hunt for all pedo-ciminals who traffic and abuse/torture/kill  children. granted, we are concerned about every child who is affected by this atrocity, but our focus should remain on our own soil. and it is soiled.

             Many of us here fighting alongside you have their "own soil" too.  This is a collective.  Whosoever gets the break will lead and  the rest will follow.  This is not a fight contained within our own backyard - all of our lands are contaminated, all of us fight together.

            Trying to make voat more like reddit: shitty content, filler news, etc...

           <p>
            They know voat is a threat, or they wouldnt be so present here. We must adopt new ferver to attack the shills' ability to slide threads either way; really use those down/upvotes effectively and encourage good work more often, and thuroughly.

            Perhaps we aren't providing enough brain power per person, but we musnt let this lose steam or believe that we will be anything but victorious; do not take the blackpill.

            I can see why many people feel that way. The arrests are kept so quiet. We're not getting new things to research or those emails. So much has been discovered already. I feel like we're almost at a standstill because nobody will take all of this info and start an actual investigation. Anything to do with pedogate is censored. Plus, we're losing people in office that were on our side. Such as Chaffetz. Trumps being all weird right now. I don't even know what direction he's going.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't let those bastards win. I can just see James Alefantis smiling, thinking that this is going to die down. We need to slap the smiles off their faces by not giving up.

              Unfortunately, the ones I would like to see most, such as the Podesta's, Clinton's. Obama and James Alefantis, etc..., probably will get away with it. They hold too much power.

            In this world of instant gratification, we need to realize that we have to be patient with these investigations, lets keep building our evidence and connecting the suspects, because the more evidence we have, the harder they'll fall.  Patience is key to a good investigator and building a solid case.

             I agree 100%... patience is key, and while this is all likely happening in back channels, my biggest fear is that nothing is happening on the "other side" when it comes to a full investigation.

            Well the shill meta is currently to discourage everyone here. Just keep holding on to your evidence and beliefs that this will come forward over time. If there's something I've learnt it's that politics and justice takes time. You're all stronger than this!

             Like I mentioned before, I'm not terribly concerned with US here on Voat... folks @ Reddit and the true YouTubers/Twitter heads that are pushing this forward... just a concern I noticed in the general public. It doesn't take long for sheep to wander to the next patch of grass. "Oooooh, look! Honey Boo Boo's mom is skinny now"

              The same sheep will come flocking to our side when critical mass and a tipping point are reached. Frankly, your point is the best argument ever for increasing the investigation into Hollywood. Maybe we need a mass letter campaign to Angelina Jolie -- wasn't she fooled by a trafficker who got her one of her adopted kids?

            Hmmm, didn't many folks talk of or agree with a deadline of May first for some kind of action by Trump? What does "time is out" look like? Would the move be to band together against Trump to get him to at least not be able to ignore it? Would the media be forced to cover that angle? Could a "Tea Party Town Hall Invasion" type protest event wherever a singular chosen Republican shows to force a statement, one at a time, happen?

            I recently posted a thread which links an article about how the History Channel is doing a show on conspiracy theories and one of them is about the CIA's involvement with drug trafficking. Well I think I posted it atleast. It's my first time doing so and as of yet I haven't seen it in Pizzagate. Anyways, my idea is to flood the comment section at HC with links to anything Pizzagate related so as to imply that if one conspiracy has truth to it then so can others, ie the CIA - drugs - Iran-Contra - Franklin Scandal to Pizzagate. It's all related.

             . Thanks for posting; if you have any questions about the submission guidelines or how to make a post that satisfies them, please ping me and I will try to help. Our guidelines are onerous, which allows us to remove many shitposts from shills and trolls without violating Voat's commitment to anti-censorship. But they can be a challenge at times and mods can seem obstructionist.
            </p>
            <p>
             One tip: It's always better to use a Discuss post that allows you to edit the body of the post and embed multiple links supporting your thesis than a Share a Link post. When you try to add support in comments, it can end up buried and mods may never see it (especially if they are trying to mod from work...ahem...or have a lot of posts to vet). Mods rarely touch comments, per Voat rules, and frequently don't read them all.

             Limited attention spans paired with limited understanding and a general acceptance of the MSM... it's painful to watch, but, at the 30,000 foot view, we're living in a pretty dumb world.

            The only thing that's going to make this mainstream again is either arrests, or more leaking. The people are falling back to sleep again.

             The most mainstream it's every really been (thus far) has been the Elite's MSM campaign for damage control...
In the meantime the case builds higher, wider and deeper then every before.

             Yeah, it's great that more content is bubbling up on YT and Twitter... my issue is the global search trend paired with decreased viewership. Partly due to the censorship you mention, but, the search trends don't lie...
            </p>
            <p>
             We need a bombshell to really get this going again, on a massive scale. Something that deflates their censorship algorithms.

              I believe the networks of the likes of Shanta Driver, Yvette Falarca, Mayor Arreguin, Professor Bikelock, BAMN, BLM, Antifa and their 1001 seed groups like 'Refuse Fascism' funded by AfGj (Soros), converge into teen trafficking and grooming, for international radical protests groups; that then leads to those more directly involved in grooming, recruiting for terrorist groups like ISIS etc., international mafia, sex/human/body organ/drug trafficking.  Find those ties and you find the MOAB to drop.

               This is true... a few years ago I would have argued that point. But, after seeing numerous examples of "frozen" YouTube views and the demonetization of channels based on nothing more than content preference by "Gatekeepers" - you bring up a valid point.

            We should not have to have steam. Why are the FBI not doing  their fucking job? Trump should have been all over PG. He is running out of time quickly. It's been 100 days already and HRC and her brood are still fucking little kids like is normal. Citizens are going to be forced to take matters into their own hands if shit doesn't start happening soon. Before you know it we will be at war with Russia and PG will be a footnote on Trump's legacy. Fucking LE is a joke they wouldn't arrest a billionaire if they caught him in bed with their own 3 yo. I welcome a nuclear war on a global scale. Put an end to the mass destruction known as humanity.

              Yeah. Problem is they've entrenched themselves, thrown up barricades, sand bags, fortifications, walls, moats, turrets. We have...very little, and we're easily demoralized. This type of issue takes intense public pressure for years

               along with
              </em>
              potential allies on the inside. We need a strong figure to rally behind. Some thought it was Trump, but regardless of his personality and style (which would be PERFECT for our movement -- a bull-headed monster to stomp and rage at the demons) we're getting mixed signals and static. We need a face. Unfortunately it's difficult to get a face in a world controlled by opposition media.

             I hope you are not alluding to waiting years to start seeing high level arrests. I think (to them) this is a waiting game. And the clock is against us not them.

              I thought that too for a while but the pace has really picked up lately. For example the Jason Chaffetz story. Last week I was pissed they got to Chaffetz. This week the truth came out. It looks like Clinton and Co extorted Chaffetz to cover up the Extortion 17 investigation. I went from dejection to elation in about 5 seconds. Not only is Clinton going to get it, all the people she extorted are going to get it as well. The entire Congress is coming apart at the seems. Both parties are involved and they know their Goose is Cooked. It's going to bring down the entire government for all intents and purposes. You get the idea.

             <p>
              This Chaffetz story has to be about the 100th time this has happened in the past 6 months. Something comes out, the Deep State puts up a smoke screen and the next week we find out it's worse than anything we ever expected. We plumb new depths and it happens again. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.
             </p>
             <p>
              After a while it's obvious, this fucker's going down hard. What we're seeing is a Deep State death spiral and it's picking up steam. Muahahahahahaha

               If Chaffetz is two-facing you gotta wonder if Gowdy is too. Who is left to termite the place from the inside except maybe some of Trump's crew, it'll have to be swarmed

                They never got to Gowdy. He wouldn't go out of his way to make them look like idiots if he had been compromised.
               </p>
               <p>
                The entire clown fraud racket in DC depends on narcissistic sociopaths and the occasional psychopath so the Deep State can catch them in compromising positions and control them via extortion. Well adjust alpha males need not apply. I think the only reason Gowdy is there is he could come out of this looking like the next President of the United States.

                  I'm not. I'm just going off instinct. Always go with the angry well educated white guy with no money. They're smart enough to see the top of the mountain but too poor to get there. That generates emotions that could crack a diamond.

             Oh, no, I get it... sorry if I wasn't clear. I'm not losing patience or motivation - the first half of my post was expressing concern with others who are. The YouTube channels that were covering this heavily and have now backed off. The lack of new info.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the lack of new info doesn't truly concern me, because we have SO MUCH that SHOULD be investigated - but it isn't, because all of the protection mechanisms are still in place.

              I understand what you mean now. Thank you for clarifying. Don't worry, the lack of coverage on Youtube is a direct result of Google/Eric Schmitt/Alphabet demonetizing all videos until they can figure out a way to more subtly suppress the people's voice.
             </p>
             <p>
              The big picture is they're stalling because they don't know what to do. They can't do that forever. They'll have to get off the fence pretty soon, probably late Spring, early Summer. I'm fairly certain they'll do the right thing and take the muzzle off the people's voice.

              These people are smart enough to figure out how to get on the right side of History. There's immense pressure building up on the tectonic plates of power in this country. Just because nothing's visible doesn't mean there isn't a fuckton of pressure way down low. The truth is building up and when it goes it's going to go all at once. It's gonna be the biggest "earthquake" the world has ever seen.

               Yay DarkMath, absolute logic hero. Youtube can't sustain this imo, people are moving and content creators are dying off. Let's face it im sure there's literally thousands of companies that would pay big bucks to Google to advertise on the likes of Pewdiepie, this is a sticky mess right now and no one is happy.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think there is a general feeling of deflation amongst a lot of groups that believe that trumps campaign promises would make it to his policy verbatim, I don't want to jump to conclusions but his swamp drainage needs a lot of work it's not a pretty sight.

               We can't undo knowing what we know now, I have been less active here on voat in recent weeks but I managed to red pill my whole family and some friends during that time, so the fight continues. But apparently it's against 8500 lucifarians, not far of the subscriber count for this sub.  So we're currently engaged 1:1 against the hyper elite whom have a 200 year or more head start, we're still in the first chapters of this story.

                Great job red pilling!! At your rate, we will awaken the peeps sooner than later. My family still thinks I am hallucinating and need to be committed. It's ok, one day they will think I am brilliant!

                is correct.  The slaves are starting to percolate from the lower levels.  Don't forget to buy ammunition when you pick up milk at Walmart!

                 I have been dropping subtle red pills for some time now, not specifically all related to PG but media &amp; power structures in general. Sweeden or could i say the new republic of cuckistan has been instrumental in this process, from beacon of western civ to rape capital where 40% of women dont feel safe walking the steets and its never on the TV news gets the gears turning. Why is no one doing anything and why are we not up in arms over it. Deprogramming takes a long time too fast and cognitive dissonance kicks in. Pick small battles until they start to question things themselves.

                We've got more than 1:1, LostandFound. :-)  Check the sidebar -- we're at 13,272. Now granted, 300 of those are probably PGisStupid alts that are in the ban box, but still. We've got eyeballs. We just need to get organized about how, when and where to share the evidence we've gathered. We could significantly increase the "pressure building up on the tectonic plates of power" as

                Yep. And I read people like Mike Cernovich and Bill O'Reilly are out shopping a new YouTube/Fox News competitor. Google can't afford to do what they're doing for much longer.

                This thing kind of reminds me of IBM and the Main Frame computer. IBM and Digital ruled the roost. They never thought anybody would challenge their dominance in a million years. When Bill Gates offered to buy some rinky dink DOS operating system for some pathetic kind of new micro-computer that only Tin Foil Hat Wing Nuts who work in their parent's garages probably would buy they jumped at the chance. The fools would probably try to use them to start new business in some pathetically sad hippy haven south and a little east of San Francisco.

                 Great analogy hopefully happens sooner than later, google lost its appearance of giving a shit a long time ago. Side note - Still don't know what to make of Cernovitch, my gut tells me not to trust him and I can't seem to shake it.

                  Me too. I strongly suspect both Mike and George Webb have some foreign sponsorship if you know what I mean. But that's ok. The Jews(tm) are smart enough to have contingency plans. And I think Mike and George are "The High Road".

                  And I'm not anti-Semitic, I have many Jewish(tm) relatives through marriage, don't ask, it's complicated. I've been invited to a few Jewish weddings. I love Israel too and have even been there. I understand their position in all this. You can't blame them for playing both sides, they have to. They have nowhere else to go.

                  What is unconscionable however are the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicates. They are the native born gatekeepers in all this and what they did is High Treason. In 10,000 years they will look back at the Bush-Clinton Syndicate as the purest form of Treason History has ever seen.

                  I don't want to imagine what their punishment will be but it's going to be so bad I don't even want to think about it.

                The real insanity of this thing is I've been hoping I'm NOT right. I think about this time last year and ignorance is bliss.

                My heart is so broken and shattered right now at finding out what these people did. I'm angry and disgusted at the same time. It's the weirdest feeling. The whole country's going to have to go through the 5 stages of grief type thing. It's like watching someone you loved your entire life die and get put in the ground. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

                Whatever or whoever it was killed this country. We'll never be  the same.

               Thanks for your analysis.  I also believe in the pressure building.  Everything on our culture/society that tries to legitimize these folks and their behavior only acts to infuriate and embolden the folks who simply want the whole cart turned over.  I believe it also draws more in and pressure will continue to grow and grown organically until justice is served and we all see the shame and humiliation of the perps and their apologists.   So many many people will not let this rest until this is the case or until the entire table is turned over.  In the end, everyone knows that the masses have the power and that this genie is out o' the bottle.

               I agree. As soon as we hit the "Tipping Point" to widespread public knowledge, all the protectors and hangers-on will start fleeing the Evil Ship like rats. They'll try to pretend they were on our side from day 1.

                How I wish that were true, however, I can't help but feel like we're losing the battle. Fewer alternative media channels discuss it, fewer investigative leads are being developed, greater obstacles to the investigation of the ones discovered are being put in place, and, as this video illustrates, it would appear as if Trump himself is compromised and therefore unlikely to be bringing anyone down without bringing himself down in the process. I hope I'm wrong, I hope desperately that, as many have supposed, it's just a matter of lining up their ducks to take down this network. But, when you consider who's implicated, namely royalty, the vatican, high ranking justices and politcians, lawyers, doctors, executives, etc... it seems highly likely that they would and could set fire to the world if anyone were to hold them to account.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's the whole point of this arrangement imo. While undoubtedly there are many sadistic sickos willingly partaking in pedogate, I suspect it's mafia-style blackmail, having the ultimate dirt on someone, literally owning their soul. You can't whistleblow once you've fucked kids, or trafficked in them; I mean you might get immunity but you'll be reviled and a de facto persona non gratis anywhere you go if you're so lucky as to not be met with local vigilante justice. I suspect everyone involved knows this. This isn't big tobacco, no one will be congratulating the guy who suddenly grows a conscience. What they'll be admitting to, while important it be known and exposed, is nevertheless too reprehensible to be forgiven.
               </p>
               <p>
                Therein lies our impasse: we have a mountain of circumstantial evidence, enough to warrant a proper investigation by some authoritative agency capable of bringing perps to justice, but said agencies are all headed by people who are compromised, complicit, or beholden to those who they would be policing. In the absence of any likely whistleblowers and  when you consider the possibility that this scandal got Assange kidnapped and Wikileaks co-opted by the CIA in October, after these leaks and their associated revelations took momentum, it begs the question, "What exactly is going to happen in order for anything to actually come of this scandal and our citizen investigations?"
               </p>
               <p>
                I really want to be wrong. I really want to discover great investigative work being done by someone which has a hope of blowing this thing wide open. Unfortunately, I too have grown somewhat disilusioned with the prospects of any justice being meted out. People seem less curious than ever and the stigma of pizzagate as fake news has permeated the mainstream making those I would attempt to red-pill more and more likely to have a preconceived idea of the very topic as Russian propaganda. It's a culture war, not merely an information war, and our alternative society or culture of people not subscribing to the MSM narrative is becoming increasingly derided. I still wholeheartedly subscribe to the belief in this as reality, and relish the opportunity to discuss it with like minds but it's nevertheless something i've started giving up on red-pilling people about. I will link them to the executive summary and leave it at that. If they have questions I'm always happy to try and answer them, but I'm not interested in being pedantic about this subject anymore; i find it leads nowhere. I hope others are having more luck as of late than I am.

                 I know what you mean. The leads have slowed. I'm not sure citizen investigators can "solve" the case unless hard evidence like photos start leaking. I believe our challenge is making people aware of what's happening. People don't even have to believe PG is real, per se, but they have to notice the censorship and web of lies and say, something isn't quite right here. "Pizzagate" could become a rallying cry for free speech and alternative media. Even if it's "I disagree with what you have to say but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sometimes it's important to take a break from PG for your own sanity, and the sake of your personal relationships. But there's always impersonal options to spread the word: write #pizzagate on dollar bills, print flyers and leave them around, fake accounts on social media.

                  I hadn't thought of putting the hashtag on money, it's a good idea. And thank you, you're right; it's easy to despair but what really is the alternative, turning a blind eye to some of the most disgusting crimes imaginable? A little hiatus helps, I'm just disappointed upon my return from one with the seemingly stagnant state of the investigation.

                Yep, exactly. Someone else gets it. I bet there are thousands of people just waiting in the wings to come forward. I know in the case of the CIA many people want to talk but they signed non-disclosure agreements and don't want to end up in jail or worse:

                The most unnerving thing is the MSM like Fake Jake Tapper spouting his bull shit. He didn't do anything wrong but his silence is deafening. The entire MSM's silence is deafening. I highly doubt any major name like Fake Jake or Rachel Maddow will have jobs after this does down. They will have zero credibility and be a daily reminder of how wrong the MSM was.

            In the real world arrests don't happen based on ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theories. The FBI/NYPD Weiner laptop story is also fictitious.

            It leaves you in the position of coming to internet forums of conspiracy insanity like this one and talk nonsense while reality goes on independent of your ridiculous beliefs.
