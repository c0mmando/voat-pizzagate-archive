             I have never posted in ANY forum.  I have been full time lurker until today.  I just wanted some help chasing serious leads and sorting through data.  I've been watching the internet sleuths uncover a loot of things in 10 months.  This was the wrong forum.  Deleted over not stating the obvious.

            You have to explain how your post relates to pizzagate.  You will be deleted if you do not provide that.  I want to help your post stay up. Good luck on your first voyage.

             I guess I didn't get the message in time.  I'm not sure it was a good idea to put even this little bit out there.  Like I say Ive been following since day one and have watched all the info come out day by day because of some very intelligent citizen investigators a lot of them here.  My source is a close family member who was essentially kidnapped and drugged while these people did what they did with her daughter and impregnated her for what purpose I shudder to think..  She was lucky to get away and it wasn't easy.  I wasnt joking when I said high level of proficiency in tech.  So yeah, I dont get to just be a spectator anymore.  And Im not gonna have much time for dissecting other peoples info anymore as I'm busy trying to find some people a little more tech savy than myself to help me out.  Anyway thank you for your kind support.  I dont think I will be posting anything else until we can actually break this shit open.

              I understand your fear.  I have some myself.  Most of us on here do but that has not stopped us.  Your situation is different.  Yours is what we are all afraid of happening to us.  Be very careful.  I am not an expert but I will tell you something that a very courageous person I worked with on here and he gave me much advice on security.  I am not a supporter of guns, but you are in a dangerous way right now and so that is my suggestion that you arm yourself in your home.  Make sure your doors and windows are always locked and secured.  Make sure there is bright lighting and high tech cameras outside as well (this of course only if you are in a home).  Otherwise bolting and locking is in order.  If I may make another suggestion.  This person also suggested THE OATHKEEPERS.  They are a group of retired firemen, lawmen and veterans that will come to your aid and they follow the Constitution.  They are in every state and you can find them on the internet.  CALL THEM.  They helped my friend.  If you need any advice or need help at anytime let me know.  I can ask for help on here without outing you.  Last but not least, make sure your relative gets help, she will need it. I will keep her in my prayers and you also.

               Thank again for your kind words and moral support.  You sound more like the type of people I was hoping to start a dialogue with when I came here looking for a bit of help.  I've read so many good things on this topic here and was disheartened to find that the moderator does not actually care about the topic of discussion nearly as much as the rule system that basically makes this a forum/contest for people who want regognition, or popularity or awards for writing ability or whatever it is.  The more I have looked around, I see what this category is all about: who can link to someone else's story first.  Who can re-word other people's stories without being accused of plagery or just general suckling up to MF.  I also find it funny that I got hacked 18 minutes after posting here and got screen shots of keylogging code and an attempt at a DOS attack.  I dont know as much as I want but its fairly obvious who set it in motion and I have forwarded pertinent info to my ISP and a very good friend in LE.  And if it eases your mind at all, I posses ALL the necessary skills for taking these people out myself.  My experience is in the field not behind a screen.  I hope someone wants a confrontation, I could gather physical evidence.  A phone, notebook contact info. Because I promise their motivation is nothing compared to mine

                Well, I cannot speak for the moderator, I have not had a problem with him for I am much more of a researcher than submitter.   I do know though that many have had problems with him.  I am not very tech savvy, either.  I am glad that you are able to defend yourself if needed and have a back up with LE.  I know you said you will not try to ask for our help because of the response, but please let me know what transpires.  Believe me, there are people on here like myself, that really do care, but we have been duped before, for some have taken advantage of our kindness and love for our children.  Take Care and thank you for your response.

                 It's a start.  I gotta just put it all out.  Name names.  If they are willing to sue for libel, then I will retract.  If they send assasins I will react.

                   PS.  I was re-reading your advise on security which was the thing that showed me you were good people, and I thought I might share one more thing with you since I've pretry much laid out everything but my actual adress lol.  I mentioned there were dark forces at work against me, and there is.  But I forgot to mention that I wear the full armor of God.  And I cant deny his hand at work here, though I initially dismissed is as self aggrandizing and trying to hard to make sense of things.  But God has insisted accept his intentions.  If nothing else this whole thing is leading my sister to the love that's always been waiting for her. True evil dares not enter my home.  True evil trembles at the power of my protector and savior of my very soul Jesus!!  Yeheshua! !  Call him what you will, but call to him.  He will come.  I don't know if you share my faith but if you do you know how powerful and real it is, and the only thing that has kept me from madness.
                   <br/>

                   It's clear they know what I'm doing, I am definitely way out of my league in technical skills compared to what I'm up against.  Me and my sis have been having our hardware repeatedly attacked with spyware and DOS.  I've been hard hacked two more times.  I'm sure they are keeping tight watch on visitors to their websites and even when I  use firewall, vpn and tor it's just been a matter of time till it happens.  My sis(step), her own mother has rallied the rest of her family against her and is legally evicting her and her two daughters, the REAL victims here.  Could have something to do with the several digital receipts for large financial transfers coming from Anaheim CA that she found in her mom's emails.  It has also just recently come to pass last Saturday that during a pretty routine visit to the hospital to have baby checked for vomiting and mild fever, they discovered sexualy transmitted disease in both her daughters 1 and 5 years old.  So the state has taken custody and apparently the case worker for the agency in charge falsified information  in the paperwork filed with the court.  Whether through incompetence or knowingly we will have to see.  They probably didn't expect that my sis has been keeping records of everything since she first got back home after her escape and nobody would take her seriously.. She intends to sue the agency and it looks like she has a strong case.  I'm still trying to get people to take notice of her story as I feel it is as importantas ever that she gets it out in public.  For her saftey.  I am sure anyone following the whole pedogate thing has heard of Mellisa Honeybee Zaccaria.  I've been trying to get in touch with her so she can talk to my sis and at least hear her story.  She doesnt seem to have any official contact info but I've been pretty loud while trying not to come off as a crazy person intent on harassing her.  IF she is real then I'm sure she is on guard against such things and worse. I have not received any replies.  Nor from anyone else I've reached out to who I would have thought could help. Titusfrost seems to be tight with Mellisa and they are both in the Boston area, where I have family and a lot of contacts myself.  Again I get wanting to be safe and smart about being contacted and though I have remained anonymous I have made it clear that I have no problem giving any info to them for vetting.  I have even made email accounts specifically for safe comms and put those in the open for them to see.  Idon't have anything to hide from people, but I don't need every weirdo on the Internet knowing my private info especially in this case.  I can't help but to start to wonder if these people are simply entertainers or what.  There have been dark forces at work everytime I turn around so maybe I need to not get discouraged.  What to you think?  You are still into it on voat, which i havent had any time for, whats the general feeling about these people?  You know, I just realized I feel kind of weird confiding all this to a complete stranger, it's probably weird for you having a complete stranger tell you all these things though too. Fuck it. All the things I've seen and heard and experienced in the past few weeks has not been good for me.  I was at a birthday party for two coworkers at the bosses house a week or so ago. It was a pool party with lots of people and kids good food and drinks and it was real nice.  UntiI I had what started as a panic attack, that turned into what I think would be considered a psychotic break from reality.  For that brief moment, something convinced me that everyone knew what I've been doing and wanted to either find out if I could be corrupted, or if they needed to take me out.  In my mind I was at a pedoparty and all the kids were there for the adults fun and it was the most sickening disturbing feeling of terror I have ever had.  I litteraly ran away.  Ran. On foot. It was about 8 miles to get home.  I thought i had been drugged. It was an awkward day at work the next day. I have chalked it up to the combination my life recently and the couple hits of bud I took. I smoke bud fairly regularly, have for a long time except when not an option. But I've never, ever on any drug felt like that. Im in deep. This shit is so serious.  I already suffer from some PTSD, and as tough a warrior as I am, I think it's taking its toll.  You seen the movie 8mm?
If not you should.  That's where I'm at. Hows that for opening up?
Youve been about the only person I've had not just ignore me, or probably think I'm crazy or seeking attention.  At least online.  And I dont even try with people I know in the world.  I used to try telling everyone about pizzagate.  Ive always been the conspiracy guy and most people just humor me.  I stopped talking. Nobody would want to hear the things I know and probably shouldnt. 
I don't even tell you, my mystery confidante. But I haven't had any outlet, so maybe getting some of that off my chest will help me out, because I can't walk away, not yet.  Not without somebody to carry the torch. That's why I want so badly for somebody to help me get it out there spread it around so it not the heavy burden that it is.  I think that's why pizzagate wasn't this traumatic, as there are many who help carry it.  Well thanks as always for your concern.  If you want me to keep you updated I can.  And if you want to know Im real check me out of Facebook, I am as unabashedly me as in person.  You will know which one I am.  There aren't many.  In fact I believe I'm the only one alive.  Thanks again.  God bless.
