<p>There are many potential leads on what seems to be the blog of his main antagonist, American activist Paul Kendrick: <a href="https://istwanouayisyen.com/">https://istwanouayisyen.com/</a>  He quotes a clergyman who brought up the issue of a NAMBLA member staying there and who was rebuffed by Geilenfeld and:</p>
