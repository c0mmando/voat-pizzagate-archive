<p>Okay, so here it is folks! A possible connection between Daniels and Sayoc. Seems they worked at the same strip club. It means they traveled in the same circles. I have my own speculation, and it has to do with this character Sayoc also having ties to New York through a gentlemen\'s club named Stringfellows and a man named Michael J. Peter. Peter is called the godfather of gentlemen\'s clubs because of his domination of the lucrative business.

<h1>PLOT TWIST: ‘Mail Bomb’ Suspect Cesar Sayoc and Stormy Daniels Worked at the Same Strip Club</h1>
<p>Cristina Laila by Cristina Laila October 30, 2018 275 Comments</p>
<p>Suspected ‘mail bomber’ Cesar Sayoc worked as a DJ at Ultra Gentleman’s Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the same strip club porn-star-turned-Trump-nemesis Stormy Daniels performed at in April.</p>
<p>WPTV spoke to Ultra manager Stacey Saccal who confirmed that Sayoc worked as a DJ Thursday afternoon, the day before he was arrested in Plantation. She said Sayoc had worked there for two months as a DJ and doorman.</p>
<p>Saccal said there had been no complaints about Sayoc from other employees prior to his arrest Friday.</p>
<p>According to the club’s manager, Stacey Saccal, Cesar Sayoc never spoke about politics and everyone who worked at the club was “shocked and in disbelief” when they heard about Sayoc’s arrest.</p>
<p>Saccal said she never knew Trump decals or political stickers were plastered on Sayoc’s white van; she said it looked like an ice cream truck.</p>

<p>An ice cream truck? WTF?  Here\'s another link that highlights the location of this strip club: </p>

<p>Stormy Daniels performed at the same strip club back in April, which just so happened to coincide with President Donald Trump\'s visit. Interestingly enough, this strip club sits across the street from Trump\'s golf course.

<p>Here\'s the link that shows he has a New York connection: </p>

<h1>Bomb suspect has New York connections</h1>
<p>Cesar Sayoc worked for strip clubs in NY, Florida</p>
<p>In the April 2014 deposition, Sayoc testified that in the 1980s, he worked at a gentleman\'s club called String Fellas in New York for a man named Michael J. Peter, who according to Sayoc &quot;invented&quot; the gentleman\'s club and was at the time &quot;semiretired&quot; in Binghamton. Peter is a well-known strip joint owner in South Florida.</p>
<p>Sayoc — who said he was of Irish, Phillipine and Native American descent — also worked at a number of strip clubs in Florida, where he said he was a dancer, manager, entertainer and owner.</p>
<p>Federal agents confirmed that Sayoc also has connections to northern New Jersey and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Sayoc has an extensive criminal record in South Florida reaching back more than two decades, with charges ranging from drug possession to grand theft. He was convicted of making a bomb threat in 2002.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although in the deposition the name of the club is given as \'\'STRING FELLAS\'\' it actually is \'\'STRINGFELLOWS\'\'. That is the club associated with Michael J. Peter. And you might be interested in a video of Mr. Peter extolling the virtues of Stormy Daniels and equating the fine art of stripping and being a whore as empowerment for women and the me too movement? WTF? Yes! </p>

<p>Here\'s a link that gives the background of Stringfellows and its creator Peter Stringfellow</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stringfellow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stringfellow</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1990, Stringfellow introduced table dancing to his New York club with a licensing deal with Michael J. Peters. This became Stringfellow\'s Presents Pure Platinum.[17][19][23] In 1996, Cabaret of Angels, a table-side dancing club was opened for three nights a week at Stringfellow\'s Covent Garden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is one of several articles accusing Michael J. Peter of having MOB TIES! Imagine that! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1991-10-15-9102110401-story.html">https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1991-10-15-9102110401-story.html</a></p>
<p>Adult nightclub mogul Michael J. Peter once boasted that he made strip joints &quot;respectable&quot; and that he operates &quot;the most legitimate nightclubs you can find.&quot;</p>
<p>But sworn statements taken in his extortion and kidnapping case allege that he employed mobsters and their relatives and threatened violence to deter competitors.</p>
<p>Peter, 44, owns five adult nightclubs in South Florida: Thee Doll House III near Pompano Beach, Pure Platinum in Oakland Park, Solid Gold in Fort Lauderdale, LaBare in Sunrise and Solid Gold in North Miami Beach.</p>
<p>He owns similar clubs elsewhere, and they have mostly been profitable. Peter owns Rolls-Royce and Excalibur automobilies, a yacht and a two-story house near Fort Lauderdale\'s Las Olas Boulevard.</p>
<p>But behind the glitter and glamor is an uglier side to Peter\'s businesses, a former manager for him, Peter Amador, said in a sworn statement on June 9.</p>
<p>Amador told prosecutors he was threatened by reputed mobster James Tortoriello Jr., whose wife and two sons were employed by Peter. Amador said Tortoriello made the threat after Amador fired Tortoriello\'s wife, Karen, a waitress at Thee Doll House III.</p>
<p>&quot;He says, \'If you mess with me, you\'re going to run into some problems,&quot;\' Amador recalled. Amador said Tortoriello\'s wife was then rehired by the general manager of Thee Dollhouse III.</p>
<p>Tortoriello\'s two sons also were hired as muscle at Pure Platinum, Amador said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is that if Peter has mob connections, what about Sayoc and Daniels? The other thing that plays in my head is the idea that being a whore and selling sex can be spun as \'\'empowerment.\'\' But someone else in the news recently did the exact same thing. His name was Keith Raniere of NXIVM fame. Now remember that Raniere taught empowerment classes and sometimes used Richard Branson\'s island to do so. Coincidentally, Branson was friends with .... Peter Stringfellow! </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Stringfellow says: The organiser behind the party was HBO, the US movie company, and HBO videoed my set with the Good Fellas. Is that where Sayoc got String Fellas, the name he used in his deposition? Or is it another coincidence? It\'s here I\'m asking for help. You see Sayoc also was/is into bodybuilding. Keith Rainere was also. I\'m wondering if Sayoc knew ... or whether this whole strip club <s>and whatever hell else they\'re into</s> ties in with NXIVM?</p>',

           Notice that Stringfellow says: The organiser behind the party was HBO, the US movie company, and HBO videoed my set with the Good Fellas. Is that where Sayoc got String Fellas, the name he used in his deposition? Or is it another coincidence? It's here I'm asking for help. You see Sayoc also was/is into bodybuilding. Keith Rainere was also. I'm wondering if Sayoc knew ... or whether this whole strip club
           <s>
            and whatever hell else they're into
           </s>
           ties in with NXIVM?

            After having read this, it becomes clear that Sayoc only worked at the club for two months prior to his little escapade. Stormy Daniels did a show there in April, long before he was there.

            If I sold him a sandwich in January, am I connected as well?

             You did? Anything you can fill in? How close were Stringfellow and Branson? I know he thought of him as a business God.

             Please feel free to say anything you like -- especially if something struck you as odd or suspicious. oh, and what about sex trafficking or the mob? Were they involved in that? And Stringfellow, was he in with the Royals? Like Savile?

             HOW did I miss this?  Have seen his name (Steyer) all over but had no idea who he is, had not researched him.  Over the target, I’d say.

             I'm only seeing a very tangential connection to Steyer here - what does the rest of the post have to do with PG?  I see nothing but info about adults here.

              I just looked through the last 4 days of related posts and cannot find the pic.  He was standing between 2 Rolls with his arm outstretched.  I'm not imagining it.

                 Yes, that's what I remember. I must have seen it on Twitter. I follow so many people.

                <p>
                 Say, have you given any thought to whether Paddock and Sayoc attended the same political rallies? Would be strange if they were at the same one, no? Their stories are similar and there's that Philippine connection.

                  What I'm wondering is if Sayoc's mob connections were tied to Bulger's mob connections.  Strange things abound at the Circle K.

                   Sayoc was photographed at a Trump rally and Paddock was photographed at an anti-Trump rally. Would be weird if they were at the same one.

                    I remember.  LOL.  Pretty amazing how little has been discussed of it past day 90.  And we know that real people died there.

                      But now I've seen some good thought that Mueller = RR and either both are good or both are bad.  RR looking good.  Mueller is so dirty, I'm not sure how he could be "Exempted".

                       Evil could have been turned.  I think Mueller was turned.  He has family whose misconduct and enmeshment is deep, no?
