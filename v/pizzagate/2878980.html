<p>Interesting that the Pennsylvania AG is telling Texas police what evidence to search for. Will try to find that video to substantiate what I just heard. It was at this site but has just been taken down as I was writing this: <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/watch-live-dato-hold-11-am-press-conference-outside-archdiocese-of-galveston-houston/285-618021117">https://www.khou.com/article/news/watch-live-dato-hold-11-am-press-conference-outside-archdiocese-of-galveston-houston/285-618021117</a></p>
<p>The live press conference with Montgomery County DA Brett Ligon is no longer available; some excerpts available on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) &quot;Concerning today\'s action at the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, Montgomery County D.A. Brett Ligon says he\'ll go where the search takes him, &quot;If it\'s at the Vatican, I\'ll be heading to Rome.  It could be like the A&amp;M game...seven overtimes.&quot;</p>

<p>2) Montgomery County D.A. Brett Ligon, &quot;The patron saint of children is St. Nicholas...St. Nicholas is also known as Santa Claus.  Well, Santa Claus is here to tell you, that the state of Texas will go to any length to protect children.&quot;

<p>3) Breaking:  About today\'s search at the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, Montgomery County D.A. Brett Ligon says he\'s taken the burden off the church, &quot;I\'m gonna find it all out.  I\'m a Catholic myself.&quot;</p>

            La Rosa Lopez' FB page (now closed) listed Lucia Cordua as a FB friend. Lucia's linked in page mentions her affiliation with Casa de Esperanza de los Ninos in Houston. This is an organization that takes in neglected children, especially those with AIDs. Her husband (like his wife, transplanted Nicaraugan)  has catered the organization's charity fundraiser for 20+ years

            The Casa de Esperanza'https://www.guidestar.org/profile/76-0555303s board of directors include the general counsel of the Archdiocese of Galveston/Houston . Wonder if La Rosa Lopez was also involved in this charity?

            This 260 lb "priest" just happened to have pictures of semi naked men from his seminary to show his victim. His aberrant behavior has been going on for a while.

             MV was told by the nun that the abuse was reported but when later checked there was no report found.  These people are scumbags DiNardo and the nun.  Disgusting totally immoral scumbags.   This guy Ligon will clean their clocks.  Not to mention the priest.

             The restaurant owner hides behind doing good works for the Casa charity and all the while he has 4 children of his own.  Barf.  What is he doing?  Is he just getting money for doing their bidding or does he merit other disgusting and sick acts.  Idk, but I hope this whole net reaches far and wide and he ends up in the slammer and is shamed to high heaven.  Thank you for the report as sick as it is.

             I wonder how long it will take them to find the "secret archives", if they ever do. About 60 investigators from multiple agencies combing the place for "secret archives" are bound to come up with some interesting stuff.

              I'll wager they find plenty.  Gotta love the way Ligon put it:

             <p>
              "And the good thing is I've taken the burden off of everybody in the Catholic Church 'cause
              <em>
               they don't have to know anything. I'm going to find it all out
              </em>

            Finally Church Militant
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/police-raid-secret-files-of-galveston-houston-archdiocese">
             https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/police-raid-secret-files-of-galveston-houston-archdiocese
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The district attorney's office from nearby Montgomery County, the Conroe Police Department (Conroe is where the alleged abuse happened) and the Texas Rangers all took part in the raid. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said at a press conference Wednesday that "federal agencies" were at the scene as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking to reporters outside the archdiocese's offices, the Republican district attorney said the Rangers and the federal agencies were there in case they uncovered evidence for crimes outside of Montgomery County.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sacred Heart Church in Conroe is where Fr. La Rosa-Lopez was assigned in the late 1990s and early 2000s when he allegedly abused two teens. It is also the parish where Ligon and his wife were married.
            <strong>
             whoa
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ligon remarked on the timing of this raid, given the upcoming "holiday season." He noted, "The patron saint of children is St. Nicholas. And I think that it's just kind of apropos that in this holiday season, St. Nicholas is also known as Santa Claus. Well Santa Claus is here to tell you that the state of Texas will go to any length necessary to protect children."
           </p>
           <p>
            A reporter asked Ligon what he would want to say to victims of clerical sex abuse who are worried that there might be a cover-up. Ligon noted, "I have done four search warrants. Starting in Fort Bend County; the Shalom Center in Montgomery County; Sacred Heart; and now I'm here. If there's something to be covered up, I'm sure I'll find it."
           </p>
           <p>
            "People cooperate," Ligon explained, because "there are so many lay Catholics out there that are ready for the Church to come clean. And I am a lay Catholic myself, but today I stand here as the district attorney of Montgomery County."
           </p>
           <p>
            Tyler Dunman of the Montgomery County district attorney's office wrote of Wednesday's search, "We will take any document or piece of information related to Fr. Manuel La Rosa-Lopez or involving any other criminal activity."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Galveston-Houston archdiocese put out a statement Wednesday about the execution of the search warrant. The archdiocese claims that it should not be called a "raid," arguing that "any use of the term 'raid' is an inaccurate and unprofessional reference to a request for records to a party that has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate fully."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ligon agreed with this sentiment, telling reporters Wednesday, "I think that the term 'raid' is inaccurate. This is a lawfully executed search warrant."
           </p>
           <p>
            The district attorney noted the archdiocese did not hand over boxes of documents to law enforcement on day one, and that prosecutors had to work with "a host of attorneys." He commented, "Having to go through the attorneys, I understand it, as an attorney myself. It's not the type of cooperation that I would hope for, but it's the type of cooperation that I would expect with a sophisticated company."
           </p>
           <p>
            At another point during the press scrum, Ligon said some archdiocesan personnel are certainly being cooperative, but it is possible others are working behind the scenes to hide evidence. "For example," he explained, "if Cdl. DiNardo is cooperative, that doesn't mean the people that work with Cdl. DiNardo are cooperative. It doesn't mean that they're going to tell him the truth. And so it very well may be in a position where he wants to give us documents but he doesn't know that they exist."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ligon went on to say, "And the good thing is I've taken the burden off of everybody in the Catholic Church 'cause they don't have to know anything. I'm going to find it all out."
           </p>
           <p>
            One journalist asked the district attorney if there were plans to seize office computers. He responded, "We've been known to in the past. We've been known to take computers, cables, hopes, dreams, whatever it takes that has a bearing on a criminal case. Usually it's when people don't cooperate that we'll take everything, including the cable box, if that's what's necessary."
           </p>
           <p>
            He noted it depends on the situation, especially the level of cooperation, adding, "I don't want to tie myself down as to what we're doing inside today."

             Really interesting details, Carmencita!: federal agencies are involved and there have been four search warrants: Fort Bend County, Shalom Center (retired priests' home), Sacred Heart Church and the Galveston-Houston Chancery. They don't rule out possibility of investigating other crimes, either. I sure hope they find the "secret archives".

              Yes I hope they find them as well.  They are locked away and if they do find them, all HE77 will break loose.  They keep records of all sorts of things in those files including secret marriages of priests with Children and possibly even priests with other priests.  I know there are secret marriages between priests and children due to the post I did on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/StcharlesSeminary">

              .  Under canon law they are to be kept under lock and key and I bet they have them.  This looks like it was a total surprise.  This is what we have been waiting for. Thank You Lord.

               It's fascinating that the evil ones keep records of such damning stuff. Guess it's useful for blackmail or other purposes.

                Yes, we know all too well how serial rapists, and killers keep Sick Momentos of their Crimes.  This shows us How Sick They Are.  Yesterday finding out that a priest canonized a pedo as St. Harvey Milk, made my stomach turn.  They are running at breakneck speed to do their bidding for the devil pope.

              You caught that too.  The fact that Ligon was married in the Church the abuse took place also plays a big factor in this.  He is a practicing Catholic for God's Sake.  So far I love this.   They were on lock down.  No one in and no one out.  Ligon is a smart cookie.  He is using very careful working.  He is surely communicating heavily with Shapiro.

            Looks like faithful Catholics in law enforcement are getting serious about cleaning up the Church, as I predicted. Very glad to see it.

             Thanks so much for the sticky. I've been poring through the bombshell information you linked to, and I'm speechless. Hadn't heard before of the plot discussed in China to poison Pope Benedict. Very strange, since my first thought upon seeing a photo of Pope Emeritus' gaunt, stricken figure about a month after he resigned was that he had been poisoned. He slowly began to look better, but he looked like a walking skeleton for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the Voris article on Satanic activity in the Vatican. I forgot that Michael Voris had made a video about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we need is a Catholic Julian Assange or an anonymous leaker who can leak the dossier and other documents. Otherwise, who knows if it will ever come to light? Catholic cardinals seem absolutely terrified to speak more than in generalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Texas AG Brett Ligon seems like a very good man. Will be following him on Twitter to see if there are any more developments.

            New Zealand Prays to Halt Culture of Death’s Advance
           </p>
           <p>
            NEW ZEALAND (ChurchMilitant.com) - In response to the advancing Culture of Death, New Zealand Catholics are holding a Rosary Crusade for life and faith.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inspired by Polish Catholics and concerned by their country's socialist leaders' desire to remove all limits on abortion and legalize euthanasia, faithful Catholics Beverley Bennett and Clare Dargaville thought their country needed a Rosary Crusade as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Dec. 8, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, New Zealanders will gather at 65 locations across the country to pray for "Life and Faith." This is also the day of their March for Life in Wellington, New Zealand. Abortion has been legal for 41 years and over 500,000 lives have been lost — over 10 percent of the population of the small country of 4.5 million.

            Movement to Consecrate California to Our Lady
           </p>
           <p>
            DETROIT (ChurchMilitant.com) - Devout Catholics in California are planning to consecrate their state to the Blessed Mother on Dec. 8, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception.
           </p>
           <p>
            On that day Catholics will gather at locations along the Californian coast to attend Mass, pray the Rosary and ask the Blessed Virgin Mary to watch over their state in a special way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Church Militant contacted the organizers of an initiative called "Consecrate California to Mary." Director, writer and storyboard artist Angelo Libutti, who spearheaded the consecration last year, told Church Militant, "I contacted Patrick Coffin and Jesse Romero proposing to act as Poland did — in the only way that makes sense for a Catholic who is full of confidence in Our Lady and Christ. These are problems too big for us to handle, and we need divine help."
           </p>
           <p>
            The website for the event lists the kinds of problems for which Catholics in California are especially in need of God's help: "To defeat the culture of death. Abortion, euthanasia, natural disasters. For the sick, elderly, unwanted. And for an end to the violence, sex abuse, drugs, alcoholism, sex trafficking."
           </p>
           <p>
            I am going to watch for protests against this.  There will be backlash for sure in Cali.

           <p>
            Prosecutors from Montgomery County, Texas, entered the offices of the Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston on Wednesday morning in search of “secret archives” and other records related to clergy sex abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prosecutors with the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office teamed up with investigators from the Conroe Police Department and Texas Rangers to raid the offices of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, according to information first reported by KHOU.  The team entered the offices on Wednesday morning in search of documents related to the ongoing sex abuse crisis and alleged coverups within the Catholic Church.
           </p>
           <p>
            In September, Father Manuel LaRosa-Lopez turned himself in to Conroe law enforcement following the issuance of an arrest warrant that alleged he sexually assaulted at least two children nearly 20 years ago, Breitbart News reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            A woman accused the priest in 2001 of kissing and touching her inappropriately at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Conroe when she was 16-years-old, the Catholic news outlet reported. He is also accused by a now 36-year-old man of sexually abusing him for several years beginning in 1998.
           </p>
           <p>
            In what KHOU called an “unprecedented action,” prosecutors entered the offices of the archdiocese to search for documents related to the LaRosa-Lopez case. The search warrant states that the DA seeks to examine confidential documents held in “the Archdiocese’s Chancery and secret archives.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Officials with the office of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston issued a statement that said, in part:
           </p>
           <pre><code>This morning, the District Attorney of Montgomery County executed a search warrant for records and information related to an ongoing investigation. The Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston continues to cooperate, as we have since the outset, with this process. In fact, consistent with Cardinal DiNardo’s pledge of full cooperation, the information being sought was already being compiled.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Officials explained that the term “secret archives” is “merely a Church term pertaining to confidential documents kept in a secure manner” for privacy protection. The statement compared the protection to that provided for medical records.

            Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon told the Houston Chronicle, “The good thing is, I’ve taken the burden off everybody in the Catholic Church. They don’t have to know anything. I’m going to find it all.”

            The local CBS affiliate reported this is the fourth search warrant executed in connection to this case.
            <strong>
             what?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Breitbart News reported on the execution of one of those warrants issued for a rehabilitation center in the Conroe area. The Shalom Center was listed in 1995 by the U.S. Conference of Bishops as a treatment center for priests involved in sex-related crimes, the Houston Chronicle stated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since then, other warrants were executed to search St. John Fisher Catholic Church in Richmond, Texas and the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Conroe.
           </p>
           <p>
            DA Ligon said he expected the search to continue for up to two days if necessary.

            Houston is a significant port city. Also recall that Roland Carnaby was gunned down by Houston state troopers under very odd circumstances in 2008. Some speculate that he had surveillance evidence of port activity in his possession when he was killed.

             Thanks for this. It could run very deep if Brett Ligon is talking about connection with Pennsylvania cases and about going to the Vatican to search if he has to. Sounds like a lot more than a lone priest doing depraved thing entirely on his own.

            The current Archbishop of Houston is Cardinal Daniel DiNardo who also serves as the

            The RICO case this month was filed against THE

             Looking at this now.  We must watch this carefully.  The RICO case is a good step forward, or so it seems.  BUT.  We must watch how it proceeds.  Will they confiscate large amounts of money from Parishes and the Vatican?  This will only hurt the Faithful in the long run.  There was an  article this morning on Church Militant's site and it has now totally disappeared.  The article was in conjunction with their donation drive. It was about how the Catholics are dwindling in numbers.  While that is a frightening thought, in the comments someone proposed that the RICO case must be watched since the govt. could raid the Church's coffers and cripple many parishes causing it impossible for Catholics to even receive the Sacraments and the Eucharist.  I am going to pray the Rosary and keep close watch.

              and anyone else interested in a modern history of the financial side of the Catholic Church, I'd strongly suggest you read Nino Lobello's books:
             </p>
             <p>
              Vatican Empire
             </p>

             <p>
              Vatican Paper$ (Vatican Papers)
             </p>
             <p>
              Vatican's Wealth
             </p>
             <p>
              He was a University if Kansas Professor of Journalism, Overseas Vatican Correspondent to the NY Daily News. A Catholic himself, he documents just the financial side and tax laws that benefit the church, while also including rare case studies of revealed church financials that depict how the whole church funnels money upwards to the Pope/have ridiculously unfair tax laws that let them have huge untaxable side businesses.

               I am not aware of him but will check him out.  For awhile now I have strongly felt that All Houses of Worship should have to pay taxes.  I am not very good at this stuff, but I think each parish should be able to apply for a tax break (notice I said break) if they service the poor such as running a soup kitchen, etc. This must be on parish grounds.  There are many good parishes that are not and do not agree with the present pope and his teachings.  Thanks for the advice.

                Totally agree, and dont mean all Catholics are involved/aware.

                I also agree, we may need to do this to charities too. If their work is virtuous, they should have no problem publishing their records.

                 Exactly.  I have no problem with any house of worship that is doing work for the poor.  There are exemptions for the elderly home owners and this is the type of exemption I mean.  They are available in your town or district.  They can create something special for them.  The Vatican has just made 25M disappear into thin air

                 $25 Million Papal Foundation Grant to Vatican Remains Unaccounted For
                </p>
                <p>
                 PHILADELPHIA (ChurchMilitant.com) - After Cdl. Donald Wuerl spearheaded a $25 million grant to the Vatican earlier this year through the Papal Foundation, sources confirm the money remains unaccounted for, the Rome hospital designated as beneficiary apparently never having received the grant.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sources also confirm Wuerl was behind the pope's cancellation of a meeting with foundation members in March, and continues to pull the strings behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Controversy engulfed the Papal Foundation, a charity partially founded by Abp. Theodore McCarrick in 1988 with assets worth $206 million, when three stewards resigned from the Audit Committee earlier this year after Wuerl pushed for the Vatican to receive $25 million — the largest single grant ever given by the foundation. The money was ostensibly to be used toward the Istituto Dermopatico Dell'Immacolata (IDI), a scandal-ridden hospital in Rome investigated by Italian authorities for embezzlement and tax fraud of nearly a billion euros.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pope Francis had allegedly requested the $25 million in summer of 2017, and Wuerl, then-chairman of the foundation, lobbied members of the Board of Trustees to vote to approve the grant (originally a loan, but revised to an outright grant on Wuerl's insistence).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Board members consist of all nine U.S.-based cardinals, as well as various bishops and laymen, making up a total of 24 trustees.

               Very intriguing about Cardinal DiNardo being tipped off by the PA federal prosecutor. There does seem to be a mysterious link between the Pennsylvania Justice Department, Cardinal DiNardo and the Galveston-Houston Diocese. I found the comments by Brett Ligon about the help the Pennsylvania AG gave to the Montgomery County police in their investigation:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://twitter.com/jackmjenkins/status/1067867187002728448">

              </p>
              <p>
               "Ligon suggested to reporters that his investigation of [Fr] Rosa-Lopez has been informed by the Pennsylvania report, which alleged widespread sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by hundreds of Catholic priests there over 70 years.
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Pennsylvania's Attorney General's Office has been very helpful in helping us structure what we're looking for," Ligon said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Are the abuse cases in Pennsylvania and Houston-Galveston similar? Is there a pattern connecting them? Why the connection? Could possibly some of the abuse cases in Pennsylvania be about SRA which might also have been involved in case of Fr. La Rosa-Lopez? I'm just throwing out ideas. Must be something very serious to have them bring a Crime Scene truck and police from multiple agencies to join in the search for evidence. Brett Ligon said he would go to the Vatican to find the evidence if he had to.

                Probably some of the priests uncovered in Pennsylvania were transfered there from positions in the Houston diocese. They are following the trail backward to find more victims and complicit hierarchy.

                 Yes, after the grand jury in Pa they listed the names of priests that were also involved in other states.  This could be the connection between the two. I am sure there are other reasons they are communicating including how to go forward depending on what is discovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The district attorney's office from nearby Montgomery County, the Conroe Police Department (Conroe is where the alleged abuse happened) and the Texas Rangers all took part in the raid. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said at a press conference Wednesday that "federal agencies" were at the scene as well.
                </p>
                <p>
