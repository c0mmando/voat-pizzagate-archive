<p>An interesting article by Dady Chery on the culture of Haiti and why there were never any abandoned children for foreigners to adopt or \'rescue\'.</p>

<p><strong>There are no orphans in Haiti!</strong></p>
<p>After a long silence at the other end of the line, my friend Jordan murmurs: “Come again?” He must be thinking I lost my senses. I realize how I sound. Someone else might imagine that I am ignorant of the extreme poverty in which most Haitians live, but Jordan and I have known each other more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Okay. I did not mean that there aren’t any orphans.<strong>Of course, many Haitian children lose their parents. But these children are never abandoned. Our families are very extended.</strong>  When a child cannot be cared for by a living parent or becomes orphaned, a grandparent, aunt, uncle, sibling, cousin, or some other relative, adopts the child. If after the child becomes a teenager the family still cannot care for her, she is placed with a more prosperous family well known to the parent – often the home of a godparent.
One cannot talk about orphaned Haitian children without confronting two highly controversial and interwoven subjects: Vodou and restavek. <strong>Both are part of the very fabric of the Haitian family, which is currently under vicious attack.</strong>
The system of partial adoption that I described to Jordan, especially the case where a child is placed in the home of a more prosperous, though often unrelated, family is the restavek (to stay with) system. This system, which is well on its way to becoming as vilified as Vodou, is now a pretext for calling Haitians slavers even while they are being enslaved and their children are being stolen. In reality, for hundreds of years this kind of partial adoption has safeguarded young Haitians from the depredations of foreigners. The restavek system is profoundly subversive in that it intimately binds Haitians of different socioeconomic classes.</p>
<p><strong>The theft of Haiti’s children is underway. Loving Haitian families who fit every qualification for the adoption of children are regarded as slavers and not permitted to adopt Haitian children.</strong>  An adoption black market, with all the attendant corruption in Haitian high places, has grown to serve the needs of wealthy and middle-class whites who fail the criteria for adoption by normal routes in their home countries. Sexual predators come to Haiti to establish schools and orphanages. Some have been exposed, most have not. Grifters obtain young children by persuading the biological parents that their offspring will maintain contact with them. As for the poor teenage girls, there are always the garment factories with a going wage of about 40 cents per hour, or there is worse, much worse.</p>

            I am thinking I may need to drop out of reading about this world we live in.  I stopped reading local newspapers because they became so leftist.  Now, I may need to give up everything else.  The cruelty, the inhumanity, the greed, the evilness.  How can it be like this?

            In the work I do, there are many who do their best to help this island.  Soap, toothpaste, clean clothes, some amount of schooling.  These are luxuries.  When I read the article from abcnews.com, it has haunted me since.  Kind of like the day I read about Anthony Weiner's laptop and the world changed on a dime for me.  Relatives went to the island several years ago.  We talked about that mission trip recently and they said they will not go back.  I knew they had come back changed and red pilled when they said that.  They wouldn't take anything for the experience, but it is hard to leave people you connected with, behind, to go back to their unbelievable daily struggle.  Hard scrabble doesn't even cover it.

            Yep....the religious  orders there take their cut, too.
They all know that you know, that they know and they know many will look the other way. That's why it is interesting to hear and read that minority  Americans think it is so horrible here in the USA.  Not even vaguely close to a bad situation.

             That's what I noticed, too.  Normally, speed does not equate with the US government. It seems as though they wanted the children out before someone else claimed them.

              me too. taking organs from anyone other than a living willing donor is just creepy.

              I did see a story the other day about an 18 person kidney swap where you had 9 people donating kidneys to strangers but all of these people were adults and at the press conference and talking to and being happy to met the recipients. That was kind of cool. It was in New Haven CT I think.

            There have been a lot of organ trafficking posts already in pizzagate. Especially in connection to Kosovo and Thaci who is a client of the podesta's lobby firm and close friend of Bill Clinton. Search the archives for Thaci, it will make you sick.

            There is an article out there, though, that a NYT writer did on assignment  in Haiti. Wrote back in 2007 or 2008. His editor gave him $150 to try to buy a child in Haiti. Long story  short, he was successful. He didn't, of course, buy the child. Had to be one of the saddest stories I ever read. Because of the poverty and the earthquake, so many children have to go to other families, just so they will have a little food to eat. But, many really are just slaves/servants to the more affluent families. This writer was successful within hours of landing and he was asked age/sex/other and nothing he requested was a problem to "fill."

            Great post.

             WOW.... had to look up UPMC, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, then I see this...Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Game Day, Monday, July 17, organized by the Williamsport Crosscutters and the UPMC Susquehanna Organ and Tissue Donation Awareness Council ,  just about knocked me over.
            </p>
            <p>
             This seems to be too Good/Bad to be true, but it sure made sense with a lot of what I have read. I give an upvote for turning the wheel to go back and finish looking into Hillary and her ties to Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those E-mails are pretty damning to me, Thanks for direction, I had forgotten why it stuck in my craw about Penn

            My church just donated 1k to a Hatian "orphanage" so they could buy bunk beds. I wonder how much the missionaries who organized the fundraiser know about the internal dealings of these institutions.

             I know, a church near me has a bulletin board full of members and articles, pictures of them doing work in Haiti and other places, I try to ask questions without getting too weird. Fortunately it is completely locally funded (and its a small town, no hospital, no orphanages, only public schools), the church group has no clinton or other political involvement at all, so that was a relief to find out.

            I am beginning to really rethink everything. Many years ago I heard that the AIDs rate in Swaziland was crazy high, like 30%. The current king there was educated in England so they aren't total backwater ignoramuses, under those leopard skin loincloths, and yet, wow, crazy high aids rate in their young children;  the going theory was that sex with virgin children  would cure aids, meaning that not only were all the kids infected, but they were also rape victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am wondering now if this wasn't all a rouse to keep all the frickin pedophiles out of the county, what better way to protect your kids than to declare them all damaged goods...
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if you haven't seen it, watch the video of the Al Smith Catholic charity dinner, Trump rails on HRC, who is smirking and making out with Kissenger,  for taking many villages, its fantastic.

             Trump went on, “Everyone knows of course Hillary’s belief that it takes a village, as in Haiti where she’s taken a number of them.”
