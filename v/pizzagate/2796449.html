<p>KANSAS CITY, Kan --  KCK firefighter Devin Rich was charged with one count of sexual exploitation of a minor, and after a seven-month investigation, Rich is in jail.</p>
<p>Rich is an eight-year veteran of the KCK Fire Department. Wyandotte County District Attorney Mark Dupree says Rich solicited a person he believed to be 15 years old for sex, on the internet.</p>
<p>Dupree says an F.B.I. investigation started when someone reported concerns about Rich’s sexual interests in February of 2018, but the activity dates back to the end of 2017.</p>
<p>The F.B.I set up a sting and Rich began talking online to an undercover agent posing as a 15-year-old.</p>
<p>Rich allegedly communicated with the undercover detective from his home and while on the job at KCK Fire House 7 at 27th and Strong in Argentine.</p>
<p>In April, federal investigators raided his home and served a warrant on the KCKFD. Rich was suspended without pay.</p>
<p>KCK Battalion Chief Morris Letcher says the fire department does not have many details of when and where the alleged crimes happened and will review its policies after this type of allegation.</p>
<p>“Hopefully people are going to understand that we still service the community, and this is just an isolated incident with this person,” said Letcher. “He is allowed due process.”</p>
<p>This is one of several public servants who have been charged with crimes since Mark Dupree was elected as Wyandotte County district attorney.</p>
<p>“There are over 400 and some odd firefighters in KCK and I respect and appreciate every last one of them,” Dupree said. “And it is my hope that this one will not stain their reputation.”</p>
<p>There was no real victim of this crime. Rich did not speak to a child online, but he believed he was and that is enough.</p>
<p>If found guilty of this crime, Rich could spend over 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>I hope this guy gets the Max.  20 years.  It will keep him away from Our Children.  A Firefighter.  Think about it.  Many times they rescue </p>
<p>Children from fires, carrying them down the stairs..........</p>

             I totally agree.  There is possibly some type of cover up by the head of the dept.  Either trying to keep the amount of  these cases to a minimum and protecting the force.  I tend to think there are other men that are doing the same.  We know there are many in LE that are compromised so why not the Fire Dept,  Think of the opportunities and their access to Our Children.

            KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- A Kansas City, Kansas firefighter is behind bars. Police arrested 36-year-old Shane McClure at his home Wednesday morning, and he's charged with aggravated indecent liberties with a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            She wanted FOX 4 to keep her identity private, but she’s been living in the KCK neighborhood for three years. She said McClure was recently re-married, living with three children and his wife. Neighbors say they would often hear crying coming from the home and the family never spoke to anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators aren’t saying much about the current allegations, but court records show McClure was divorced in 2014 and the divorce papers note an emergency motion to terminate all parental contact between McClure and a child. Neighbors say he has a teenage daughter from his previous marriage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Video Included.  This is so sick.

            Interesting...he is 33 years old. Religious views listed as Christian. I expect he's a Freemason. They like sacrificing members when they are 33, 88, etc

             A lot of people in power or authority positions are Freemasons. Many are corrupt and use their powers to do nasty things just like this one.  Just learned yesterday that Rahm Emanuel's grandpa was a Freemason.  I am sure it still runs in the family.

               Yep.  This second story of the fireman you can tell he can't stop his pedophilia from taking hold, he gets a divorce and then marries a woman with children.  What keeps him going?  He must have suffered the same consequences from another pedo, either a relative or in school, etc.  Would be interesting to know if his father or another relative was a fireman.  Thanks for responding, I know we have a lot of new people here, so I wanted them to be aware of this generational pedophilia and that there are some professionals that we have always trusted, but do not deserve our respect.  It is happening all over.
