            Obviously this never happened. There are major back room deals being struck all the time no doubt. I'm glad Trump won obviously because I happen to think child rape, organ harvesting, institutionalized drug dealing, charity fraud and gassing 1300 innocent men, women and children at Ghouta Syria is wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            But given Trump's lack of intellect this is exactly what I suspected might happen. It's time to face the facts, Trump is a fucking idiot. There I said it. Trump is a fucking idiot and he has no idea who he's dealing with. In fact I would be very surprised if Trump makes it to 2018 in one piece because let's face it anyone who'd do a Ghouta would have no problem offing a narcissistic blow-hard like Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the strong parallels between America 2010-2017 with Germany 1930-1937 Trump reminds me of Ernst Rhom who few people realize was very close to becoming Fuehrer before he was offed by Herr Hitler.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm">
             Ernst Rohm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Rohm was just like Trump immensely popular but unsophisticated and in waaaaaaaaay over his head. Rohm's popularity in large part was based on his working class roots, think Trump unsophisticated behavior like crassly saying "grab 'em by the pussy" and a million other examples. An admittedly silly parallel would be Family Guy's Peter Griffin running for President. Or Donald Trump at various times in the past 9 months, take your pick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well we all know what happened, no need to go into it. I just find it shocking I would ever be comparing the American government to pre-war Nazi Germany. What the fuck happened?

             The Nazis were not destroyed in ww2, they migrated to America and so did their influence on our government. The CIA is the deep states greatest tool and they were taught by the Nazis. This countries history has been a lie ever since. Tough pill to swallow, but take it, the truth is the answer.

              Yep. I've been a keen observer of human nature for a long time and have even received my own well deserved and grievous chastisements from the Lord above and I've got a really bad feeling about what's going to happen next. Nobody ever sees it coming.

              Thanks. I got a few down votes for my Trump criticism. People need to start considering the possibility they've got dirt on Trump as well or there's some other thing that's preventing arrests from happening.

              Did you see they released all the perps that were just arrested down in Haiti?

               I thought the downvoats were because your idea of Ernst Rohm becoming Furher is ludicrous.
              </p>
              <p>
               Especially given by 1933 Hitler was already in power and had eliminated all other politcal parties and none of the industrialists who supported Hitler would have supported Rohm.

                 This is so sad. You're not a shill after all. You're just dumb. Oh fuck, here I was this entire time thinking you were plugged into some power center in DC and interacting with /voat/Pizzagate because maybe you worked at a PR firm or Law Partnership and needed to keep your finger on the pulse of a potential threat to whoever the fucking psychopaths were who gang raped Haiti and killed 1300 innocent men, women and children in Ghouta Syria with the Sarin gas precursors captured in Libya when Qadafi went down.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Oh my god. I feel like I just wasted all this time for nothing. You actually cited a reference to The Enabling Act of 1933 which for some bizarre reason you think Hitler or any Nazi would consider protection against internecine fighting for the soul of the Party.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You actually wrote Hitler "had eliminated all other political parties" as if you think that could have protected him from the ever burgeoning cadre of men in the German military who didn't take kindly to the idea a gutter snipe of a failed painter and paper hanger would be ordering them around for the foreseeable future.

                Interesting. People didn't object to "Trump is a fucking idiot." but were instead offended by my obscure reference to a little known Nazi named Ernst Rohm and my opinion his popularity with the working class posed such a grave threat to Hitler's influence on the Nazi party the he was killed to eliminate the possibility a rival faction even thinking about a power grab.............which would have no doubt placed Rohm at its head given his popularity with the working class.

                 If you think Ernst Rohm is little known, you are saying people on this board are idiots.

                 Rohm in no way threatened Hitler's position as head of Germany or head of the Nazi party.   He could have attempted a coup, but he would have lost and lost badly. He probably knew this (which is why Hitler and Himmler had to fake their evidence of Rohm's coup plotting.)  And the proof Rohm in no way threatened Hitler's position is that after Rohm was killed in the Night of the Long Knives, his paramilitary the Sturmabteilung (SA) did nothing.  There were three million strong and vastly outnumbered the Germany Army, but their leadership was murdered and they didn't even protest.  They accepted new leadership and a reduced role in Germany.

                  This will probably be one of the last times we talk. You just stepped in it real bad AreWeSure. You just proved you're an intellectual light weight.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Rohm in no way threatened Hitler's position"
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What was he killed for not washing his Leder-Hosen? Obviously there was a power struggle, Hitler could have no one else on the stage with him. Of course at the time he was not an immediate threat. He was killed because could have TURNED INTO a threat.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hitler had Rohm killed as an insurance policy. Hitler knew the first mistake he made would have motivated his naysayers in the Wehrmacht to go looking for alternatives. The first person they would have picked were he alive was Ernst Rohm because he would placate the Nazi base while also being more malleable given his limited intellectual capacity. Think of George W Bush being chosen by the Shadow Government because he couldn't get in trouble outside choking to death eating pretzels.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  None of this ever happened because, duh, Ernst Rohm was murdered and Hitler had many early military successes which shut people up. By the time the first cracks began to show it was too late.
