            I never claimed to be virtuous, and I have led a fairly worldly life in the past. YOU make assumptions based on your small minded views of people who have come to love God. Once again, read it for yourself, it will help you to change your Ways too.

            All our rights are GOD GIVEN whether you want to acknowledge that or not! And who do you think you are lecturing me about rights you eurotrash fuckwit? Are you even "allowed" to have a steak knife or a tea kettle where you live? LMFAO what a joke you are! I have ZERO obsession about my children's sexual development, but it seems to be of HUGE importance to you for some odd reason despite saying you aren't a pedophole!
           </p>
           <p>
            What else is odd is that I have never met a person who said their life was ruined because they had a happy, stable childhood with loving parents, but I have met a whole lot of drug addicts and prostitutes who were exposed to sex way too young. But hey, you seem like a person who has all of the answers and zero mental health issues right?! My children will be allowed to develop normally and at their pace since I am a normal parent who was not fucked up as a kid like it seems you were.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you knock up some street walking crack head feel free to raise your little bastard however you see fit, but you can take your pedo style ideas about child rearing and fuck off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, but please pick up a bible and read it for yourself if you're so interested in hearing from God. It's been real fun but I'm beginning to tire from your monotonous repetitions.

            I have parental rights that come from GOD and not the government. The government is tasked with upholding my God given right.  I don't know what kind of "right" you think you have to my kids, or anyone else's kids, but if a pedo like you comes near my kids it will be the last thing you do! Get lost loser!

            I was just curious as to why you recommend early 20's.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Statistically, people start to have sex in their early 20s

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This chart would suggest otherwise (unless India and china are skewing the stats over population). Most 'western' countries on this list are ~18, with Scandinavian countries being notably lower.

            And I'm a single female who's always been indifferent to having children, but this has absolutely crushed my soul as well. However, I have found the light. Before PG I was agnostic, but now I try to pray every night for God to bring justice to these disgusting creatures. If this has taught me anything it's that for this kind of evil to exist, it's opposite must exist as well.  The truly sick part is that my Grandpa was a Lutheran minister, I was raised in the church and was always really spiritual until I went to college. Thanks to my college education/indoctrination I was skeptical that a higher being existed at all, however now I know and I will NEVER forget.

He rails against the charge because he thinks it could be damaging to his side. The public just never could come around to their pedo agenda like they had hoped back in 1993.

            Hi.  This is incorrect.   All this came out during her confirmation hearings.  When people heard what this was about, she was confirmed 96-3.
           </p>
           <p>
            The paper she was writing had nothing to do with changing the age of consent in the United States.  The paper she was writing was about creating gender neutral language.  The way rape laws were defined back then you could argue that men or boys couldn't be raped because of the language used. The part of the paper that talks about lowerin the age of consent IS A QUOTE from a proposed Romeo and Juliet law and Ginsberg only addresses the issue of gender in the quote, not the age issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            The quote was from " a draft Senate bill that never became law." Again she praises the use of language in this bill.  She does not advocate for the bill.   Secondly, the bill seems to be about age of consent among teenagers not someone of 18 and a minor.  Do we prosecute a 15 year old for sleeping with his 15 year old gf type of deal.  AKA a Romeo and Juliet law.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see this article from a supporter of ginsberg for more

It Looks Like Justice Ginsburg Likely Was the Victim of a Drafting Error

            <em>
             But the careful reader — which I, unfortunately, was not (especially in my more recent post on the subject here) — should have realized that the report was likely intending to recommend replacing the "carnal knowledge" ban not with a flat age of consent of 12 (what the text said) but rather with a graduated Romeo-and-Juliet age of consent that would have been set at 16 for adults (what the Â§1633 that the text cited said).

             Back in my day libs could spin better. Nowadays they will literally deny the clear text on the page. They might even try to tell you that it isn't writing on a page, it's pecan pie.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way that you can be certain that she didn't intend for any "Romeo and Juliet" bs is because it didn't exist in the old code and why would she be inventing new concepts for age of consent and then forget to add the concept?
            </p>
            <p>
             The removal of gender language for the purpose of making man/boy sex the same as man/girl sex. That's why she got rid of the "carnal knowledge with a female" line. The man/boy act was a whole different thing back then with much more severe punishment.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Senator HATCH. Sure. No, no, I understand.
In 1975, while you were at the ACLU, that organization adopted
a policy statement favoring homosexual rights. According to what
has been represented to me as minutes of a meeting on this matter,
the following is noted:
In the second paragraph of the policy statement dealing with relations between
adults and minors, Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a motion to eliminate the sentence
reading, "The State has a legitimate interest in controlling sexual behavior between
adults and minors by criminal sanctions." She argued that this implied approval of
statutory rape statutes, which are of questionable constitutionality.
Now, I realize that these events took place over 18 years ago, so
let me just ask you: Do you have any doubt that the States have
the constitutional authority to enact statutory rape laws to impose
criminal sanctions on sexual contact between an adult and a minor,
even where the minor allegedly consents?
Judge GINSBURG. Not at all, Senator Hatch. What I did have a
strong objection to was the sex classification.
Senator HATCH. Sure.
Judge GINSBURG. I think child abuse is a deplorable thing,
whether it is same sex, opposite sex, male-female, and the State
has to draw lines based on age.
What I do object to is the vision of the world that supposes a
woman is always the victim. So my only objection to that policy
was its sex specificity.
Senator HATCH. SO as long as they treat males and females
equally, that is your concern?
263
Judge GINSBURG. Yes, and I think that as much as we would not
like these things to go on, children are abused, it is among the
most deplorable things, and it doesn't
Senator HATCH. And the State has power to correct it.
Judge GINSBURG. Yes, and has power to draw lines on the basis
of age that are inevitably going to be arbitrary at the edge.
Senator HATCH. Well, I am relieved to hear that that was the
basis for your objection. It was a shock to me to learn, you know,
that the Constitution, some people argue that the Constitution denies
the State the right or the ability to protect young people and
teenagers by forbidding sexual contact between them and an adult,
even where the sexual contact is supposedly voluntary, and I am
concerned about that.

               So now you have a pro-polygamy senator who is the product of polygamy spinning for Ginsburg?  Hatch personally recommended Ginsburg to Clinton, according to the archived articles I've been reading.

              <p>
               ( edit )
Hey, I think I just discovered why Hatch was so enthusiastic for Ginsburg. Her manifesto also calls laws against polygamy a violation of privacy. Do you find that to be coincidental to Hatch's enthusiasm for Ginsburg?

            You say my wording was ludicrous, but I'm not sure of your argument for that. Is rape always a semantic thing? Theoretically, if liberals control a jurisdiction and make the age of consent 2 years old, then it's not rape if they have sex with toddlers? Or is 12 the right age in your opinion and anything younger than that is rape that transcends their little statutes?

            ALL parents need to have your attitude and remain vigilant and pissed as hell! Any pedo needs to be taken out immediately by the parents of the child the pedo harmed. And yes, being a pedo harms children! Their bodies, emotions, cognitive capacities, and soul are not ready for sex until much much later. It makes me sick to type this but if any pedo comes near my kid it will be the last thing they fucking do!

            What a pathetic gathering of unscrupulous degenerates the Clintons and their Masonic bretheren are. And these sub-humans are infested in our system and basically run everything. The Rubicon was crossed long ago and we continue to do nothing. But you have to recognize it is reality before you can resist it. Keep waking people up. Good job OP.

               One's sexual preferences has nothing to do with the discussion about when a human may be considered "grown" or "sexually mature".

                Have you not been paying attention? Pedophiles have been behind the push for years to lower the age of consent. They state children are "sexually mature" enough at young ages to consent to sex with older people. Their sick "sexual preference" most certainly does correlate to the beliefs that children are mature enough for sex so that they can justify their actions and have a larger pool of kids to rape!

                 I am not doubting or denying that pedophiles would support a bill lowering of the age of consent.

                 I am making an argument regarding the
                 <strong>
                  LAW
                 </strong>
                 that is philosophically different from the current paradigm.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let's assume that the average age of sexual maturity is
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>
                 . There is some spread to this, of course; let's call it "
                 <em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 ". Some people will become sexually mature at
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>
                 -
                 <em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 and some people will not become sexually mature until
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>
                 +
                 <em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 , so that 99% of
                 <em>
                  all
                 </em>
                 people become sexually mature somewhere between the ages of **X
                 <em>
                  <em>
                   -
                  </em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 and **X

                  <em>
                   +
                  </em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 . This is basic science, without regard to the law.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The law is currently written so that the AoC is (around)
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>

                  e
                 </em>
                 , that is, only people of age
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>
                 +
                 <em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 can
                 <strong>
                  <em>
                   legally
                  </em>
                 </strong>
                 consent to sex. While this ensures that (almost) everyone is, in fact, sexually mature by this point, it also forbids, and therefore
                 <strong>
                  criminalizes
                 </strong>
                 consensual sex for
                 <em>
                  every
                 </em>
                 person who became sexually mature BEFORE **X
                 <em>
                  <em>
                   +
                  </em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 years of age (i.e., like 95-98% of the population.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am arguing that the AoC should be set at
                 <strong>
                  X
                 </strong>
                 -
                 <em>
                  e
                 </em>
                 , so that ALL sexually mature individuals can engage in
                 <strong>
                  consensual
                 </strong>
                 sex without being in fear of the law. Furthermore, this does not prevent you, as a parent, from teaching and mentoring your children about their right to not have sex until they feel they are mature enough for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 ...but I don't think you really care about logic. I think you just want to argue.

                  No, I care about logic and don't just "want to argue". I just don't want to engage in discussing something that is a part of the pedophile agenda with someone who I am about 98% sure is either a pedophile or a pedo sympathizer. I have seen you comments dude! You're not fooling me! Buh bye!

            It was not a ludicrous title, it was true: since a 12-year-old can't really consent to sexual intercourse being so young and immature, lowering the age of consent to 12 is in effect legalizing rape of 12-year-olds. Try to keep up.

            Did you actually just say, "age of consent for rape?"
           </p>
           <p>
            That is quite possibly the most absurd phrase I've heard in this forum, and that is saying a lot.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're missing the point. What OP is saying is they yes, they wanted to lower the age of consent, but that given the low age, it in effect us legalizing rape if 12-year-olds since they really are too young to consent regardless of the law. Since you missed that.

            Citing Alfred Kinsey makes me puke. He was a known pedo. Period. I will have a party when ole Ruthie takes her last nap. She's an enemy of any sort of moral values within our society. She is the Margaret Sanger of our time.

            Quote from article linked: In a 2009 interview for the New York Times Magazine, Ginsburg said the following: “Frankly I had thought that at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.”

             Yes, I agree.  Everything is marketing now.  They started that in the 50's.  Probably the idea of the MK Ultra mind control.  That is about when it started when they brought the Nazi Scientists here.  They think they know what's best for the kids of America.  We need to turn this car around right now.

            Well if Megan Fox is a dude then men are clearly the marketing force behind dazzling women aren't they.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm just sayin the feminist in you is leaking. Marketing is the perversion though and they shouldn't be able to target sexuality in any respect. Unless they're in the business of selling brain crack in which case it's all good since they have a mandate to seek profit that's above question.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then you wouldn't have your feminism to blame men for either. Because there'd be more substance demanded of people than that weak minded bullshit which would have been met with hammers.

            That's partly right. I mean, Megan Fox is a dude.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it sounds like you understand why you're telling them to wait until they're middle aged. To help keep them susceptible to marketing. While they're made fat, ugly and stupid off the shit they're sold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reread your post and substitute 'men' for 'feminism' as an evolutionary exercise in you personal development.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are taking that attitude with you to your classes than you're a monster.

            right, because what young girl or young boy doesn't want to fit in and be accepted by the big kids? They are so vulnerable and impressionable and wanting to be treated as an adult is part of the process of becoming one, so getting raped or abused for that, at that age, is doubly traumatizing. (As opposed to getting raped or abused as an adult, not that in any way I am advocating for rape of adults. )

            Hey, Ginsburg! Do you also believe that 12 year olds should be allowed to have driver's licenses and vote? How about we allow credit cards in their name, too?
           </p>
           <p>
            What's that you say? Their brains aren't developed enough for THOSE kinds of decisions and responsibilities. Just "consenting" to sex, you say.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ginsburg and everyone who supports her "12 should be legal age of consent" crap need to be strung up.

            Notice how there was no link to the 1977 paper they cite? There's your first clue that this might not be a quality article full of true revelations. C'mon people, be better than this. This is Voat, not Reddit - demand evidence to back up claims.

            Didn't CIAnon give out initials of two government members that would soon be charged with trafficking or pedophilia? Iirc, the first were CS (Chuck Shumer) TK (Tim Kaine) and RB (people assumed it was Richard Blumenthal) but maybe they were wrong and it is Ruth Bader instead. I mean the initials fit? Just a thought.

             No, actually she goes by Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I would have no clue who you were talking about if you simply said ruth bader, but if you said Ruth Ginsburg, I would assume scotus.

            Please, I'd like to vomit now. I wish all the straights who  who worship gay men, only discovered they're fun ( they are fun) in middle age, could have a " weekend retreat", gays be honest, and these simpleton straights get a giant red pill heart attack. Yes they really do mean to normalize pederasty and ebophilia, and they could give two shits about babies. Because they cry and poop and get on their nerves. Do they have a conscience about that? Ask them. They'd probably say "Pervert out, just don't mess up the upholstery". OF COURSE not all gays. But we're not talking about the good people here, gay straight or otherwise. Mr. Gay Big Deal WILL have his 16 year old boyfriend and there's nothing you can do about it.

            Does anyone have the PDF of the actual book? The only thing I found isn't the professional print, which is out of print, so new copies are
            <s>
             available
            </s>
            <em>
             unavailable
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            I did find a PDF with page citations for the arguments to:
- lower the age of consent to 12(p102)
- legalized bigamy (p195-196)
- government must provide comprehensive child care (p214)
- integrated sex prisons (p100-101, 216)
- integrated fraternity and sorority (p169)
- integrated boy and girl scouts (p145-146, 219-220)
- mother's and father's days must be same day (p146)
- remove wife and widow benefits from social security (p206)
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically everything she proposed was an attack on traditional family values. What kids are most vulnerable to grooming and sexual abuse? Those without strong families and a positive home life, which builds confidence and serves as a barrier to pedos in community outreach programs sinking their claws in.
           </p>
           <p>
            So does she directly support pedophilia? Not that you can see, but a smart person wouldn't come out and admit such, they would instead push policies that slide us in that direction with normalization tactics.

             This is really what has been going on.  drug addiction issues,  huge numbers of military enlistees on long stints, mass incarcerations, parents working at multiple jobs, housing market bubble all of this works to leave kids and families vulnerable.

              All of this has been created for a reason.  I believe they have arranged the economy this way of course for their profits but also to keep us so busy that we cannot take care of families.  People are stretched to the limit and that is on purpose.

               yes, so that we don't see or have energy to fight what they are doing, so go to work, watch your tv, take your antidepressants, buy shit online and be too afraid or broke that you don't travel and see how you should be living.

                 nana66 added a lot to the great UN corruption post, Ng Lap Seng was buying prostitutes for Stanley Ho's hotels in Macou from Clinton, so that trial with Preet Bharara will be interesting even if there aren't pizzagate arrests, CF/UN shit might come out. Pray they don't settle out of court.

              Yep, and women working full time in traditionally male dominated industries has created a surplus of labor, which has lowered the average household income once adjusted for inflation.
             </p>
             <p>
              My friend was a teacher, who makes piss poor pay, because Arizona sucks in education. She got pregnant, had her baby, took her time off, and went back to work. It costs her more for childcare than she takes home after taxes daily. Can't reason with her though because she is a radical feminist who screams about the pay gap. So now her boy spends the day with strangers from 630am to 6pm. I'm sure he will grow up well adjusted. :/

               the kid will probably be okay but she is better off staying home and collecting welfare and food stamps. She'll enjoy her child more and can spend time studying for a better career when the kid is older. Tell her that I said she should quit until women get equal pay.

                Haha. Yeah I tried that argument. I am gardening now so I am trying to show her that she could use her time for more productive means than trying to educate the little shits at her school, and it would be theraputic for her plus give her bonding time with her son, but she is one of those, "but what about the children" types. We also had a brief falling out when I responded once, "what about your own damned kid? why doesn't he get the same opportunity as she got?" when she was talking about how bright a previously homeschooled girl was. She doesnt even need to work, her BF makes good money in finance. It's one of those you can lead a horse to water situations.

                  yeah, I just know I used to think that I liked working too, until I realized that I was a wage slave. Now I hate it, but it is a necessary evil for the time being. But she is always bitching about work, so I don't think she really likes it, but has been conditioned to think that way, which is why I have always tried to point out to my friends that there are alternatives to that lifestyle, especially when the kid suffers because of it.

                   So just point out all the banks full of crooks that she is supporting. Bear Stearns got 30 million dollars before the 2008 crash, and then folded, Lehmann, Citi, Sachs, $7trillion altogether, what a fucking disgrace. point out that she is financially supporting crimes against her own best interest.

            We all know organs and stem cells are big business. 
"The big profits go to the middle men and "organ brokers" according to article below.

            "There's a black market for hearts, lungs, and livers, but the kidney is the most sought after. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 7,000 kidneys are illegally harvested annually by traffickers worldwide and the prices vary widely by country.
           </p>
           <p>
            The average buyer spends $150,000 (though prices in excess of $200,000 are common) while the average donor gets $5,000. The big profits go the the middle men and “organ brokers”. In the US 98,463 individuals are waiting for a kidney as of October 25, 2013. Of those, about half will die before they receive one.
           </p>
           <p>
            The profits are huge, and money is a temptation many brokers and doctors just cannot resist. In 2010 WHO estimated about 11,000 organs were obtained on the black market. WHO also claims that an organ is sold every hour of every day, 365/7".

            Not a surprise. the pedophiles have their own support networks. This is how they protect themselves, by getting someone when they are young and impressionable, telling them that morality is bullshit, show they can get away with anything, offer a jump start into their career via the network connections, and invite them into the fold. none can out the others because they maintain blackmail leverage over each other. It is mutually assured destruction. And if the person doesn't want to go along, they are either killed or the network uses connections to discredit or Institutionalize them.

            We need to use a fine tooth comb to find this stuff. Looking at the appointments under ghw bush and Clinton would be a good place to start. how many judges were skull and bones or quill and dagger or scroll and key? Then find their early legal judgements or arguments if they are still accessible. You don't develop these positions and then suddenly change, they may change their public position, to conceal themselves from casual scrutiny, but as Hillary's speeches demonstrate, a public statement of values often differs from their privately held beliefs.

            NAMBLA Director David Thorstad claims: "Pederasty, like homosexuality, has existed, and exists, in all societies that have ever been studied. Homoeroticism is a ubiquitous feature of human experience, as even efforts to repress it confirm.
            <em>
             Men and youths have always been attracted to each other, and, like homosexuality in general, their love is irrepressible

            Am I missing something here? Where's the link for Ms. Ginsburg advocating this? Also where are you getting that Podesta advised Clinton to select Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Is it an assumption? Not saying you're wrong, but I would like a link to her advocating this and maybe an article stating that was Podesta was Bill Clinton's advisor. Thanks.

              Great. That's one question answered. I guess it at least points to the fact that Podesta pushing for Ginsburg could have happened as there was this type of contact and relationship. I did read up on Ginsburg and this very strange position on legalizing the age of consent to 12. The official reason was that the age for boys and girls differed and the element of "fairness" was the issue. If the age of consent for boys were that low, she should have opted it for raising it rather than lowering it for girls. Seems simple enough. Plus would the real reason ever be given? The elite often couch their posturings on "fairness" and "equality" when they're done for much different subversive reasons. Like the legalization of child prostitution in Cali for instance. Think they're going to come out and say, "We did it because it makes sex trafficking easier for us." Doubtful.

               yup. I think the legal arena is made deliberately convoluted and obtuse to prevent non-lawyers from participating, and to give judges justification for making decisions that are NOT rational, fair or just and favor the party they chose. The judiciary employs the Baffling with Bullshit scenario in full bloom.

                Definitely. Take letting off these protected elite pedophiles because prison wouldn't be fair and not serve a purpose. Sure it would! Prison is supposed to be punitive. It' great if it's also rehabilitative, but punitive is good enough.

                 so many isolated cases where raping a girl is NO BIG DEAL even by scumbags is a pattern and reflection of social values. Obviously the system needs scumbags more than it needs healthy well adjusted girls. My post where the Idaho Judge let a guy off for this yesterday was deleted. PS prison is simply where you go to learn how to commit worse crimes.

                  Did you tie in that case with others? Or the judge with one of the known players? Try doing that because publicity and shining a spotlight on which judges are doing this, and which scumbags are getting off, is important.

But just off the top of my head you have this idaho case, the stanford rape case, and the Steubinville Ohio case where the football team raped the girl and the whistleblower got more prison time than the rapists.

                    Well, there you go! Your work is halfway done. I understand about the inertia, but if you get a blast of wind under your sails, just start doing searches and cross-searches. Save the links and start tying things up with a bow.

            She did not call for legalizing rape, or for lowering the age of consent to 12. It's incredible how you guys believe everything you read.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an opinion on sex bias in laws, she quoted a bill (that was never passed) as an example of sex-neutral language in rape law, i.e., not defining rape as something a male does to a female, but that one person does to another. That bill that she quoted included a line about "under 12 years old", it was not her suggestion or anything of the sort. She was only quoting it as an example of sex-neutral language. She was not in any way, shape, or form addressing what the age of consent should be.

             "Pedophiles are not generally violent, if there is such thing as pedophiles at all," Levin wrote. "More important, sexual contact with a child does not a pedophile make."
            </p>
            <p>
             No one with certain knowledge of pedophilia, is implying that it may not exist?

             You just linked to Slate fake news where the author admits he hasn't read the Ginsburg manifesto in question. Ginsburg clearly calls for changing the text in the US Code to make the age of consent 12.

             The sex-neutral language she demanded was so liberal men can fuck and get married to 12 year old boys.

             Oh yeah, that progressive BS science they've been feeding us for decades, sure. When you've been red-pilled, you start  questioning everything you've learned over the years and stop taking science "studies" as Gospel, like you once did.

              Scientism. It runs so rampent in academia that even professors are had. Questioning mainstream Science made me a Flat Earther.

                Sorry I should have been clearer about the last sentence. Questioning mainstream Scientific THEORIES made me a Flat Earther. Im not arguing against actual Science, rather the baseless, unsolved Theories that hold no water and contribute to the disease that is Scientism.

             Maybe you shouldn't believe stupid sources and read the original for yourself. The 12 year old line was from a draft bill and she discusses only the gender language. Or don't read it and remain stupid. Your call.

             What do you think the AoC should be? 16? 18? 21?
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally,  I think it should be about... 12 or 13. I don't think kids should be having sex that young, but biologically speaking, some of them are mature enough for it and, if they
             <strong>
              CONSENT
             </strong>
             to it, no one should be punished by an arbitrary law.

              Jesus Christ. I know several people who started "having sex" (being raped) at that age. All have ruined lives. The most successful of them "only" has bulimia.

                It has to be illegal so that there is a legal structure to make sure that kids get the help they need and adult pedos get punished. The age of consent should be 18.
               </p>
               <p>
                I know your next point. What about 17 year olds dating each other?
               </p>
               <p>
                Here in Virginia we have some laws that are in place but not enforced unless we need them. Such as sodomy. We don't actually care what people do. But there was a park in my neighborhood that people couldn't go into anymore because dudes were meeting there and being publicly indecent. Having sodomy laws on the books gave the cops another tool to use to get the perverts back to some kind of decent place, such as, oh, I dunno, a hotel or their own homes maybe? Not a park where people go with their kids and dogs?

            Well, I read this and your statement seems to be true.  The laugh is that the Catholic Family Assoc. of America calls her a potential pedophelia advocate.  The last ones to be pointing fingers when it comes to rape of children.  An interesting fact about RBG is that she was a friend of Antonin Scalia.  They shared many dinners and operas together.  Strange.

             Not a surprise. The left and right are just illusions. The Congress is the same way, you saw it with Trump signing his cabinet appointments, they were all laughing and had inside jokes, dem and rep alike. They go to each other's houses for dinner, go out to concerts, etc. It is because they are in an elite club, so it is easier to relate to people in your career path, especially when you are corrupt to the core.

              That I guess is not getting to be as surprising as I thought.  I wonder what she found so interesting about him after all the things we have been reading about him.  These Supreme Court Jesters have some strange stories in their backgrounds.

                I wonder if RBG would approve of 12 year olds hunting Supreme Court Judges?  I think it might be a great sport.  At lease they should be given rifles when they are hunted by them.  Grown up rich people preying on defenseless unarmed people.  How powerful is that?

                 Ha, nice one. sadistic fuckers. the RBG connection is crazy, I read the link it just blows my mind how anyone can think this way. Do you think that she (or any of the suspects) just said say it as a ruse to get promoted (if they know the game ahead of time) and didn't really mean it? I mean wanting to legalizing sex with 12 year olds is just down right sick.

             ..."Pedophiles are not generally violent, if there is such thing as pedophiles at all," Levin wrote. "More important, sexual contact with a child does not a pedophile make."

            <p>
             After a flurry of controversy ensued, the University of Minnesota Press issued a press release defending its publication of the work.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Neither the University Press nor the University of Minnesota endorses the theses of authors it publishes, including that of Ms. Levine. In fact, some within the university may vehemently disagree," said Christine Maziar, vice president for research and dean of the graduate school in the release. "University presses by their nature will publish work on controversial subjects; it's our responsibility to ensure that the procedures and processes of the press foster both academic freedom and quality publications."
            </p>
            <p>
             Eberstadt, LaRue and others have pointed out that Levine's assertions in the book rest solely on pro-pedophilia sources such as the NAMBLA Bulletin, and Levine's work earned her a book prize from the Los Angeles Times.

             Peter Sprigg, Family Research Council director of Marriage and Family Studies, told CNSNews.com that the movement to de-stigmatize pedophilia within academia can be traced back to Alfred Kinsey in 1948....

             how can these people say this shit. it doesnt bother children? yea wait until they grow up and realize how disgusting and vile a human being must be to corrupt a child.  early chikdhood trauma really fucks someone up, esp if they r geneticallly predispositioned to mental heslth issues, have abusive upbringing. i seriously think study of psychology and improvement if mental health issues has been kept down purposely

             "Pedophilia" (child "love") is itself a term that should be banned and replaced with something else.

             It's inherently about violence, just like rape is.

              I'd suggest that "child molestation" would be a better term, but "molest" is far too mild - its root word, I am fairly certain, merely means "annoy"!
