            The email titled Honduras Maybe Maybe between Hillary and Cheryl Mills. What an ending. Gays consider an underage boy a ‚Äúchicken‚Äù the gay homosexual is theme called a ‚Äúchicken hawk‚Äù. I read that they wear a hanky in their back pocket to spread the word. To let them know. What a way to live. Disgusting seeking out young boys. Our üë¶ Boys.

              Funny he would bring that up. I don‚Äôt know Set Green but if he made a statement like that he should be researched. Highly suspect statement imo. The hanky they wear in their pockets is called a Kewpie Doll. I‚Äôve never seen one but know they use hankies in different ways to send messages to their ‚Äúprey‚Äù. It‚Äôs all sick.

                 if you look at the "art" murals that were taken down in comet, it depicts this as the case. Many of these sick fucks will not face any justice within the legal system as their all involved. But God will punish evil and the works of the devil will never prevail.

             The Voree plates, also called The Record of Rajah Manchou of Vorito, or the Voree Record, were a set of three tiny metal plates allegedly discovered by Latter Day Saint leader James J. Strang in 1845 in Voree, near Burlington, Wisconsin. Purportedly the final testament of an ancient American ruler named "Rajah Manchou of Vorito", Strang asserted that this discovery vindicated his claims to be the true successor of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement‚Äîas opposed to Brigham Young, whom most Latter Day Saints accepted as Smith's successor in 1844. The plates also lent credence to his claim that Voree, not the Salt Lake Valley, was to be the new "gathering place" of the Latter Day Saints. Strang's purported translation of this text is accepted as scripture by his church and some other bodies descending from it, but not by any other Latter Day Saint organization.

             So there is a split in the Mormon church similar to the split in Islam between Sunni and Shi'ite? Is this why there were so many comparisons between Mormons and Muslims during this time period?

              Thanks for answering about the Voree Plates, I'd never heard of them. Here's some information about mainstream Mormonisms' self-contradictory doctrines:

             <p>
              Evidence suggests Brigham Young taught Blood Atonement, where some sins (example, breaking covenants with the mormon church) required the sinner's blood to be spilt, in other words, to kill the victim without due process or a fair trial for their salvation's sake, according to the Congressional Series of United States Public Documents, Volume 1434:

                  Peter W. Smith was a longtime Lake Forest businessman who earlier this year told of his 2016 quest to obtain from Russian hackers more than 30,000 of Hillary Clinton's emails.

                 <p>
                  Smith took his life about 10 days after calling a Wall Street Journal reporter about Smith‚Äôs efforts. Now, his estate is cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee by turning over unspecified documents it requested, Lake Forest attorney William Ensing told the Tribune last week.

Elliott‚Äôs Round Table contemporaries included a fellow Lindsay prote¬¥ge¬¥, top British historian and intelligence director of Chatham House, Arnold Toynbee; Lord Lothian of the notoriously pro-Nazi ‚ÄúCliveden Set‚Äù; Lord Leconsfield, later director of Britain‚Äôs Tavistock Institute psychological warfare center; and media magnate William Waldorf Astor.

Interestingly, that version of Taliesin, deemed Taliesin II, also burned, though in a decidedly less criminal manner. In 1925, a lightning strike ignited faulty wiring, or so the story goes. Again,

               This seems to correspond with the younger dryas period I've seen people talk about in regards to myths like Atlantis. An internet search brought me to a link that said "Atlantis in Wisconsin" where I found an article titled Kenosha - Earliest Evidence of Man.

               Is that why Racine is the "root"? Because the earliest evidence of man is found there? Racine is a 19 minute drive from Kenosha. At risk of going off topic, was the "Garden of Eden" in Wisconsin? I have never believed in such a place before, so it feels strange to ask, but it feels like you might be trying to lead me to something along these lines.

               The path of souls appears to be the Native American Death Journey into the Milky Way. I am struggling to grasp your point but when you say "What if the architecture was more than architecture", are you saying that Frank Lloyd Wrights Taliesen house was designed to send the murder victims through the path of souls?

One additional stellar element is needed. That is that the Scorpius Constellation (the ruler of the underworld) needed to be below the horizon and not visible when the ceremony took place."

               So the Parousia is different than the rapture? The Parousia is the second coming? Are saying that in Racine they are planning to fake the second coming of Christ and possibly also the rapture? Or, in other words, the so-called Project Blue Beam is being run out of Racine?

               In the past I have seen "The Day of the Lord" used to refer to a cataclysmic event not unlike what was said to have occurred at the end of the Younger Dryas Period 12,000 years ago. Could this be the truth that they cannot allow the world to know?

              <p>
               Is the Parousia not what some believe it is because the Day of the Lord is a coming cataclysm? And is the rapture not what some believe it is because people will be taken to safety from this cataclysm, rather than be taken to heaven?
