<p>Quote: &quot;The head of the United Nations Children’s Fund in Belgium resigned today after the disclosure of a child pornography case linked to the Belgian branch of the organization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; <strong>Unicef said it was investigating charges that the Belgian committee was linked to an organization producing pornographic photographs of children and distributing them throughout Europe.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unicef’s mission is to help and protect the world’s children. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;the Belgian police arrested Jos Verbeek, 63 years old, the director of Unicef’s Belgian committee, and charged him with inciting minors to debauchery.</p>
<p>The arrest followed the discovery of a secret photographic studio in the basement of the Brussels building where the committee’s offices are housed. The studio was used to take pornographic photographs of children, many of whom were of North African origin, the police said.</p>
<p>The police said more than 1,000 such photographs were seized, along with a mailing list of some 400 names in 15 European countries that had been prepared on the Unicef office computer.</p>
<p>Similar photographs found in several other European countries appear to have been taken in the Unicef office in Brussels, according to investigators.</p>
<p>Sorry to be cliche but -the past illustrates the present. This UNICEF porn ring sounds eerily similar to what Honeybee has potentially found  w/the corruption re: Brian Podesta Top Secret Clearance lead, - the UNICEF bust seems to have had intelligence ties as well.</p>
<p>There is also precedent in terms of the coverups of all of these types of scandals. Establishment has been very effective at squashing speech on this topic. Like it is attempting to right now on twitter for bringing exactly these cases up. </p>
<p>UNICEF is a child &quot;protection&quot; that was LITERALLY FOUND MAKING CHILD PORN, distributing it, and the bust had intel ties. If it was this bad in 1987 before the internet, I cannot imagine how bad it is now. </p>

            I dug up this 1987 scandal from my memory. Until I posted it on Voat I thought that this was 'just' about misbehaviour of a noble cause institution; I was not even sure whether to post it or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            To my
            <strong>
             big
            </strong>
            surprise another Voat commenter then found out that secret services were involved (I think I overlooked that). Now the UNICEF case matches more closely the patterns in PizzaGate, so that IMO it is a big confirmation of the PizzaGate allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The open collaboration on Voat is great.

             Found the case ^^ a couple of months ago when someone sent me this site as a research resource. Have been trying to get people to look at it since early Jan... along with other cases too. I am so glad more people know about this one. Seems to be really important.

             Absolutely. The fact that it was specifically a "child protection" organization though - when you then look at what Honeybee found -... it shows potentially an example of what her lead is pointing towards. Child orgs used as trafficking and child porn/ prostitution hubs.

              If you have time, would like your thoughts on the following. Would like to make it an official white house petition and flood twitter/voat with it before they purge all of the pizzagate tweeters with large followings (pizzagate angela, you 9217, etc). Thanks
             </p>

              In 2015, then FBI Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division Joseph Campbell referred to the level of pedophilia and child sex trafficking as "almost epidemic".  As concerned Americans and individuals, we are grateful for the concerted efforts the Trump administration has put forth to arrest over 1500 suspects of these disgusting crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sadly, it has become evident that many of these child abusers disguise themselves under the pretense of working for, or being associated with, a "child organization". Documented examples include Second Mile, UNICEF, former Congressional page program, and even the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
             </p>
             <p>
              WE WANT THE EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE OF OUR PRECIOUS CHILDREN THWARTED. We whole-heartedly request a thorough and open investigation by the AG, DOJ, and law enforcement into the activities of these functioning "children's organizations". And we insist on continual investigations until the pedophiles in these organizations and our government are exposed and prosecuted.

               That sounds perfect! I like that idea, and the summup of the children's organizations sounds great. At this point I'm at the stage where every child protection/welfare organization /NGO is suspect until proven otherwise.

            Great research.  The censorship is hitting red hot levels.  We're all getting locked out and immediately locked again when creating new accounts for posting nothing tweets.  I'll start tweeting to get over here to Voat.  Scary times.  Jeff Sessions under attack this evening on Twitter.  Brutal attacks.

             Are you creating new accounts with new email addresses or different IP addresses? If you're suspended, then use the same IP to create a new account, they're probably just shutting your account down because they can see you're the same person opening a new account by looking at your IP address. To view the IP address associated with your Internet connection, look here:
             <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/">
              http://whatismyipaddress.com/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             You can avoid this by only using your phone's data Internet connection to create the new account to post with. The IP you're posting from will be fresh, and they won't know it's you they've suspended in the past. If you go this route, you can't ever use your home/work WiFi to post on Twitter, as they'll see it's the same person they've suspended in the past.

             Alternatively, you can purchase a VPN account, which will make it look like you're using Twitter with a completely different IP address. Someone else who's more well-versed in VPN, please chime in here and ELI5 for everyone.
