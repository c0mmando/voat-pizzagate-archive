<p>Rejoice and Amen! Things are picking up speed and the connections are showing. Seems the entire scummy Bronfman family was involved in whatever the hell they were involved with. We still don\'t know. Yes, Clare and Sara have been ID\'d as members of this \'\'sex cult\'\', but from day one, I\'ve been asking what was the goal of NXIVM? It can\'t have been to find sex partners for Keith Raniere. There had to be a major goal, and I suspect we\'re closer to finding out. The reveal can\'t be far behind because the news is HUGE! Do I keep saying that? Yes! But let me set the stage. </p>
<p>December 31, 2017, Julian Assange tweeted out the video PAPER PLANES along with what appeared to be a block code. Scroll down this link for the tweet:</p>

<p>Well, M.I.A. is a fan of <a href="https://voat.co/user/JulianAssange">@JulianAssange</a>. And last year Assange tweeted this with a link to her song &quot;Paper Planes&quot; followed by what looked like blockchain (code).</p>

<p>If Assange tweets something, it\'s significant! So there was speculation on what it meant and what that code was for ... what would it unlock? And now this ... the revelation that Benjamin Bronfman was married to M.I.A.!!! </p>

<p>Just doing some digging on the Bronfman Family in regards to the #NXIVM cult. We all know Clare and Sara were members. We also know their father had ties to the Clintons. Let\'s take a look at brother Benjamin. Did you know Benjamin was married to the singer M.I.A.? #QAnon 👇</p>

<h1>M.I.A.: The Permanent Revolution of Pop\'s Most Fascinating Radical</h1>
<p>She just wants to release her new album and retire in peace, so why are people so mad at her?</p>
<p>In recent years, M.I.A. has managed to piss off both the NFL (which sued her for $16.6 million for flipping the bird as Madonna\'s guest at the 2012 Super Bowl halftime show; the case was settled for an undisclosed amount) and the U.S. State Department, which right now is denying her a visa to enter the country. Maya, who was born in London to Sri Lankan parents, has a seven-year-old son, Ikhyd, whose father – Maya\'s ex – is the American entrepreneur and environmentalist Benjamin Bronfman. And yet she still can\'t get a visa, quite possibly because she has been pegged in the past as a supporter of the Tamil Tigers, a Sri Lankan separatist group that the U.S. says is a terrorist organization. (Maya denies supporting the Tigers, though she has been an outspoken advocate for Sri Lanka\'s oppressed Tamil minority.) &quot;They never tell you \'no,\' and they never tell you \'yes,\' &quot; she says of the visa process. &quot;[They] just keep saying they\'re investigating me.&quot;</p>
<p>This was published on August 11. 2016, so one has to wonder why The Kenyan\'s administration was keeping her out of the U.S. </p>

            Assange has always been one of them and a limited hangout. He has been seen with Lady Gaga and MIA. He was a"friend" of Pamela Anderson. He was raised in the Children of God pedo cult. His every word was covered by the MSM instead of an info blackout as we see with PG.

            wasn't going to post on this but guess now I am.  So much information its hard to tell where to stop and start.
here is the article which is too long to post.  I hope this makes sense and is revelant.

            One of Igtet’s top backers  is John McCain – a man who has been photographed shaking hands with almost every extremist in Libya and who was a major figure in the plot of the invasion/destruction of the country. 
  Igtet is also friendly with  John Kerry.  Yuck

           <p>
            One of Igtet’s and Sara Bronfman’s business partners is a man named Richard Griffiths – who has considerable connections to American and Canadian intelligence agencies – including the CIA.

            The Bronfmans are one of New York’s most prominent and social dynasties. They have sunk a  portion of their money into US entertainment and communications entities –

            Sara Bronfman, 38, and  Clare Bronfman, 35, became heiresses to the  Seagram a Edgar Bronfman Jr is their half-brother and is a former chairman of Warner Music Group

            the sisters had siphoned off colossal amounts of money from their own family trust funds – to finance NXIVM and its nefarious activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Samuel Bronfman also dabbled in the oil business…
  Eventually the Bronfmans became Canada’s richest family.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bronfman family was the king behind the throne of the organised crime empire in Arizona – that spawned the political career of John McCain.  A man named Jim Hensley was well known in mob circles as a gangster in Arizona .Hensley’s daughter married John McCain . Like the Bronfmans, Hensley was also involved with alcohol –

            "The Bronfman family emigrated to western Canada from the Russian empire in the late 1880s. At first they farmed and worked in construction, but as the children grew up they moved into the hotel-prostitution business, after the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway line. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Since McCain’s career was sponsored by the Lansky-Bronfman syndicate, it is no coincidence McCain recently traveled to London where Lord Jacob Rothschild of the international banking empire raised money among American expatriates on McCain’s behalf. Rothschild has long been allied with the Bronfman family as major patrons of Israel. 

             omg,  cant believe how entertwined these families are, I had missed the connection of the Bronfman family connection to McCain via  the Hensley wife. Now the daughter is in the process of being groomed to take her place in the matrix of governmental/msm/multinational corporations control entities.

             Yeah, the Bronfman's are nothing like their PR. The media loves to whitewash pieces of shit, but then they're paid to.

             All that money propping up a shadow government out to destroy America. Sounds like a plot for a movie, but then Allison Mack isn't even an American citizen. Where the hell are these people coming from that settle here and then take part in wreaking havoc?

            Singer MIA is a piece of shit globalist actor.  She is not on the side of any human beings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Singer MIA uses reddit AMA's to push new albums where she barely answers anybody's questions, much less the pertinent questions about poverty and the pillaging of the third world.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is more concerned with photo shoots while taking up junior level conspiracies and masquerading as a woke individual.
           </p>
           <p>
            She got famous after being married to a globalist - she is a fucking pop culture experiment and most likely controlled op.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll find more photo shoots of her than you will outreach missions/charity.
           </p>
           <p>
            For fucks sake she was brought to the superbowl by kaballah loving madonna.

            And what happened to anybody questioning assange?  He stopped putting out the PGP codes, there is OBVIOUS FAKE DOCTORED FOOTAGE OF HIM THAT MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A BAD PIXAR CHARACTER.
           </p>

            WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING?

            Why are you not questioning this?

            Her major hit song got 12 and 13 year old girls to sing along "All I wanna do is take your money" and soft-sell them down the line into degenerate hip-hop - I was there, I saw it happen.  She isn't fucking helping anyone - she's shooting fucking birds at the superbowl halftime with no real message other than "fuck america".
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck you MIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go ahead and downvoat and shit on me if you have to, I'm doing a job nobody wants to do - being a realist and shitting on fairy tales.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody wants to hear santa isn't real, but for the 10th time I'll say it:  No pop culture actors are ever going to save us from plutocracy, big brother, and the intel agencies.  It's a fucking show people, you're watching a carefully programmed show.

             In the first place, nobody is pandering to her. For now, we're getting the info out. It's like drawing conclusions about Avicii's motives in making those two trafficking videos. I mean, The Kenyan spoke his name, but does that mean Avicii was scum? Or was he a hero?
            </p>
            <p>
             M.I.A. is an unknown. It stated she's a friend of Assange, but in what respect? Pam Anderson also has attached herself to him. There are these strange photos of them together. For me, it's whatever. I don't trust her and I feel she's part of the conspiracy, but we'll see.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for M.I.A., all we know is that that video is important. If Assange tweeted it, it has to be. Something was meant by it. As someone has suggested, it may have been bragging. They do like to flaunt things. So was she flaunting what they were doing in raking in the dough?
            </p>
            <p>
             We'll all find out together. But you're getting angry at everybody before you know how individuals feel is a little premature. My philosophy?

            The purpose of Nxivm is Illuminati type mind control training for individuals and then putting them in various positions of power around the country. Blackmail, espionage type stuff. These people are programmed robots. Remember Maeve the little baby that was being pimped out by her grandmother as one of the future leaders of the country, same thing, they program them young in cult Luciferian Masonic Kabbalah Illuminati Satanic families.

             No doubt that that's an aspect -- an important one. Like the pyschological patent for deprogamming a Luciferian. Such a strange thing and, yet, it's perfect to: (1) position themselves as some sort of mental health/psychiatric authority; and (2) to get families to bring their Luciferian children to them. By showing them the films they already had ''normal baselines'' for, they could see who had the high probability of being mercenary, violent offender type. While they needed leaders and followers, they really needed sociopaths who could kill or do dirty deeds dirt cheap.

             I see what you're saying and it fits. It also fits that those women were not just going to be used for the dump douchebag's pleasure.

            <p>
             The Bronfman family emigrated to western Canada from the Russian empire in the late 1880s. At first they farmed and worked in construction, but as the children grew up they moved into the hotel-prostitution business, after the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway line.
            </p>
            <p>
             Documentation exists that the Bronfmans themselves have been directly involved with intelligence operations. A firm called Space Research was formed in 1968 as a partnership between the Allan Bronfman wing of the family-now represented by Allan's sons Edward and Peter, and A.D. Little, Inc. That firm was ostensibly formed to build howitzers capable of firing warheads into space. It operated, however, as a cover for the smuggling of arms under the sanction of V . S. and British intelligence. Prominent members of Space Research's board included Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau, the former head of V.S. Army R&amp;D Richard Bissell, the former director
of operations for the CIA; and various other retired V.S. army officers.
            </p>
            <p>
             During the pre-1979 period, Space Research sold to Iran howitzers capable of firing short range tactical nuclear warheads. When the Iranian revolution began, the Bronfmans sold their shares in Space Research to Saad Gabr.

            Great post.  Via several websites I was able to determine that M.I.A. never did marry Benjamin even after she became pregnant.  Indeed  Benjamin filed a paternity and international.custody action against M.I.A.. since she was born in England and raised in Sri Lanka  and he was concerned that she would keep their son away from him. She had the same concern due to the extraordrinary  family wealth and power. Evidently the issues were resolved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Benjamin is the nephew of Clare and Sara. His father is Edgar, Jr . and his mother is the African American actress Sherry Brewer. The Bronfman family disapproved of the interracial marriage. Benjamin has used his mother's maiden name Brewer as his surname during his musical career which might create confusion when researching.
           </p>
           <p>
            M.I.A  was raised in abject poverty and had difficulty coping with the family wealth and lifestyle  and could not see herself marrying  into the family even though Benjamin was a liberal do-gooder.  I found nothing to indicate that he or she was connected with NXIVM  other than the family name. Given her personality and fierce independance she would have nothing but contempt for any aspect of NXIVM. Keep all this in mind when doing further research. Perhaps she knew of the shenanigans of NXIVM and she and Assange were laying down clues.

             Great post, I mostly agree with your assessment of the situation. M.I.A is a big Wikileaks supporter and she did appear rather distressed when the Bronfman family tried to use their influence to take her child. M.I.A was signed by Interscope Records, own by Edgar Bronfman.

             It's good to know that Assange is/was on top of this. He knows what's going on hence his being silenced. If you're in the shoes of the Cannibal Elite, you know he could drop the info at anytime.

             Have no idea, but if band members are sitting around and someone even offers a word, guess what? They're given credit for helping write the song. Then there's the music. Add a riff ... credited. :)

              That's what the globalists want to do, especially the environmentalists at the UN and EU.  Both were founded by communists.

            I haven't had time to dig or read much in the past few weeks. My heart is warmed when I log on and see posts like this. Brilliant. Thank you for taking the time to make the connections and for sharing with the rest of us. I could say this over and over and I would never stop feeling sincere gratitude for the work put in. Keep it up, love!

             FULL STOP.

            <p>
             Singer MIA is a piece of shit globalist actor. She is not on the side of any human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Singer MIA uses reddit AMA's to push new albums where she barely answers anybody's questions, much less the pertinent questions about poverty and the pillaging of the third world.  The answers she does give, she sounds like a fucking valley girl - no thought or care put into responses.
            </p>
            <p>
             She is more concerned with photo shoots and getting press while taking up junior level conspiracies and masquerading as a woke individual.
            </p>
            <p>
             She got famous being married to a globalist - she is a paid-for pop culture experiment and most likely controlled op.
            </p>
            <p>
             You'll find more photo shoots of her than you will outreach missions/charity.
            </p>
            <p>
             For fucks sake she was brought to the superbowl by kaballah loving madonna.
            </p>
            <p>
             Come on guyyyyyss.
            </p>
            <p>
             And what happened to anybody questioning assange? He stopped putting out the PGP codes, there is OBVIOUS FAKE DOCTORED FOOTAGE OF HIM THAT MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A BAD PIXAR CHARACTER.
            </p>
            <p>
             WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why are you not questioning this?
            </p>
            <p>
             Her major hit song got 12 and 13 year old girls to sing along "All I wanna do is take your money" and soft-sell them down the line into degenerate hip-hop - I was there, I saw it happen. She isn't fucking helping anyone - she's shooting fucking birds at the superbowl halftime with no real message other than "fuck america".
            </p>
            <p>
             Fuck you MIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Go ahead and downvoat and shit on me if you have to, I'm doing a job nobody wants to do - being a realist and shitting on fairy tales.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nobody wants to hear santa isn't real, but for the 10th time I'll say it: No pop culture actors are ever going to save us from plutocracy, big brother, and the intel agencies. It's a fucking show people, you're watching a carefully programmed show.
            </p>
            <p>
             MIA is reddit hero - let that sink in folks.

              wow, good rebuttal,, your observations reinforce my  opinion she would never allow Keith Raniere to control her. She is uncontrolable . I agree that Madonna ruined  preteens and young.women  and encouraged slutty appearances and slutty behavior.  M.I.A. strikes me as someone  determined to best the baddest of male rappers. Certainlly hard evidence  is preferable to speculation , but hunches and speculations can sometimes lead to hard evidence.  Thanks for reminding everyone to  maintain a measure of cynicism when turning over rocks.

              I've never trusted Assange. I've always thought he was part of the deep state. For one thing, there are subliminals in his photos. What's their long-term goal with all this? I don't know.  Other than Revelation of the method. They gradually reveal what they have done and what they are currently doing. If noone protests and tries to hunt them down and hang them in the town square then they know it's safe to proceed to even worse atrocities. If they tell you and you don't stop them then you feel as though you have enslaved yourself. The great awakening. Awakening to what? A better future? Or to more of the same? Except now you know how evil they really are. They tell you what they're doing not because it's part of a moral code. They tell us because they don't want us to kill them. They are completely devoid of all morality. For God's sake they want to devour you. They want to eat you.

               Shit mane, they could be devouring us in some kind of metaphysical way and we don't know it.  Is that why we need the holy armor?  The breastplate of righteousness and so on?

               That's the other thing, we could already be trapped in the NWO and the jig is that it's already here, and we think it's coming.  I mean progressively we're being pushed into cages - is it already here?

             Thanks so much. I'm only passing things along and keeping everyone in the loop. If I find something, I post it because things really are coming together. Stumbled across something else that might be Q related ... and CNN related. Can't believe they actually used to print news.

            I will say there is definite references to skull and bones in the video, as well as references to communications.which I believe in my opinion could be referring to Titanpointe.

             Bill Gates undoubtedly fits into this. In the prophecy, it said Gates would give Trump the money, that he'd ''open up the gates''. Something like that. I just can't see Gates ''joining'' the fight against the elite since he is one. Maybe the prophecy pointed to the gates being opened through our POTUS' power to seize monies. Just conjecture at this point.

             I definitely have to watch the video again. Maybe I'll understand more than I did the first time around. But more and more is being revealed and the fact the dots are connecting is amazing and should give us hope.

            Nice catch.  Definitely enough pieces of this puzzle are showing to indicate a full picture is becoming discernible.  I need to look at the song lyrics again.  Experience shows how much they love to flaunt it publicly in ways only
            <em>
             the illuminated
            </em>
            can grasp.  I used to play the song
            <em>
             Whiter Shade of Pale
            </em>
            on guitar until around five years ago the light bulb flashed on and i could see what those lyrics were saying.  Felt like throwing up and never played it again.

             Ack! Now I just figured out what those lyrics meant and am throwing up in the back of my mouth. ''shudders''

             Yes, they love flaunting it. I'll have to take a look at that video again. I know Q called out the helicopter accident in Florida and a specific spot in Florida re: planes flying in and out of. He was saying why that locale was important. I just can't remember all this because they're random points of data right now. Once they connect, it'll be all good and I'll get it.

             I think you can probably relax about your favorite music. The writer says this about it:

            <p>
             Also, when he said books were an influence,  In a Tale of Two Cities there is this:  "Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!" Millers in england weren't far out of history at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             it just looks like a typical creative process

              All things are possible, and you might be right.  It could all be just coincidence that one of the, "sixteen vestal virgins who were leaving for the coast,"  "turned a whiter shade of pale,"  when she learned
              <em>
               why
              </em>
              she was leaving for the coast, and though his eyes were, "opened wide (about what is transpiring)",  "they might as well been closed." (nothing is going to change it).
             </p>
             <p>
              The goddess Vestil, as in "Vestil Virgins,"  is the Roman goddess of the hearth.  I wouldn't really expect the song lyricist to casually mention in an interview that it is a song about sex trafficking children (the ones they don't sacrifice to Vestil or Moloch and cannibalize on the spot).
             </p>
             <p>
              There is more, but too much to go into here.  And the suspicion could just be an overactive imagination resulting from years of investigating these sick creeps.  But if it is all coincidence or accidental synergy, it still makes the same allusions.  That's enough for me to stay away from it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Dickens is one of my all time favorite authors.  I've  read
              <em>
               A Tale of Two Cities
              </em>
              at least twice i think, but it's been so many years that i definitely don't remember that quote.  I believe you that it's there, and it is at least a vague resemblance to the line in the song.  But not close enough to convince me.
