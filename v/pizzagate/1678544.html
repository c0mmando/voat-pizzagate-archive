            Google has responded and claims that NN was taken down because of a "sneaky mobile redirect" embedded in one of the pages on NN.  They claim that as soon as Adams removes it, he can apply to have the site reinstated with them:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hi! I work with the Google Search team. We’re seeing a bit of confusion &amp; incorrect stories circulating about what’s happening here, so just to be super clear — Natural News is using a sneaky mobile redirect, which is prohibited by our webmaster guidelines (there’s a bit about this kind of issue at
            <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/detect-and-get-rid-of-unwanted-sneaky.html">
             https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/10/detect-and-get-rid-of-unwanted-sneaky.html)
            </a>
            ). These redirects aren’t always easy to reproduce, they’re sometimes in widgets or served by ad networks, and can target specific devices, browsers, or user locations. When we last checked, there was one on blogs .naturalnews. com/bentonite-clay-a-natural-medicine-cabinet-must-have/. As soon as this is cleaned up, the site can submit a reconsideration request through Search Console, and once that’s reviewed things will return to normal. No action has been taken based on the editorial content of this site."
           </p>
           <p>
            So Google is explicitly telling us that “Natural News” is using “sneaky mobile redirects” and that is the reason for why they were removed and not editorial content (i.e. all the quackery and nonsense). What are those?
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the Google Blog link, a mobile redirect occurs when a website shows different content to someone using a mobile device than what is shown to a desktop user. This is sometimes useful and completely acceptable, such as showing an optimized version for mobile users where images are not out of whack or were navigation is better. Some mobile redirects, are unacceptable to Google. These “sneaky” redirects occur when a mobile user is redirected to an entirely different website. Webmasters sometimes implement these on purpose and Google can take action and manually remove those websites from their search results. However, it can also happen without the website owner being aware, such as when it happens due to ads or compromised by a malicious attacker.

            David removed the videos himself. Please stop talking about him here, Podesta and Brock have a shill army waiting to pounce on any chance to destroy him. They're into kicking someone when they're down, and they do it here more than anywhere besides their MSM. He no longer has his HuffPo column. He lost it the minute he questioned whether Hillary was lying about her health. This column was where he called out the establishment on issues such as the NDAA indefinite detention clause. He then lost his very positive Wikipedia bio page the minute he began talking about pizzagate. Now he is the subject of fact-free hit pieces in the MSM, and extreme cruelty in comment sections all over the web.
