            Hey guys, sorry I have been busy the last two days. here is Giustra's youtube channel
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FrankGiustra">
             https://www.youtube.com/user/FrankGiustra
            </a>
            on his food revolution video he talks about how his dad was from Argentina, (possible ex nazi?) and how he is involved in pushing gmo's and his hollywood connections, etc. 
it was long and his channel has a bunch of vids, and I have been too busy to comb through them. I am willing to bet there is a bunch of useful info here.

* Martelly's prime minister lasted 5 months.  Martelly has been accused of taking millions in bribes and no elections at any level have taken place since his election until 2015.
* At so
me point in 2011 Baby Doc Duvalier returned.

            When the Parliament's term was over Parliament was dissolved.  Martelly left office in Feb 2016 without a successor having been chosen because the presidential election was so fraud ridden.  A week later a provisional president of Haiti was appointed for a term lasting until June 2016.  Almost a year later, he finally expected to be replaced by an elected president next month.

            Haiti has had over 30 coups in its history.  Food production per capita went down 30% in 1990's, because Haiti literally has lost the soil to grow crops.  It's a mess and was a mess long before the recent earthquake.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this big picture is missed by folks who try claim something was caused in recent years.

             "big picture is missed by folks".....That's true. Haiti was never stable. But doesn't that make them the ideal "sucker" for a scammer? The earthquake happened and they lost the last ounce of resistance. Then the Clinton Foundation descended on Haiti like the Black Death and the rest is History no?
            </p>
            <p>
             Surely you'd agree. All evidence points to the Clintons raping Haiti. There's very clear evidence of money laundering with the IHRC. Ditto with Hillary's brother and his Gold mine with no Gold. Gold mines are sketchy as it is. So when people buy a used Gold mine it's even more so. It'd make the perfect cover for laundering money no? Pump in ill gotten proceeds from Middle Eastern kick backs and oil plays and that shit will come out smelling like Pink Roses.

            Does this not smack of Whitewater?!  It worked same way by lending people money for their homes they could not afford and then when in default they would acquire the property back and then sell them.  Some people went to prison for it, but as usual Clintons walked from that scandal.  Would be interesting if property was leveraged and how many of those properties ended up in the Clintons' lap.

            If you want to see how one of these Acceso brands treats its people on the ground, how about some real life interviews with people who have been recipients of these supports. The Haiti Acceso is an offshoot of the already established Columbian Acceso, heres some real interviews with people in Columbia after getting help

            . Heres some highlights
           </p>
           <p>
            'The jilted fish-seller'
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Sandra said she received no money from the Clinton Foundation and, in fact, took out a large bank loan at its urging. Paying this loan proved to be a tremendous burden, she said. Even worse, within months the head of the Acceso project told her that she should no longer deal directly with buyers. Instead, she would sell her fish directly to Acceso — at sharply reduced prices — and Acceso would resell them. In other words, the Clinton Foundation would act as a middleman and profit from margins supplied by the people it was supposed to be helping. Sandra and eight other Acceso participants immediately dropped out, she said, worried that “if we had stayed with them, we would have gone out of business.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            ‘concentration camp for workers’
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...desk was stacked high with papers related to Pacific Rubiales’s labor practices, the result of years of investigative work by his staff. He did not see the Clinton Foundation and its partnership with Giustra’s Pacific Rubiales as either progressive or positive. “The territory where Pacific Rubiales operated,” he said, thumbing through pages of alleged human-rights violations, “was a type of concentration camp for workers.” Robledo said he had no doubt that Bill Clinton had successfully overcome legal and regulatory obstacles for Giustra’s benefit, especially given Clinton’s strong relationship with Colombian President Uribe and his stature as a former U.S. President: “Bringing Bill Clinton to Colombia was like bringing God,” he said.

            Hi sorry no intention to misled or waste time, just postin for the attention of pedogate and traffcking (maybe adoptions) researchers here an elderly photographer link specialised in weddings and new born babies. According to pipl he is 74. of the 2 images here one shows his website to get info. The other image has a very little girl with a t shirt that has a logo similar to the girl lover. Bear in mind of the whole website it is the only baby or person to have a slogan and a logo, and this looks like an advertisement to me. His FB allso plastered with new babies all the time.

            Man. Everything the Clinton's did in Haiti was a family deal using US Aid money to get it kick started. Why isn't the entire Clinton family (including Hillary's brother etc...) rotting in a jail cell right now? How much more evidence is there that a Democratic cabal of crony-capitalists claiming to be socialists, is crowded around this witch and her pathological lying and raping husband? If Trump doesn't have these ghouls charged and locked up ... well ... what does that say for the word Justice? Giustra and a strong Canadian connection seem to be a very promising lead, especially after we found that pedo symbol on the logo of that Giustra based refugee processing 'charity'.

           <p>
            In November I went on the border data and noticed they were trying to change identification for what constituted a family and a child.    I don't have screen grab and I gave the sites to a forum member, because I don't have digging skills.
            <br/>
            I haven't heard anything back on that dig.
           </p>
           <p>
            The info looked like  border deregulation and declassification had a stream from  USA, to Canada,  (back and forth) and from Vancouver Canada to Australia, from what I could find.  Like I say,  I can't find those  Canada/USA border pages now.
Guistra was based out of Vancouver, Canada right?
           </p>
           <p>
            The declassification of children and families blew me away as I looked at it recorded online.
Maybe somebody with better skills could find those pages?
           </p>
           <p>
            You look at all the Canadian  child funding and child help agencies,  it's an unreal amount, because Canada's population is smaller than California.   And,  the Canadian  Child Protection Services  has the same problems as the  USA,  where is all that  help and $ going in proportion to the agencies and funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the other day I went back on some of the agency names and all the   'staff'  bio  info has been deleted from many of them.
            <br/>
            One of the staff of a Canadian child funding agency  had a Slavic name, and her former job was - get this -  working at  LavaLife.  I checked an online  expose lavalife and came up with what looked like    something questionable -  not really a dating site that the exposers were comfortable with.   I hoped to dig for connections between  the Ukraine/Canada/USA, but no skills in that area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another Canadian  child funding agency  worker  had a bio working at IBM,  another guy from another agency worked in bio-  experimentation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dumped all the links on the forum person  GrimReader, and that person is now nowhere to be found with the dig.
            <br/>
            I was new at the time and didn't realize to trust no one.  I gave all that info to GrimReader because they'd just put out the Hawaii connection info, which seemed trustworthy and I thought they'd be able to dig and hunt on the new Canada CPS info that I'd located.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I have no idea how to retrieve site info that's been scrubbed, because since then  much of it has been scrubbed.

              One of the agencies top staff  was a woman with a  Slavic type name.   Her bio was weird... involved in  lavalife and then in a Canadian child services / funding agency.
When I checked an expose lavalife I came up with this sight out of Australia:

              I don't have screen grab (which is why I passed on all my info, because I couldn't format it.)
here's a copy/paste of the info:

              </p>
              <p>
               The overly-sexual layout is not only ugly and unusable, but also scares off women from joining. That means, obviously, that there aren't any actually on the site.
              </p>
              <p>
               With a site like LavaLife.com, you just have to accept that you’re going to be continuously disappointed. It’s sad, but that’s honestly all that you’re going to end up getting here.
              </p>
              <p>
               It’s all a waste.
              </p>
              <p>
               The more that you dig into this site, the more you’re going to really end up seeing that it’s mostly just a really poorly designed layout in red and black, with a lot of fake profiles.
              </p>

              <p>
               That’s literally it. That’s all you’re going to get here, and it’s really sad to think of any men actually joining this site, because women certainly don’t even come close to doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
               The main reason behind this, of course, is that the site itself is just too overly sexualized. Most of the profiles really do seem to condone the use of a lot of sexual terms.

              <p>
               We ended up spending a grand total of four months on our LavaLife review, and during that time, we sent out a total of 150 chat messages to ladies that we met online.
              </p>
              <p>
               It wasn’t good enough.

              <p>
               From those 150 chat messages, we could only get a grand total of 41 responses overall, which was just not even close to our minimum that we really do like to see.
              </p>
              <p>
               From those 41 messages, not a single woman actually wanted to end up meeting up with us in real life, which really did show us exactly how dead the whole site was.
              </p>
              <p>
               This site just ended up being a disappointment on every single level, and we can’t even say that we were surprised. This is just the kind of site that you really want to ignore.

              <p>
               Spending time on a site like the LavaLife Australian site was really just an eye-opener about what not to do when it came to dating site. It’s just one big mess after another.
              </p>
              <p>
               It’s not good enough.
              </p>
              <p>
               One glance at the front page might have you unconvinced about how bad it all is, but the second that you really join up and start cruising around the site is the second it proves how bad it is.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is, there just isn’t any care here, and it’s all running off of a ‘sexy’ template that most people are going to end up fed up about within the first fifteen minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
               That’s because it’s not intuitive, and it certainly doesn’t promote the kind of intimate atmosphere that most women are dying for. That makes this site just subpar at best.

               LavaLife.com is an Online Dating Site That You Need to Avoid in the Future
              </p>
              <p>
               We were really not impressed with LavaLife.com, and that’s because it’s just not even close to good enough. This site really does miss the mark for us at every single turn.
              </p>
              <p>
               We hated that.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing about this site is that it tries too hard to be sexy, and that certainly does turn off a lot of ladies from every wanting to join it. That’s why the numbers are so bad.
              </p>
              <p>
               This means, ultimately, that you just aren’t going to end up getting the kinds of dates that you want. You’ll be lucky if you ever even get to talk to a woman consistently.
              </p>
              <p>
               That’s not what we’re here for. We’re here for real dates in real life, and this site can’t even come close to providing that for us. That’s why you just need to leave it alone.
              </p>
              <p>
               Skip it.
              </p>
              <p>
               With a site like this one, the only real thing that you can end up doing is just to leave it alone. It’s not good enough, and it’s never going to end up giving you good results.
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead, check out our number one site, Xpress.com. It’s the site that you really do need to go to if you’re looking for an awesome dating opportunity, and we’ve proven that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Give it a shot, and you’ll definitely be able to have fun. We know that without a doubt, you’ll be able to meet a ton of ladies online, and it’s going to be something you love

              The article says that it doesn't behave like a normal  dating sight, and the article does   read  like a cover for a pedo ring, not a dating sight,   so I don't know what's up with this -  the website article may be the actual hook-up; I've never used the dating sight and have no idea - which is why I wanted  GrimReader to look into it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I thought it was odd that a fundraising child agency would hire a person from a dating sight.  Not unusual, but odd, and when I looked at the expose link it really made me think it needed to be investigated.  But  GrimReader, the person who delivered  the Hawiian connection info, hasn't replied.   he/she  said they'd take all my data  (which I pm'd on this forum)  and do offline resaserch and get back to me.   I remember that I sent it to this  PG member the same day of the CPP shooting.
             </p>
             <p>
              People were concerned about  GrimReaders safety, because  after they dropped the Hawiian Connection info a few interesting PG things happened,  which  made many on the forum members  concern for  .
             </p>
             <p>
              So I went back to some of these  agency sites and the staff bios that I linked to are scrubbed.

            THIS is the kind of investigative reporting that we should be seeing from "pro" journalists in MSM, right NOW. And should have been seeing all along. So pro, you Pizzagate investigators are, doing the msm's job, without the six-figure reward.

            This is a great post. Keep the rural farmers poor so they sell their children for $50 with promises of an education and food. That is called human trafficking and it seems to follow the Clintons like a cloud.

             “While travelling in southern India I saw this terrible abuse of child labor,” explains Hand in Hand co-founder Percy Barnevik. “I started to buy them out for about US $150 a child. I was in mind to buy out 200,000 children, which becomes quite a lot of money. I realized that I had to attack the root cause of the problem: poverty.”

             How can you use ports without trained port operators?
            </p>
            <p>
             Smugglers have to answer that question, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very questionable that a YOUTH program is training port operators.  In the USA, that would be illegal; port operation is considered to be dangerous labor subject to concomitant heavier regulation about who can do the work.

And then this in another article about Abbot Laborites and their donations to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was Sec. of State:

            You could also just set a logistics company for peanut exports and then just skip to the end.

           <p>
            OR WOW, may be the USDA had a peanut glut on its hands and learned the Clinton-Slim-Giustra were going to use their company for something other than peanuts and they flooded the market to shut them down.

            Damn right something weird. The Clintons already did this with rice (flood the Haitian market), depressing rice prices and bankrupting and already impoverished population. This would just be the next "installment" of Clinton rape of Haiti.

             Another thing this does is force farmers out of their villages into cities to look for work. Makes for a more mobile population where familes can lose touch with their members more easily which could lead to missing kids. Sex work is always an option if no other work is available.

            Great find! Considering that much of the promised relief aid / funding actually reached Haiti, I'm curious if these shipments can be traced. I suspect that this is probably another shell company to funnel cash though.

             Don't engage this dickhead shill ( arewesure ).  You're spot on... this is about destroying the independence of Haitian farmers and creating desperation.  Cargill, Monsanto, ADM, and the World Bank have been destroying independent farming since the 1970's

                If you don't already know, Ebola doesn't exist (in the way the media presented it). It was an excuse for them to get boots on the ground to secure Nigerian Oil and Diamonds in Sierra Leone.

                The plane was shooting the building, not the people fleeing. Why would a US warplane attack a humanitarian center in a warzone? They were not harboring terrorists. Even an enraged warhawk in the military wouldn't do that. There is a deeper subtext. There is a lie.

               <p>
                Someone in the military knew something that we do not. They are probably gone now.

              I read up on this story last week, seems that CF set all these farmers up to grow peanuts and then US gov. flooded Haiti with free peanuts ruining the farmers market values. This "help" destroyed the local people more than just leaving them alone would have.
