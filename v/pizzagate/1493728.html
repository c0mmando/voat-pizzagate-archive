            FBIanon (if you believe him) said Hillary sold a huge hunk of classified information to the highest bidder. He called them SAPs

            We need to remember that. I am guessing Saudi Arabia or Qutar.  Those were some HUGE Foundation donations. And she would also be paid in kids.
This is the biggest story of my lifetime.  The illuminati.  That Soros is leaning on Facebook to sensor fake news makes me know in my bones we are almost there!

             The SAP program was found on Weiner's lappy, that Huma used too right? It was just willy nilly out there for anyone to take.There's two more, Hillary had them too. Protocol calls for going through layers to use them.. and that's treason to bypass it for their benefit...

            Totally agree mate! Just want to correct you on 1 thing - George Soros introduced HRC to Haiti, not the other way around. This happened prior to 1998, it's shown on an interview of Soros in the show "60 minutes" in an episode from 1998. I posted that interview on a thread but didn't get much attention, I think it's quite relevant because of that part (05:20) and because it shows how unbelievably powerful he already was eighteen years go. I really mean unbelievably!
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4-pm_MOEbw&amp;t=2s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4-pm_MOEbw&amp;t=2s
            </a>
            You watch that 13 minute long interview, you remember FBIanon's words: "George Soros is at the heart of all of this", and the conclusion is: "makes sense this guy is ruthless!"

            we have definitely NOT "exhausted" connections regarding Alefantis, who has a sketchy past at best, when that can be located. Others as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            For instance, who knows that "Podesta" was a TITLE or name given to "high officials" in Italy:
           </p>
           <p>
            PODESTA
1. any of certain magistrates in Italy, as a chief magistrate in medieval towns and republics. 2. a person appointed to serve as mayor of an Italian city during the Fascist regime. ... 1540-50; &lt; Italian podestà power &lt; Latin potestās power, command.

            Yes, but you hit at the weak link and that is Alefantis. He's coming apart at the seams. They're in damage control and they don't do that unless damage has been done. JA is the one that's been running his mouth all over social media and its his tracks we can follow. We can't let up on him or his friends, or Brock. Remember the rent being paid to a non-existent company and the houses sold to a dead person? Then there's PEGASUS MUSEUM. There was a superlative post confirming it's an active project, but what it is has not been revealed. Keep digging into JA and DO NOT LET UP!

             Alefantis is a perfect fall guy. If our efforts are focused on him they can make him look like a victim or they could "disappear" him. The entire reason this investigation is still going is because of the global implications. They can cut James out of the story, but people like the Clintons, Soros, the Royal Family... if one goes down they will drag the entire house of cards down with them.

              Nope not that simple. JA has been to the White House and people have already rallied around him. Then there's Comet Pizza. They can't let that building go. If they let it go, it's secrets will be revealed, like that passageway from Bucks to Comet. I'm not saying focus only on him, but what do you hope to find out about Podesta? You think he's been blabbing on the web? Social media? Where he got loose was mixing business with pleasure like with spirit cooking and Luzzatto pool time swimming. But the only way we know about that is because of the leak (leak not hack). The only one that's been blabbing has been Alefantis so the clues are with him. And you can't go after Soros without someone like JA or Brock or even Sasha Lord singing their little hearts out and telling what they know. It's the way it goes.

               Dude. There's nothing in Comet Ping Pong anymore. There's nothing in those tunnels anymore. To believe otherwise is to suggest that our enemies are incompetent at every level. No, Podesta is not "blabbing on the web," come on now. But what he and others at the highest level
               <strong>
                have
               </strong>
               been doing is making deals with large foreign entities. James Alefantis is one specific piece that shows us one thing and one thing only: that there is a market for this in the USA. James blabbing on instagram pointed them out for us, but you are never gonna get the King by going after a foot soldier. You are never gonna link CPP to pedophile rings in Norway, Canada, UK and Australia. You're not gonna find some secret code embedded in Alefantis' art that's gonna show transaction records between America's elite and Qatari royalty.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is so much more to this than CPP, and there is an extremely limited pool of information that we can expect to find there. The fact that you seem to think that Alefantis or Sasha Lord (lol) would ever,
               <strong>
                ever
               </strong>
               even HAVE any info to give on someone like Soros is just silly. Soros could probably throw Hillary herself under the bus and come away scott free. You are severely underestimating the scope of what we're dealing with.

                Then you don't know about investigation. You only go after The King by going after foot soldiers. Who do you think leaked the info? Foot soldiers. And with the massive amount of deals Alefantis put together, he was more than a foot soldier. He was an active participant and obviously you don't know what you're talking about because a passageway exists between Comet and Bucks. What happened to it? Magic tooth fairy take it away? Poof? Gone? Doubtful. And Comet has a basement. If they're not using it for storage, WTH are they using it for? Talk to somebody else. You ain't shakin' me, bro. Not one little bit.

            Can we do this in a structured, organised way, like have a list of things that need looking into, following up on, and then three people agreeing to take on one of those things each, so efforts aren't duplicated and we know we've covered everything?

             right, something on the order of $540,000 net after expenses...? that's some crappy art gallery. probably money laundering, which is what a lot of the art trade is about.

            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.

            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

            " Infants' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. "

            " The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "

            Why does this seem like a shill post to me?  You have zero links or verifiable truths in your post.  You are trying to lead the investigation to your chosen direction.  Megyn Kelly just had Alefantis on last night and people EVERYWHERE are condemning her, NOT just voat/chans/etc.  It seems the closer that Alefantis comes to being dropped on, the more that people keep begging to push the investigation into the direction of Saudi Arabia.

            Why might that be?

             I've followed this since before there was even a reddit thread, and stumbled upon these wikileak code words personally. This post is ignorant. You honestly think Alefantis is the mastermind worldwide? Give me a break. Take the leaders down and Alefantis will fall along with them. I'm not saying Alefantis is innocent by any means. But lets remember it was Podesta's emails that were incriminating and he clearly holds more power in Washington. Silencedogood was a pseudonym used by Benjamin Franklin when writing to his brother's philadelphia news paper. Silencedogood is a name for complete transparency. Learn some American history man and stop over thinking shit. Bigger fish need to be fried with Alefantis, so lets get them.

                   Correct, you need to grow up because although you disagree with me, I'm not choosing to attack your character by calling you a shill. If you want to disagree with my conclusion then by all means argue with them and present your conclusions but don't you dare call me a shill because I take way too much shit from my friends who have concluded I've gone off the deep end with pizzagate with how much I post on social media about it only to be called a shill by some small minded anonymous on a thread who appears to be suffering from lack of attention.

            Is there anything to suggest that he or GWB had anything to do with occult, or anything? Seems like the Saudi's have been comfortable for a long time. The Bush's and the Clinton's seemed to have gotten along pretty well, and even had a easy exchange of power.

              Edit: Fuck it. Read Manly P. Hall's Secret Teaching of All Ages and Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma. I have my own physical copies. Plus the Nag hammadi library, hermetica, and a shit ton of other related but not immediately the topic stuff.

            Imho Alefantis is not peanuts as he is one of the fronts/trading markets in DC.

            But you are right, the ties are worldwide and it all leads to a corrupt political "elite" that operates within a global net of governements, military and businesses. I wanted to remind of "Camp Bondsteel", the notorious military base in Kosovo, that still exists although war in Yugoslavia has ended decades ago. It mainly serves as a marketplace for the Albanian Mafia and government (which is basically the same) for trading arms, drugs and - humans.

             Podesta's are SAUDI agents
            </p>
            <p>
             The Podesta Group – owned by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is Chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign – was hired for a $200,000 public relations engagement with the Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             Alefantis is in a homosexual relationship with John Podesta, that's why Alefantis is important.  Alefantis provided fun open area on the pizza-blocks the dark shit happened at other nearby sites.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brock broke up with Alefantis 5+ yearsa ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta is Serious SAUDI front man for the pizza-blocks

            <p>
             Andrew Kline (DOJ) is still the man who put it all together and kept everyone out of jail.

              Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

              Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

              So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
             </p>
             <p>
              " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
             </p>

             <p>
              Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

              Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
             </p>
             <p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's take a look at their lyrics now.
             </p>
             <p>
              " Infants' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. "
             </p>
             <p>
              " The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "
             </p>
             <p>
              Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.

             Saw your comment and just wanted to make it clear. I don't want to undermine what has been found of alefantis. What i'm implying is that if you take down the larger players who are obviously morally bankrupt, they always are willing to rat people like alefantis for a better deal. Taking care of the larger parties involved will inevitably destroy alefantis.

            This.  Your analogy makes a lot of sense and is good advice.  I think people have been focusing so much on Alefantis because the shocking pics of the children anger and sicken them and they want to take him down.  But our focus needs to be on the larger prize.  The Clinton Foundation.  Also, the Podesta Bros. have a lobbying business involving payments from SA.  There must be a connection there as well.  Yes, it is all intertwined.  Pull out one brick and the whole house will come tumbling down.  Like the three little pigs.
