<p>Hello Pizzagaters! Was screwing around on Twitter and thought I\'d see what Teigen was up to. I don\'t follow her and the thought was probably induced by what I saw yesterday. Seems Teigen and Daniels [as in Stormy] are TWEETING BUDDIES! Well, tweeting at least. Link: </p>

            The Kardashian women are Armenian witches from what I understand, maybe, probably. Like, Marina Abromavitch style witches evil shit.

            Have you seen "The Black Child" youtube videos on all that. The Black Child is a black negro guy that is totally tuned in and sharp as fuck on that situation. I backed it up and archived his videos because I suspected his videos would get deleted from youtube. Well, his whole channel got deleted and he was one of my favs. I have it a LOT of The Black Child videos saved. He knows his shit. He has tried to re-establish but I don't know if the Armenian Witches Kardashian Clan has been reuploaded or not. I save The Black Child's work for posterity because it is special! I don't know who The Black Child is but he is a knowledgeable dude.

            His old channel was bad ass. This is his new channel named The Black Matrix. I hate that they wrecked his old channel because it was the bomb.

            From a purely technical standpoint - what can be accomplished with one's SIM chip? It's registered to a phone and can only contain a finite number of contacts based on my understanding. Unless* if in the right hands it could be popped into a mobile device/SIM chip reader, used to fake authenticate the device, and then restore files from the cloud.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this method would require the user to have backed up their incriminating content/text/images/etc. all on the cloud... I have nothing on my phone, literally nothing, that I would care if anyone saw. And I don't even back stuff up on the cloud. Wouldn't it take a special kind of stupid to be involved in Pizza and to also be backing up content remotely?
           </p>
           <p>
            Final thought: Perhaps there is a way to bypass this, assuming the NSA "has everything" as Q has stated, maybe the SIM chip acts as a key into the NSA database and everyone, is always, "backing up to a cloud drive" whether or not they think they are/have volunteered to do so.

             This.

            <p>
             It was along the lines I was thinking. And as for what people do with their phones, I don't think we can go by what us non-elite do. I would imagine even her contact list could prove connections that she denies having ... and as long as you brought up Q ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Think logically. If someone did go to the trouble of stealing her SIM card, there had to be a reason. You have to open up the phone and pop it out so it's not like she left a $100 on a table and someone could just swipe it and put it in their pocket.. They went to the trouble of stealing it out of her phone ... not taking the phone, but the card. It demonstrates a planned action. If it's a planned action, then there was a purpose. A purpose and a cover that it was even gone. So logically, the person that took it had to know and be able to implement whatever they planned on doing to it. Or selling it ... or leaking it ... whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the remarks. It's always good to useful feedback for brainstorming.

            Sims cards don't store data, just your phone info for sign in to your carrier, so maybe someone took the sim card to stop her from calling people?

            But then there is still the internet so I got no idea.

            Notice Chrissy named her daughter Luna as in moon, darkness. Kim Kardashian named her daughter North-what people don’t know is that North is for North Star and she is a moon child which has significant occult meaning. As I understand it, Kim Kardashians husband Kanye’s mother died right before North was born. A sacrifice given.

             Kanye's mother died in 2007, the daughter was born in 2012.  The sacrifice of his mother was said to be about his career not his daughter. I think the guilt of his mother is what sets him off.

             Thanks for the info. As for the occult, they're into that crap. Their brains are rotting from within. It gets me physically ill to think about them bringing innocent children into this. They'll be raised to think what they do is right, and to fight any help.

              Another interesting tidbit is Khloe Kardashian was supposedly pregnant with her ex husband Lamar’s child and was aborted as a sacrifice. There is a video of him being hounded with questions by someone when no one was around and he confirmed she was pregnant and they couldn’t have the child it wasn’t allowed (sacrificed). First born is usually sacrificed. Pretty sick considering she was always talking about not being able to conceive. So many lies to the public. The whole family is SICK.

            Good chance that it is simply her main squeeze, John Legend, attempting to clone her phone so that he can spy on her. Maybe he took her sim card out, planned to clone it right quick before she noticed it was gone, and didn't get the sim card back into the phone before she noticed it missing.

             Took her Sim Card.  Yes.  Remember what an Anon told us.  The Cards.  I believe Sim Cards are being stolen and used or new ones applied for for some refugees.  Remember the lawyer that was found in Fla.  on the beach?  He was working on a case involving cards.  I think there is more to be looked into with these cards.  We have researched before but I believe the digging was not deep enough and in the right place.  I could be wrong...............but Sim Cards keep popping up.

             I was also thinking that she wanted to destroy the card. She said she'd been working on other devices, so she might have transferred all the juicy blackmail/ritual stuff. Then she pops onto Twitter to say, "Whoopsie!" Everybody knows she's an idiot and probably loses track of Luna several times a day so no one thinks anything of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm telling you, though. I HOPE it was a friend/acquaintance that couldn't stand her lording her position of power over everyone ... or was tired of being blackmailed him or herself. So

             steals the SIM card so they can leak it. If that's accomplish, no more position of power because both Teigen and Legend are exposed for what they are.

              I used to work at a mobile phone carrier and SIM cards aren't really used for storage so much anymore. There are maybe a few contacts but everything is stored on the cloud now unless they're deliberately storing on the card, which there is hardly any space on anyway.

                Depends most people these days store their contacts not on the Sim card but in the cloud or on the phones memory. So there may be a few contacts on there but likely not all of them. Especially if she didn't even notice it was missing. Her contacts being missing from her phone would have alerted her, of course you would think so would her phone being disabled. And most phones alert you when you don't have a Sim card in them. So that makes me feel like it wasn't a phone she used daily anyway.

                 If you read the tweet again, she states she wasn't using her phone for a couple of days which means he was uploading to the cloud most likely. That could have been compromised by the use of the SIM card.

               I'm telling you, though. I HOPE it was a friend/acquaintance that couldn't stand her lording her position of power over everyone ... or was tired of being blackmailed him or herself. So

               steals the SIM card so they can leak it. If that's accomplish, no more position of power because both Teigen and Legend are exposed for what they are.

            That Teigen is a nasty one. You can tell she thinks she gonna handle it all for John and be his ride or die bitch. Thats a big problem with all those yacht girls that forget they are transitory and impermanent with ANY of these playing "celebrities". She seems like a real undereducated viper that thinks she can do some real damage but will most likely become one of the bigger messes in Hollywood when she gets dumped.

            Hopefully that SIM card will turn up in a papparazzi's hand and pictures will get published of her getting fisted by her daytime lesbian entourage.

             Wishing so hard that it's leaked. It would be such karmic justice. If she has nothing to hide .... ?

             I agree with everything you said. It's what the backing of The Cannibal Elite can do to one's mentality. They do believe themselves to be invincible ... same thing's going on with Avenatti. He's got heavy-duty backing so he thinks what he's been getting away with will be covered up.

              It's a simple card, not a memory card. It would hold contacts at the most... SIM cards manage the phones functionality but store very little data, that's for the phone memory or sd cards...

                That's a stretch. So you take a Sim card and put it in another phone. You would still need the users password to access the cloud. The Sim card would only help to pass the second part of two factor authentication.

                 Look, I don't want this to turn into a long protracted argument. If you don't like the theories, the fact remains she stated it was stolen.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Going back to Q, ''THINK LOGICALLY''. If someone went to the trouble of stealing it, they had a reason. Again, if you don't like the possible reasons I'm giving, think up your own -- or dismiss the importance. Since I believe Teigen to be a liar, she could have easily put out the fake story to destroy the card for whatever reason. And I believe she's also a monumental scatterbrain who indeed could have taken it out and left it somewhere ... like on the rim of a sink. Yes, I believe she's that stupid.
