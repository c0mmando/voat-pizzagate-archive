Be warned....for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. For me, I was a fan of her work when I was a kid, so this case is personal.</p>

<p>Got more ammo against the official narrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stansac.com/what-temperature-should-you-set-your-thermostat-in-summer-and-winter-with-statistics/">https://www.stansac.com/what-temperature-should-you-set-your-thermostat-in-summer-and-winter-with-statistics/</a> The average temperature settings of air conditioners is about 70-75 degrees. Room temperature. Remember that the theory assumes BOTH room temperature and natural causes (ie no gaping head wounds such as from a bullet).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/dirtiest-object-bedroom-mattress-bacteria-fungus-2015-10">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/dirtiest-object-bedroom-mattress-bacteria-fungus-2015-10</a> A mattress is a veritable cesspool of microbial life. One of the worst spots in the house. All that sweat combined with the heat of a body is the perfect climate for their growth. Meaning that a dead body on a bed would logically go through the process of decay quicker than normal. More holes in the murder suicide narrative.</p>

<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). </p>
<p>Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent.</p>
<p>Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. </p>
<p>Timeline: February-May 1987</p>
<p>Accomplice: Adria Later, Judith’s mother</p>
<p>-The Murder:</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood\'s tracks had a part in the motive.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. How this works is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at that time of death.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           The average temperature settings of air conditioners is about 70-75 degrees. Room temperature. Remember that the theory assumes BOTH room temperature and natural causes (ie no gaping head wounds such as from a bullet).

           A mattress is a veritable cesspool of microbial life. One of the worst spots in the house. All that sweat combined with the heat of a body is the perfect climate for their growth. Meaning that a dead body on a bed would logically go through the process of decay quicker than normal. More holes in the murder suicide narrative.

           This one is perfecting for terrorizing pedowood.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice).
          </p>
          <p>
           Witness: Clare Torao
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent.
          </p>
          <p>
           Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline: February-May 1987
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice: Adria Later, Judith’s mother
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder:
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood's tracks had a part in the motive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Jack Dorsey.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". How this works is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at that time of death.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            I decided to look up some info on Sid Sheinberg.  He is co-founder of The Children's Action Network.  Some Supporters of CAN are:
           </p>
           <p>
            Armani, Bulgari, Lucy Dahl (daughter of Roald Dahl)  David Geffen  Ralph Lauren  Stella McCartney  Ron &amp; Cheryl Howard Family Found. 
Saban Family Found. (Haim Saban)   Lorraine and Sid Sheinberg   Versace   Linda Thompson (gf of Elvis and formerly married to Bruce 
Jenner now Caitlyn)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is quite a list imo.  I think the name Geffen speaks for itself.  But we have the Saban Family Found.  Haim Saban has a huge connection to Hillary Clinton.

           <p>
            The billionaire and his wife, Cheryl, have given a stunning $6.4 million to Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, according to federal records confirmed with Saban’s political advisers. The donations come not only to her official campaign but also to her super PAC and state Democratic Party committees that can support the former secretary of state’s efforts.

            Haim Saban was the creator of the Power Rangers but this paragraph is Amazing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over a late dinner, Clinton regaled Saban, his wife, Cheryl, and 100 guests—including Disney CEO Bob Iger, DreamWorks Animation founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, and basketball legend Magic Johnson—with war stories from the campaign trail. “Well, the latest one they have on me is that I’m dying,” she said, referring to the elaborate conspiracy theories about her health ginned up by conservative media. “That’s a new one.” The price of admission to the Sabans’ fundraiser—their second for Clinton during the 2016 race—was $100,000 per couple. After a few hours of mingling, Clinton had raised more than $5 million—one of the most lucrative hauls of her campaign.

            DreamWorks Pictures (also known as DreamWorks SKG or DreamWorks Studios, commonly referred to as DreamWorks) is an American film production label of Amblin Partners. It was founded in 1994 as a film studio by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen (together, SKG), of which they owned 72%. The studio was formerly distributing its own and third-party films by itself. It has produced or distributed more than ten films with box-office grosses of more than $100 million each.

            Also good example of just what is acceptable in our so called culture. MSM gives stamp of approval....in our forefather's time..this was accepted , not by all but but enough....Thomas Jefferson , while in France, brought over a young black girl , Sally Hemmings, to be his  daughter's servant...She was also his daughter's aunt, but that was Not socially acceptable and common knowledge. Jefferson 39, Sally 14.....his wife made him promise never to remarry....life long relationship with many children  , documented by DNA.  Benedict Arnold , 39 fell in love with a 16 year old...she wasn't interested but unlike Sally Hemmings had a choice. So this behavior is not new but age old within western culture ...names for it is newer.It has to stop .......and all the trappings that enable it..we need a different justice system and MSM.

             Thanks for posting that info.  I have heard of Sally Hemmings but didn't realize her age.  More Creepiness.  We have to remember these people originated from our former mother country.  Some things remain the same.  That's a tall order a new justice system and MSM.  But I think it's not impossible.  They prob is that so many rely on soc media for their news and they will believe just about anything if they see it more than once.  That's the new litmus test.   So we have brought back bad habits that prob never went away.  The problem is that it seems to have run amok.  Things seem to be much worse.

              I think they should make it 16, with the restriction that when you're 16 or 17, you can only have sexual relations with persons aged 16-20, to allow relationships by people of the same age range. And people 21 years old or older could only have sexual relations to persons who are at least 18, in order to prevent pedos from exploiting younger persons.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think they have provisions like this in some countries, and they seem to work well.

            Thank you for your tireless pursuit of these Monstrous  Murderers. It seems every time I see that pic of Michael C I hate him even more.  Always have.  Slimy creepy pervert.  He covers his sick desires by claiming he is shocked over Woody Allen being accused by his daughter Dylan.  That picture tells us all we need to know. RIP Judith and RIP Heather.
