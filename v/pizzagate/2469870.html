<p><strong>Elisa and Scott\'s Father Richard A. Stephens Had Ties to a Naval Hospital Reported to Carry Out MK Ultra, and to the Carlton Club Which Was Named in the Westminster Paedophile Claims:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prior to the late Richard A. Stephens running AAU, he joined the U.S. Navy after WWII ended.  He was stationed at <strong>Oakland Naval Hospital where MK Ultra was reportedly carried out.</strong>  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, this well-researched <a href="http://archive.is/xTEyC#selection-197.0-205.139">Hemmings Motor News interview</a> with RAS one year before he died states he earned a dentistry degree at Stanford University after the Navy.  Dentists are used in MK Ultra.  Instead of working as a dentist, he took over AAU from his father, Richard S. Stephens.  It is strange that Stephens being a dentist is not mentioned anywhere else that I can find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around the time RAS was stationed at Oakland Naval Hospital also known as Oak Knoll, and studying at Stanford University, both were reportedly infested with <strong>MK Ultra operations,</strong> for example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/9teqG">Oak Knoll patient “Manchurian Candidate Experiment” Ewell Lee Danielly</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/9teqG#selection-261.0-261.155">The CIA’s Dr. James Alexander Hamilton of Stanford was active in MK Ultra in SF and other places in the 1940’s (and onward.)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/gJA7u#selection-699.0-699.386">L. Ron Hubbard claimed he developed Scientology cult mind control methods at Oak Knoll Naval Hospital around this time.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Richard A. Stephens was a member of the ultra-exclusive <a href="http://archive.is/vz3pm"><strong>Carlton Club</strong></a> <strong>in London,</strong> third to last paragraph <a href="http://archive.is/v1Xm3">here.</a>  What was he doing in London?  The <a href="http://archive.is/vyhWg">Carlton Club was named as a location where attacks on children occurred in the Westminster Paedophile Ring claims.</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>AAU Car Museum, Showrooms Across San Francisco, “Elite” Car Shows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As museums are considered part of the cabal’s child trafficking operations, I’ll mention Scott Stephens <a href="http://archive.is/7rrlu#selection-655.0-655.154">works at the AAU car museum.</a>  He is possibly involved with the car shows around the country, but I only found his name mentioned for the upcoming <a href="http://archive.is/2V9oa#selection-473.34-473.48">SF International Auto Show</a> in November 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vehicles are also kept in <a href="http://archive.is/hdBJ2#selection-255.141-255.392">“multiple showrooms sprinkled throughout San Francisco,”</a> but I don’t know where these are.  Hopefully all innocent.</p>

<p><strong>City Attorney Sues AAU for Code Violations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the news video below, beginning at 0:40, the city attorney says AAU gets away with murder (at 1:05).  <strong>Just an expression, or does he know something?</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/899/26168300237_62e66de0be_h.jpg">this screen capture,</a> AAU vans are parked in front of a gated refurbished motel.   Are they dorms, classrooms?  It’s probably innocent, but it still looks sketchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The City Attorney eventually won a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180327003812/https://www.sfcityattorney.org/2016/12/19/herrera-secures-landmark-settlement-valued-60-million-academy-art-university/">$60 million settlement against AAU in 2016</a> </p>

Instead of working as a dentist, he took over AAU from his father, Richard S. Stephens.  It is strange that Stephens being a dentist is not mentioned anywhere else that I can find.
