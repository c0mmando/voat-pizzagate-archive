           </p>
           <p>
            My psychologist at the time found a way to bring this up during every session, trying to get me to acknowledge the wrongness of the situation since my PTSD had begun to accelerate. She dubbed my behavior "extremely self-destructive" and explained that I was putting myself in precarious situations to assert some sense of control.
Sometimes, when you feel like your life is falling apart, quickening the inevitable descent into pariahdom seems like the only thing left to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking back, it's easy for me to recognize how this must have been what provoked my boyfriend to feel like he had to be there for me all the time, why he chose to carry my weight. He had known about my rapes since before we started dating and about the possibility of my getting worse shortly thereafter. But I had started seeing a therapist at school and he was determined to help me through this dark period of my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            We thought we could handle anything my past could throw at us, that we were writing a love story whose end had already been determined: I was going to get well. I would stop trying to commit suicide, start playing the piano again, and finally tell my parents about what had happened to me as a child. I would pursue a job in human rights, transfer to Columbia—things would matter to me again. Defiance! Redemption! Transformation!
           </p>
           <p>
            He had seen my scars and still told me I looked beautiful, what was more proof than that?
But nothing can prepare you for remembering that kind of abuse. How fundamentally less human you feel when you have to rely on someone else to bring you back to reality, as you wake feeling ashamed and emasculated.
           </p>
           <p>
            We still went to the movies, played the board games that everybody else thought were boring, but when my nightmares started following me into the day, I stopped going to class. In between consoling me, negotiating with my teachers to bring home my assignments, and coordinating with my friends to make sure I was never left alone, he went with me to my therapy appointments, where he'd sit in the waiting room as I cried in the next room over.

             What a crock of shit blowing out this guys mouth.  Is he really taking "intellectual responsibility" for his age 0+ victims?!  The problem with the UN/Obamanation true believers of the world is personified in the fast track branding of Joel Davis as a rising super star of Global Leadership and advocate for victims of sexual violence/exploitation.
            </p>
            <p>
             You want sustainability?  Shut that shit down and save few hundred million trees a year for freaking UN sponsored crap studies.

               That's not how they roll.  Hired precisely because of his background and inclinations.  I really wonder about his family because he has had a very expensive education and quite presitgious placements and internships.  Groomed for leadership in organisations that purport to look after children?

            <p>
             We (Youth) are educated and assertive, but in areas of conflict, we are not protected. We need sustained commitment from governments to create meaningful spaces where the voices of youth survivors can be heard. We need unfettered access to comprehensive sexuality education, and we need to be included and treated as partners in the fight to end sexual violence in conflict. Youth have capacity and tools to change mindsets — more so than any generation before us. When governments stand in solidarity with young people, they support the creation of a stronger community to build sustainable peace. It’s time for all of our voices to be included at the discussion table, and it’s time for the recommendations of my fellow youth leaders, survivors, and activists to be taken seriously. -Joel Davis, PEDOPHILE, and Youth Ambassador for the United States on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Co-founding Executive Director of Youth to End Sexual Violence

               After the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, almost every national government established a minimum age of marriage, yet today, 1 in 9 girls are still married by the age of 15, with some becoming brides as early as 8 or 9 years old, said Anne Richard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for population, refugees, and migration.

               Young people themselves can offer critical insights on how to reach overlooked groups and meet the needs of their generation, but have so far been excluded from policy dialogues, said

                Joel Davis, the 19-year-old executive director of Youth to End Sexual Violence and a coordinator of the He For She campaign.

              <p>
               Davis, whose organization campaigns to eradicate sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict settings, said his age is often used by adults as a way of disqualifying him from participating.

               Policymakers’ failure to protect young people’s rights coupled with this tendency to dismiss their opinions creates some troubling double standards, said Gilmore:
              </p>
              <p>
               They’re old enough to be pregnant, but not old enough to be trusted with access to comprehensive sexuality education or to contraceptives. They’re old enough to catch a sexually transmitted infection, but not old enough to exercise the autonomy required to seek and receive treatment for it. They’re old enough to be raped; they’re not old enough to be believed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Adams said she hopes the data provided in the UNFPA report will feed into theSustainable Development Goals – the international development agenda currently being drafted – and enable and encourage development organizations to reorient their work more towards youth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Davis emphasized multi-sectoral approaches that keep young people from falling through programmatic gaps. Richard and Adams stressed the need to actively reach out to youth through social media and technology. And Bah and Gilmore highlighted the importance of deliberately investing in and collecting data on vulnerable groups, particularly young girls.
              </p>
              <p>
               “Young people hold within themselves the power to succeed and transform many of the issues and contexts of exclusion that plague our international community…if we provide [them] the tools to access education instead of picking up weapons,” said
