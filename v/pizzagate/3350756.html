<p>Jewish Role in the African Slave Trade

<p>COMMENT BY
&quot;Yoruba Israelite
December 23, 2010 at 11:51 pm</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, thank you for the kind words. And thank you for your testimony. It is heart-warming to hear the testimony of the few among us who kept faith and held fast to the Covenant even down through slavery. That is heart-warming indeed.</p>
<p>“When she died, she and her husband an Israelite, were both buried near Wrightson Road, in the Jewish section of Lapeyrouse cemetery (my mother told us this).”</p>
<p>This raises though the question about the distinction between Jew and Israelite. For we are Israelites, not Jews. Those who call themselves Jews are impostors, and not of the seed of Israel. Some are of the seed of Isaac, through Israel’s brother Edom. The Hebrew Edomites are our brothers, but also an enemy with whom we have been warring since the womb (Genesis 25:23). Others, the Ashkenazi Jews, are not even of the seed of Shem, let alone Abraham, but descend rather from Japheth through Togarmah (though named after Ashkenaz because of the place to which they had migrated.) At any rate, the term “Jew” originally denoted citizens of a place — the Roman province of Judaea — not seedline. The place, though named after Yahudah (Judah), came to be overrun by those of the seedline of Edom/Esau, after those of the seedline of Judah were scattered out of the land (Obadiah 1:11-13). This is why history records that Herod Antipater, king of Judaea under the Romans, was of the seed of Edom — he was Idumean — not of Judah. He was a Jew, but not an Israelite.</p>
<p>The matter goes even deeper, because as Hebrew Edomites, the Jews were up to their necks in the slave trade, and also were familiar with the prophecy whereby the “Yahoodees” were a people destined to be enslaved, because they had forsaken their God. The Hebrew Edomite Jews were behind the Dutch West India Company and British West India Company, and as such played a significant role in the slave trade of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Surinam, Brazil, and etc. Hence, some of us will carry Edomite seed, but nevertheless are grafted into the house of Israel. Also, it was black Hebrew Edomites (e.g. the Idoma tribe of Nigeria, who are given away by their name to be Edomite) who sold black Hebrew Israelites into slavery, to white Hebrew Edomites such as Aaron Lopez.&quot;

            , what does this have to do with elite child abuse as described in our definition of pizzagate in the sidebar? That is the second post you've made in 24 hours that has ignored our submission rules. You are abusing the 24 Hour Grace flair. I am removing this per Rule 1. Please repost this and any future indirectly relevant submissions to

            </a>
            . This is the last warning, as we have had this conversation more than one in the past.
