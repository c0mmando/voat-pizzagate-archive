            Ah yes, Ivanka...who has her merchandise made in the least reputable sweat shops in china that employ child labor under the table/but are one of the cheapest sweats to use.  However, not satisfied with that low ball will be moving much of her production to Viet Nam where the really low low price can't be beat.  Yeah, please tell me how much she really gives a flying about slavery and children.  Why do ppl get all excited when a celebrity mentions some cause when they participate in it themselves?  So she said something at the UN...of course, right now it is the hot topic.  This is just political theater designed to keep the sheep focused in one direction while the govt is into some really deep and horrific dealings.  trump was selected/not elected.

             it's illegal to employ people under the age of 16 in china. It's stricter than Canada, were i started working at 13. Would you consider that inhumane or bad?
            </p>
            <p>
             ''real'' child labor used to happen in China, but not anymore. Not more than in the west and the work conditions are usually much less strict than home. having worked in factories in both countries, Chinese workers are much more relaxed in their work ethic than we are because bosses home are much more concerned of losses by shitty employees while in china they are cheap as hell so their individual performance rarely matters. I've worked in a bunch of places with colleagues doing literally nothing for YEARS, just sitting at the desk pretending to work. No one gives a fuck. You would be more in trouble by talking about that person doing nothing than that person would be... Anyway, work in china aint that bad really. I mean, they're getting in average, raises of around 10% a year. who would complain lol.

              Child labor happens all the time in china.  Doesn't matter what the law is/it happens/is documented.  The children are 'off the books'.  Ivanka uses sweat shops that do such.  This is not speculation.  Research it yourself if you are so inclined/I'm not going to point you to all the documentation, easy to find with simple search.  As far as how relaxed it is in China...yeah, my dream is to work in a factory averaging 60 hours a week or more, living in a small room crammed beyond capacity.
             </p>
             <p>
              While it is true there are some reputable chinese companies there are plenty that break the laws (just like here).  Those are the sweat shops ivanka uses.  The trump family that is supposed to care so much for US workers has their merchandise made in china including Melania's cheaply made qvc jewelry (think qvc stopped carrying it), trump with all his products and of course daughter dearest.  All this bs about elevating women and helping them become successful complete and total lies.  But hey, it sounds good and for the masses that don't do their own research.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't whitewash reality bc you want to believe they actually give a shit.  They don't.  I wanted to believe too...but I took the red pill.

               The only ''documentation'' ive seen were manufactured by the very people that we're hunting in this sub, like Clinton Foundation, Soros, Human Rights NGOs  and friends.
              </p>
              <p>
               China has it's dark corners, but they arent about children slave labour. They have the most people on the planet, they don't have a shortage of manpower and they already pay them peanuts because since they subsidize housing and food heavily, people can live on almost nothing without revolting. The whole child labour thing is long past for them. They do ''higher end'' stuff now. This isn't the 1920s anymore (or bangladesh). China changed like we did on this. Employing children would cost more to these companies than hiring educated workforce and if the company gets caught, the owners go to jail or get shot. So why in the fuck would they save 10cents a day on handbags they make 200$ profit per bag and take the risk of getting a bullet. It makes no sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               Problems in china:
1. Hard drugs epidemic
2. Human traffic with Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam region
3. Pollution
4. Lack of enforcement of rules
5. Human rights stuff (debatable)
....
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to blame a country for child labour blame Cambodia or Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, they still do it today. Not China.

                I understand you are supportive of trump and family.  I'm not interested in having a discussion or debate about them.  It serves no purpose.  We each make our decisions based on what we believe are facts (or want to believe).  Dare I say most that are in the public eye say one thing and do another/I'm not singling her out.  Nothing would please me more in this respect than to find out the family is genuine/so far evidence I have seen does not support that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Peace~
               </p>
               <p>
                edit...to clarify/I don't think trump and fam are as bad as clinton and fam/but not by much.  Don't see trumps engaged in sra or global human trafficking but I do see them buddy bubby with those that do such things, and not just referring to the clintons, buddies with Soros, Rothchilds and their circle.  In this case lesser of 2 evils might apply.  To me, evil is evil...degrees of such only semantics.  It is all political theater and the 'agenda' is progressing as intended.  If ppl don't wake up to this it's game over.  It's time to stop picking sides and see what is going on if there is to be any hope whatsoever.  In fact 'picking sides' is part of the agenda bc it keeps ppl divided/divided we fall.  Ppl have fallen into the trap.

                  Um, I find your 'concern' interesting.  And Bernie???  Seriously???  He's as much a pawn as trump is.  It is all political theater.

                  Then again your opinion on trump...

                   I still do think Trump being president is a very significant event because he's not part of that group of people despite being very rich. He scares them because they have nothing on him. No strings for the puppeteers. I don't even like the guy but just saying NO to the TPP is something absolutely massive.

            Well, she is a fashion designer. So it's her career to design fashion. I don't think she has any experience in politics or in battling human trafficking, but she is a celebrity, so I guess having a celebrity bring light on something is pretty popular.

               Stop looking in the mirror and describing yourself!  I knew I was throwing away good advice on you. You know the old 'pearls before swine' saying.  But I guess I was too optimistic, I should have known that anyone with a mouth as foul as yours has not had a good enough education to provide a broad vocabulary so has to resort to the gutter. Sad. Have a good day  with your friends, JA JP CHR etc....  :P

                Nah, I'm a good American, just not a paranoid, low-education crackpot that sees paedo in everything. See, I'm normal and highly educated and traveled. 
Foul-mouthed people are scientifically proven to be the smart ones. It's part of my vocabulary that appears when I see garbage like this "pizzagate" bullshit. 
I suspect you're likely a flat-earther as well. Enjoy your Crazy World of Baby-Eating Reptilians, buddy.

                 There you go, you managed a nice sentence without having to swear.  One question, is the Foul-mouthed 'proven to be smart' the opinion of 'smart' people like you? haha - You suspect wrong, I have never even entertained the crazy flat-earth theory nor do I believe in reptilian humanoids. I have travelled plenty too and during the time I lived in S.Africa I was part of a team who counseled a few poor people who escaped the world of 'pizzagate' so don't try and tell me that pizzagate is not real!

            I can only imagine their consternation when they know what they know.  When the gates to the White House opened for them, they saw great things happening, but, many, many, many horrible things shown to them, too. Each time Hollyweird, et al. go after the First Family, you know it is because they know the jig is up.  And, oh my gosh, how much of a deal with the devil has Jane Fonda had to enter into, to look like a 20 year old (well, at least, far away and made up)?

              a downvoat means we have struck a nerve.  If any of these "people" who hate the Trumps had anything on any of them, it would have come out since he decided to run in 2015.  And, that ladies and gentlemen, is why they come on here with their hate.  It has to be exercised somewhere.  Can't post on MSN, because they took down their comments section and it hasn't come back up-MSN couldn't handle the truth, either.  Had to shut down all comments, because they knew people were getting redpilled by the our side "schooling" them.

            If you read the article, she is there to speak about slavery and human trafficking. This was linked on Drudge, btw ~ but only as a fashion item. "“This is a Call to Action– a call for global unity to address the greatest human rights issues of our time,” she added. “Human trafficking and forced labor are forms of modern slavery that know no boundaries, spilling across international borders, and impacting men, women, children, of all ages and all nationalities.”

             That is fine.  We need eyes on all areas of the human trafficking. Even though this is only one aspect of it, it is important to cover.
