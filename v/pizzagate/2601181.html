<p><strong>Palm Beach Daily News: 05/31/18</strong></p>
<p><em>Joseph Recarey, a former Palm Beach detective who had a knack for making others smile, who tackled the island’s largest and most important investigations, and who cared deeply for his family and friends, died Friday, May 25, 2018, after a brief illness. He was 50.</em></p>
<p><em>Recarey was one of the most decorated police officers in the history of the department with more than 150 commendations, 11 officer-of-the-month awards and a 2013 Palm Beach Police Foundation Officer of the Year award, Reiter said. He worked in several units, including the Organized Crime Vice and Narcotics Unit and the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Public Integrity Unit. He was a lead detective in many major investigations, including the high-profile solicitation-of-minors case against billionaire</em> <strong><em>Jeffrey Epstein</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Before department meetings began, Recarey entertained officers with spot-on impressions of the chief, impressions that sometimes lasted too long. At least one time, Recarey turned around to find the chief standing behind him. “It was a riot,” Szarszewski said. “He made work extremely fun to be at.”</em></p>
<p><em>“As hard of a worker as he was, he was a family man,” Szarszewski said. “His wife and his kids were the world to him.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>No other information about the cause of death was released.</em></strong></p>

            If someone had not lost his life, I would be ROMFL.  How many lawyers is that now?  I know there was one found on the Beach.  Then we had the Process Server Shawn Lucas, the list constantly grows.  How convenient.  The detective working on the Epstein Case.  NTSHF.  You know what that means.  Nothing To See,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Joseph Recarey's cause of death is still a mystery to the public.

             "A suspicion not shared by his family"
What is your proof of this statement? If they did believe it, they might stay quiet. He has children.
THEIR SILENCE PROVES NOTHING.

            <p>
             Before his law firm imploded in October 2009 and he was sentenced to 50 years in prison, he said he was able to dial up McCain. Such access came from hosting fund-raisers at his palatial Fort Lauderdale home for the Arizona Republican’s 2008 presidential bid. He became one of McCain’s biggest contributors nationwide — largely, he testified, because he broke campaign finance laws by bankrolling contributions that were sent by others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, he said, he talked to Crist about who the governor should appoint to vacancies on the
             <strong>
              Broward County bench
             </strong>
             . He urged Crist to appoint those he believed would make favorable rulings for his law firm once they donned their judicial robes.

            And another death:
"The only witness named in the documents is Alfredo Rodriguez, who was a houseman at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion in 2004. That’s when Epstein regularly paid young women to give him sexually-charged massages, police said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rodriguez was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 and sentenced to 18 months in jail for trying to sell a journal he purloined from Epstein. Prosecutors said the journal detailed Epstein’s sexual dalliances. Rodriguez, who lived in Kendall, died in 2014.""
           </p>
           <p>
            "...the FBI last week released what appears to be an explosive explanation for what many have long described as a sweetheart deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Epstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon,” agents wrote in one of dozens of heavily redacted, decade-old memos that were unexpectedly and inexplicably posted on an FBI website known as “The Vault.”"

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to an account by Detective Joseph Recarey, prosecutor Lana Belohlavek related to him the terms of the Epstein deal during an April 17 meeting in her West Palm Beach office. Recarey reported that Belohlavek, chief of the prosecutor's crimes against children unit, told him that Epstein had accepted the plea deal via criminal attorney Guy Fronstin (who has since been replaced). Belohlavek, according to Recarey, played for him a voicemail message from Fronstin in which the lawyer 'agreed to the deal' and requested that investigators 'call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal.'
            </p>
            <p>
             It is unclear why the plea bargain was not formally struck at that point, but the report indicates that police investigators--who anticipated five felony counts being lodged against Epstein--were incensed at what they clearly viewed as a sweetheart prosecution offer.

             I have seen articles and comments about Acosta giving Epstein a deal, but when I looked into some other articles, and read about what Acosta went through, it totally changed my opinion.  It certainly seemed as if Epstein's dream team of attorneys put Acosta through quite an ordeal.  I dont remember everything, but I vaguely remember there, at one point, being over 150 appearances/changes, and things seemed to drag on and on.  I got the feeling he was extremely frustrated and upset that he had to deal with all the crap.  He possibly "gave up" at some point, because dealing with all the changes every few days became overwhelming.  Appearance after appearance after appearance, change after change, dispute after dispute.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldnt fully trust those articles saying he was simply "cutting a cozy deal".  There appeared to be way more to it.

              Good comment. I read a bit about this case when it broke. The hidden hand of Epstein was just too powerful for the locals.
Let's not forget that Trump spends lots of time in Palm Beach. Perhaps he saw that Acosta could be trusted to do the right thing given enough support.

               Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black. Acosta said Epstein's defense mounted "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors."
              </p>
              <p>
               "I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved."
