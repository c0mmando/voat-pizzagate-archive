            James "Achiles" is literately the Achilles heel here. The only options is to confess and take it like a man. He can choose to name names or not. It wont take much to catch the other conspirators. There is no way out of this for him. He is at risk for ever, he is a a marked man. His image and reputation is ruined, he is exposed to the world. Also an innocent man would not behave the way he did. Whatever his future is, his life is different now. There is no point for him to pretend things are fine.

            I just re-read through the Podesta emails. Why would James give two shits about the Podesta emails? There's nothing in them to suggest he's into anything but running 2 restaurants, being friends with the Podestas (not a crime), and being a Hillary supporter (also not a crime).  Go ahead, check.  I just did a search on Comet and another on his email address.  There's definitely not anything from James that admits guilt of anything at all and I couldn't even find anything suspicious that mentions him.  The most "scandalous" thing I saw was one of John's emails explains to someone that James is Brock's boyfriend and in another email James ended it with XOXO. If there's something specific in the Podesta emails that pins him to anything please let me know but I didn't see anything damning as it specifically related to James or Comet.
