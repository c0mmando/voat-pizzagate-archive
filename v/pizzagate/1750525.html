            Can't  agree. Shills always need to be exposed. Always expose the truth and let the chips fall where they may.

            I watched the bum-licking that Scott Pelley gave to Alefantis on 60 Minutes.  Sounds like Pelley's unethically vested in the cover up.  What is Scott Pelley's connection, I wonder?

            In terms of who the perps are that Alex named in his big reveal yesterday were:  "the UK and so on", Saville, Epstein, Weiner, I can't remember who else - but all of them have been extensively covered here, alongside our look into James, the Pegasus, and any rabbit holes that came up. We never focused excessively on Comet pizza, so i'm really not sure Alex was talking about us, he was referring in his comments to some fictional MSM-derived group of people who supposedly descended upon Comet pizza and harassed an assuredly innocent guy :(  This scenario describes no one I know, and nothing i've seen. So I have no reasonto take any of his stuff seriously, as i never have in the past. He straight up told you all to follow the very same people you've already been following, except to leave DC out of it. I'm not sure why anyone would follow that advice. It's just silly.

            The Perfect Psyop. Attack morale. That's how I would have done it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have AJ forcefully admit defeat publicly to millions, then send an army of shills on as many sites discussing pizzagate as possible to continously crush morale with as many demonizing character assasination tactics as possible ''Fuck AJ! '' ''Loser!'' ''Traitor!'' '' Never listening to him again!'' ''Unsubscribed!'' Etc..etc.. you get the point.
           </p>
           <p>
            All that can do is make people feel down and defeated, and when you're tired you don't want to fight anymore. All the best psychologists know that it starts with your mind. It's come to the point that they are making it seem like Voat is full of people for the cause, but it's filled with MK-Ultra, Time Travel, allusions to 911 and much more bullshit tactics that do nothing but make you waste time on arguing non-issues. One can't tell anymore and they have done a good con job confusing some folk.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you know what?
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many lurkers on here that just read. They don't comment, and they don't get involved in these divide and conquer shenanigans. They quietly do their job red-pilling people intelligently and that is why the movement refuses to die, that is why it will only get stronger, and that is why it will ultimately defeat the deceivers and evil doers behind pedogate.

            Yup, it doesn't make sense to spend time trying to figure out who is disinfo and who isn't.   Some are obvious, but the good ones are not.  The purpose of this subverse is to do research, not to argue about Alex Jones.   The mods might be the enemy, or not.  I don't really care since there is nothing that can be done about it if they are.   Voat itself might be run by the enemy, but still it is interesting to see appears here.

            Even if someone is disinfo - they are still talking about sex trafficking of our young at least!
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the big problem for shills, they have to put out the fire with small doses of gasoline.  : )
           </p>
           <p>
            My focus is as you put it - just listen to what is said and examine it with what evidence you have seen.   If AJ says his bit for his reasons, fine.  That is not going to make me forget miles of evidence pointing to CPP and all the really strange weirdness around the CPP website and computer harddrive.   If Seaman is playing 4D chess as a shill, well that is a funny strategy to speak to thousands constantly about how real pizzagate is, as you try to suppress it.   If that is shill strategy, we've already won.

            I wish I had had my character attacked because I can defend myself from that, the problem is that here, your posts get deleted in a heartbeat if they mention certain subjects... Don't want to be pessimistic, but I get the feeling that his place is just a honeypot, to keep people typing away, busy thinking they are actually getting somewhere while they are actually flushing the pizzagate case down the toilet... I love your nickname by the way :D

             Yeah  OP is right lets not expose shills for intentional disinfo as that just helps further our ability to investigate matters and receive info from credible sources. Open the flood gates.

             The correct response is to ignore them, not to divert your time and energy into attacking people.  Spend it investigating stuff, instead of getting jealous people make money off of youtube.
