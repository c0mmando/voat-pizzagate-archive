<p>A December, 2013, <a href="http://protectthepope.com/?p=9467"> article</a> by Deacon Nick Donnelly on protectthepoe.com describes Leaniz as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a spy of Cardinal Bergoglio in Rome” within the ranks of the Congregation of Bishops and also as one of the ‘pawns of Bergoglio’.
CNA writes about Msgr. Fabiàn Pedacchio Leaniz’s role as the ‘eyes and ears of Cardinal Bergoglio’:</p>
<p>In 2007, the Congregation of Bishops asked Cardinal Bergoglio if he could suggest an Argentinian priest for a post within its ranks. The cardinal chose Msgr. Pedacchio Leaniz, whom the archbishop of Buenos Aires held in great esteem.</p>
<p>Their friendship even led to some speculation about the true role the priest had in the Congregation for the Bishops. In a Dec. 26, 2011 report, an anonymous informant wrote in the Argentinian portal Intereconomia accusing him of being “a spy of Cardinal Bergoglio in Rome” within the ranks of the Congregation of Bishops.</p>
<p>The report insinuated that Msgr. Pedacchio used to inform Cardinal Bergoglio “of any document or letter that reached the Congregation, sealed documents included.” The report also asserted that “when the issue at stake is very important, Msgr. Pedacchio also sends faxes to Bergoglio with all the documentation required” by “his boss.”</p>
<p>Msgr. Pedacchio Leaniz is considered by many to be skilled and attentive. “He used to keep eyes and ears open,” said a Vatican clerk who worked in the Congregation for Bishops and spoke to CNA on the condition of anonymity.’</p>
<p>Now, Msgr. Pedacchio Leaniz is Pope Francis’ full-time second secretary, a position through which he aids the Holy Father in his daily life whether it be as a translator or in answering personal correspondence in the name of the Pope. The first secretary is Msgr. Alfred Xuereb, of Maltese origins, who also served as second secretary to Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>As second secretary, Msgr. Pedacchio will eventually be inserted into the ranks of the Secretari
at of State.’</p>

            Stuff keeps coming out every day.  Slowly chipping away at the reign of bergoglio.  How long will it take?  He is keeping quiet on the Penn. Grand Jury 301 results and has totally ignored mentioning the St. Joseph Orphanage debacle in Burlington Vermont.  He has shamed his position as pope and as far as the Victims and Survivors he has let them know that he has no respect or sympathy for the abuse and rapes that his church men have committed against them when they were children.  These Victims have suffered all their lives and this pope does not care one bit.  Is this secretary providing child porn for bergolgio?  Would not be a bit surprised.  I wonder who is taking Gustavo's place?

              I totally understand.  Thanks for informing me. But we must remember the part of the statement that says:
             </p>
             <p>
              Sonnante's story caught on the public because Pope Francis has a history of promoting gay or pro-gay prelates.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have to remember that many will try to hijack anything that will make news.  The sad thing is, that when fake stories and documents are presented, it sometimes is done for a purpose.  People start wondering if the ones that are truthful, well maybe, they are fake too.  A masterful plan.  All this stuff is making me sick.

             Never mind morality. As head of an ancient multi national corporation, it would be unwise for the pope to accept any liability.

              I don’t care about liability. If his priests kept their hands off of Our Children he would have plenty of money. They have to keep paying because of their sick and disgusting rape and abuse.

                Keep speaking out.  Met a guy today and he was wise about all the stuff we talk about.  He is a Muslim and says a lot of the people he knows will be home schooling their children.  They can't trust the schools.  Too many strange things they are allowing there he says.  He knows about the False Flag School Shootings and the Organ Harvesting.  I was in complete shock.  My husband just sat there.  He believes some but not everything I tell him, especially the schools. He does not believe the School Shootings are set up.  Well now he does.  This guy also knew about Chem Trails.  I am still in mortal shock.  So keep talking and telling.  That's what will turn this around.
