            Nothing will happen unless the people understand how big this is and how it affects them personally, and how it affects every state, community and industry. These are not isolated incidents of corruption. This is a global network that links to arms of the mafia, secret societies, and the most powerful people in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth Rich is a small part of the puzzle, but an important one. He is one of many who have had their lives destroyed by uncovering corruption, yet the business as usual corruption continues. Why? Because our agencies work for the criminal elite involved in the network. They are all expendable and replaceable, and the people at the top control the political parties which controls most appointments. If they cannot compromise someone, they run them over using any leverage or force necessary. They kill the killers and build in plausible deniability, jurisdictional limitations, perjury, and other means to avoid prosecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin and Seth Rich are both TABOO. Both must be addressed, or there will be no real effective change. The rank and file of the FBI, DOJ, DHS, CIA and other agencies along with military and police need to take a stand if they care about America and the future of our world. These groups are the ones enforcing the system of corruption and protecting the criminally corrupt elite. Once people know they will be protected and not have their lives destroyed or ended, they will come forward. This goes beyond government corruption as public-private partnerships are the key to exposing the bigger picture of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Google, Twitter and Facebook are just a few of the private entities involved. The companies all need to be held accountable along with the people involved, including all who are guilty of misprision of felonies and misprision of treason.
           </p>
           <p>
            As it stands now, anyone who exposes corruption is either murdered, imprisoned or exiled. This is tyranny.

            I sure hope so. At first I thought the Seth Rich story was a distraction from pizzagate but when I saw the actions MSM was taking to censor and punish anybody suggesting the need for further investigation, the more important the Seth Rich murder became. The left wing Clinton Machine is becoming increasingly frightening. I've been a news/political junkie for almost half a century and I've never seen anything like this. It's not just our country at stake, it's the very principles of democracy in danger. I hope our military understands this in case things turn very ugly.
