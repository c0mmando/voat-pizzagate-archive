<p>At 3:04 there is a tv static pattern that may be like those old random dot stereograms. If anyone was good at those maybe relax your focusing and convergence of your eyes to see if anything appears in those patterns. Starting at 3:05 between the top two thin horizontal lines there is some lettering wth a 3 D appearance, looks almost like a watermark on paper. I can\'t quite make them out though. As the frames go by, this shows up in different areas of the screen.</p>
<p>Something else interesting about this video is that if you go frame by frame using the , and . keys, it goes in 1 second steps. Usually it\'s much shorter steps,like 1/4 second steps. The interesting thing is that going step by step each time you view the video you\'ll notice different images in some areas of the video. Probably sometimes you\'re hitting the 1 second frame steps while other times the 1/2 second frame steps. Does anyone know if this is something the uploader of the video can set up. it\'s the first time I\'ve noticed this.</p>',

            Oh a guy with curlyish hair it must be him. We need to stop it with these things, it makes us all look crazy. There's plenty of actual evidence and links to be made without "hey is that alefantis" "hey i think i found chickenlover" etc.
