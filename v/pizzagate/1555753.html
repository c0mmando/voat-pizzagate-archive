<p>At 3:04 there is a tv static pattern that may be like those old random dot stereograms. If anyone was good at those maybe relax your focusing and convergence of your eyes to see if anything appears in those patterns.

<p>Something else interesting about this video is that if you go frame by frame using the , and . keys, it goes in 1 second steps. Usually it\'s much shorter steps,like 1/4 second steps.

Probably sometimes you\'re hitting the 1 second frame steps while other times the 1/2 second frame steps.

            Oh a guy with curlyish hair it must be him. We need to stop it with these things, it makes us all look crazy. There's plenty of actual evidence and links to be made without "hey is that alefantis" "hey i think i found chickenlover" etc.
