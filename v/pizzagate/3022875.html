<h2>In an interview with DailyMailTV, McManus claims Jackson brought young boys into his bedroom and said she saw troubling things while cleaning up after him</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Michael Jackson\'s former housekeeper Adrian McManus came forward in an interview with Daily Mail TV, and confirms that he was a predatory pedophile who sexually abused \'dozens\' of children, filmed his sick encounters and kept the footage in a secret library hidden at his Neverland ranch.</strong></p>
<p>She said witnessed first hand his disturbing interactions with young children and saw the King of Pop\'s stash of \'sex tapes.\'</p>
<p>She allegedly witnessed Jackson\'s criminal behaviour during the four years she worked at the Neverland ranch and is in no doubt her former employer was a \'pedophile\'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She claims the star - who has been accused of serious sexual abuse in a shocking new documentary - brought a long line of young boys into his bedroom and that she saw many troubling things while cleaning up after him.</p>
<p>McManus, 56, claims she often fished Jackson\'s and children\'s underwear from Jacuzzi and baths at the home, and witnessed kids walking around barely clothed. She was one of just a few staff to have access to the star\'s bedroom, bathroom and secret chambers.</p>
<p>She says she found Vaseline and tampons next to Jackson\'s bed and scattered around the house and recalls the singer having a strange obsession with photos of children.</p>
<p>\'There was a lot of Vaseline around Neverland, a lot in Michael’s bedroom,\' she recalls.</p>
<p>\'I didn’t question it, because he was my boss and you just do what you’re supposed to do, but I would wonder.</p>
<p>\'And they had it all over in the main house, there was a rose room, it was up there. They had it in train room, which was kind of like an attic; they had that up there. It was in every room, the soldier room.</p>
<p>\'It was in drawers. Sometimes it was on counters. Sometimes they would find it on the golf carts that Michael would take out to drive around.\'</p>
<p>McManus would often have to clean up after Jackson had boys over for long weekends.</p>
<p>\'I found underwear that were in the back of Michael’s main room and one of the closets and it was in the back of the filing cabinets,\' she recalls. [She describes what the used underwear looked like].</p>
<p>\'When I would go in to pick up Mr Jackson’s bedroom, many times when there were his special guests there, little boys, they were taking baths with him in his Jacuzzi. He had a Jacuzzi in the bedroom and I used to have to let the water out of the Jacuzzi, so I had to put hangers together in order to get to the middle of the Jacuzzi to let the water out.</p>
<p>\'But Michael would have his underwear floating in the water and the little boys’ underwear floating in the water together. If they weren’t floating in the water, they were outside on the floor around the Jacuzzi. So I would find stuff like that.\'</p>
<p>She added: \'With all the little boys he would hold their hands and kiss them. And they would fight for Michael\'s love. It was a strange environment to watch.\'</p>
<p>McManus also points to the fact Jackson was obsessed with capturing everything on camera at Neverland and had a walk-in closet filled with expensive camera equipment and battery chargers. A bank of TV screens are pictured in a room in the train station at Jackson\'s ranch</p>
<p>The maid claims she also saw books on masturbation in the bedroom and one time Jackson asked her to laminate photos of naked babies and have them put in his room for decoration.</p>
<p>But most disturbing was a large collection of VHS cassettes McManus believes contained \'intimate\' footage the star filmed with children in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The maid believes the singer - who died a decade ago from drug abuse - hid the \'damaging\' material from police by storing it in a movie projection theater away from the main house on the sprawling Neverland ranch.</p>
<p>Asked about the videos, she said: \'I think they were of Michael with boys doing inappropriate things that had to be hidden, or they would have put him in jail. I think they were sex tapes.\'</p>
<p>“ After watching Michael with the boys and dealing with the way he was and what I saw and then hearing what I heard, I believe it to be true.”</p>
<p>While McManus admits she never actually saw the contents of the tapes, she says Jackson\'s behavior and the shroud of secrecy placed on the tapes has left her convinced of their more sinister nature.</p>
<p>\'After watching Michael with the boys and dealing with the way he was and what I saw and then hearing what I heard, I believe it to be true,\' she says.</p>
<p>McManus also points to the fact Jackson was obsessed with capturing everything on camera at Neverland and had a walk-in closet filled with expensive camera equipment and battery chargers.</p>
<p>\'He had a lot of batteries charging, the chargers always charging and cameras, a closet full of cameras and battery chargers, so they were always ready for him to use,\' she recalls.</p>
<p>\'And when that one died, next, but he always had a camera on him taking pictures of the boys, kids. It was always the boys. That’s all that’s really there.\'</p>
<p>Her claims come in the wake of the release of Leaving Neverland - an HBO documentary detailing Wade Robson and Jimmy Safechuck\'s allegations of long term abuse by Jackson.</p>
<p>Producers for the show also claimed they were made aware of potential tapes, but never found them.</p>
<p>She says that as details emerged that Jackson could face criminal charges when former child companion Jordan Chandler alleged abuse, the tapes were hidden.</p>
<p>\'I don’t know where they went, but I did hear that one of the nephews of the man who ran the theater had got a hold of a lot of the videos and hid them,\' she recalls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'The rumor was the projectionist said that they were very damaging to Michael.</p>
<p>\'I had heard that the man who ran the theater, he had mentioned that his nephew had come over there once in a while. His nephew would run the theater when the older man wouldn’t. And rumors were that he packed them up in the trunk and took them off the ranch.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1993, 13-year-old Jordan Chandler brought charges of sexual abuse against Jackson that ended in a reported $20 million cash settlement.</p>
<p>And a 2003 criminal case spurred by 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo’s accusations led to Jackson’s arrest, trial and 2005 acquittal.</p>
<p>McManus\' claims of the existence of videos were in part supported by <em>Leaving Neverland</em> producer Dan Reed, who says Safechuck was aware of \'sexual\' videos Jackson had filmed.</p>
<p>Speaking to Rolling Stone, British award winning creative Reed said: \'James mentioned to me at one point, &quot;You know, Michael had a video camera and he recorded a sexual act.&quot; But he didn’t go into detail. And then Jackson was like, &quot;Oh, what did I do?&quot; and taped over it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I have all the evidence that I need. And there was no video recording that exists of Michael having sex with [these] children. \'There was no flagrante delicto with these guys. We don’t have the tapes.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days McManus works as a carer in Nipomo, California, and says she \'is at peace\' with branding her former boss a sex abuser, despite still suffering with anxiety and panic attacks as a result of the experience.</p>
<p>She adds that she was not shocked at the claims made by Robson and Safechuck, who were regular private guests in Jackson\'s bedroom during her years working for him</p>
<p>\'I’m not shocked. I already know what he is. I live with it. I know the truth. It wouldn’t shock me. It is kind of what it is, what it was. I think it would be devastating to his fans, who are blindfolded by the reality. That’s what would hurt.\'</p>
<p>“ He was always cuddling [Safechuck], holding his hand or being amorous towards him more like a girlfriend than a friend.”
She has previously claimed that she recalls Jackson accuser Safechuck being cajoled into playing dress-up with the King of Pop.</p>
<p>She says she always wondered about Jackson\'s relationship with Safechuck in early 1990s.</p>
<p>\'Michael would be obsessed with Jimmy,\' she said. \'They would go into the bedroom and play dress-up. Jimmy would take his clothes off, and Michael would let him wear his personal shirts, pajamas and famous black fedora hat.\'</p>
<p>She said Safechuck was a regular guest at Neverland and his relationship with Jackson \'didn\'t feel right.\'</p>
<p>She recalled how Jackson would get Jimmy alone and \'lock him away\' for days at a time.</p>
<p>\'He was always cuddling him, holding his hand or being amorous towards him more like a girlfriend than a friend,\' she said.</p>
<p>McManus tried and failed to sue Jackson along with other employees in 1994 for their treatment during their employment.
Melanie Bagnall, Kassim Abdool, Ralph Chacon, McManus and Sandy Domz said they were harassed and threatened by security guards and fired or forced to quit in 1994. </p>
<p>In their depositions McManus and Chacon spoke about the singer\'s alleged sexual abuse of minors.</p>
<p>McManus was also called as a prosecution witness in his 2005 criminal trial.</p>
<p>The former maid says Jackson got away with the abuse for so many years because of the regime of fear and intimidation he ran.</p>
<p>She claims Jackson\'s private security team would issue death threats and intimidate staff and children to stay silent about what they saw in Neverland during the early 90s.</p>

            This all makes me nervous. Why did nobody listen to these men before? Why was Jackson protected after his death? I'm sorry if I feel like this is an attempt to divert attention.

             Jackson was incredibly rich and powerful. People have no idea how quickly someone rich can quash things with the right pay offs to the right people.

            Great post. And remember that when police raided Jackson's residence they found what they called 'grooming material' to desensitise the children and break down their boundaries. They also found images of naked adults with children's faces imposed on them. Sick.

            This woman makes me sick! If she saw all that stuff go on then she should have spoke up! Sounds like she wants a pay day now with all her anxiety! I honestly don’t know what to think of this dead pop star. I wish more attention  would come on SS though .

             Yes, for the sake of the children, she should have said something.  But perhaps she was too frightened--Jackson was powerful.

             Possible, because the Daily Mail reported that many film critics thought that the allegations against Jackson were highly credible after the screening of 'Leaving Neverland'.

             This doesn't mean that she is lying though. I also think that he was a pedo.

              Yes he probably was a pedo but I will never be 100 % sure because of all the shadiness that goes on. At least he’s dead and not harming kids anymore. Just wish some of the living pedos would go down .

            A friend of mine at the moment is totally anti-Jackson...  says he was a monster-pedo.
Because of that new movie coming out "Leaving Neverland". 
I have not yet seen this movie.

            But I always was defending Michael Jackson a little bit..  for two reasons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The Establishment (which is disgusting pedovores themselves) obviously hated him.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I never saw him appearing together with our "usual suspects"....like Epstein and the Clinton cabal...
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            .... but - wait-  ... wasn't he good friends with Steven Spielberg..? 
...and!  I just found this article from 2016:

           <p>
            It claims that there are connections with creepy Uri Geller and some well known pedos like Greville Jenner and Clement Freud. Geller also was friends with Jimmy Savile
           </p>
           <p>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, honestly, I don't know what to think of this. We have to face the opportunity, that Jackson was a pedo. 
But I do not think he was a satanist pedovore.
           </p>
           <p>
            He probably liked to watch naked boys. And maybe he did disgusting shit with them. Nothing to excuse. Pedo.
            <br/>
            But maybe he was acting "autonomously" and was  "just" interested in being touchy and have some sexual "fun"... 
And maybe he was crazy enough to think the kids would appreciate these things.
            <br/>
            But guess he was not into torturing kids and eating them and drinking their blood.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he maybe was a pedo  -  but not a member of the cabal club?  Or maybe he was a member of the club (from birth), but maybe at some time he quit the relationship with the cabal?  And that's why "they" tried to expose him? With what they did themselves much worse?
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know. But there must be a reason for that the cabal hated him so much.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we can say: He did not need the cabal to get access to kids. He had access to the kids himself. He built his big "Neverland"-trap. He was rich enough to groom the kids himself and pay their parents hush money. 
He did not need the trafficking cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe he refused to deliver kids from Neverland to  the cabal? And so become part in the big trafficking business? Or he just declined the cabal's invitation to an adrenochrome party?  They could have offered him some "medicine" for all his health issus.... and he declined (because depite being a pedophile he was not interested in killing kids and take part in satanism?) - and so they knew, they cannot control him?
           </p>
           <p>
            We should focus on the relationship  "Jackson - cabal".  And try to figure out, what maybe could be a reason that they tried to destroy him in the nineties.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, just to make that clear: ANY pedophilia is disgusting!  But maybe there are different levels of evil.... and it is naive to think that all pedos are part of the same club.

             Michael Jackson was not only a pedophile, but he was also a big player in child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cabal hated him because of his extreme wealth and power, and in the cabals book, they aim to keep everyone broke and working for them. The mob hates competition.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the article, "McManus said she was scared to come forward because she 'was told by Michael’s bodyguards that they could hire a hit man to take me out.'" Michael threatened kids he raped with "disappearing" and also threatened their parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             *&gt; He did not need the cabal to get access to kids. He had access to the kids himself. He built his big "Neverland"-trap. *
Exactly, Neverland provided the perfect avenue for procuring children. But it was opened in 1988. He had to get his kids from somewhere before that and who knows how much blackmail the 'cabal' had on him at that point. 
Many pedophiles worked for Michael Jackson in procuring children, and it was an open secret what his 'type' was.
            </p>
            <p>
             *&gt;But guess he was not into torturing kids and eating them and drinking their blood. *
I wouldn't be so sure about that...

             Stephen Spielberg financed his early films with child pornography money.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are competing gangs, all vying for turf and selling product (children, child porn).
            </p>
            <p>
             Given his plying children (getting them drunk, drugging them), making physical threats to the children to keep them quiet, threatening their families, using manipulation and mind control tactics to control children, paying off charities and child abuse orgs with 'donations,' etc...
I think it is safe to say his level of evil is off the charts. The man admitted to admiring Hitler and apparently borrowed from his tactics.

             I think you are right. The other pedos hated him because MJ wasn't probably on the "dark side" of the pedo spectrum. I think another reason for the hate could be that MJ was too obvious pedo. All his shit has "PEDO" written all over it. He may have made the other pedos around him feel uncomfortable.

             I agree. I think MJ's father may have made him a "victim." He had no normal childhood. They worked him to death.
            </p>
            <p>
             "“I just remember hearing my mother scream, ‘Joe you’re gonna kill him, you’re gonna kill him, stop it,’” Michael recalled. “I was so fast he couldn’t catch me half the time, but when he would catch me, oh my god it was bad, it was really bad.” Michael also said his father would taunt him about his “fat nose”, and later told Winfrey he was so afraid of his father that he would sometimes vomit when he saw him. In 1979, Michael fired his father as his manager and took control of his career himself."

             I think the appeal of Neverland was to replace a stolen childhood. He never had a chance at "normal." His later music video "They don't really care about us" appeared to expose Hollywood NWO types. It seems he did tick off people in high places.

              If he had child pornography he would have been charged with that. There was an inventory of all the material found and what MJ had on his nightstand was pictures of grown women. Who knows where the stuff laying all around his huge mansion with dozens of staff came from? What is “sexual imagery of a child”? It is likely not child pornography, because they would have called it that (and filed charges).

             No. The police officer responsible for the raid said they found all kinds of porn, not only 'straight, adult' stuff.

              There are inventories of what was discovered.  As far as I am aware nearly all of it is some sort of Hustler and Penthouse-type stuff. No young nude males or boylove stuff.

               I'm sure that they found homo porn stuff too. Not 100% sure, but IIRC, they also found some boy love stuff. I remember that, because when reading it at the time, I was actually surprised that they

               </em>
               found adult porn, both straight and homo, as I thought that Jackson was a pedo, I hadn't assumed they would find adult porn.

            There's never been any proof of MJ being a pedo.  There's been accusations sure, but this cunt is saying that a private theater and having vaseline everywhere somehow makes him a pedo.  WTF was he gonna do with that shit on his golf cart or in literally every room of the house?  Seems to me that he had some use for it that wasn't lube because he was rich as fuck and would have bought it by the pallet if he found one he liked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I'm not saying that having naked spas with kids is right, obviously that's more than a bit fucked up, but the man was robbed of his childhood and in his twisted mind probably equated that with the skinny dipping a lot of kids do down at the local river in their youth.  After all his sole mission was to recreate the childhood he never had so that kind of shit seems infinitely more likely than trying to repeat the sexual abuse he undoubtedly suffered himself.  Then again fags do reproduce that way so who knows but personally I don't believe it for a second.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also if this cunt suspected anything and let it go on like she says she's just as guilty for not only allowing it to continue but literally hiding any evidence too.  There's no statute of limitations when it comes to child sex offenses so I say hang her.

             Not true. Most US states have statute of limitations on these offences.

              Have to agree about most of these testimonies. I don't have any strong opinions either way, I'm open to accepting the harder truth. But when it comes to MJ, obviously, it feels like he's way too stardom level to accurately differentiate any of these accusations with reality or fiction. Anyone ever seen Eddie Griffin's interview on MJ, black stars in general and their relation to the press?

              Around 5:19 is where he and the interviewer share stories about Jackson's scandals. Reminiscent of Dave Chappelle's public grievances about Hollywood, PR, corporate interest, art and commerce, etc... Going further you'll more see conspiratorial claims about racial type casting and the like.
