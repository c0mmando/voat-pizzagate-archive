            The links between the Pilgrims Society, the Clintons, Podestas, Bushes, McCain, Rockefellers, and Rothschilds is key. This is how the US business elite is tied to British and Dutch royalty, and it all connects back to Racine, Wisconsin.

            Ok so lets say everything he says is legit and actually comes to pass.....  Why is this good?  Someone explain it to me.  It sounds like they are getting a known hacker and Trumps lawyer to lie about Trump ordering hacking of the DNC and that involves flying to Russia to hire a hacker?  Forget that the made up story is ridiculous for a moment.  The press will eat it up.  It will be looked at as fact regardless of whether George Webb or anyone else said it was going to happen before hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean unless they can prove Seth Rich leaked the emails the press is going to present this as fact, If George Webb is right, Trump is gonna get railroaded by false accusations.  How is this good news?

            Watching 213.1, so Hillary had Awans hacked sony under the front of gucifer 1.0 to extort money from hollywood peeps. Wonder if that's why they've been kissing her flabby ass and blasting trump so much.

            So in one or two weeks if he is wrong are you all going to respond appropriately, like by rethinking your trust in his every word? Or pretend, like when his interview with Seth Rich's brother didn't happen, that there are no red flags piling up in the corner with regards to this hero who emerged from nowhere and believes the pizzagate perps should walk free? Asking for a friend.

             This was an interesting statement he made, but nobody should get their hopes up for anything coming in 2 weeks, just like Kim's empty promises. The reporting is as slow footed as the investigation, with all sides hedged, and George Webb and others aren't saying what needs to be said. The FBI, NSA, DHS, CIA, DNC and RNC are corrupt criminal organizations acting above the law under the color of law. They all know what is going on, and they are all corrupt and complicit. They are all guilty of misprision of treason, and misprision of felonies. Trump is either fully compromised or as corrupt and involved in Pizzagate as Hillary Clinton is. He isn't draining any swamp. Even Trey Gowdy cannot be trusted as FBI Director. He has done nothing but grandstand and praise corrupt Jim Comey. Their only concern is the people taking a real stand, and as long as we maintain some hope that George Webb, Sean Hannity, and Alex Jones are on the case, that the feds will finally take notice soon and arrest a patsy or two. Maybe a low charge for Hillary like they gave to Wiener. This is a sick joke.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many red flags mixed among many more valid discoveries. What is surprising is the relatively low number of views of his reports, and how no one else seems to know about the Seth Rich cover up from July. The entire thing was orchestrated with Jim Comey. He was involved. This is still being orchestrated and controlled with half of the cast including Congress "playing dumb". This is complete tyranny, and George Webb is worth following, but it is bigger than what he is covering, and it's alarming that no one is paying attention.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about this - they know the information is out there, likely in the hands of Wikileaks, Kim, and many others. They know much more may be discovered. They know it is only a matter of time before it is all revealed, so they are getting in front of the investigation to control it. What happened to Gwen Jackmann? How is he still alive? Who is protecting him? Who is he working with and for? Why do him and Robert David Steele not care about real justice? What they are really afraid of is an uncontrolled George Webb.
            </p>
            <p>
             This goes much deeper than what George Sweigart is covering. This is about tying up loose ends, and letting everyone know the game has to change before they get caught up in the "Awan Brothers hacking".
            </p>
            <p>
             The question is whether George and other 'reporters' will go outside of the controlled narrative and expand the scope to the network of global corruption and collusion. Does he know about the rat lines in Racine, Wisconsin, and how that links to the Pilgrims Society and Knights of Pythias (Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, etc.)? Does he know how this is related to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, the World Bank, the Vatican, Agenda 2030, Kabbalistic Zionism, Satanism and the Temple of Set, and the elite power families in America?
            </p>
            <p>
             Follow George Webb, just don't stop where he stops. He is covering what we already know, or what will soon be known. Much like Alex Jones, he is exposing some information while still covering up the hidden truths to keep the story going and his listeners tuned in.

              Oh so he did choose the "Webb" name on purpose. OK, i was suspecting the name actually meant something and was chosen as a hiding in plain sight thing, because the people he works with like to do that sort of thing. And his videos are indeed weaving a Webb to trap the free thinking pizzagate researchers who were following good leads, and getting too close to the DC cult for comfort. He's performed Blackstones before, why wouldn't he be playing yet anohter role for the deep state sickos? There's nothing trustworthy about him whatsoever. He's an actor.with a sketchy past.

               Webb is apparently his middle name. He said today that he is rooting for Mossad, and that Eric Braverman is working for Kissinger and Mossad. He also is saying that Kim is part of the school play. Something tells me there is a reason why Gwen Jackmann's account went dark. This is why everyone needs to think beyond what people are telling them, and not trust someone who has dubious connections to the same groups as those involved.

              Interesting thoughts.   Could you share how you see it all unraveling, if, that is, you think it ever can, or will?  I understand about controlled opposition, somewhat.  I understand the skepticism.  I am asking, because I truly want to know how you, and others, see the whole show being brought down, and not just a patsy or two.  Do you see it as being a possibility of actually happening, of true justice being served and the children being freed, and, if so, then how, and when?

               It is a moving target based on how much the people figure out and demand. If people keep watching cable TV and acting like nothing is wrong, nothing will change. The first key is making sure enough of us know the truth so that they can't Seth Rich everyone. The next key is reaching the masses and giving them a path to the truth they they can understand, and a pathway for real change through peace, liberty, extreme transparency and reform with modernized checks and balances, and justice.
              </p>
              <p>
               We need the dominoes to start falling faster, and demanding more. This goes through politics to industries and secret societies. Either it all ends, or it never will. This is why Racine is important. Who cares if they find the trigger man for Seth Rich? Who cares if Wiener, the Clintons and Podestas all get small punishments? What matters is that the people find out what is really going on, and how it affects them personally. This is real. This is everyone's life. How can such an evil and corrupt place as Racine, Wisconsin exist without people knowing about it? Until something is done about Racine, and how it links to every other hub of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, nothing will change and we will still be fed lies and false boogeymen.
              </p>
              <p>
               George Webb and Ashton Kutcher may seems like they are "solving" Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, but neither are who they say they are. George Sweigart and Chris Kutcher know exactly what they are doing. So does Trump. Do not sell your faith so cheaply to false prophets.
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: everything is relative. George Webb's investigation is better than no investigation. Wikileaks is better than no leaks. Kim's statement is better than silence. Alex Jones is better than Jake Tapper. Some truths must be revealed to keep all truths from being revealed.
              </p>
              <p>
               What if every person in the world didn't have to ever worry about food, water, shelter, health and mental care, privacy, or safety again? This should be the goal. No more rigged anything. No more corruption. No more false leaders. Shared peace by shared truth.

                I disagree with this vehemently. Though I do agree that even if Wikileaks is working for govt intel agencies, their leaks are better than no leaks. I wish George would go away. We were doing fine without him, we were doing great. We don't need him. He is a disinfo agent and that is very dangerous.

                 You may be right, and his credibility and motives should be questioned. There are some major red flags for certain, and we are making connections between George Webb and Racine. Today he claimed to support Mossad, and called Eric Braverman an agent of Mossad working for Kissinger. Gwen Jackmann said that Braverman and George were working together. Now she has gone silent. We do not know if George Webb is part of the corruption, controlled opposition, or disinformation. We do know that Racine, Wisconsin is part of the corruption, and not disinformation. This is why Racine is a true barometer and litmus test for whether people are following a script or if they are willing to shine the light on the system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption that is so curiously and unusually linked to Paul Ryan's home district. When George Webb investigates Racine and uncovers something unknown already, it would be a pleasant shock and surprise. There is more faith in an anonymous V____Z comment than 214 days of youtube videos. Keep digging and discerning.

            So I guess Clinton/McCabe/Podesta came up with a plan of making Guccifer 1.0 be the DNC hacker. How? They make a deal that gets him to lie and say Trump hired him to hack the DNC and thereby provide the "evidence" Trump broke the law Watergate style. Instead of the plumbers breaking into DNC headquarters in the Watergate office complex it's make up a story Trump paid Guccifer to break into the modern equivalent and...........wait for it..........provide the evidence to impeach Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is the overwhelming evidence Seth Rich was the leaker. All the meta-data and audit trails give it away. Oh what a tangled web we weave when at first we set out to deceive.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there's the problem of a new FBI director being appointed to replace
            <s>
             Luke Skywalker
            </s>
            Andrew SlowWalker. Clinton and Podesta don't work in government anymore so a new FBI director could be a problem if they dissolve any deal made by their predecessor.

               a plea agreement where he cooperates in exchange for a reduced sentence would be advantageous. He told Fox News he has nothing to hide and wants to cooperate with the U.S. government, adding that he has hidden two gigabytes of data that is “too hot” and “it is a matter of national security.”
