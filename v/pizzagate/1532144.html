            Plenty of photos of kids - but they seem to be the same kids. 
My gut tells me this guy is clean, there doesn't seem to be anything else pizza/ping pong related.

             That's why I would like someone to ask him about it. He deleted it, that much is obvious. Because Comet Ping Pong changed the decor it's hard to find proof this artwork was there aside from this archive link. This guy has seen it, and taken a picture of it. If he's a decent human being he will be honest about it. Could you call him a witness I wonder?

            I didn't say troll them. It's more like infiltration my idea. Like project veritas. Talk to them.  Get to know them. Get to the subject at some point. See if they let slip information which they might otherwise want covered up, or if they incriminate themselves. Actually it's more like a sting. I don't mean barrage them on social media, if just one or two people can get information that would be beneficial. This painting is pretty important because children attend this venue, it's really not appropriate for it to be there and probably illegal. And this guy might be a witness to what was painted on the walls before they changed their decor.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we know people are holding something back and they will never talk about it to a non-bias reporter at any time, if no witnesses come forward, if witnesses are being killed and the killings covered up, getting information out of people by lying to them, making it seem like you're on their side unfortunately is quite often the most effective way possible.

            I would do this myself but as I said Instagram will not allow me to join.

            I know it's old but I want to see this guy's response to it. Especially when he doesn't know he's talking to someone looking for proof of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            And who else would see the comment with the question? His wife? His kids? The kids in the pictures? Would it encourage someone who knows something to come forward? If we pretend we're trying to debunk it would someone reply with hard evidence of abuse by the people in the Comet Ping Pong circle?
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy reminds me of Sandusky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone should try and sting this guy. Talk to him and try and get information out of him about the picture. Comet Ping Pong have since changed the decor in the restaurant.
