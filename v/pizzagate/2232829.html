            Definitely sounds like trafficking, how many reports over the years have we read, 'a naked girl ran through traffic?  I remember reading one where the poor girl about 12 ran through traffic and because no one stopped, the perpetrator caught her again.  Another when I lived in South Africa, a young teenage girl escaped naked from her captor, and an off duty policeman stopped, the sicko tried to puraude the policeman that she was a relative and had mental problems, (not knowing he was a policeman), he said if that is the case you can come to the station and pick her up.  Then a car chase perused and the man ended up shooting himself to death.  It turned out that he and his wife, I think, had kidnapped 6 girls.  Can't remember if the others survived. The probable reason they make them strip is so they will not escape in public naked, because of the embarrassment. Just a guess.

             Undoubtedly. One of Dahlmer's victims escaped, and two cops gave the underage kid back to Dahlmer so he could finish him off!!!! The lady who made the call even followed up and told the dispatcher that it was only a child, and the dispatcher was pretty much laughing telling her he was Dahlm'er bf! Sick!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, this has to be human trafficking. But what about the two other kids in the car. Just says they let them go? Go where? They were minors! Were they children of the pervs driving the car? Doubt there'll be an update. Why give details? But it just goes to show you how a family can just disappear.

             Scary stuff and I'm so happy they escaped.

              I also thought released them to where?  It was an odd statement, it is usually, released to their parents, or into the custody of CPS etc., but nothing!

               Yeah, very weird. Were they victims also? Or were all the people in the car victims? Were they victims who had to kidnap more victims? Otherwise, why drive around nude? Isn't that sort of calling attention to themselves?

                 Jeez Louise! Read another article that made this sound almost like a joke! I don't think kidnapping a family is all that funny!

                 Anyway, they said they're not giving anymore details of the children or adults that were charged because it would identify the two kids. I guess that would mean, if I'm extrapolating correctly, that the two children who were released are the kids of the nasty naked couple plus one. Could be another older adult child?

                  Me either. it will get swept under the carpet again. 😒 Reminds me of this article again, people thought it was hilarious, a prank, because he was naked.  But knowing what we know now, shock, horror, he probably was literally trying to escape.  Why would you risk your life.  I never heard any more about it after this initial incident.

                   I believe that video was a hoax. There's one that overlay the real roof of Buckingham Palace with the faux one used.

                   It's very well done though.

             That's a good guess.  What nasty people and if people did not stop for that girl they should have bad luck.  How can you just keep on going?  Very Very Sad Indeed.  And yes, a nasty trick that is, keeping them from running away.  A good call yes, it certainly sounds like trafficking.  Am glad they were caught and nabbed.
