I was pretty unhappy with most of it - him rambling about all kinds of subjects.

     But he has a reveal at about the halfway point.   That the federal Dept of Health and Human Services has the legal ability to engage in sexual acts with children in accordance with the guidelines.  No intercourse, but other things.   So if you work for dhhs and a co-worker catches you, say with your *** in her mouth, there is nothing that can be done.  Overall, I think he is kind of arrogant, but I must agree he is right.   No matter how many \'pasta\' and \'pizza\', or \'dominoes\' emails you see, not matter how many pics of toddler girls with \'pizza slut\' shirts on, none of that proves anything.   He had some good advice, too.  Do not publicly state anybody is a pedofile, or a satanic murderer.   Be careful to only raise questions, not state things.  There are many that clamoring to Trump to simply arrest all the high level people we think are involved.    He makes a good case that is <em>not</em> what we want to do.  What we want is to do exactly what President Trump appears to be doing.   Start out with the low, and work your way up, squeezing the guilty to get the higher fish.   Otherwise, the enemy just regroups and replaces the top with somebody else.   Our job as people that want to help bring these rings down is just to research and wonder about things.  I\'m nearly 100% certain that both the white hats the black hats are watching us closely.  Hopefully the black hats are a little busy right now;  Too much to worry about us.</p>',

            Called it earlier: "Yeah... David Seaman, Vault 7, the Hillary "dump" from Assange, CNNLeaks, the "deadlines" for disclosures on Weinergate... we've been mislead quite a bit and still only have the original leaks. I am in full out "believe it when I see it" mode. Multiple promises broken, possible sources being compromised, extreme delays with pushing ahead, etc."

            Thanks Michael, you've added next to nothing that we haven't already discussed in detail and you are guilty of click baiting just as I had predicted. Your video will not be deleted.

            Look, Michael, there is a reason we use the term. The circumstantial evidence we have uses the term pizza. If we can't refer to them as pedos without being potentialy sued for libel, doesn't it make sense to use the term we are using rather than "pedogate", per your own argument?

            He is a shill of the Thomas Wictor variety. Likely Soros/Brock funded, not CIA funded. The objective of these types of shills is to influence us to think that all this corruption will work itself out for the best. The best is equated with not seeking to prosecute those at the top, due to the shills' assertions that prosecuting them will be detrimental to the nation as a whole, impractical costly, etc. Don't fall for it. If we can bring down the NY mafia, even if they continue on after regrouping, we can bring down the corrupt govt officials.

             He's not a shill. But his was a crappy report that he erroneously flagged as groundbreaking. He could have told us that he discovered some govt agency can legally touch children sexually in a conscience, 3 minute video. Instead he claimed to have info that will surely get his video removed promptly, and he, whilst showing us he had very little idea of what pizzagate researchers actually believe and investigate, proceeded to lecture and advise from on high.

             Unlikely.  Shills usually are all about how there is no hope, we've lost.  Or they are all about - look at this!  Smoking Gun!  Where it is completely lame.   This guy was preaching patience, and give good advice to ask questions but not to make accusations.  A shill would do the opposite.

              They are trying to run out the clock and deflect and de-escelate the public's outrage, meanwhile they attempt to discredit the public's support for Trump and attack his Cabinet. Shill all the way; are you as well?

            He had kind of tortured explanation as to why he made his title click-bait.   I think we get it - that you want to become famous with this.  That's ok, as long as you care more about righting the wrongs, which I think he actually does.
