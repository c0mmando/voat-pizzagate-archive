<p>He is said to have committed suicide in Oman, one of the worst places in the fucking world when it comes to child trafficking. And the weird part here is that he was actually invited by the sultan\'s family member. Now, Swedish media is talking about how he was depressed and was suicidal. But they are completely ignoring the fact that he had changed his lifestyle entirely following his surgery. They are also ignoring the fact that he never actually showed any suicidal tendencies whatsoever, not even when he was at his lowest in his depression. He never expressed the will to die. Everyone around him (parents especially) have completely accepted that he killed himself.</p>
<p>IN FUCKING OMAN</p>
<p>NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES</p>
<p>A couple of people have expressed some doubt, they still accept the suicide because there is nothing else, and they need to stay sane. This is why our countries have been steadily declining for so long. They simply suicide/overdose the ones who aren\'t quiet.</p>

            He was probably dosed with Fentanyl (tiny bit in a drink by female assassin) in a hotel room then post mortem someone broke a bottle and slashed his wrists.  Or they did it while he was coding and foaming, anti mortem.

               Have not seen researching the family trees of Greenberg and Steinbergs. There is a Steinberg in jail in NY, charged with human trafficking infants and killing them. He also used poor criminals and drug addicts to do crimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a facebook group, of children that were illegally adopted, and a Jewish doctor and attorney were arrested. The judges will not release the birth and other records to these growing group of adults that were taken from poor mothers.There are some news articles on this group fighting in court for decades, as NY judges/state attorney/governors refuse release birth information to hundreds of ones in a growing group seeking their rights to know what poor mother they were taken from illegally.
              </p>
              <p>
               The arrested doctor and attorney connects to Miami Medical University. A Dr. Greenberg was in the medical program as the arrested doctor, as was Hemingway's son. His first wife was a nurse at same university. Greenberg is a retired, reknowned cardiologist, Mensa, high mason, past president of AMA, American Heart Association, medical honor boards, and past cardiology medical scientist at Cern, as his cousin was a early scientist at Cern Chicago, also. Dr.Louis Hank Greenberg, cardiologist, has one sister, Marlene Steinberg, was a court psychologist for at risk kids/fosters.
              </p>
              <p>
               Their son is Micheal Steinberg that was on 2017 ballot in 35 plus states for vice president of the United States, under presidential candidate Rocky, listed on Wikipedia. Rocky has had legal corruption scandals.  Ester Steinberg is from show, Funny Girls, another comedian, whining of same rich problems in religion. His wife Miriam, running for local politics, and Steinbergs are bullying another write in candidate, a lucrative case using tax dollars, is in Tampa news. Steinbergs in Tampa, Greenbergs in Orlando, both in NY, California, DC. Steinberg/Greenberg museums in USA and israel.
              </p>
              <p>
               Greenbergs and Steinbergs are huge in backside of Hollywood. The back scenes of illimuniti families are Greenbergs/Steinbergs/Medelsohns/Kobrin/ and more. Ones that run the local cities they live, connect to state, national , worldwide pitics, medical, lawyers/courts/local state federal contracts/nasdaq/corporations/Hollywood.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look up CEO Stanley Greenberg under federal investigations in NY. Baseball player Hank Greenberg married department store owner (Macys or Bloomingdale). Anyone can find more Steinberg/Greenberg connections to the kids taken from poor moms and Mkultra/paperclip? Look up all the unsolved/missing cases of children and females serial murdered/raped, and how some cases involve lower income drug dealers/club scenes. Look up missing children lists, 99.9 percent are not rich, not Jew, but poor whites/black/hispanic/native/christians/indigenous.
              </p>
              <p>
               Go to web search websites where mothers and kids can post searching for each other. The number of poor white/black/native indian/hispanic mothers searching for kids taken from them. Look up Rick Scott in Texas Medicare/Medicaid scandals. Voted in for Governor, yet again.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look up Florida cases of how Medicaid children/infants not covered for home medical supplies, like simple oxygen, taken from poor parents, put in nursing homes as child institutions are overbooked. The media refuses to air most cases, and attorneys refuse to take most cases and poor cannot afford attorneys. Legal aid and others are only tenant, divorce cases, and it is not real attorney representatiin, only typing up many pages about client being on welfare, then the judge evicts at court. Look up how Fema puts the disaster victims in the unsafe motels, only a few days, then homeless, then state takes kids from the single parent. Same with Haitians and others from South America. Families are seperated. Moms and female kids taken to motels with strict curfew laws. Boys taken to a institution, then teeth tested/health and routed to Boys Town hospitals, foster homes, group homes. Adult males taken to prisons in South Florida.
              </p>
              <p>
               Rockefellors and others are the publicized illuminati. Comet players are the fall guys/distractions. The behind the scene Zionists/Masons/Illuminatis are found by seeing the power player families for decades, as each city was small and being developed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look up the National and County Human Trafficking hotlines, board of directors, donators. Same with JCC and Jewish Metro Services that charges most poor, $80 and up, required mental counselling with a labelled disorder, to get any food pantry of canned food donation!
              </p>
              <p>
               On facebook these rich Jews are the conservative/Askenazi/orthodox that are elite status, closed strong units in each community that know each other for decades, all grow up together, same temples, schools, including private ones like Hebrew Day School. They are Zionist jews funding Zionism and anti-semetism, run the rabbinical councils.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you call the Human Traffic Hotlines, national or local, a counselor answers and tries to get location and meet up. Then, called by the "crime advocate," demands upfront name and location in military commando or refuses help. Refuses allow the federal/state/crime victim rights to have their own Safety Plan and choices of healing, privacy, forces into their shelter, demands a mental label and psychotropics. That ruins court cases as mental routed. Shelters, the prisons of curfew, control, forced labor as wages taken versus help ones relocate safely out of county, change names, pursue law suits and justice, allow choose where want to live and return to the work they did prior or were college educated in.
              </p>
              <p>
               The non minor victim survivors in Crime Psychopathology still under control are called RAT. Put in dire conditions, sleep deprived, no free will, under full control, including financial independance on overpriced rental slums. Look up the Jews that own most rentals in poor ghettos.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many RAT are forced on welfare and disability for physical and mental. Ones on physical are continued duressed and attempts to mental route by their handlers, often parents that illegal adopted, or suspected as refuse birth and child records. I would say, at least 1000 survivors are RATTED, acrossed the USA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many were runaways, then convinced in hardships, dire events, endangered issues to move back to family areas, then the same abuse/MK Ultra restarts and escalates, dissociates, purposeful distress and severe mental/emotional abuse, treat like 5 year old imbeciles, cut off student and adult level access to computers/office gear/jobs/transport/no funds.

               There are also Israeli children brought to the USA, sometimes alone, or single poor parent/or addict issues. Taken into group foster homes, many in Brooklyn. Never given passports/citizenship. At age 16/17, try to leave and work, cannot get jobs/go to college without citizenship. Cops are called, mental routed, forced on psychotropics and institutions. But, institutions for kids and young adults are so full, the news has covered that nursing homes for elderly are being used.

               Genetics to various medical issues ( deaf, blind, blood disorders, cardio disorders, etc). The human trafficking are the ite networks that infiltrate all, and use lower income hard criminals. Many arrested serial murders state it is networks, same as shown on Voat research with pedofile sex offenders on dark web sites. The Golden serial killer just charged is a past cop, and wife is attorney that lobbies in the feminist movement, daughter a ER doctor. A Long Island cop just arrested for raping a rape victim, not assisting the victim that called for help.

              <p>
               The Long Island Serial killer crime profile and crime scene analysis. Intelligent, girlfriend or married, burlap bags, trucks, no rich Jew victims. Burlaps are sold at Kosher groceries for dry good, but professors on pay for this case, never mention that. Two of the professors hired are from a NY and NJ college. Calls to the NY one, he states not being paid to consult, violates Title IV as a working professor in this #metoo, easy to get ones fired fir violating. The NJ professor answers to a victim and screeches like a psycho. Why would serial killers not become professors and authors/consults on serial killers, great elite infiltration and prey on surviving victims. Is the Long Island Serial killer a elite, zionist doctor or medical student of that type of family?

              <p>
               The support of Zionist males by rabbis to pursue medical, lawyer, politics is very high. The poor females are not helped, but the very attractive ones state are sex solicited by the older males at Shabbas they go to, to eat as hungry. The male Jews can go around each Shabbas Friday, before sunset, bum money from the Jews. The poor female Jews are shunned, as males make thousands in Brooklyn and fly down to Miami to bum also.
              </p>
              <p>
               The inside looks and the local scene communities, and the mind thoughts of how ones group operate is so key, as are the networks and infrastructures. Simiar to mafia, but way more developed.
 Not all Jews are Zionists or aware, so please do not think I am discriminating. Zionist elite is not the same as low income, regular Jews that are not in these very select in groups.

               Each state needs outlines of what elite families are in dominating positions in politics, medical, law/courts, government contracts/development, real estate including motels/hotels, prison industrial complex/private corps, hospital/nusing home and mental institution staff, boatd of directors, stockholders. Rick Scott is on many boards and holds stocks. Mendelsohns- corporation of selling life insurance policies into tertiary stock markets on Nasdaq. DC was outlined, Florida keeps connecting to DC, NY, California, Hollywood, Boystown, Haiti, war on poor and disabled, back scene illuminati families listed above, and Bush families  and more.

                Dc, Nebraska networks have been more outlined. We are missing the networks, as each city/hobspot in various networked states not being outlined, yet local location is where each victim is trafficked for various uses.The main players are the ones not in news, stay behind scenes, public image as successful, great community members and families. Each area to function their trafficking is infiltrated, from top to bottom, including using poor hardened criminals, including rapists, serial killers, pedofiles. Remember, pedofiles cannot get jobs, so easy to hire, and dog treats are they can continue criming victims, get attorneys, stay out of jails, courts, paid off cops. Notice how sex clubs and cop bars are in the poor ghettos and who owns these joints.

                 Wow thanks so much for all your research.  You know that in order to post something like this we have to have sources for everything.  Not doubting your info, just that those are the rules for people will question it.  I seriously believe what you have given here.  Most def the owners of buildings in the ghettos are part of this trafficking scene.  Most own many buildings not just one or two.  I did research on Tenet Healthcare and read all about Rick Scott and his bilking of Medicare.  Jeb Bush helped Scott get his start in Fl.  after he paid a huge amount for his crimes.  So he slid from Texas to Fl. with Bush help.  The Bushes are big in Fl.  with Barbara being on the Board of Mayo Clinic and George Sr. being someone entirely different with the last name of Sherff and being Jewish.

                   Jeb had to leave as head of Tenet Healthcare in Texas so he could run for Pres.  His hands are sooooooooooo dirty.

                   told me while researching St. Louis that the CF involvement with Tenet will take the Clintons down.   I have long thought Scott is more involved and flying under the radar.  He has to be involved with DWS and all the stuff going on with Pulse and the Parkland shooting.  Also Kasky and his Adoption Trafficking.  Good God I could go on and on, there is never an end.

                     Fl. and and we know the Chicago Emanuels have to be connected to this Jewish Mafia also to the Pedowood Moguls it is all a big Rat Line Rabbit Hole.  Not to mention connected Jews in NY.  I believe they all have connections to these crimes.  This is why I have said over and over that all this was designed to be so convoluted on purpose.  Yes, the IRS will be the one to take them down.  But here is the problem.  The IRS I believe has been so drained and stripped of power on purpose.  If Trump is really trying to drain the swamp, he must fix the IRS.

                      ever wonder who the IRS really works for?

                     <p>
                      the swamp is so huge, think if what Trump is working on, once the arrests start coming in, it's will just be a matter of going down the line

                      If you look at the percentage of Jewish people in the US, then look into everything owned by them, you see a big problem

                     <p>
                      I'm not about to include all Jewish people, and yes I realize there are fake Jews, but it's become so overwhelming

                       I can't remember where I read it, but I think the IRS works for The Crown.  Yes, they have created this whole mess so it will be almost impossible to figure out.  Also, think about it if the truth comes out about these Jewish elites, think about people that are Jew haters and they will be trying to shoot and kill any of them.  We know what have many on here and it will become open season.  Well the ones that are elite will have protection and the others will not.  They have now a way to get rid of the Real Jews and not the fake ones.  This has bothered me.  Also I just read that other thread about  Anthony and look what I found by accident.

                       What are THEY up to?  Grace makes me sick.  Are these 3 all fakes?  I think so.

               You mean his agent might be a member of the Cabal? Entirely possible - I think he has close connections to (((Jeff Koons))), IIRC, he represents him or represented him.

                Well he definitely has connections to the Brzezinskis who connect to BC and BO.  Sooooooooooo, yeah could be.  They were also in Oman same time as Avicii.  There is a picture in the DM article I believe.  Funny, that.

              Nope.  A ridiculously remote country with less people than Detroit can't be one of the worst trafficking points on earth as OP claimed twice, unable to resist reaching deep into the recesses of his asshole to bolster a weak post.

              Your MO of trying using Arabs to try and distract from Israel being the actual global sex slave leader is laughably obvious.  Hint: you have to CONCEDE the points even admitted by Jew themselves. Kikeshilling since day one

            TMZ isn't really a reliable source though, is it?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Avicii committed suicide with broken glass he used to cut himself ... TMZ has learned.
            </p>
            <p>
             Multiple sources familiar with the circumstances surrounding the famous DJ's death tell us, he did indeed take his own life ... something his parents alluded to last week.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our sources say the method of death was a shard of glass that caused massive bleeding. Two sources tell us Avicii broke a bottle and used the glass to inflict the fatal wound. One of the sources says it was a wine bottle.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two sources tell us the point of injury was Avicii's neck but another strongly denies that, saying it was his wrist. We cannot confirm this, but the sources were privy to specific information about Avicii's death.

            Now there are reports in the media that he broke a wine bottle and slit his own throat with it.  And the police immediately declared "no foul play."  He was suicided and it's looking like the perpetrators will get away with it.

             he created the track and directed the video in "For a better day"

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think what is very important is that he also played one of the victims, who later, as adults, become vigilantes and kill their traffickers and the politician who raped them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes me wonder whether he might have been a survivor of sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is also important is that he mentioned in an interview that he did the video to highlight the problem of child trafficking during the period of mass immigration to Europe in 2015 (where many children got lost, and thousands 'disappeared').
           </p>
           <p>
            What did he actually know about child trafficking of refugee chlldren in Europe? About Swedish politicians? Or, perhaps, about Hungarian politicians? The video was shot in Hungary, a major travel route for refugees and migrants from Syria and other countries who wanted to go to other European countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scene in the video that shows a protest in front of the government building (where the pedo politician resides) reminded me a bit of the mass demonstrations in Belgium during the Dutroux scandal, when 300,000 people took to the streets, demanded justice for the victims, and protested against a corrupt political and judicial system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please watch this excellent video that shows how the investigations of the child abuse network by LE whitehats was undermined by corrupt officials (ironically, it's a BBC documentary), I'd recommend to use it for redpilling friends and family - show them the Avicii music video first, and let them watch the documentary after that. It will only take 50 minutes to watch both videos.

            I can see why they have it in for this guy. Not seeing how his gf is particularly Jewish, either. Looks like they just want us not to dig because they think we will fall for the broken addict drinks himself to death routine.

             Well, you never know how the relationship was at the time he was found dead - but he seemed to be reasonably happy and seemed to have developed a strong bond to his stepson.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would he have killed himself without leaving at least a letter for the two?

             - did you know that Avicii had a girlfriend and a stepson, and seemed to be quite happy? See Daily Mail article above.

              Yes, tragic... I believe he was born into it, and that he was sacrificed as I've stated previously. So let's look at the dates... We know how significant numbers are to these people. He was found dead on April 20, let's assume he died on April 19.
             </p>
             <p>
              April 19 is the first day of the 13-day Satanic ritual day relating to fire - the fire god, Baal, or Molech/Nimrod (the Sun God), also known as the Roman god, Saturn (Satan/Devil). This day is a major human sacrifice day, demanding fire sacrifice with an emphasis on children. This day is one of the most important human sacrifice days, and as such, has had some very important historic events occur on this day.

            Not sure where to put this. Somewhat related. Some have pointed out just how many famous people seem to have been touched by especially sick tragedies involving loved ones. Others have pointed out that serial killers and other sick fucks may not always be working alone as always reported.

             Interview is a special example.of social engineering..
The debt system and its whole administration is fake reality...doesnt have to exist and be relied on..if we reduce debt at the US treasury and become a direct controller of tye US corporation....suing corrupt administrator and public servants under universal jurisdiction...
US as ur debtor would be able to legally kidnap corrupt leaders and criminal child traffickers across the planet ...including the thugs in qatar and oman ..
