<p>&quot;This is a RICO lawsuit. RICO is a special case of civil lawsuit. Evidence can be obtained from across state lines. In addition, it is possible for RICO to be upgraded from a civil case to a criminal case depending on what kind of evidence gets found.</p>
<p>RICO is what gets used to take down organized crime. RICO is intentionally designed to be vague so as to take down mobsters even if a smoking gun can\'t be found.&quot;</p>

<p>ALLUSIONS TO PIZZAGATE IN THE PRESS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the same day this suit was filed, Republican Paul Nehlen, who lost to Paul Ryan, tells Associated Press that he believes that <a href="https://apnews.com/f2eec24f86be4db9a193212b4e1d52e7">Pizzagate is real</a></p>

<p>Again, on the same day, LA Times posted a story about Trump retweeting a tweet by Jack Prosobiec, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-updates-everything-president-trump-retweets-alt-right-blogger-who-1502769297-htmlstory.html">&quot;an alt-right media figure who pushed the PizzaGate and Seth Rich conspiracy theories&quot;</a></p>

<p>I believe we need to read between the lines that many in high level positions are getting ready to bring the elite pedophile ring down and the only way they can do this is through a *MAJOR INDICTMENT process started by Gregory Ackers\' suit.</p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/us/dennis-hastert-released.html">Remember the Dennis Hastert case</a></p>

            Thumbs down. No such indictments are possible. They are above the law. This is not a legitimate government as you attempt to paint it with your talk of them arresting each other. Doesn't work that way, never has, never will. They must be drawn out by force. They won't leave, they won't stop themselves or arrest themselves. Their system provides them impunity, not consequences for their crimes. The title of this thread is unfortunate.

            Is it possible that Gregory Ackers is a navy veteran?  A question I was asking myself because of his interactions with some veterans online and also his email address: greg
            <strong>
             anchors
            </strong>
            @yahoo.com
           </p>
           <p>
            One of his aliases seems to be Gregory C. Hairston.  That name happened to come up in the congressional records as a navy enlistee 1993-1994:
            <a href="http://archive.is/iRxIQ">
             http://archive.is/iRxIQ
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            and then in this article :
            <a href="http://www.ussnewmexico.net/old-updates/">
             http://www.ussnewmexico.net/old-updates/
            </a>
            (
            <em>
             Ctrl + F to find the name Hairston on the page
            </em>
            )  Notice that even though his name is listed for a photo, the photo itself is missing even though the images seem to be present on other articles.  However, someone archived the page:

            On Gregory Acker's Facebook he posted this postcard which I believe may be a photo of himself:

            Here's a bizarre coincidence.  In public records, one of the names Gregory Ackers is listed under is Gregory Hairston. 
 A person of the same name was shot in Phoenix yesterday.  (It's not Ackers.)

            This is a RICO lawsuit. RICO is a special case of civil lawsuit. Evidence can be obtained from across state lines. In addition, it is possible for RICO to be upgraded from a civil case to a criminal case depending on what kind of evidence gets found.
           </p>
           <p>
            RICO is what gets used to take down organized crime. RICO is intentionally designed to be vague so as to take down mobsters even if a smoking gun can't be found.

             Thank you, I placed in description because you really hit the nail on the head, ALSO, it's sad that people on this thread believe that because it's a civil suit, it means nothing, at least somebody is going through the trouble to take these people to court. Can't trust lawyers, can't trust police, so take em to court yourself. Also this guy uses community centers and homeless shelters as addresses, I wonder if he is really homeless? Doesn't seem to make sense, I think I'm going to contact him today.

            I think the RICO charges against CNN will hold up that' a lead pipe cinch, but I really don't think the Lindbergh Baby Kidnapping charges against Podesta will hold up.  Do you?   Wouldn't the statue of limitations apply?  Though you have to admit the sketch of the kidnapper is almost a dead on match.

            I'm was 50/50 of Hillary Clinton going away for life, but now that I find out there's no jury, I'm like 75% sure.

            But the Debbie Wasserman Schultz charges?  Did you read that?  I'm not buying it.  It's one thing to say she sometimes dresses as a man and that she as taken skydiving lesssons, but DWS is DB Cooper?   I'm not buying that.

            I don't know why I didn't do this sooner.  I checked out the address on Google maps that Ackers has listed in the court documents - 503 Olympic Blvd, Santa Monica (CA), 90401, United States
           </p>
           <p>
            Listed under that address we have a homeless shelter:

             Great find! This explains why he can't afford to pay the fees. He's homeless! These bizarre lawsuits are very common from crazy people. He has no job and nothing  better to do than file lawsuit after lawsuit to no avail. If he spent as much time looking for a job as he spends trying to sue people, he might not be homeless. Taxpayer dollars going to waste.  (I work in the field and see these on a regular basis, so I get irritated by the amount of money wasted).

             Per the last page of the complaint - He is suing each of these people for "all assets." He wants all podesta and Clinton's money for himself. Greedy bastard.

               Lol with all due respect, I never said his residential status made him crazy. Had you read the conversation, you'd have caught there is a lot more to it than that.

               As far as the moron comment - funny statement from someone who says 
"AND WTF WOULDN'T HE CLAIM THE SPOILS, IT'S THE POINT THAT THEY LOSE AND SOMEONE WINS. DUH! "
              </p>
              <p>
               Your question or statement doesn't even make sense. Pot calling the kettle black eh?

              There's more to this story though.  He has some very interesting people on his Facebook account.  He says he is a filmmaker, makes documentaries.  So he's often posting to well known people asking if he can make a film about them.  Maybe that's why he has a few prominent names on his account.  However, as I said at the start of all this, just the fact that he has three pages of court cases listed showed that something was not normal.

               I don't have FB. Who are the interesting people? Maybe he does make documentaries, but no one watches them. How many people with you tube channels can claim the same? Like all of them.

              <p>
               I agree with you. This shouldn't be a fuss. I usually don't comment on anything but with the amount of upvoats this has, I thought this post needed some scepticism.

                Yes, that's why I spent some time on this too.  As so many were swooning from excitement I thought that we needed a realism burger.

                As for the people who are on his account, one person in particular caught my eye because he's from the computing world..and that's sort of my thing..I started putting together a data post on him (Prof. Kevin Warwick).  The youtube videos have comments from someone who seems to know him

                 I wonder if Ackers is schizophrenic and thinks Professor Warwick is beaming voices into his head and making him speak in other people's voices. :)

            This is what I would do if I were Hillary: hire/convince/lure some diagnosed or certifiable nutcase into filing a lawsuit against her. Get it dismissed within hours as frivolous and then proclaim loudly, wether asked or not about it, that 1) the Courts have established she's innocent; 2) anyone trying to raise the issue of her responsibility/crimes/guilt, or to file charges against her is at least as batshit crazy as that guy Akers.

              And thank you for looking into this more, THIS is why I love Voat, peer reviewed information and REAL discussion, it's the only way to get to the truth. I wrote to Greg Ackers and I'm hoping for a phone call today, it is really bizarre that most of his previous addresses where Community Centers and Homeless Shelters, could he be a homeless guy? It seems counterintuitive given the wording and persistance in getting these people in an actual court setting. Hope we can get his side of the story. Also look in to the PAC he created "Democrats for Trump" it was listed on his Google + page. Not sure where the Bounty website came from, any info on how that relates to Greg? Just want to see the evidence he set up that website. Truth On ♡

               I think he got help with the court documentation.  He has a couple of lawyers on his Facebook page.  But that's the puzzle for me.  He does appear to be homeless and has moved between Texas and LA over the last few years.  However, he has some very prominent names as friends on his FB account.  Doesn't make sense.  Unless he flattered some of those people by asking to make a film with them because that is what he seems to do.  However, I have never seen anyone respond to his overtures.
              </p>
              <p>
               He does seem to be very political..here's another example:

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Btw, have you seen he was noticed by Stratfor back in 2012?  He's in the wikileaks. I just posted a link in one of my last comments here.

                 I think he's not well. And unless we find something more interesting, if we (VOAT) attach ourselves to this case too much the MSM could have a field day if/when the details come out.  Come on, what's the story with the Moonlight Bunny Ranch?  I know a few journalists, that's the first thing they'll head for.  See what I mean?  I'm advising caution.

                Wow I'm just thinking, stay with me, this might be a long shot... BUT If you've made the ultimate sacrifice to jail these muther f-ers, and don't want to have to keep paying filing fees, you would remain homeless, for to actually be granted 28 U.S.C 1915 (1)(a) you have to prove you really can't afford to pay file fees, but have good reason to file. Thoughts?

                 Yes, I initially thought that was a possibility.  But having gone through his emails I think that he is not mentally well and his education is of a certain standard.  He is definitely a political animal.  The question is did he file those court documents himself?  And if he did not, who helped him and why?

                  This complaint doesn't look professional at all. From the layout, formatting and punctuation errors to the arguments themselves.  It's not even on pleading paper. No lawyer would write this.

            The only thing that was granted on this was a waiver of fees. Meaning he doesn't have to pay the filing fee because he is too broke. It's a civil suit, not a criminal suit. Anyone can file a civil suit against anyone else for any reason - it doesn't even have to be a legit reason.

            Perhaps now is a time to start considering having an anthem for our cause telling the deep state that their end is nigh and we're coming for them. Something like this maybe???

            When this nightmare is over, I have my own place, and some spare funds, I'm planning on holding a special victory party for us the Pizzagate Investigation Team. Shills not invited of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this goes down fast enough (cut off time due to planning and preparation needed would be before Thanksgiving), there may be time to turn the celebration into a Christmas Party.

            Am I understanding this correctly that it's a CIVIL suit, and not a CRIMINAL suit? As in, if it's not thrown out of court, the defendants can simply and quietly settle out of court for an undisclosed sum of money and not do any jail time at all?

               That's a good question.  It could be someone pretending to be him.  Ackers though does seem to be a documentary filmmaker or has aspirations to be one.  His Facebook account has similar posts where he is trying to contact others and asking to collaborate on films.  If you google his yahoo email address you will see other examples where he does the same. Public records of his address, which is also stated on the court documents, tie in with his Facebook account.  So the Twitter account profile does tie in with the other bits and pieces that we know about him. However, there is no verification that the Twitter account is definitely him. I did not want to post a link to any other social media accounts because I think people can go find that if they want and I personally find that quite intrusive.  FB, for example, shows links to other accounts.  Twitter is less intrusive (imo).

             Your threads get marked as disinfo because you're a known shill. The author of a thread being a shill is one of the criteria for getting a disinfo tag.

             You still run away everytime you're pressed on those audit differences Dark Math kept grilling you about.
            </p>
            <p>
             You still dodge the question as to why you feel the need to have 3+ accounts. If you were an honest user, that many accounts would not be nessecary. Further evidence you're a shill, and thus a terrible person.

             You still refuse to answer when pressed about the Clinton Foundation's financial connections to the "White Phosphorous Incident".

               Once again, one of your many posts that only have a bunch of all caps, insults, and/or hateful rhetoric. The hallmarks of someone with very low intelligence. Possibly a micropenis too. Nothing of actual value was said.
              </p>
              <p>
               So many extra accounts. An honest user has no reason to have so many. You wouldn't get downvoated so much if you weren't such an egotistical, hateful, misogyonistic asshole.
              </p>
              <p>
               I loled when you were so stupid you created a topic dedicated just to roasting me. You lost one of your accounts because of that. They say that narcacists get the most butt hurt when the truth about them gets exposed, so they lash out when they see it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Birds of a feather flock together in your case. Now that you're defending a known shill yet again, we know your true colors. Whose side you're truly on. Its not us. GTFO shill.

                 Once again you prove me right. Broken record with your usual posts with only all caps, insults, and/or hateful rhetoric.

                 I already explained why you keep getting downvoated. If you weren't an egotistical, misogynistic, hateful asshole, you wouldn't get brigaded by honest users sick of your shit. Also, you're a shill who constantly posts false flag baiting posts designed to get us discredited.

                  Does it not give you pause to note that your brain interprets THE MERE MENTION OF JEWS as potentially hateful or violent.  You silly hysterical brainwashed white-knighting faggot.

            Justice will be sweet. Too many of us have been ridiculed for pushing forth this information to the public.  My family is included in that bunch.  Good vs. evil and we, the white hats, have risen up to win. Thx, for posting this! Upvoat ten times over!

            The fact that Gregory Ackers has gone public against government corruption is what I call a battle cry.
A hell of a lot more value to Humanity than my contribution to point out the obvious.
Most important to me is Gregory's the only one who has the balls to go against Podesda, worth the price of my dignity.

             Without jury huh? Not sure if that's a good thing. Closed doors and no "normal citizens" to witness evidence and bring down true justice. Although, I guess they could use fake jurors just as easily.

               It's simply not an indictment and it doesn't appear she understands that.  That's why I said it was disinfo.

                Not disinfo, it's a civil complaint implementing RICO, with given enough evidence, could move to a criminal indictment after discovery, that's pretty clear. Thanks for your thoughts though and I understand the confusion

                 It's the difference between I have a powerball ticket and I have 700 million dollars.  This is still a completely DISINFO post, because you giving false hope because you are misinformed about the significance of what you are posting.  Nothing at all changed in the pizzagate case from the filing of these documents.  When I buy a Powerball ticket nothing changes in my life except I no longer have $2.  I wish and I hope it will win me 700 million dollars, but I don't actually have 700 million dollars.

                 You've been corrected and you updated your post, but so much of it is still flat out wrong that you are still unintentionally deceiving the people in this thread.   As a mod you should take some responsibility for that.

                   You may have your hopes up, but this lawsuit will get tossed.  I'm the local skeptic around here, but I post facts.

                   A civil suit has not been granted in this case.  You need to read that document and Google what you don't understand.  It doesn't say what you claim it says.  It just says he doesn't have to pay the filing fee.  That's it.  It doesn't say this going to trial.  The next step is to determine if this is a frivolous or malicious lawsuit.  Not trial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Anyone, including anyone on this board could have filed this lawsuit.

                  <p>
                   There's nothing special about Gregory Ackers filing it.  It's just a civil filing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They would all have the same result.  Lawsuit deemed frivolous and  dismissed and or dismissed for lack of standing- the actions didn't harm the plantiff therefore he is not entitled to sue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   All of Darkknight's comments are irrelevant in this case.  There will be no indictment, no criminal case, no civil trial, no civil discovery.

                An indictment is found and presented by a Grand Jury legally convened and sworn. It originates with a prosecutor and is issued by the grand jury against an individual who is charged with a crime. Before such individual may be convicted, the charge must be proved at trial Beyond a Reasonable Doubt.
               </p>
               <p>
                The purpose of an indictment is to inform an accused individual of the charge against him or her so that the person will be able to prepare a defense.

             Sorry for the delayed response, but this is extremely important.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul Nehlen isn't draining any swamp. He had a great opportunity to expose the real Evil in Racine and Wisconsin, and tried riding Trump's coattails to a landslide defeat. We do believe that his election may have been rigged to be an absolute blowout to boost Paul Ryan's stature as he worked against Trump, but Paul Nehlen was too conservative and unwilling to say what needed to be said. Everyone knows that corruption is everywhere these days. We gave Paul Nehlen specific information to expose the real levels of corruption in Racine and Wisconsin, and he didn't follow through with any of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul Nehlen is a political poser, or an ignorant follower looking to make a name for himself without really shaking up the system. His campaign staff claims that he is aware of the real "root" of Evil in Racine, yet he never once mentioned the racketeering networks, the corrupt foundations involved, the corrupt corporations involved, the corrupt politicians involved, the corrupt churches and non-profits involved, the corrupt clubs and secret societies involved, or any specific cases in Racine or Wisconsin. Everything was surface level and vague, much like Donald Trump has been, but even Donald did not endorse his biggest political follower, Paul Nehlen.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Paul Nehlen finally names ANYONE involved, we will support him, whether that is the actual secret societies involved such as the Pilgrims Society or the Knights of Pythias, or the corporations involved such as SC Johnson, Cargill, Dow, DuPont and CNH, or the foundations involved such as Johnson Foundation or Racine Community Foundation, or even the Rotary groups involved in extreme racketeering and corruption. Anyone can repeat the old familiar names of the Clinton Foundation, DNC, John McCain, and DynCorp, but he is either controlled or too afraid to name the real power players involved at the global level and how that ties back to the model and "root" of the entire network in Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at what Paul Nehlen has exposed before and since his failed election - nothing. We know the real Truth and the real Agenda, and how it links to Racine, Wisconsin. Paul Nehlen must not be paying attention, is controlled opposition, is ignorant, or lacks the courage and conviction to name names.
            </p>
            <p>
             We met with the FBI. We met with the DOJ. We went to local and state authorities. We went to Nehlen. We went to InfoWars. We went to Breitbart. We went to Vox. We went to other Wisconsin and national news outlets. We went to Sanders. We went to Trump. We did this long before the general election and before Pizzagate ever began. We have continued private investigations, discovering more connections daily. There will never be justice until the world stands up and knows the real Truth about Racine, Wisconsin - the model for Global Enslavement through Sustainability and the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI and Community Policing.
            </p>
            <p>
             NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN DRAINING ANY SWAMP, RESTORING LAW &amp; ORDER, OR EXPOSING THE ROOT OF THE ENTIRE NETWORK.

             Local conservative talk radio came out hard against him. As they did against Trump until he secured the nomination. Talk radio painted him as a "Johnny come lately" that may have been less than truthful about his small business experience and success, which he was touting.

             He's a serial filer of ridiculous lawsuits. If you look up his lawsuits from this link:
            </p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             You will find a bunch of complaints filed against various entities where he's looking to get rich. That's all. He tried to sue Yahoo for "in excess of $75,000."
            </p>
            <p>
             I am all about seeing these people go down, but unlike this guy, none of us here are looking to get rich off of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you look into all of his lawsuits filed, he is granted a waiver of fees in every case (in order to be granted this waiver a person has to file paperwork with their financial breakdown proving they can't afford the filing fees) and then every case is dismissed. This one will be dismissed as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing against op, It's an honest mistake, but this isn't a smoking gun or anything exciting. Just a crazy guy looking to make a buck by suing the world when he's unhappy.

             I think we need some background information on this guy.  The court threw out his case against the Moonlight Bunny Ranch.  I don't have access to the court documents so I can't see the details of any of the cases.  An awful lot of litigation though.  Hmm..

               You can see through my deflection?  As I said I can't see the court documents (and

               </a>
               )... I dig deep when it comes to research.  Sorry if you don't like that but I am tired of being tricked so I question.  I'm hoping just as much as you that this actually means something but because I have more than 2 brain cells between my ears I don't rely on hope only and examine any story that I come across.

              thank you. I can't wait for these LGBTI loving democrat perverts to go to where they belong. Jail... but my main target now is of course this OTO pedo ring I am investigating in Oregon. Their social media is making me sick. I need to go for walks outside to stay sane.

            Is this the same Gregory Ackers who made some kind of complaint against Dennis Hof and the Moonlite Bunny Ranch back in 2015?

            I have been waiting for justice since this story broke last year, it has been a roller coaster ride since then, my thought is, when justice does come to these monsters will it be a few months in a fancy prison for the elite, or will it be true justice like the common man would receive!....I have read were Hillary has been offered a plea deal by the DOJ.....there is no place for plea deals in this, especially for those in high places of government, business, banking, etc.....all elite scum need to be thrown in the deepest hole never to be heard from again.
