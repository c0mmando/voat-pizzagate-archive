            The other thing to look into is the correlation between heroin/opiate overdoses and organ transplantation increases.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/health/opioid-overdose-organ-donation/index.html">
             https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/10/health/opioid-overdose-organ-donation/index.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In fact, Klassen noted that people who died of overdoses are usually good candidates for organ donation. "They tend to be younger and tend not to have the burdens of diseases associated with aging," he said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Heroin/opiate overdose lets the doctor call the patient in a "brain-dead"  coma and harvest organs while the patients heart is still beating. So the medical industry is benefitting from the addicts, then harvesting their organs when they OD
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue now, is organ donation is split into regions in the US, so areas with the heroin epidemic (like new england) have tons of available organs, while others have shortages. They are attempting to change the laws so it's a national registry so organs can help those closest to death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus states like NY are changing laws to allow younger and younger teens to become organ donors.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            They elite want younger organs by any means possible.

            </p>
            <p>
             So if there is to be a war on opiates, there will be less organs available no ???
            </p>
            <p>
             btw giving away my age, I know a few too many vets on opiates who are addicts and selling
there drugs.  They should be cut off.

            Microfinance exploits poor people who, when they can't repay the debt, are often forced to sell their organs. Transplant hospitals in Bangladesh increased five-fold in a few years because of the lucrative trade in body parts.

            Then on July 17th, 2017 Elizabeth Beck made a disturbing appearance on InfoWars. Water-filters aside, she looked genuinely terrified about what she uncovered. At 8:53 when Owen says “organ transplant” and again at 9:20 when Owen says “black market organ transplants” her eyes bug out, way out. This is the only time she displays that body language during the interview. Perhaps she is communicating that “yes, this is what is happening, but if I use those words I will be killed”. Here is the interview and a transcript I cleaned up:
           </p>
           <p>
            Federal prosecutor Beranton Whisenant Jr. found dead on beach.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) There is a Jacksonville -&gt; Mayo Clinic connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mayo Clinic has a hospital in Jacksonville Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) There’s a Mayo Clinic -&gt; Judge Harvey E. Schlesinger connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lawsuit was filed in 2015 in Federal Court in Jacksonville against the Mayo Clinic in connection with an organ transplant case.
           </p>
           <p>
            The judge presiding over that case was the Honorable Harvey E. Schlesinger.
           </p>
           <p>
            CASE NUMBER: 3:15-cv-01244
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Whisenant’s body was recovered on May 24th, 2017. On June 8th, 2017 Judge Harvey E. Schlesinger threw out the case against Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville on Summary Judgement.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) There is a Mayo Clinic -&gt; Clinton Foundation connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            A number of hospitals, including Mayo Clinic and St. Vincents co-sponsored a launch event in Northeast Florida in connection with the Clinton Health Matters Initiative.
           </p>
           <p>
            6) There is a Mayo Clinic -&gt; High Government Officials connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            The numerous public trustees of the Mayo Clinic include a Thomas J. Brokaw, (possibly Tom Brokaw) Barbara P. Bush, Richard B Cheney (possibly Dick Cheney) Senator Thomas Daschle and Paul Volcker.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Mayo Clinic provides a full range of health services including organ transplants, bone marrow transplants, blood transfusions and genetic medicine.
           </p>
           <p>
            7) There is a Clinton Foundation -&gt; Haiti connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            8) There is a Klause Eberwein -&gt; Haiti connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Klause Eberwein, a former Haitian government official was found dead July 11th of this year with a gunshot wound to the head. He was found at 14501 South Dixie Highway; a Quality Inn.
           </p>
           <p>
            9) There is a Peter Smith -&gt; Mayo Clinic connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            This keeps going.  This is Bad News for Mayo.
