<p>Daily Wire Article:</p>
<p>Earlier this week, former child star Corey Feldman vowed to expose Hollywood\'s alleged pedophile network when he announced his TRUTH campaign to attempt to produce a documentary about what he experienced as a child — Feldman and his friend Corey Haim allege that they had become familiar with this ring of pedophilia in their youths.</p>
<p>During his announcement, Feldman stated that one of his abusers remains a powerful player in Hollywood up to this very day and that he could name at least six names off the top of his head, all of whom have routinely participated in this culture of sexual predation of children. On top of that, Feldman also expressed deep fear that those in power could bring about his eventual death in light of his revelations.
Many have since been asking why Feldman just does not outright name his accusers and be done with it. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations in California makes that difficult,</p>
<p>&quot;I\'d love to be the first to do it,&quot; Feldman said in an interview back in 2016. &quot;But unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening. Because if I were to go and mention anybody\'s name, I would be the one that would be in legal problems and I\'m the one that would be sued.&quot;</p>
<p>What about when the statute of limitations was not in play? Did Corey Feldman name his abusers then? Shockingly, recent evidence shows that in 1993, when Corey Feldman was just 22, the child actor did indeed tell police the names of his sexual abusers . . . and they did nothing.</p>
<p>In 2013, when Corey Feldman began speaking out about Hollywood pedophilia in his book, Choreography, Radar Online uncovered a secret police recording from 1993 in which Feldman stated he had been molested as a child in Hollywood and even named those who did it. For legal reasons, the recording had the names edited out; Feldman identifies them in his memoir as &quot;Ron,&quot; &quot;Tony,&quot; &quot;Burnham&quot; and &quot;Crimson&quot; — all pseudonyms.</p>

            I bought Coreyography a few weeks ago but didn't pick it up until this past weekend and oh man, what a story. I read the entire book straight through and while I had always liked Corey, my respect for him is now through the roof. What he has gone through (and still going through) would be too much for most.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's interesting with his use of pseudonyms because while he does use them, he also divulges pretty specific things like "I met so-and-so on the set of ((this movie)) and even ended up getting him a small cameo in the film" or "At the time, I was filming ((this)) and had been spending a lot of time with celebrity A and celebrity B so we ended up becoming a kind-of foursome (+ the pseudoym) that would often be seen together on the party circuit that summer".
           </p>
           <p>
            Like he's almost giving away all the details to figure out the names without actually naming names in the book...

             I think we could read that and figure out who it is by investigating all there is to know about who was in the films and who was on set. Make a graph of "possibles."

            I want him to name names now but that's not fair. I need to realize he already did name names and no one protected him. That's why I donated to his indiegogo. If he's going to put himself out there he's taking a huge risk and I'd like to help keep him and his family safe. Id like to start some type of whistleblowers protection fund.
I'm not sure where Corey stands but if he's talking about what we're talking about and can further our cause? Yeah, I want to support that.

             I can name names for you. Contact me by PM as another online website of Anonymous industry insiders makes the answer extremely clear with specific names.

             However the simpler answer would be, "Who DIDN'T molest children?"  Pedo rings and swing parties, especially after Satanic rituals, are the norm.

             I did too. I donated a few times. Donated once and thought it wasn't enough. Donated again, and then read this and was like... he needs more.
