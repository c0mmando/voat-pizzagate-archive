            It's all smoke and mirrors.  You never know who is playing whom for what motive.  Actions speak louder than words.

Many of the top so called Hollywood heart throbs like Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp began as rentboys and were passed around the homosexual elites before rising up the celebrity ladder. Guys such as Depp and John Cusack's connection to Hunter S. Thompson is also suspicious, who I believe was into all kind of dark shit. This stuff goes very deep and ultra dark as it connects with child disappearances, human sacrifice, child pornography and snuff films. All this before you even get into their occult beliefs and magic rituals. This involves almost all the a list people. You simply cannot rise above a certain level of fame and fortune without being involved in some form or other. Their network is worldwide and comprises of smaller interconnected cells, so if one cell falls, the majority is protected. This has recently been seen with Jimmy Savile and one of his cells. Savile was a pedophile, necrophiliac, possible serial killer and a procurer of children for the elites. There are many more like him still around.﻿

             You know, I never received this ping.  I have been suspicious about this.  Others as well have not.  And others have told me they did not receive mine.  There was someone that possibly connected what Paddock connection and Paradise was and we were discussing it.  The comments remain in the post, but I checked and they did not appear in her comment history.  I wonder if they are deleting or just not allowing them to appear.  Amazing.  It is an amazing piece of work and everyone should look at it.  I think she cracked the code.

            Agreed. I think RDJ and his reputed 3 -4 buds, all children of Hollywood and obviously still "in the know" really deserve a LOT more credit than Corey Feldman for getting many, many, many people in and out of the industry talking about Pedogate. It was clearly meant as a warning sign to some that they'd better watch their extreme behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one was going to mess with RDJ's renewed top money making career. Plus he's married to the daughter of a studio mogul, power player. Of course RDJ could always say his name was used without his 100% full permission.

            Also that anything originally printed on CDAN could obviously be laughed off as a joke. The site has been outed by no less than the NY Times for made up Blinds. Believe me, that's really a cover for those that want to leak the truth but still don't want to be held legally responsible for the info getting exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            You see Corey Feldman has been milking the fact he will name the important names for way, way too long. As everyone in the industry knows, twinks who continually get movie roles their looks and talent don't always fully merit almost always have become "pass around bottoms." Which means that it's easier to name the 100% NOT guilty parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            After all we haven't talked about the gay and bi media biggies around the world who just might be willing to write a far more favorable story about the new twink being overly promoted. Or their so-so reviewed movie.

                People that live in OK.   should leave flyers in places for people to get out of town.  They were hiring crisis actors through Nov. 2nd.  Hmm.  Wonder what for.  I am scared for them and very sad.

                  I don't but I think it was in a post in pizzagatewhatever.  If I come across it, I will send.  I think it had something to do with the Nov. 4th suspected attack.  Which I hope does not happen.  I just was going to post this in whatever but I will put it in the comments here as well.  There is also a horrible Cholera Epidemic in Yemen.  They are afraid so I believe they are rushing things.  Hurricane Philippe will also hit Cuba and the Bahamas.

           <pre><code>Sorry pals, there is absolutely NO WAY any of this has to do with Rob Reiner. I worked for him for many years and he is a total stand up dude. His wife is awesome and although he's not a genius like his Dad, Carl, there is no chance on earth that Rob would be involved in something like this, he is one of the good guys. I really hope this post can put to bed rumors about him - xo, Covgal

             I don't know who Sandy Gallin is, but if I had to name one it would be Charlie Sheen.  I remember his ex-wife claiming he had CP on his laptop.  After that it was all hush hush.   2 and a half men was and still is a filthy show and when Sheen left Kutcher took over.  What a pair.

                 I don't go to movies nowadays at all.  I will never go so a new movie with a child in it anymore.  Never.  The should be boycotted until the abuse stops.

                  It makes me so angry that the women in Hollywood never want to discuss the abuse of kids. Hopefully it will change soon. I feel the same whenever i see a kid in a movie, new or old. Always wonder if it has happened to that child.

                   I KNOW.  I  also think about whether the big star in the movie is using that poor child.  I am waiting for the House of Disney to fall.  Think of all the movies.  There was Bobbie Driscoll who named Disney as his abuser years ago. He was in Song of the South and the voice of Peter Pan.  When the child gets too old, they are thrown under the bus and no more jobs.  That's what happened to Bobby.  On to the next one.  There was a Carousel of Children for their Taking.  Oh God, this must come out.  They were are still are so very evil.

                     Annette Funicello had MS later on.  I wonder if it can be caused by being sodomized over and over.  I have heard it may cause Parkinsons. There was an adult named Jimmy on there.  And another one too.  Wondering about them now.  Also Tim Considine came from there from a little piece they called Spin and Marty.  Tim was later chosen for a show called My Three Sons with Fred McMurray and William Frawley.  Oh boy. Boys and older men. Not a good combo.

                      I remember that about Annette having MS. She was made into a wholesome sex symbol for them in their movies.  Have no idea about the cause of her MS. My Three Sons with two older men on the show, of course all teenage sons.

                       I just remembered Don Grady and the other younger kid Ernie (he was Jerry Mathers brother I believe of Leave It To Beaver)..  I bet Jerry has some stories.  He and Tony Dow pretty much left the industry.  But as I have said before Bobby Driscoll who was abused by Walt Disney said after he got older Walt threw him aside.  No more jobs.

                   Understand that the vast majority of women in Hollywood have been abused themselves. Now they use drugs/alcohol/shopping/etc to deal with it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I've had women witness a friend of theirs grab me inappropriately while stuck riding in their car. They laugh it all off. Or tell the jerk to stop which of course he ignores. They don't work in entertainment either. It's always been a "Boys will be Boys" attitude, so, "suck it up."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Same goes when a woman who's been raised in a home with a physically abusive father hears about or sees another woman getting hit. Do you think they would EVER call the police? No. They don't want to "get involved" even when they could report the abuse anonymously.
                  </p>

                   I've spoken up whenever I can.

               Geffen?  All of a sudden Sandy becomes much more important to me.  Geffen  &amp;  R Kelley are tied too.  I think Geffen was married to Carol King many moons ago.

                 Michael Jackson
                </strong>
                ...also before he died earlier this year, Sandy's biggest client was
                <strong>
                 Andy Cohen
                </strong>
                . Hmmm. wonder what poor Andy has had to deal with over the years.

                is the alleged 'Hollywood Mogul' that repeatedly comes up in conversations about Hollywood's biggest pedo. See my other post. There was a blind item yesterday about someone who fits his description having spent the last two weeks issuing death threats around Hollywood to anyone who has recordings of him.
Hmmm.

                   Yes, PIE, the organizer wants to lower the age of consent to 4.  Yes, I said 4.  The Royals are Knighting people but not for the reason we think, I believe it is a payoff of sorts.  Yes, I agree , the certainly are demons.

                   Yeah, they think we don't know what they are doing.  If the masses ever find out what they have all been up to, as Bush said, They will lynch us in the streets (or words to that effect0.

                    Unfortunately, too many do not want to believe such evil could be possible. We need to come up with ways to red-pill the masses. I have suggested before that we really need a subverse soley devoted to just that ...ways to get the word out to the masses (esp those who only rely on the MSM for info). Even though some stuff (Weinstein, Feldman)  is starting to be covered ...I do not see the MSM ever covering the depth of this horror story. I would guess, at most, the MSM will sacrifice a few well known names, pat themselves on the back, and be done with the subject. And the pedos will continue.
