            Forgive me for erring to the side of highly suspicious when federal agencies are involved with the 'care' and 'protection' of children. Silsby is not connected, you're correct, but she is walking free after being caught smuggling children out of Haiti for the Clinton Foundation and the Federal Government seems just fine and dandy with that. We also know CPS is rife with corruption and unspeakable treatment of children. Children taken from their parents by court order and many times when parents violated the orders and attempted to get their children back, the Amber Alert system was used as a drag net. I think a top to bottom review of every Federal agency regarding children is long past due.

            You seem very vested in your claim. I expect that you will continue to write walls and walls of words about it. Good work so far.

            You begin by setting yourself up as the One True Expert, and perhaps you are. But then you never go on to address the point that I raise, which is that the NCMEC, whether run by well meaning people who sometimes do good, could be (intentionally or not) supplying criminals with information they can use to be better criminals.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would think an expert would understand how to address such a reasonable thought experiment in some way other than appeal to authority.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look, I hope you're right, but you should understand that there will be investigation, regardless. Too much has been hidden in the past. As an investigator, don't you understand that?

            "Those YouTube videos about "a mysterious and alarming number of missing children in the DC area" are complete horsecrap."
           </p>
           <p>
            They are no more horsecrap than all your playing around with numbers was horsecrap on the way to learning math. They very simply explanation that they indicated a "clearly immense simple distinction between Virginia and all other states regarding missing children," turned out to be (apparently) incorrect.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesn't mean there is nothing to learn from the data, as I've alluded to with additional thought experiments.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the meantime, you might better question why all this research must be done publicly, which is problematic because it means that an organization that might be purely innocent and beneficial in nature is subjected publicly to experiments and speculation. Why is that? It's because after decades of known pedophile rings being mostly covered up time and again (in order to protect powerful people), the public now has the motivation and tools to conduct the investigations that our government refuses to conduct.

            RealityCalls has done a nice service on one piece of this investigation, but that is in no way definitive of the sources of data, which are still obfuscated or unrevealed in important ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Then to make matters worse, instead of acknowledging and apologizing...RealyCalls went to far as to accuse the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of being incompetent for failing to conform to their stated falsehoods."
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not what it sounded like to me. It sounded like she acknowledges that a step in the investigation that she undertook with her stats contact yielded information that shifted the relevant set of hypotheses. And that's...reasonable.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no point in being angry that the world has not yet conformed to your claimed omnipotence. Just explain your position as best you can and keep thinking about the problem.

            This is what is known as a "prior", which is an assumption underlying a belief system. Unless you run this agency, you don't know its intentions just like you don't know any other human's intentions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not stating that I know their intentions. I'm stating a hypothesis for the purpose of testing that hypothesis with other information to determine its consistency. This is an ordinary and reasonable thought experiment.

            Um, no. Experiments aren't about proof. Experiments are about establishing consistency between hypotheses and observations.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, I know a lot more about this than I'm being up front about for a variety of reasons that I don't care to share with you. If I shared it straight out, it wouldn't be as valuable and convincing than if I walked people through thought experiments and allowed discussion of judgment of the details.

            Well, as far as I am aware the NCMEC only have figures on missing children that they ADVERTISE.  And there is an annual figure of 800,000 missing children from Reuters
            <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missing-children-idUSBRE83P14020120426">

            . If you can clarify the situation that would be most appreciated because from my various conversations with individuals and agencies the situation is not clear - at least, as far as the public is concerned.

            John 'the untouchable' Walsh is conspicuous by his absence through all this. He's a total fraud. It doesn't take much digging in the rabbit hole to find that his son Adam's alleged kidnapping and beheading was nothing but a fake staged event that has made him a multi-millionaire.

            Here is a quick thought on credibility: when I watched the video about Virginia kids being reported missing more (and the subsequent video explaining that VA might simply be the only state reporting well), I did the math and noted that the total numbers of children missing would still only be a few thousand if all states reported as well as VA does. But...500,000ish kids go missing every year. These numbers are so disparate that there is
            <em>
             something
            </em>
            that doesn't make sense. These numbers are not close to justified.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, it may be that the answer is simply 490,000 kids are found quickly out of those 500,000, but having watched the video reports from the 80s about how there are hundreds of young boys living on the streets in just a half square mile in Houston, turning tricks, I doubt it.

             Apparently it's the NCIC that compile data on missing children. Only accessible to FBI, law enforcment and researchers.  The NCMEC numbers are simply the advertisements they have for missing children and is nothing to do with data compilation. How this works on a state by state basis is anybody's guess.

              Okay, then, if the NCMEC is an advertising group for missing children, then here is a composite thought to the big picture: it seems that maybe nonprofits around the world have been providing the Clinton Foundation with data. For instance, there was a Wikileaks email from 2009 describing the specific conditions regarding child trafficking in Haiti, which might as well be intelligence if your doing something like what George Webb suggests and creating brothels for miners or even just shipping kids without ID cards out to other countries.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, could the NCMEC be a vehicle for data for pedophile networks? And could this be the real reason VA might have been coaxed into encouraging its officers to start following through with the reporting?
             </p>
             <p>
              It makes a sick kind of sense. If there are pedophile "child hunters" (Buck's
              <em>
               Hunting
              </em>
              ...) who scope out train stations and other kinds of places where children might find refuge and travel having not formed a good plan for where to go next, does this give them...photo ID of the kids?
             </p>
             <p>
              I know one adult who ran away from home and was scooped up by a predator in California when she was 14. What she has told me about her ordeal sounds a lot like pizzagate experiences, including his acting like a handler with brainwashing by trauma. She told me that her handler scooped her up at a train or bus station.

               Yes, in terms of the NCMEC, I have come to this conclusion as well and written about that elsewhere on this board.  Briefly, Innocents at Risk is a Washington based non profit, Izette Folger who works there, is a great friend of James Alefantis and her comments can be seen on his inappropriate Instagram postings.  This organisation trains airline crew NOT to interfere or intervene with passengers they suspect of trafficking children. Instead they are directed to a trafficking hotline, which then passes it on to Polaris which works with the Clinton Foundation.  Can you believe this ?

                , can you link me to where you wrote this on voat? I am keeping my own information set and this adds to a specific thread of my research. Hopefully it will either help me see the bigger picture more clearly or be a conduit to a further lead.

             Numbers are so deceiving because they are always manipulated.  Look this website and the upvoat/downvote manipulation, look at YouTube and the lying numbers.  Look at hillarys pole numbers....all lies.

              The extent of the corruption is truly shocking.  I was thinking today that it is only a citizen-based open source investigation and pressure from the grassroots that can begin to attempt any change.  It's no wonder that data is being made available to us.  If you work for any of the agencies or corporations or within government it is not possible to do anything.  The rot has travelled too deep.

              I've noticed that they through out the odd amber alert to keep us imagining that they are doing something.  What about the hundreds of thousands that go missing.  Where are their amber alerts?  Everything is subject to corruption because people just love money.

            It's so insidious, isn't it ? These government entities are spending tax dollars on doing the exact opposite of what they claim. They are profiting again on the backside with payoffs for child trafficking,  child porn, organ harvesting, slavery..

               Thank you for this.  I am going to look further into this later.  I have to get on with a few things as Christmas draws near and my life has been put on hold with all this.

               I am very concerned with the entire child tracking system.  If you note, in the mainstream press, whenever this issue is addressed there is a focus on the expanding problem of increased child trafficking numbers, missing children, etc. but not with the obvious weaknesses within the tracking systems themselves.  And new pop up organisations every day feeding into what appears to be a lucrative system.  Yet when one scrutinizes the figures, it is clear that statewide, it is impossible to get accurate information, in terms of the missing children numbers.  There is no transparency or consistency in the way individual states record this information.  I have found that the tracking of missing and exploited children is being run through private corporations.  The whole thing is a mess and the mainstream reporting refuses to look or investigate.  The problem is huge and not even necessarily hidden, just convoluted.  As a society we should really be ashamed. Later.
