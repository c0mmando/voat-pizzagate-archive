<p>For some reason, he has never gone to jail for this felony nor seems to have suffered any negative consequences. On the contrary, his popularity has exploded ever since this charge first appeared. Might some powerful friends in the music industry see a useful tool for pedo normalization?</p>
<p>Let\'s look at his &quot;art&quot;.</p>
<p>In the hypermasculine world of hip hip, a rapper who decks himself out in Rainbow gay pride colors is completely unheard of. He also wears a pendant on his necklage with the Jigsaw character from Saw movies, classic &quot;pedo spiral&quot; on both cheeks. With his rainbow hair and rainbow fanged &quot;grill&quot; his overall presence is one of a gay, demonic pied piper.</p>

<p>Let\'s talk about his music videos. In the following videos I believe he is flaunting his pedophilia, none more so blatant than his latest single &quot;Tatti&quot;, but first take a look at his video &quot;Gotti&quot;.</p>
<p>In the music video &quot;Gotti&quot;, we witness the rapper transform into a woman poolside, before the video inexplicably shifts to a setting in what i assume is the dominican republic or haiti (2:10). Here is where it gets dark, and represents what I believe to be the child sex tourism industry...we see 6ix9ine meet with a procurer of some sort, then proceed to wander around the village giving money primarily to small children, with accompanying adults looking very sad/reluctant. Very disturbing given this man\'s background and what we know of the seedy underside of Caribbean countries. Please note the age range of the children he is giving money to! I believe this is relevant in our next video.</p>
<p>Gotti:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5WrgDzNIZ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5WrgDzNIZ0</a></p>
<p>(at 3:23 there is a prominently featured man chopping up a coconut. Given the way it is done and the odd placement of such a scene, it may represent pineal gland/adrenochrome extraction from a human skull. But this is much more speculative.)</p>
<p>In his latest video &quot;Tati&quot;, i believe he has lost all fear of being held to account and is blatantly advertising his pedophilia.
At 0:25 he climbs out of a dark tinted vehicle cradling a child with disheveled clothing in his lap. The age is the same age of the children he was giving money to in \'Gotti\'. As those who have studied pedophilia know, there is often a very specific age preference for these monsters and for mr. 6ix9ine it seems to be the ages of 4-6. At 0:30 right after emerging from the vehicle with this sex crimes felon the same young child appears with a shiny substance smeared all over his lips. Can it be any more blatant what was meant to be conveyed? Throughout the rest of the song (example 1:29) he is seen carrying a small child in this same age range in his arms or on his lap. Notice he also rarely is close to the adult female dancers in the videos that normal rappers would focus on.</p>
<p>Tati:

<p>To summarize, we have a rapper who has confessed in court to pedophilic felony charges avoid any meaningful legal or professional consequences and flaunt his affinity for small children in heavily promoted music videos. Next steps should be to research who is backing him - he says that he signed his life away to &quot;the illuminati&quot;: <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-signs-record-deal/">http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-signs-record-deal/</a>
I believe he may have ties to Virgin Records.</p>

            Just a comment that "coconut" is a derogatory term for Caribbean Islanders used primarily by African Americans, so symbolism of man chopping a coconut may be a double entendre.

            solely with regards to the 'gotti' video, as freakish as the young dude looks, after watchin 3 1/2 mins of the video the extended part with him giving out $ looked exactly like some freak (tho dressed sorta normal for him) giving out $ to random kids and adults in some random impoverished tropical area   (difficult with that autotune but it also sounded like he was rapping/sining bout giving $ to his people, prayin that they eat etc).  maybe i missed something but no i didn't see a 'procuring angle' nor scared parents.  the older lady he first encounters does seem reluctant in general but that's it as far as i saw.   not doubting that this freak isn't wrapped up in some sick top-down agenda  by the controllers of the music industry, just don't see this particular video as being all that revealing

            Sex with a 17yo? Disgusting! Against nature. Hang him high! Where are we, that moral eroded so badly. I vote for an age of consent of 30 years. Nah, let’s say 40 years and ONLY with lights off. No fun allowed. No orgasm. Only after marriage. And only, if it cannot be avoided under any circumstance.

            It's a commercial, or two. When are people going to understand that decorative professionals are not just "decorative professionals". The most celebrated pop stars are simply the most exquisite and expensive sex workers, or providers of other services... or, other's services.

            "Pled GUILTY to the Felony use of a child in a sexual performance"  he should not be around childen,  and he clearly is. Never went to prison? Must be intelligence agency created/owned asset pushing a degenerate message,  is my thoughts.

            @ OP Do you think that another one of his songs, called "Gummo" is related (or similar to a "head nod") to the movie of the same name? The short synopsis from a quick Google search shows that two sisters escaping a pedo is a part of the plot.

              Very interesting, it seems these two may be cut from the same cloth. Thanks for the reply, I'm relatively new here, so I appreciate you taking the time to point me in the right direction.

            Time to Take Down the Pedo Rappers.  This is the Second One on here.  He is Vermin Rapping.  The words to the other post were awful just plain awful.  This guy has needs to be locked up NOW.  The Music Industry should be charged for signing him up.   It seems to me, there are more of these every day and possibly this is their plan.  Spreading this filth to our kids.  #Stop the Pedo Filth

                Hmm.  Yes, there are those that just won't listen.  Glad to hear you are running out.  I think it depends where you live.  Also younger people like teens are much more receptive and with open minds.

                 I still have to work with the little ones. I don't know how much of the white guilt they are pushing down hereat school.  They are 100% pushing the LGBTQQBBQ agenda here and it was sick.  They changed my little niece from her Christian views (gays appalled her).  The last 2 years they have changed her.  I am wont to think internet/yt/social media unholy trinity is part of the cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I hope they send them home with a history book so I can see the revisionism.

                 My brothers aren't even 20 years older than me and there were glaring differences between the texts. They are rewriting the story of our founding fathers and our revolutions.

                 They teach Krystallnacht as a surprise attack and include exactly zero reasons to the precursor events.  Oh no, they were attacked for no reason!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I could go on, I've been calling out teachers bullshit since first grade and was lucky enough to have a father that made sure I didn't buy into it.  We missed the chance at a better life when they deposed Hitler.

                  Keep up the good work.  You are lucky to have had a father that made you question things and not accept whatever came out of the Boob Tube.  I hate to burst your bubble about a text book, because they are getting away from those.  I keep wanting to buy up old text books and hand them out, but the best laid plans never seem to happen.  I wish I would have saved mine. If people find them they should buy them and share them.  I am sure that their will be many mouths dropping open when they find out the truth.  Yes, they are brainwashing the future. Our Children.

            Great Article Rap is glorification of evil just like all other forms of "music". Literally the NWO runs the "industry" they recruit the worst types and shekel it out there for propaganda.

            BIRDMAN signed him for 15 mil.  Birdman groomed Lil Wayne from infancy to be a rapper and forced him into sexual acts from the time he was a child.  Hip Hop is compromised by israeli freemason Leor Cohen and is an ironic monopoly of Pansexual Eroticism and blatant advertising for guns and opiods.
