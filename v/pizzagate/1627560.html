<p>So here is a breakdown of a few &quot;new&quot; tidbits from Hagmann:</p>
<ol>
<li>There have been intense fights, both verbal and (apparently) physical between the NYPD and FBI regarding if, how, and when to pursue the leads they got from Weiner\'s &quot;laptop.&quot; Comey was caught in the middle of this and this is why he did what he did during the campaign. Trump know about this and this is why he kept Comey on. But now Preet Bharara (US Atty, NY Southern District) feels like now that Trump is in he feels free to move forward with indictments.</li>
<li>
They not only seized a laptop, but other devices, including a desktop, thumb drives, and a modem, which had incriminating info on them.
Good moral people in the Department have made backups of all the info to guard against power player shenanigans.
</li>
<li>At least 30 agencies throughout the country are involved in investigations.</li>
<li>The operating players and principles have a lot of overlap with the anti-Trump, push for Sharia invasions, Black Lives Matter, and the like. So it is all part of the larger globalist agenda.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, not much new in the area of actual crimes or greater details. But the fact that Hagmann is clear about the reality of investigations moving forward with the intention to bring actual prosecutions, and the fact that Jones has gotten independent confirmation of the same, is pretty major.</p>',

            Damn, Although the info and intent is good. I cannot stand how Alex Jones continually interrupts his guests and takes away from their flow by running off on tangents. Very frustrating.
