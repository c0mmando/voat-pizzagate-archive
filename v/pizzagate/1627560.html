<li>
They not only seized a laptop, but other devices, including a desktop, thumb drives, and a modem, which had incriminating info on them.
Good moral people in the Department have made backups of all the info to guard against power player shenanigans.

<li>At least 30 agencies throughout the country are involved in investigations.</li>

<p>Other than that, not much new in the area of actual crimes or greater details.

            Damn, Although the info and intent is good. I cannot stand how Alex Jones continually interrupts his guests and takes away from their flow by running off on tangents. Very frustrating.
