<p><a href="http://archive.is/vLukM">GLSEN founder,</a>   (un)safe schools czar, and Obama appointee Kevin Jennings wrote a book called &quot;Queering Elementary Education&quot; and has chapter titles such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Locating a Place for Gay and Lesbian Themes in Elementary …” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“‘It’s Okay to be Gay’: Interrupting Straight Thinking in the English Classroom.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given his admiration for Harry Hays, using a publisher known to publish books pro-pedophilia and \'fistgate\', I\'m quite certain his intentions weren\'t pure. Besides, that would confuse children about their sexuality. Wouldn\'t a confused child be easier to groom?
Here are some interesting parts from the post;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is frightening: An organization gaining increasing access to thousands of public schools and funded by major corporations–and that has been recently endorsed by federal government officials—defines “oppression” as a sermon that doesn’t align with a homosexual-activist interpretation of the Bible.
Some more...</p>
<p>In GLSEN’s 125-page Tackling LGBT Issues in School booklet (co-sponsored by Connecticut GLSEN and Planned Parenthood chapters), the organization promotes the following resources for educators:</p>
<p>A “Heterosexual Questionnaire” that asks students, among other questions: “If you’ve never slept with a person of the same sex, is it possible that all you need is a good gay or lesbian lover?” This resource is promoted as a way to expose “heterosexism” and “make schools safer places.”</p>
<p>A “Homophobia Scale” lesson for high-school age students. The scale teaches that “acceptance” and “tolerance” are “homophobic” attitudes. But “positive levels of attitudes” are “admiration” and “nurturance.”</p>
<p>In short, GLSEN wants schools to push students beyond tolerance and acceptance into admiration and advocacy for the homosexual activist movement.</p>
<p>GLSEN has come under fire for promoting sexually explicit books, as well as materials that contain derogatory statements toward religious and socially conservative people. Below are just a few of the books that GLSEN has recommended as the “highest quality resources” for students and educators :</p>
<p>Two Moms, The Zark &amp; Me, listed as being age-appropriate for elementary school kids, presents a nightmarish portrayal of a conservative couple basically accosting a child in a park. Even a Publishers Weekly review called it “mean-spirited”: “A boy is taken to the park by his ‘two moms,’ wanders over to the zoo where he …is picked up by Mr. and Mrs. McFink—ultra conservatives who go ballistic over his family’s domestic arrangements . … in all, it’s a mean-spirited, sniping approach to a topic that deserves thoughtful treatment.”
AND</p>
<p>GLSEN also promoted the book Queer 13 as appropriate for kids as young as middle school age. This book is extremely explicit and includes graphic descriptions of a young boy’s sexual interactions with an adult man in a restroom—as well as details of how the boy goes on to have more sexual experiences with strangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently this among other questionable choices of &quot;highest quality resources&quot; is appropriate for those whose minds are still developing. Obama certainly agreed, he placed the guy in charge of Safe Schools. Despite him having no experience with such a thing.
<a href="http://archive.is/ON0AF">George Stephanopoulos</a> defended him. According to Brock run Media Matters and other \'progressive\' outlets, everything against Jennings is false. Harry Hay wasn\'t a pedo enabler! He just thought NAMBLA had a point.
They say there is no evidence of Hay supporting NAMBLA or being a part of it. Well, look at the photos below(and the fact the NAMBLA website seems to like him). </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/mAClK">Photo 1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/N0xH8">Photo 2</a></p>
<p>Frankly, it\'s obvious Jennings was <a href="http://archive.is/gV6qi">aware</a> of Hay\'s support of NAMBLA given this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jennings has spoken positively about Hay and wrote about him in a book titled Becoming Visible, which is a gay history book for teens and college aged adults. In this book, Jennings referenced a biography of Hay (The Trouble with Harry Hay, by Stuart Timmons) which mentioned Hay’s support of NAMBLA but Jennings did not disclose this to his readers. Anyone seeking to learn more would find the reference but then learn that Hay was an advocate of boy lovers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he mentioned a biography that contained the fact Hay was an advocate of pedophilia, he obviously was well aware. </p>
<p>Here is a speech from Harry Hay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point is that I was perfectly capable of handling myself and knowing exactly what I wanted.  But this year I knew that I wanted to find a man to tell me what I wanted to know.  So, at fourteen, you realize, I’m a child molester.  I’m a child, and I’m molesting an adult till I find out what I want to know.  And I found him, and he was shocked. Then he discovered that, rather than being a man, as he suspected that I was from the way I looked—my callouses on my hands, and the way I handled myself, and my clothing—that I was only a fourteen-year-old kid, and if anybody found out about it he’d be in jail for life, or, at least in California twenty-three years in that period.</p>
<p>I’m telling you this story, and I’m saying it tonight, in memory of a man—all I can remember is that his name was Matt. And I send to all of you my love and deep affection for what you offer to the boys, in honor of this boy when he was fourteen, and when he needed to know best of all what only another gay man could show him and tell him.</p>
<p>I also would like to say at this point that it seems to me that in the gay community the people who should be running interference for NAMBLA are the parents and friends of gays.  Because if the parents and friends of gays are truly friends of gays, they would know from their gay kids that the relationship with an older man is precisely what thirteen-, fourteen-, and fifteen-year-old kids need more than anything else in the world.   And they would be welcoming this, and welcoming the opportunity for young gay kids to have the kind of experience that they would need.</p>
<p>So, again, as I said, my offering is not as a member of NAMBLA, but in memory of that fourteen-year-old boy who was handled by Matt so long ago.  And in memorial to Matt, I offer you my love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very disturbing.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/F42zk">http://archive.is/F42zk</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Again, the founder\'s intentions weren\'t pure. This is the same man who told a teenager to &quot;use a condom&quot; next time he had sex with an adult when he was a teacher. For Jennings I\'m sure this falls under the \'experimentation and discovery\' portion of it. </p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://archive.is/vTX8p">http://archive.is/vTX8p</a> On it\'s board of directors, you have many individuals who are seemingly well connected. Take for instance the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rick Gomez, Target[Target made the transgender bathroom rule if I remember correctly, which was unecessary if you ask me. Those who identified as female or male used the bathroom they associated with]</li>
<li>
Kimberly Reed, Big Sky Film Productions inc.</li>
<li>
Michelle Scales, JP Morgan Chase</li>
<li>
Chip Sullivan, NBC Entertainment</li>
<li>
Patrick Moran, ABC Studios</li>
</ul>
<p>Going on their website and clicking on \'National Leadership Council\' and \'National Advisory Council\', you will see even more individuals such as Jonathan Rebell from Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>Well connected with the entertainment industry. And if you go on GLSEN under their partners etc. you\'ll see Disney donated. Kevin Jennings foundation he in now the executive director of(ARCUS Foundation) is partnered with the Podesta\'s Center for American Progress and the Rockefeller\'s.</p>
<p>I\'m sure there is much more to uncover.</p>',
