<p>Toy Freaks YouTube Channel (this has been covered in the past, don\'t know how many of you have seen it, but please report this channel!!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/3uptheyingyang">https://www.youtube.com/user/3uptheyingyang</a></p>
<p>I have children so I encounter a lot of YouTube and I also worry a lot about what is out there in terms of predators. I discovered like some of the other Voat members have also noticed the YouTube channel ToyFreaks. A brief description: a man, who looks absolutely nothing like the 3 children in the videos (who also do not look like actual siblings), is playing weird fetish games with the kids, dressing them up in baby costumes and taking them to the store, putting them in the cart when they\'re  like 10 years old and way too big for it, and it just gets worse from there. The three children he is abusing look nothing alike, and he films all these store trip videos in public, the rest in some weird creepy run down apartment. I came across one where he had the little girl covered in pasta and the title of the video is something like <strong>&quot;Bad Baby Victoria Pees on Annabelle Messy.&quot;</strong> So as not to identify myself too much I don\'t want to post the screenshot as I have this posted elsewhere online and I\'ve been undergoing stalking and harassment so I pretty much stopped posting here as much as I used to.</p>
<p>**I strongly feel the need to post this here, as I put this up on Twitter and I know I\'m being shadow banned there. Please someone go and get some attention on this channel. Previous Voat threads have addressed this and I also saw it on SteemIt, but these girls are in danger as is the little boy. This channel pops up as suggested videos for my kids and it has 7M subscribers on YouTube. **
This channel needs to be reported like crazy. </p>
<p>Other channels that appear to be creepy, and the key words that they seem to be using
If you go to YouTube, and type in <strong>&quot;bad baby,&quot;</strong> there are so many channels like this, but this ToyFreaks channel is one of the worst I\'ve seen. </p>
<p>Pedos seem to be using YouTube to look for children</p>
<p>Someone posted a link to BoyChat here yesterday and I had to go and see what they were talking about because it was related to an old thread where the boy lovers were talking about a specific child that they wanted to be with. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I started reading through that message board, it seemed like the pedos were all using YouTube to communicate about boys they think are hot. One of them posted a link to a parasailing video or something like that, and the boy in the video at the beginning was an actor, so it eerily reminded me of that Audi commercial with the Hampstead daughter that was played during the Superbowl. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting pics of others\' kids online in general seems to be a pedo thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I\'m pretty sure that a certain someone I know who posts photos of the children he is grooming on his Instagram and on YouTube is doing the same thing which would be, advertising the kids he posts the photos of. I think that not only are they trying to normalize pedophilia to every child in America so they can be easily groomed with no suspicion, I think pedos are using YouTube / Instagram / other social media to communicate about specific children that they have available for rent or sale. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pedo Grooming on YouTube brainwashing children using common nursery rhyme - Johnny Johnny Yes Papa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also FYI, the nursery rhyme Johnny Johnny Yes Papa is being used on YouTube to condition children to open their mouths wide and put things in them for stuff like candy, sugar, or whatever food item they want to insert. The kids will run around and open their mouths on command after watching that enough times. It\'s truly sick. I came across one yesterday with some foreign family putting their kids in a bathtub full of bananas and then putting the mom in there with them. Seemed like a pretty phallic bathtub creepy reference to me and it also reminded me of the Fatherhood web video with the kid in the shower stall. I think that they do probably do a lot of the rape in showers and bathrooms because of the ability to clean it up afterwards. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another thing I should mention before I forget is that I\'ve noticed the pedo codes pasta, cheese, and other references to pedophilic activities on numerous other videos marketed to children of older ages. I think this is intentional and they\'re all advertising to each other so they can find each other and network so they can more easily find victims together. </p>

            The instagram account is very telling, can anyone hop over there and archive all of that? He talks about how he can't post personal information because he has a lot of haters.... Super duper sketchy stuff guys. I'm trying to go through what I can as we speak.

                   I agree, and it was just 2 days ago. I did see a boy in one of the videos, but haven't seen him in any others. I am 100% sure these kids are about to be flown off somewhere for more raping. No chance in hell of this channel being normal in any way.

             Exactly.  The relevance to pizza get rule has become so loose and relaxed that I could say something like:  "Related to pizzagate cause pizza is good and so is this post"and it still wouldnt get deleted.

            Reporting these scumbag channels to You Tube is not working.  They are obviously continuing to actively ALLOW it despite complaints.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to hold You Tube and its CEO accountable publicly and in massive numbers on social media with links to offensive videos.

            Follow the money.  We can find a list of You Tube's advertisers and publicly shame them for aligning themselves with a company that condones children's videos that attempt to make sexually suggestive activities with adults seem normal and fun.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can find a list of parenting organizations and publications and publicly ask them in massive numbers why they are absent from the urgent fight to protect children and their parents from pedophiles who count on these videos to groom innocent young viewers.

              That would be something to look into, but I believe it would require being able to show personal "injury" was caused by the videos and/or You Tube's failure to remove them when requested.  Maybe a class action suit where multiple people complain of the same harm would fly.  I'm not a lawyer so don't really know.

             I know I'm gonna get crucidied for this, but I just don't get a creepy vibe from the slip and slide video, also, comments didn't seem sinister at all, although a lot of them were in foriegn languages.  Can someone point me to something that is obviously creepy in the video, or gross comments etc.  I'm completely ignorant to this subject.  Thanks.

               Well, I'm not sure if you have kids, but I've seen a friend of mine's 5 or 6 yr old son watch children play w toys and in similar videos on youtube, on his phone for hours and hours on end.  So just to give everyone some perspective, it's not necessarily adults watching these videos.  Now, once again, I would like to express my ignorance to the subject, and if anyone would like to actually point something out specifically that is obviously sinister in nature,  I would appreciate it.

             <p>
              Do you think there is a slight chance that Youtube are skewing the figures on purpose to enrage us even more?
             </p>
             <p>
              I just can't see the figures being that high! Maybe I am being naive?
             </p>
             <p>
              The amount of complaints that I know have been made to Youtube especially on the videos titled 'webcam video from...' and they haven't been acknowledged or removed!!

              Within about 5 minutes of posting this &amp; reporting to FBI I got 2 stalker phone calls from someone who instantly called back after I rejected the first call &amp; doesn't leave a message. Kinda weird you guys. Cue the Twilight zone music. Also, weird knock on my door yesterday after my husband had left... I've been reporting stuff for months now and received death threats... etc.
