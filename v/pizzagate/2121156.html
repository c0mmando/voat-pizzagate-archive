<p>A former Freemason Grand Master is facing ten years in jail after he was caught by police trying to incite a child into sex.
Alan Wright, 75, was arrested last November when he tried to meet a ’14-year-old boy’ who was actually police officer working on an online sting operation.
Wright regularly went to secret society meetings at Freemasons Hall in St James Street London attended by Prince Michael of Kent.  He was described as a ‘significant’ figure of the organisation which is also popular with Prince Michael.
Wright was arrested last November at Bury St Edmunds railway station in Suffolk, the Express reported.
He thought he was there to meet a 14-year-old boy he’d talked to online, and sent pictures of his private parts.</p>
<p>But instead when he arrived he was greeted by Suffolk police, who’d set up an online sting after gathering information on Wright’s private life.
A specialist officer had posed as a child on the gay dating app Grindr.
Wright will appear at Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing next month, and is facing up to ten years in prison.
He was a former Grand Master of the Grand Council of Royal and Select Masters, although he resigned from the Freemasons when details of his activities came to line.
A spokesman for the United Grand Lodge of England said: ‘We were made aware of an allegation against a Freemason on December 1 2016, who immediately resigned from the organisation.
‘Having learned of the situation we have no further information currently, and fully believe that this is a one-off, isolated incident.</p>

            Any and every freemason is a satanist piece of criminal trash that should be tied to a stake and burned. That will end your pedophile problem.

            </p>
            <p>
             [Alan] Wright, of Rye Gardens, Little Downham, Ely, admitted attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and was given a 16 month prison sentence suspended for two years.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was also ordered to take part in the Thames Valley Sex Offenders’ Treatment Programme and a 40-day rehabilitation activity requirement.

            <p>
             He was further ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work in the community and was made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order and ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for ten years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wright was ordered to pay £1,200 costs and a £140 victim surcharge.

            Perhaps a local dept they don't control made a bust. It will get fixed, don't doubt it. But it is odd. As if they don't know where to look to find who is running the rings. Then all of the sudden, they randomly bust a Masonic master. Kinda weird.

             Coordinated campaign against Freemasons going on. On 4chan too.

             Masons are esoteric, and some are bad of course,  but they're not the satanic pedophiles you're after.

              pedo is pedo, all children deserve to be safe. Now you are distinguishing which kind of pedo is "who we're after".  How about "being after" all pedos.

               Many believe that Freemasons are the ones taking down the pedo ring. So when I see a coordinated effort against "freemasonry", it's very Saul Alinsky

              You are either a brazen shill or extremely ignorant and out of touch regarding the true nature of our world.  (((Freemasonry))) is not being targetted by anyone who has any real influence or power.  It is part of the foundation of the NWO.  I suggest you do some much needed research.
