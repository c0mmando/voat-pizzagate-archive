            The Sisters of Mercy is an Eighties Goth band that I have written quite often about in pizzagatewhatever. During the Thatcher era, their lyrics were very politically astute.  The lead singer and songwriter, originally at Oxford University, moved to the less prestigious Leeds University to sing in the underground music clubs of the area... an area that Savile was familiar with.  Anyhoo,..

            here is a story about the young lover of Netanyahu that might place him in the pedo category too. This is Ofra Haza singing with the band

             Bat-Sheva Ofra Haza-Ashkenazi was an Israeli singer, actress and Grammy Award-nominee recording artist, commonly known as "The Israeli Madonna",[1] or "Madonna of the East".

             Ofra Haza died on February 23, 2000, at the age of 42, of AIDS-related pneumonia.

             years after her death, do her final recordings answer any questions?
            </p>
            <p>
             The day Ofra Haza died was actually the
             <strong>
              second
             </strong>
             time Israel had been plunged into a state of mourning for her.
            </p>
            <p>
             For many Israelis, it was hard to detect "God's will" in the manner of Haza's eventual passing. Ten years ago, the news that she had died, aged 42, as a result of Aids-related illness, belied everything Israel thought it knew about her. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, she was almost a wholesome mirror image of the kind of star Madonna was in the west. "She kept a clean image," remembers Isthar Ashdoth, a producer and musician who worked with her. "You never saw a picture of her with a man or any dirty gossip. For her, it was all about the voice."

           <p>
            The wikipedia article skips the years between 12 and 19.  I read an article where they describe those early years, how she was offered to powerful men...  And the story of how she got AIDS.  I'm having trouble finding it now.  But Netanyahu was allegedly one of those men.
