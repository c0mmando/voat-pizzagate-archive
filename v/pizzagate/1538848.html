<p>Pizzagate Gear Youtube Channel connected the walls that were listed In Werkinonmahnightcheeses\' instagram. There was a website mentioned for the Pegasus museum mentioned in the video and it had the matched walls for the Werkinonmahnightcheese drilling photo. The video had the floor plans and everything. It also had the work permits pulled by alefontis for Pegasus Holdings. There were six permits. All of this was brilliantly explained in the video but since has been Kill. The channel Pizzagate Gear had about 200 subscribers I cannot find it is absolutely gone POOF wiped off the face of this Earth by youtube. If somebody mirrored we would be forever grateful. </p>

            gee, if they'd only invented CARS before 2016... like the neighborhood actually MATTERS?

            BULLETS MATTER. DEATH MATERS. MURDER MATTERS. MOTIVE MATTERS. Proximity? Meh, not so much, unless they can be proven to be at the scene, at the time.

            Wouldn't it be quite easy to see if any kids turned up missing in that playground by Pegasus Museum? I don't know how to do it but it seems like it would be in some public archives especially if more than one kid ended up missing.

            The picture of the walk-in cooler posted on IG by alefantis and tagged #murder and by him and #killroom by someone else (werkinonmanightcheese or w/ever the handle) has been demonstrated to NOT be at comet ping pong, and it is almost certainly NOT at 3518 11th st, either.

            The 4chan/pol thread
            <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/105683310">
             https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/105683310
            </a>
            linked in this post  shows at post 105701957 a chat with alefantis, presumably from early days of pizzagate, in which he  says it was from an empty restaurant space he  was looking at. Considering there is no food in it, and it doesn't look new, this is likely true. Even liars tell the truth sometimes. 
It is also rather large for a cooler, at least 20 feet long, with a lot of cooling power.
To build  a cooler like this would probably cost in the high 5 figures, and require a big outside unit. It would likely be found attached to a commercial building with a 600+ amp electrical service, of which it might consume 250+ amps, or ~6000-8000KWH per month. In other words,  it might cost $600-1000 or so, monthly, to run it, and it would not be easy or safe to do so through a typical 200A residential electrical connection. And the power co. would notice, especially if you weren't paying for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The utility poles in the alley appear to carry only cable/data wires, so it looks like the electrical supply is buried in this neighborhood. Perhaps searching electrical permits or IRL investigating could show what the service to this address is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask yourselves why, other than operating a profitable food business, such a cooler would be built.
Sure, the people under investigation may be suspected of being involved in trafficking, child abuse, murder, even cannibalism.
But are they going to serve a dinner to several hundred cannibals at once?
It is bloody unlikely, no matter how depraved they might be.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very unlikely there is a huge hidden cooler in this building owned by alefantis. Possible I suppose, but unlikely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite possible he or others have done things there he would not like to come to light, though, just not ones requiring a hotel-sized walk in freezer.

           <p>
            I really only paid attention to the "Pizzagategear pulled their video" bit of the title, and went to look, and it was indeed taken down. It was a pretty good video, too. I assume youtube removed it or they decided they could better present the information.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as Seth Rich being killed near Pegasus, I have no idea of the validity of that. Still not sure how this makes me a shill though

             I am not sure if he is giving the proper proof tho... I want to believe him, but I don't know if I can. I am talking about the video he made in which he stated that James Alefantis threatened him. I am not sure if he is giving proper evidence to show that he was actually threatened by him. Why would he post the video that shows James Alefantis threatening him if James Alefantis had truly threatened him. He should now be in more danger than before if he is telling the truth, so why would he do it?

            Good work!
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I don't think the killroom is in that exact room. I think the hole in the ground was a start of the construction of an underground lair.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see that Wills dude is into ironworking and he made the stairs with the little desk on top. That would be a stairs suitable for a "secret staircase"
           </p>
           <p>
            I do think we found something. The images were absolutely at that location. The question is, what is beneath that room?
           </p>
           <p>
            It could also be they are constructing "kill rooms" for home owners and installing them on location. But good work, if we had law enforcement on our side we'd have arrested these bastards this week.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we should do it ourselves.

            First of all, this is quite amazing work.  Congrats on that!
           </p>
           <p>
            Two issues:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The ceiling.  The ceiling in the construction room with the trench looks too high for the Pegasus Museum.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Using rough measurements taken from the specs on the pingpong table at the Joola website, the rear wall in the construction trench room appears to be much wider than the back wall in the alley identified as the killroom wall.

             You didn't take into account the floor surface that would have to be replaced after the trenches were dug. Could add at least 1' to the level of the finished floor, making the ceiling 1' lower relatively.

            Guys, we should crowdfund a single account and query that account to download pertinent youtube videos in HD. I know they offer free SD downloads, but if 20 folks threw in a single dollar (I'm down), we could get higher quality vids which plebs will appreciate.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to save this stuff before Google wipes it away.

             So the Pizzagate Gear youtube channel has been removed entirely? Holy shit.

            Channel is up, just the vid was removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just watched their video a few hours ago.

           <p>
            I even commented defending them from someone saying it was 'wrong' that they were selling shirts to spread the message. This is unreal.

              City blocks are various sizes.  What's the actual distance here?  The graphic linked above indicates 1.7 miles by road, so I'm upvoating your "almost two miles".

             Channel is there, but video is definitely removed. The video was fantastic, I can't imagine them wanting to make an edit. Very odd. Did they have more videos before? They only have 5 vids
