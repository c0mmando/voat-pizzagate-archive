<p>OFFICIALS DESCRIBE \'CULT RITUALS\' IN CHILD ABUSE CASE</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
described in a court document as a &quot;cult&quot; that allegedly conducted &quot;brainwashing&quot; and used children &quot;in rituals.&quot;</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
includes photos showing children involved in bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
Their links to the D.C. area have led authorities into a far-reaching investigation that includes the Finders -- a group of about 40 people that court documents allege is led by a man named Marion Pettie -- and their various homes, including the duplex apartment building in Glover Park, the Northeast Washington warehouse and a 90-acre farm in rural Madison County, Va.</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
According to U.S. District Court records in Washington, a confidential police source had previously told authorities that the Finders were &quot;a cult&quot; that conducted &quot;brainwashing&quot; techniques at the warehouse and the Glover Park duplex at 3918-20 W St. NW. This source told of being recruited by the Finders with promises of &quot;financial reward and sexual gratification&quot; and of being invited by one member to &quot;explore&quot; satanism with them, according to the documents.</p>
<p>According to the affidavit, the source told authorities that children were used in &quot;rituals&quot; by the members, and though the source had never witnessed abuse of the children, the source said the children\'s grandparents feared for their safety.</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
Five of the children were uncommunicative, according to police, and none seemed to recognize objects such as typewriters and staplers.</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
However, the oldest was able to give investigators some information. She said that the two men &quot;were their teachers,&quot; according to Hunt. She was not sure where they had been recently or where they were going. But until recently, they had been living in the District in &quot;a house with other children and adults.&quot; They lived mainly on a diet of raw fruit and vegetables, she said.
The girl told the police that while they were in the District, the children received instruction from &quot;a man they called a Game Caller or a Game Leader,&quot; according to Hunt.</p>
<p>Quote from Washington Post
The Fourth Street warehouse, which authorities said also was used as a residence, had windows that were boarded shut. One wall was covered with a huge map of the world, lit by floodlights. </p>

<p>Quote from The Washington Post
In an affidavit supporting the search, Virginia authorities included photographs showing three white-robed Finders men and several children dismembering two goats. The photographs were in a scrapbook titled &quot;The Execution of Henrietta and Igor.&quot; In one picture, a crying child looked at a decapitated goat. Another photo was captioned, &quot;Ben finds Henrietta\'s Womb.&quot; Three pictures showed children playing with goat fetuses.</p>

            Agreed.  I research looking for that silver bullet that I can shoot into social media to open peoples eyes but I know I'll never find it.  So the goal isn't research, the goal is to continue pushing memes to raise awareness.  I like the phrase I hear used sometimes "you have to give people the dignity to find out for themselves".  I'll keep digging, weaponizing info into memes, and pushing it out however I can.

             Nice, thanks!  Saved to my links file and I'll go though every bit looking for new info and ammo for the meme war.  I'll be posting that infographic to my social accounts as is.  I think that's a good one!

            The biggest question with the Finders case is the sysre of the children, all warehouse evidence and the men were allowed to get out of jail pass, as Fl cops told to drop it and not inform FBI jurisdiction.

             The most compelling article was a follow up by US News and World Report in 1993 (Dec I think) but this has been purged.  That news organization moved to a new information system and purged all records prior to 1997 I believe.  There are archived versions but I've lost the link and they're hard to find.  It's on my list to find this again but archived versions are not as compelling so it's not high on my list.

            I came across this old discussion on child kidnapping rings. This discussion addressed Rudy Giuliani's role in the cover-up of a child sex scandal at West Point when he was US Attorney in 1984. The bottom of the page has many links to world wide sex scandals.

            edit: This line caught my eye "It's a sad fact, most child kidnapping rings world wide are directly connected to governments, corporations like Dyncorp and the UN."

             This is interesting.  Because I'm optimist I believe that Trump knows all this and this may even be the reason he ran.  This is based on very little evidence but I still believe at this point.  When Giuliani announced that he would not join Trump's cabinet I wondered if Trump asked him to remove himself.  I've copied your entire comment into my "links for later" file, thanks!

            Great attempt, but way too much information. Number one thing I learned about effective communication is that people love bullet points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Always put important information you want to highlight in that form. The bullet points force you to condense the details so it's already consumable and easy to process. Also when you mention something like The Finders, you should give a very brief summary of what/who they are. Again, try to do it in a bulleted format.
           </p>
           <p>
            Agree about using videos.

             Thanks for the tips.  It looked much better in it's word doc form (copy/paste disaster!)  I threw in everything, this was really just a rough draft shared at the request of another voater.  I will pare it down into the most sensational items with the goal of letting the reader discover the truth for themselves after I grab their interest.  I'll send a link to the polished doc(s) back through voat for more feedback.  It would be nice to create something that can spur some interest on Facebook etc.

             Yes, it has to be sent out in meme form.  Most people won't read more than one line unless it's something really compelling.  I'll keep trying different forms as I have time.  Of course if I get some success with any form I'll share here.

              Notice how this guy did it. Archive.is the original articles. use the &gt; to show quotes, like this
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               quoted statements

             <p>
              Then it looks worth reading.

               It was a nicely formatted word doc but the copy/paste into voat destroyed that.  :)  Any idea on a good place to store pdf or word docs that can be shared without a login?  I want to be able to share docs with short headlines and clickable links.

               I bookmarked Archive.is, thanks!  I do have a fear that news story links will disappear.
