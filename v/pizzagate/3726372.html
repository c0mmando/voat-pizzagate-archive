<p><strong>Really... What are the odds that all these PG-connected people have the virus? Thoughts?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Prince Charles “has a bad cough” but is “generally feeling OK”, as he battles the coronavirus, a source with knowledge of the Prince’s condition has told The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>The source added that Charles’ family “are not very worried” about the prospect that he may become seriously ill following the revelation Wednesday that the heir to the throne has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.&quot;</p>
<p>While the Prince’s press officers declined to comment further on his health, in a previous statement they said: “He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.</p>
<p>However palace sources did confirm to The Daily Beast that Charles had been displaying “key symptoms” of COVID-19 and that this is what had “given the hint” that he should be tested. The key symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, fever and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>The royal family have followed pandemic protocol dating back to the time of the 1665 Great Plague and split themselves up to try and ensure not all members of the direct line of succession get infected with the sometimes fatal disease.</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla are in Scotland, Kate and William are in Norfolk and Harry and Meghan are in Canada.</p>
<p>Ironically, the royals in the least isolated location are the most vulnerable, namely the Queen, 93, and her husband Prince Philip, 98, who are sheltering at Windsor Castle, which is in the center of the busy town of the same name, not far from London.</p>
<p>However Charles’s diagnosis is likely to focus courtiers’ minds on the absolute imperative of keeping other senior royals safe from any possible sources of infection.</p>
<p>There will of course be many who will now question the wisdom of having permitted the Queen to continue carrying out public engagements until last week.</p>
<p>She was still holding meetings and audiences with multiple people present as late as March 18.</p>
<p>Assuming a 14-day incubation period, courtiers will, by tomorrow, at least be quietly confident that HM did not contract the virus during an investiture attended by dozens of members of the public, and Prince Charles, at Buckingham Palace on March 12. The Queen wore gloves on that occasion, and Charles has avoided bodily contact by greeting people with steepled fingers in recent weeks instead of shaking hands.</p>
<p>Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles wife, is with him but has not got the virus, the palace said.</p>
<p>Charles, 71, and Camilla, 72, are of an age which makes them a member of the most at-risk groups.</p>
<p>Charles’ son Prince Harry was said last week to feel “helpless” and to have been worried about the prospect of his aging father and grandparents catching the disease.</p>
<p>Penny Junor, Charles’ biographer, who has been close to the family for many years, earlier told The Daily Beast: “He’s only recently gone up to Aberdeen, and until he was forcibly stopped he continued to be out and about, meeting people and doing things. It just shows nobody is immune; other world leaders have got it so why not the heir to the throne?”</p>
<p>Junor said there were reasons to be optimistic that Charles would cope well with the infection, saying: “He is a strong, fit man. He is very diet conscious, he exercises, he is slim, he doesn’t have asthma, and has never smoked. He doesn’t really have any health issues apart from a bad back from several polo falls.”</p>
<p>She added: “Of course, he will be having top-notch medical care, but still, it is very scary.\'&quot;</p>',

            So the pompous arse who has to have a butler put toothpaste on his toothbrush every night for him, as well as having his personal assistant pack his toilet seat around the world wherever he goes, has the Corona virus?! Riiiiiiiiight.  When u do the Kabbalah numerology CORONA works out to be 666, coincidence? Does anyone else agree that with ole Charlie horse out of the picture, and the Queen in isolation, it brings the perfect opportunity for Prince William to step up and take over the next few months in place as he will eventually be King. A trial run so to speak.

              Excellent theory, time will tell. People also called Megan and Harry moving to LA a while back and sure enough, they are. They will likely keep the royals relevant in America even though they relinquished their titles.

            I've said it before. I think they fake their deaths when it gets too hairy or when they've had enough and want out. Like in the series breaking bad and the vacuum cleaner guy. And what a great opportunity this is to retire.

            I wonder how many SERVANTS he's "isolating" himself with in that palatial cottage he retreated to. Also he's working normally. WHAT IT WORK to a person who does precisely WHAT he want's WHEN he wants and HOW he wants his ENTIRE life? Does he consider seeing and hearing and smelling and touching and tasting arduous tasks?

            There can't be anything to this "their adrenochrome was poisoned!" narrative. That seems ridiculous. Equally ridiculous is the idea that they are all being arrested. So what is going on? Are famous people claiming to have coronavirus when they really do not just to help hype up the scare?

              Yes I believe the virus has been around since last year. Italian doctors said they saw strange pneumonia cases where the lungs got destroyed. My feeling is that the virus was engineered to target some haplogroups such as Italian and Chinese. Northern Italy is the wealthiest and most productive region of Europe.
