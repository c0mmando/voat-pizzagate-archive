            It's a term used routinely now in domestic violence. Abusers do this because it warps the victims mind by causing them to question their own ability to read reality.

            No worries :) I appreciate the kind words. My horror and written descriptions was leaving no doubt that Twitter was distributing child porn. Attacking me in hopes I'd shut up or trying to make me seem like a liar, was distraction from what I wrote.

            I decided to join you all here because fullchan pizzagate threads are getting shilled pretty bad. I don't usually mind shills, it's fun and interesting to watch their tactics, but last night someone posted a particularly crude Abramovitch pic at the start of a new pg thread with no comment and I feel I need a break from unmoderated digging. I'm not usually one to get triggered but digging this criminal enterprise is taking its toll I guess.

            Here is an infographic that is purported to be a leak of a CTR slack chat. This was before the election, so quite some time ago.

            I got banned from T_D...I kept reporting assholes that were following me around badgering me to post proof of the KP I saw on Twitter..I was polite at first, then fuck it I started reporting them...they were asking/demanding I do something illegal...which would get T_D deleted...they were not banned. I get banned for saying Moslems were animals (re what's happening in europe). Yeah..

            The beauty of all this shilling is that it forces you to evaluate arguments based purely on merit. It just ends up making you sharper and not rely on anyone's word without evidence.

            I posted this in the main sub, but it should have been posted here.  Food for thought:
           </p>
           <p>
            I was reading the newb stickie again and something hit me. Maybe this has been discussed before. In the department of "know your enemy", I thought I'd throw this out.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were Podesta, I'd be putting the thumbscrews to STRATFOR to help suppress this "mess". And Lord knows, they have every reason to want to as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are a couple openings at STRATFOR. They aren't big, so they don't have 100 openings. But they are looking for some unique skillsets. See if anything jumps out as odd to you like it did me:

            Good post. They are all over Me, even on our local FB board. You gotta know your shit to fend them off and they insanely found of logical fallacy. Let me arm you with a tip  - learn about gas lighting/ aka crazy making. This is how they well up anger in a targeted voice and then use it to squash truth.

            i think our modteam does a great job by filtering out those "talmud blood sacrifice sucking circumcised baby cock jews" people. these mods seem to be reasonable enough to detect the fakes. the rest we handle ourselves. i am not worried.

            i am just jealous of these people. i would love to get paid for shitposting too.

            Just vote them down.  That's why Reddit at Voat works so well for this purpose - the shills can't accomplish anything because we have much greater numbers.  Don't respond, downvote, move on.  The best stuff always comes to the top with upvotes.

             Agree.   But it's obvious when people are on here calling this a Witch hunt, adding no new information, not being open to looking at any of the evidence, etc. that these are either Jimmy Comet's buddies or paid CTR shills.   if it's reasonable questioning, nobody has a problem with that.  In fact, I've seen at least half a dozen issues cleared up over the past few days.

             I'm a migrant from reddit, but long time lurker on voat. You defiantly have a better user base.

            <p>
             I'd love to down voat the CTR shit posts but I can't as a newbie. Nothing to stop them up voating their own shit though (10 up voats a day but that is enough for them to get things to the top)

               i speak for it. fuck off! if a kid wants to do something AND they are informed (to be defined as understands and can state important nuances) than i believe they should have the right to autonomy. any law that denies this autonomy is de fact oppression.

              Careful.  Not sure how doxxing works here.  It's definitely freer than reddit and 4chan, but doxxing tends to get places shut down.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, the ctr dox files were extensive.  So you'll find it floating around.  Someone already linked to the fec filings but 4pol definitely went a lot farther at some point.

                No clue.  It's legality here.  Pretty sure that's the only line.  And god knows they can't afford lawyers.  Depends on where the servers are, i guess.  I haven't witnessed a doxxing campaign here yet so i dunno.
               </p>
               <p>
                8chan goes pretty far and gets away with it.  But i think even they kill the threads when they get huge.  Posting shit like pelosi's cell# is gonna cause problems.  Hilarious problems.  But problems.  Ask atko.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not telling you not to do it.  I'm saying be careful about it.  Besides this was a slide thread.  Wikileaks just pointed out hbgary again, hinted at palantir actually being the enemy.  Shits funny.  Current events lead away from ctr attention at all.  This thread shows up pushing for redundant ctr doxx.

               FCC filing = public record.   The names weren't posted here.  Just a link to a public document anyone has the legal right to see.

               That's not doxxing.   Doxxing is sharing specific private info on people in public forum intending to harass them.     Maybe these folks are sex offenders?   Who know...

               <p>
                There was like a month long ctr doxx campaign that led to ben fishcucks name being an instaban on 4chan and a shadow delete on reddit.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you're not aware of that and also that they have already compiled mountains of doxx data, you're reworking ancient ground and wastng your time.

                I'm facilitating you finding 100x what you're digging for here and warning that it's an incendiary topic that you need to be careful with.

            How many "we've been compromised/shills abound!" posts do we need to have on the first page? Every one of them just shows we have that much less evidence to discuss.

             I posted the tactics as an informative explanation of the tactics our members can expect from the shills.   I know you're 'in the know' about CTR and what they do.  Others may find my explanation helpful.   Thank you for your concern.   MAGA.
