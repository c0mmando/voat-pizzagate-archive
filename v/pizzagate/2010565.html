<p>This is Part III of the posts investigating the train wreck named Kamala Harris. From getting her start by letting Willie Brown between her legs, to turning a blind eye to Cardinal William Levada and the hundreds of children molested by SF pedo priests, to allegedly having a secret police force working out of her office, this wraith is a nightmare. Why should this concern us? BECAUSE SHE’S BEING PRIMED TO BE THE NEXT CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THAT’S WHY! </p>
<p>They’re repeating the playbook used in The Kenyan’s reign of terror to get this bitch in office, and so far, we’re not doing a damned thing! We say we’re for stopping the rape of children, and yet do nothing to prevent a piece of shit like this being handed the presidency? Really? Here she is, receiving the mantle of the heir apparent from The Cannibal Queen. Look at this shit: </p>

<p>But one of the most egregious disturbing and troubling aspects of this bitch’s rise to the power elite is the case of Jonah Reifa and Lexi Dillon. First, a bit on Lexi: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://la.indymedia.org/news/2014/10/266356.html">http://la.indymedia.org/news/2014/10/266356.html</a> 
Outrage was the sentiment outside the Los Angeles office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris as women chanted, &quot;Bring back our kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Kamala Harris came into that office four years ago on a promise of fighting against domestic violence and human trafficking. Jennie Johnson of Children\'s Watch says, &quot;Kamala\'s performance in this area is currently an F-. She is running for re-election. You would think she would lift at least part of a finger to help women and trafficked children.&quot; </p>
<p>California has been credited as the U.S. hub of sex trafficking of young American kids into international sex slavery and exploitation. Protesters held transcripts to show that much of the trafficking was officially done by courts. They are demanding an investigation.into what they say is incontrovertible evidence of judicial sex trafficking crimes. </p>
<p>Two of the most famous cases are those of Lexi Dillon and Jonah Rief. Lexi was trafficked out of Orange County by a foreign molester with judicial approval after Tustin Police attempted to arrest the foreigner who is no longer allowed to re-enter the U.S. for national security reasons. Kamala Hrrris received and ignored thousands of petitions asking her to intervene on behalf of Lexi and her mother Ruby Dillon.</p>

<p>Here’s a couple articles on Jonah Rief: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/jonah-rief-child-trafficking-satanic.html">http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/jonah-rief-child-trafficking-satanic.html</a></p>
<p>Jonah Rief in the USA in 2012. In 2013, Jonah entered Australia under a fake passport. &quot;After Jonah was trafficked, nude photos of the boy went up on a Facebook page belonging to Sara Francis. Close to 200,000 hits on the page has indicated to human trafficking experts that the pictures were used as part of a sales operation.&quot; Saving Jonah Rief.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2014/10/02/18762333.php">https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2014/10/02/18762333.php</a></p>
<p>It was a nightmare scenario. A four year old boy had a nightmare and told his mother, &quot;The bad people are coming. The bad people are coming.&quot; Tammy Rief\'s biggest regret was that she did not realize the danger her son was in. </p>
<p>In 2012, human traffickers stalked and later stole Ms. Rief\'s son. A man known as Brian Sullivan, though he had many aliases, had pretended to be the Tammy\'s husband. He found a rogue California officer who helped him raid houses and remove people from Alabama and North Carolina. Tammy has never been married and the man was not related to Jonah in any way. After Jonah was taken, Tammy went to Washington D.C. enlisted the aid of state department officials and Senator Sessions from Alabama. But her efforts were later cut short when she herself was taken and held prisoner for 91 days without any information on what was going on or why she had been taken.  …</p>
<p>Prior to Jonah\'s abduction, he lived with Tammy in Alabama. Sullivan was seen by neighbors lying in wait near the Rief residence and watching the house. He frightened Tammy by letting her know he was more familiar with her ancestry than even she was. </p>
<p>Traffickers normally study their victims in advance in an effort to obtain targets who will provide them with a strong monetary return for their efforts. Tammy and Jonah had obtained a protective order against Sullivan after he uploaded fake internet videos, including one with information on how to get to the boy\'s Alabama home, an apparent solicitation for assistance in abducting the boy. Neighbors say that the problem was that nobody could have prepared for the measures taken by the traffickers.  
</p>

<p>It’s interesting that in the above link, it mentions that the boy’s mother, Tammy Rief, “worked in movies”.  I’ve never seen this brought out. Is it a clue as to where Jonah got on this Sullivan guy’s radar? Why hasn’t this been talked about? </p>
<p>Here’s the Save Jonah Rief page on FB: </p>

<p>I would suggest everyone getting on board and tweeting it …. Creating hashtags … commenting on articles written about this shrew Kamala Harris with “Where’s Jonah Rief?” or the like.  And what about the California courts? Why are we allowing them to run all over our justice system? How can a divorce judge grant Sullivan custody when the two weren’t married and never had a common law marriage? And before I forget, the tentacles of this octopus run deep.  
</p>
<p>Remember this bitch judge who was found dead from an apparent suicide? And if you think I’m being harsh … wait … you may not think so after you read the next link: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-york-judge-20170420-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-york-judge-20170420-story.html</a> </p>
<p>Mysterious death of New York judge was initially called a suicide. Now, police think it\'s suspicious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so where’s the connection … this is the connection: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/n-y-rules-non-biological-non-adoptive-parents-seek-custody-article-1.2771412">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/n-y-rules-non-biological-non-adoptive-parents-seek-custody-article-1.2771412</a></p>
<p>New York state court rules non-biological, non-adoptive parents can seek custody, visitation if couple breaks up</p>
<p>In the decision written by Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, the court holds that &quot;where a partner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to conceive a child and to raise the child together, the non-biological, non-adoptive partner has standing to seek visitation and custody.&quot;
While acknowledging it\'s rare for the court to change one of its previous decisions, the judges found that the 1991 Court of Appeals ruling limiting the legal definition of parents to those with a biological or adoptive relationship &quot;has inflicted disproportionate hardship on the growing number of nontraditional families across our State.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, she’s the bitch that carried this non-biological partner having rights into New York State making it easier than ever to do the same thing in NY. Remember, these lizards always cover outrageously scummy actions under noble principles. </p>
<p>Any ideas of how to form massive protests in California over the human trafficking and over Harris? Please post so we can strategize. </p>
<p>I also think the angle of Tammy Rief being in movies needs to be investigated. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading, now let\'s get busy!</p>',

            Mysterious death of New York judge was initially called a suicide. Now, police think it's suspicious

           Okay, so where’s the connection … this is the connection:

            New York state court rules non-biological, non-adoptive parents can seek custody, visitation if couple breaks up
           </p>
           <p>
            In the decision written by Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam, the court holds that "where a partner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to conceive a child and to raise the child together, the non-biological, non-adoptive partner has standing to seek visitation and custody."
While acknowledging it's rare for the court to change one of its previous decisions, the judges found that the 1991 Court of Appeals ruling limiting the legal definition of parents to those with a biological or adoptive relationship "has inflicted disproportionate hardship on the growing number of nontraditional families across our State."

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Yup, she’s the bitch that carried this non-biological partner having rights into New York State making it easier than ever to do the same thing in NY. Remember, these lizards always cover outrageously scummy actions under noble principles.

           Any ideas of how to form massive protests in California over the human trafficking and over Harris? Please post so we can strategize.

          <p>
           I also think the angle of Tammy Rief being in movies needs to be investigated.

Not only was Tammy Rief a film art directer feature films , tv commercials and shows for over 20 years , not mentioned in the Jonah Rief case , the pictures of the so called Brian Sullivan wasn't published . And the fact that he claimed to be a NFL punter kicker spealist in 1981 thu 1983 with the Kansa city chiefs and Baltimore colts . As well as he was involved in celebrity fundraisers and a member annul Colorado black tie golf affair in columbine,Colorado. And the so called Denise Lynn Glaser alias last names she uses is also Nolan , Wallick and Sara francis a name she also used! A lot more info on Jonah Rief case I truly believe it was kept out of the media to stop anyone from finding Jonah Rief and to protect the evil people whom stole this child with the help of Orange County ca . cps and the courts and a ring of child traffickers

              Welcome , and thank you . there is lots more they kept hidden . Brian Sullivan is on fb with a picture of Jonah Rief when he was little past 2 years old , but Brian posted this on Facebook 2015 Jonah Rief would have been 8 years old at this time . Why did he post a picture of Jonah at age 2 instead of age 8 ? It seems to me he is trying to give people the impression that Jonah still looks like a 2 year , just so no one recognizes Jonah Rief at his real age. Jonah will be 10 on dec,18,2017 I am so hoping to get people to open there eyes and see what really went on with Tammy and her son Jonah Rief . They have taken Jonah with the help of those who are suspose to be protecting children , and have bought his mother Tammy Rief to a complete pause in life since this happened , every attempt she makes at finding her son is blocked and death threats to family and friends as well , they have made sure to use every dime she had to fight for her child , so that she would be forced to be her on attorney . These people whom are responsible Are cold callus evil humans and I pray there is people out there that still has good hearts and really are fighting for children because I can honestly say I don't believe anyone in Orange County ca gave a shit about anything except their pocket books .

               I hope the same thing. It's outrageous that no one is doing anything to get this child back.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'd only suggest she make this way more public. I didn't know anything about it until I started digging. I understand Jeff Sessions helped her at one time. He's in a pretty powerful position now. Could she reach out to him? What about a Republican opponent of the California Attorney General? Or Senator Harris? It might be a campaign issue. Breaks my heart to know this kid is being abused and with a stranger, but the cover up and the story being buried is part of the problem.

                She has tried to get it out but due to them nearly abducting her , she had to go into hiding afraid she would be killed and never get a chance to see her son again . There was terrible things she had done to her and others who tried to help her . They even threaten to kill her parents , she was also told it had something to do with her linage by an anti trafficking org that asked her if she had "letters patent" in the family? Of which Tammy confirmed. She was then told that her case stunk like CIA, and that they took her son to do with these royal "letters patent" in the family. Her and Jonah are direct bloodline descendants from the last king of France, "Citizen King." The mother doesn't know why or who this would matter to or benefit from stealing and trafficking this child???

              Wow wow wow !  I'm in Cali and let me tell you , I have been fighting CPS for my nephew and niece for the past 2 years . My life has been hell! Also a certain person I went to for help in Orange County, completely disregarded me . He's running for DA this year and was DA in the past . He's the author of Meagans law . I've posted details here before when I was on an emotional rant , it's so frustrating knowing that they have all the control . I have Facebook messages archived from him telling me " what do you want me to do about it , isn't That a police matter"  I said " I thought since you were an advocate for children you might want to help"

                Thank you . No I have not . After my encounter with a certain city official and my recent knowledge of all the corruption within the government , I feel like i would be putting an even stronger target on myself and family . It's utterly paralyzingly ! I get brave then I get scared . This man lived a few doors down from my family member and had knowledge of abuse going on within the household .

                 Yeah, I made that call a long time ago, and I had no knowledge of the corruption. So I just called the state senate, and summarized how wrong cps was in about a paragraph.  An aide took my call, obviously took notes, and the senator called me back.  Then cps behaved.  Who knows.  Hope your situation comes to a good resolution.  Sending you love and light

               I so feel for you, I wish there was a real way to help but do not give up. File objections on everything and appeal every decision, they might decide you are not worth the battle.

                Thank you 🙂 Unfortunately the mother of the children is a really good sociopathic narcissist and gets along well with this city official , in fact her daughter is best friends with his daughter . Isn't that sweet? Even though I sent him her mugshot and told him that she was envolved in a 350k dollar jewelry heist in NP beach ca.

                 Thats really sad. It sounds like a targeted set up to get the kids (by the official) befriending a mom he knows he can steal the kids from. Zero Hedge just posted an article about California custody law which I just posted here.

               I want everyone to get together on this. What is happening is UNACCEPTABLE. So come on, everyone, let's strategize on how we can start massive protests in California about what's happening. We need focused emails, tweets, social media accounts to band together and demand accountability! So how? HOW?

             Exceptional Post.  I just read all of it and evidently she is one of their Brain washed Brownstoned Robots that has been programmed to moved ahead as planned.  Yes, these people must be stopped before they take hold.  There is probably already everything set up that will put her into the limelight of the media and they will help push her forward.  Thanks for bringing this to the forefront.  What she is doing by ignoring requests about this little boy and Mom is her payment for her upcoming success.  She is doing all the right things to move ahead.  They want to reward her with the Presidency.  Or so they hope.

               The stage is being set.  People in her district need to know what she has let happened in regards in of all respects, a child.  A child that has been abused.  There is nothing worse than an adult that does not lift a finger to save a child from such horror.  Despicable.

                It is. I think it's the one thing where most people can agree and it stands to reason to make it the main reason for not supporting her. I mean, they actually threw the mother in jail for protecting her son! And with her out of the picture, Sullivan was free to abscond with Jonah.

                  A lot of people had faith in the government. They don't want to believe a bunch of corrupt contemptible maggots have taken over. I would have found it hard to believe myself. But courts are now being used to traffic children. It's fact; not theory ... not faux news. We have got to start making comments on that article and tweeting it out ... facebooking it.

                   I bailed on Obama in 2012 although there were a few things that I did not like, but had no inkling about anything that we know now.  The day the bottom fell out for me was when I was in Philly for the Conv.  and found out from delegates that they literally stole the election from Bernie Sanders.  It was a shock but when I started seeing little things bit by bit on the internet I thought I was on Mars.  That is when it hit the fan and the rest is history.  I agree we must get stronger and hit them in the face with memes tweets etc.  They have gotten off way too easy until now.

                    This is right on the money! Most of us had no idea what they were up to. I mean, I didn't like the direction the country was headed, but child trafficking? Never even hit my brain! And it should have. The Franklin scandal was there, but that was covered up so I really didn't know outside of what I thought were isolated incidents or politicians. Then the leaks came ... red pilled! I couldn't believe it ... could not .... I started to investigate ... really to try to explain things away, but those things couldn't be dismissed. Let's think up some great memes and keep using them.
