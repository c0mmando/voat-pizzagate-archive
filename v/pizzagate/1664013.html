            Listen..we have been fed a false narrative since WWII minimally.  I have personally seen it in our research in our company.  I had to build a "narrative" for my discovery (which has to do with the human body and new science)...part of building that narrative was research why we are do degraded in this particular system...and guess what?  All points to IG Farben roots, then to Bayer and Monsanto...but all started with Paperclip just like NASA BS...VERY easy to manipulate us thru our diet and look at who controls about 99.9% of seeds and pesticides...ever wonder why they are so focused on GMO?  Well if I can make you just mildly allergic to something (like most of us are to wheat/gluten) then I can make $$$$ of of you thru your life because I can guarantee you will have issues.  Seeds come from BASF/Monsanto (IG Farben), pesticides from Bayer (IG Farben)....
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I am of the opinion that WWII did not end the way we thought it did...we LOST when some idiots spoke for US and sold US for technological advancements...

             Now people are starting to see the connection I talk about.  Might toss in there the founder of Universal Studios, another occultist in their fold...who coincidentally was using the globe earth image clear back in 1908 in their movie introductions; half a century before NASA took any "photos" of it.  It dates back to Copernicus, another occultist in their group... the guy who came up with the "theory" the earth was a sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is the message of all that false science about a ball earth and outer space?  "There is no God"...its the name of a recent Stephen Hawking documentary even...but of course you also have to believe a paraplegic writes books on astrophysics and speaks fluently through a computer voice by wiggling his cheek.  Or you can catch famed astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss speaking at universities around the world....after explaining how the universe started with a star exploding, he always uses the punchline "Forget Jesus!  Thank a star for dying so you could be here!".  And then there's Bill Nye, the failed comedian turned television scientist....who can be seen doing his job at the opening of a Noah's ark exhibit screaming "Its child abuse to teach the bible to children!".
            </p>
            <p>
             Or people can go on entranced, believing the magic....yep, this guy here is a scientist living way, way up in the sky.  Snap out of it, its an actor here on earth on a studio set.  Notice the solar flare video effects added inside the "space craft"...really gives it that "up in outer space" feel.  All illusion.   The public has been duped for generations.

            </p>
            <p>
             50 years ago, with black and white TV their stuff was believable...but nowadays...its like going to see a Chris Angel show and getting a cheap nightclub act instead. :/
            </p>
            <p>
             Then take Wernher Von Braun....the former fiction writer for a Rockefeller magazine, turned SS officer for Germany, then brought over after the war to work with Walt Disney who was a founding member of the club the "Uplifters" in the 1930's who wrote the play "The uplift of Lucifer" with the LA sheriff who designed a badge with the triangle pedo symbol on it.  The Uplifters also started several youth and children's programs and groups.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also of irony....is the headstone of Wernher Von Braun...the guy put in charge of NASA, who got us out of the earth's atmosphere...the only thing written on his headstone besides dates of birth and death...is "Psalms 19:1"....which if you look it up, reads "The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork"....funny thing for the guy who proved there was no God and no Firmament as the bible said, to put on his headstone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a video on Von Braun...I'm not a "dis-info" agent...I've simply done my homework and put the pieces together.  There is far more to the subject..and really is nothing but one big ruse...with many in on it.  Look into the explorations to the South Pole, operations "high jump", followed by "operation fishbowl", followed by an international treaty in 1959, putting Antarctica off limits.  Look at Captain Cook's expedition to Antarctica, where he charted over 70,000 miles trying to circumnavigate it. Then look at the previous conception of our earth.....that for whatever reason, even the most educated have never even seen...instead told a lie that when Columbus set sail...people thought you would fall off the edge...they thought nothing of the sort.
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fautyLuuvo">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fautyLuuvo
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The previous conception of our earth was established through actual exploration, independently by various cultures...it accounts for everything we see in the sky and on earth without error.....and was used to navigate accurately by for thousands of  years...until a bunch of satanists came up with a "Theory" the earth was a sphere instead.  There was murder in the Church at the time..it was the Church of England in charge of education back then and they implemented the teaching of the globe model....and another coincidence is at the same time removed several books from the bible.  Few even know of the those books, they were forgotten about until they were found again in the Ethiopian bibles and in the lost sea scrolls....but they used to be in all bibles up until about 500 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             One book in particular, "The Book of Enoch" was very explicit about about how our world worked, and the celestial bodies above us...it described the calendar that is still used worldwide today....it also told of the demons who came down to earth, what they did, what happened to them...which might explain CERN's digging.  But its funny, that book is the only place where the demons were named by name....so Hollywood must know about that book, as they use those demon's names in their movies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even if the old conception of the earth was incorrect...why keep it hidden?  Not a single show that mentions it ever, not a single mention in all of academia.  Why not?  If nothing else, its quite the curiosity....very ingenious how everyone had it figured.  Instead we get programming...everything from childhood cartoons, to adult programming to even the last president's speeches that has the notion "anyone who thinks the earth is flat is crazy or stupid" scripted in through innuendo, connotation or direct dialogue of characters in the movies or shows.  Its in everything if you watch.  Simple things like a scene starting with characters riding in car, but on the radio the host says "I had someone call in the other day who thought the earth was flat"..."I told him to put down the crack pipe"...then the scene starts....that's put in there by intent and is in everything....its called programming....and it works...the average person who's been exposed to the media will react to the notion of the earth being flat with attacks calling the person suggesting it crazy or stupid.   With the last president, I've seen in three of his speeches where he said to effect someone else's stupidity things like "they must have been founding members of the flat earth society", or "they probably thought the earth was flat when Columbus set sail".  Keep in mind, Columbus did not prove the earth a sphere....the entire earth was already charted by other cultures....they already figured out you just go round and round on the earth East or West....to the South was the retaining ice wall.  The compass points to the center.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, that's the big one and the crux of what is ailing the world.  Pizzagate is but a thread of that ball of corruption and wickedness.  Alaphantic or Hillary..even Obama are small players in it all.   If we're to truly eradicate the evil that has permeated itself around the world....that "monolithic and ruthless conspiracy" that Kennedy caught glimpse of....we're gonna have to take an honest look at all those photos, the science and the people from NASA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a video that helps explain it.
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOz2JUI9_ZI">

            <p>
             The old map is still used, but is now called the "Azimuthal Equidistant Projection Map" and is said to be just the globe flattened out.....notice it has no Antarctica on it?  Notice its on the UN flag and in the logos of many other "global" organizations?  Here's a video that shows an old map found hidden and not on record in the Boston Public Library...from the late 1800's......notice it says "As it Is" and explains the sun just as it was thought to be for thousands of years prior?  Many more examples of that same mapping can be found.

             Examine the flight routes in the Southern Hemisphere...which map do they match up on....all except one flight that was created recently with actor John Travolta doing a press conference to announce the new nonstop flight that would match the globe earth...but does that flight really exist?  Or just on TV?  An illusion?  And why are both poles of the earth off limits?  I've been to the Northern most parts of Alaska, where the sun never sets...watched it go round in the sky.....still thousands of miles from the North Pole....but you can see, the North Pole would be in the center of that circle the sun is making...the poles are not off limits because of the weather.  The one public tour to Antarctica is to an island off the tip of South America....the name of the island?  "Deception Island"!  You can't make this stuff up.  lol   Then, if you examine the science we're taught....opposite latitudes should have nearly identical weather on the globe....the mechanics are perfectly symmetrical for opposite seasons North and South...so how come that tour only runs for 5 weeks?  But in the opposite latitude, there's travel everyday of the year?  I think more than a few musicians have caught on

              Just look up at the stars......we are not on a ball spinning at over 1,000 mph while orbiting the sun at over 50,000 mph, as the sun orbits the milky way at over half a million miles per hour, and the entire milky way is moving at over 1 million miles per hour.....with each star in the sky a sun in its own galaxy undergoing the same motions.....moving millions of miles everyday while we also move millions of miles everyday....yet the stars stay perfectly aligned....all of them circling the North Star which stays directly above our North Pole...year after year, century after century.  The sun is not 93 million miles away, 400 times larger and 400 times further away from the moon.  The two are the same size and about the same height above us.   If the sun were 93 million miles away, then there's no way it would change in apparent size by moving anywhere across an 8,000 mile diameter sphere....but you can see the sun grow twice its size as it approaches......or shrink as it goes away....particularly in an airplane....there's a good timelapse from a flight between NY and Moscow.....you can see the sun shrink more than half it size as the plane goes away from it.   According to the laws of perspective that are used by science to account for the sun and moon appearing the same size... then you'd have to move 47 million miles further from the sun to make it appear half its size.  The whole thing really is a ruse....albeit an elaborate one.

              People will argue that the stars rotate the opposite direction in the Southern "hemisphere".....not exactly.  Picture a football dome stadium with the stars being fixed in its ceiling and rotating.....if you are halfway between the center of the stadium and the walls....when you look up towards the center (North) the ceiling would appear to turn one way...if it were rotating clockwise...looking from the "equator" to the center....the stars in the ceiling would go by right to left.....if you turn around and face outward and look up...the stars will go by from left to right.   Observations in the South that say the stars are rotating around a pole....are taken from observation points still many thousands of miles from the South Pole.....or edge of the disk....at those vast distances, perspective comes into play and the the further stars appear to arch on the horizon as they barely come into view then go past...what is seen matches stars in a dome, with the edges of the dome coming close to the ground.  I bet at the "South Pole" the stars go straight over....but nobody can get anywhere near there.....international forces guard it.

             Speaking of Mars conference....here's the press conference of the team that landed on the Martian Surface, with all the rhetoric about how great the space program is for humanity, how they'll name their children after the spacecraft...and a lot high fiving, and circle jerkign removed.  Are you sure they're not actors?

            I posted this earlier but it was deleted, citing rule 1. I tied it to pizzagate because many researchers have warned about distractions. Someone brought up a good point about this being lined up with the vault 7 release. But anyway, it's interesting. I don't trust NASA in the slightest!
