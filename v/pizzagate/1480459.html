<p>TLDR: The Democrats have been illegally supplying Iran\'s Nuclear Program since 2009. Obama, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton have all benefited financially from it.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton has ties to the mining/commodity trading industry through her old criminal pal Marc Rich. Through Rich\'s company Glencore, Hillary Clinton can be tied to:</p>
<p>Terrorism, the Drug trade, Iran\'s Nuclear Program, North Korea, and even Apartheid South Africa</p>
<p>Everyone largely believes that Hillary Clinton is corrupt. I believe so too, but I believe it\'s in a different vein of corruption. I believe there is a long running criminal conspiracy in our Government that dates back to the 1970s in its origin, and continues to this day. In order to prove that point, I need to answer a few questions :</p>
<p>Who is Marc Rich?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich</a></p>
<p>Marc Rich was born December 18, 1934 and died on June 26, 2013. He was a businessmen, his focus was in banking and trade commodities.</p>
<p>Rich founded the commodities trading giant Glencore. Today it is the World\'s 3rd largest family business, and the 10th largest company on the Fortune Global 500 list. It has headquarters in Switzerland, London, the Netherlands, and Jersey. As well subsidiaries all around the globe. Without a doubt its primary interests are oil, gas, and mining.</p>
<p>Marc Rich was indicted in the United States in 1983 with business partner Picnus Green and fled the country.</p>
<p>What did Marc Rich do?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/marc-rich-pardoned-financier-dies-at-78.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/business/marc-rich-pardoned-financier-dies-at-78.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/marc-rich-commodities-trader-fugitive-dies?INTCMP=SRCH">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/26/marc-rich-commodities-trader-fugitive-dies?INTCMP=SRCH</a></p>
<p>Marc Rich and Pincus Green were indicted on 65 criminal counts including: tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the 1973-1974 Oil Embargo, when Rich used contacts in Iran and Iraq to circumvent the sanctions.</p>
<p>In his own biography, and to his biographer Daniel Amann, Rich said his &quot;most important and most profitable&quot; business deals happened by violating international trade embargoes and doing business with the apartheid regime of South Africa.</p>
<p>Rich admitted to doing business with: Apartheid South Africa, Fidel Castro\'s Cuba, Marxist Angola, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, Gaddafi\'s Libya, Ceausescu\'s Romania, and Pinochet\'s Chile.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International#American_inquiries_and_legal_actions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International#American_inquiries_and_legal_actions</a></p>
<p>Rich was also believed to be involved with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International: a bank which was closed down for laundering money for people such as Saddamm Hussein, Manuel Noriega, and the Medellin Cartel and the terrorist group Abu Nidal. Rich was even reported to have been involved in arms deals in Iraq in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Okay, that\'s who Marc Rich was. By why is that important?</p>
<p>Marc Rich was pardoned by President Bill Clinton on January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, in what the New York Times would call one of history\'s most &quot;flagrant abuses of presidential power.&quot;</p>
<p>Why was Rich\'s pardon so bad?</p>
<p>Long story short? Rich bought his pardon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pardoned-financier-marc-rich-dead-at-78/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/pardoned-financier-marc-rich-dead-at-78/</a></p>
<p>Rich funneled $1 million to the Democratic party, including more than $100,000 to Hillary Clinton\'s Senate Campaign in New York, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation.</p>
<p>It was arguably the most controversial moment of Clinton\'s presidency. He went on to defend it, even citing the arguments of another controversial pardon receiver, one &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby.</p>
<p><a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/121908-jamescomey.pdf">http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/121908-jamescomey.pdf</a></p>
<p>Then Deputy Attorny General Eric Holder argued for Rich\'s pardon. Eric Holder was Obama\'s first Attorney General</p>
<p>The pardon of Marc Rich was so controversial there was a federal hearing on it. It was originally prosecuted by Federal Prosecutor Mary Jo White, but she stepped down and was replaced by the current director of the FBI James Comey, who ultimately found &quot;No evidence of criminal activity.&quot; According to the Washington Post.</p>
<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2001/03/27/brits-seize-2-million-bound-for-marc-rich/">http://nypost.com/2001/03/27/brits-seize-2-million-bound-for-marc-rich/</a></p>
<p>Just more evidence of Rich\'s drug ties.</p>
<p>The Clinton Pardons/Drug ties of People involved</p>
<p>Now, Marc Rich hard long standing ties to terrorist organizations and the drug trade.</p>
<p>For a moment, I want to focus on the latter, and not the former.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/us/roger-clinton-s-dogged-effort-for-drug-trafficker.html?ref=topics">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/us/roger-clinton-s-dogged-effort-for-drug-trafficker.html?ref=topics</a></p>
<p>Clinton considered pardoning a known drug trafficker after a man, one Tommy Gambino, approached Clinton\'s brother Roger Clinton on a golf course, handed him a rolex watch and had a conversation about presuading his brother to do so.</p>
<p>Roger Clinton\'s efforts to get Rosario Gambino pardoned were so persistent the FBI investigated them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/23/us/clinton-pardons-brothers-siblings-who-often-emerge-unflattering-spotlight.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/23/us/clinton-pardons-brothers-siblings-who-often-emerge-unflattering-spotlight.html</a></p>
<p>Roger has a long history of involvment in cocaine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-brothers-hugh-tony-rodham-116674">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-brothers-hugh-tony-rodham-116674</a></p>
<p>But Roger also received a pardon for cocaine conviction.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/hillary-clinton-hugh-tony-rodham</a></p>
<p>Hugh Rodham, Hillary Clinton\'s brother, received $434,000 to lobby for a pardon of a cocaine trafficker, and he did so successfully.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal</a></p>
<p>Now, some may say it\'s disingenous to say Eric Holder has drug ties. But he is tied to the late Marc Rich, and we should all remember the time he helped facilitate the transfer of firearms to Mexican Drug Cartels.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/media-resources/media-releases/2013/former-us-deputy-attorney-general-joins-hsbc-board">http://www.hsbc.com/news-and-insight/media-resources/media-releases/2013/former-us-deputy-attorney-general-joins-hsbc-board</a></p>
<p>Current FBI Director James Comey sat on the board of banking giant HSBC.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213</a></p>
<p>The same Banking Giant that launders drug cartel money. And has been caught, charged and fined for doing so.</p>
<p><a href="https://investments.hsbc.co.uk/news/company/24989264/glencore-gallops-higher-as-liberum-bullish-on-china-s-coal-policy">https://investments.hsbc.co.uk/news/company/24989264/glencore-gallops-higher-as-liberum-bullish-on-china-s-coal-policy</a></p>
<p>HSBC is also responsible for many of Glencore\'s investments. Again, Glencore was founded by the criminal Marc Rich, who paid for a pardon by former President Bill Clinton. A pardon which was investigated by James Comey, who sat on the board of HSBC, which laundered drug cartel money, and did business with a company that worked intimately with drug traffickers. Comey found &quot;No evidence of criminal activity.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, so Glencore, the Clinton\'s, HSBC, the director the FBI are somehow all linked to eachother and to drug cartels. So what? Where does this lead.</p>
<p>Okay, now this is where things begin to get a little technical, and more questions have to get answered.</p>
<p>Who is John Podesta, and what is Joule Unlimited?</p>',

           Current FBI Director James Comey sat on the board of banking giant HSBC.

           The same Banking Giant that launders drug cartel money. And has been caught, charged and fined for doing so.

           HSBC is also responsible for many of Glencore's investments. Again, Glencore was founded by the criminal Marc Rich, who paid for a pardon by former President Bill Clinton. A pardon which was investigated by James Comey, who sat on the board of HSBC, which laundered drug cartel money, and did business with a company that worked intimately with drug traffickers. Comey found "No evidence of criminal activity."
          </p>
          <p>
           Okay, so Glencore, the Clinton's, HSBC, the director the FBI are somehow all linked to eachother and to drug cartels. So what? Where does this lead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Okay, now this is where things begin to get a little technical, and more questions have to get answered.

            Glencore is a trading company. They trade lots of things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Gadaffi fell in 2011, they began trading Libyan oil again.
           </p>
           <p>
            They trade Yemen's oil
           </p>
           <p>
            They trade Iraqi oil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once the Iran deal was hitched, they began trading Iranian copper.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012 and 2013, they were caught trading aluminum to Iran's nuclear program(which was against international law at the time).
           </p>
           <p>
            And as Time reads, government policy since 2008(Gee what happened in 2008? Hmm) has made it so Glencore could sit back and make "EASY MONEY"

            Wikileaks has shown us Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Glencore investors TIED to Joule Unlimited and John Podesta, and thus in multiple directions James Comey, The Clintons, and the democrats, fund ISIS. And Qatar Gave Bill Clinton $1 million for a 5 minute meeting in 2011
           </p>
           <p>
            $1 million for a five minute meeting in 2011? Didn't Gadaffi fall in 2011? Didn't Saudi Arabia invest $400 million into Glencore in 2011? Didn't Glencore begin trading Libyan Oil in 2011?
           </p>
           <p>
            YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
           </p>

             Glencore is still working with North Korea. They are trying to have an aluminum monopoly in the US, and have been busted selling aluminum to the Iranian nuclear program...are they funding the North Korean one as well?

             Glencore gets mining contracts in North Korea via China, and gets to sell food futures to North Korea via the United Nations. It's amazing how centered around Glencore the world's elite actually are.

             The success of Glencore is directly tied to the success of the Chinese government. Note how Trump wants to be tougher on China, but Clinton does not.

             Okay, so for years Glencore has been benefiting from Hillary's foriegn policy. But how does Hillary Benefit from Glencore? Let's move to Canada for a bit, shall we?

             The Canadian branch of the Clintons, The Clinton-Giustra Enterprise, which accepts money from the same mining industry the Clinton's have been linked to, the same mining industry benefiting from all of Hillary and Bill's foreign policy 'blunders' over the years, would not be excluded, and certainly have not been so far, from being tied to her.

             John Kerry, current Secretary of State, has money invested off-shore in a financial firm known as aPriori Capital Partners.
             <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=73375&amp;privcapId=160210">
              http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=73375&amp;privcapId=160210
             </a>
             aPriori Capital Partners is ran by a man named Peter T. Grauer, who also sits on the board of directors for Bloomberg. Mr. Grauer ALSO sits on the Board of directors for...wait for it...Glencore
So once again we see the Obama Administration tied directly to members of the board of directors at Glencore.
Now lets look into the darker side of this company. Let's go back to wikileaks. To the Stratfor cables

             I'm gonna grab some quotes from this article
A few days after it was announced that the global commodities trader Glencore was to mount the biggest stock exchange float in British history, every major news organisation in the UK received a terse letter from a London law firm.
The letter was from Schillings, which is no ordinary corporate law firm: its lawyers describe themselves as reputation management experts, people who help clients "manage what is published and broadcast about them". They are particularly proud of their own reputation as the country's leading superinjunction specialists.
Glencore executives, the letter said, "are extremely private individuals", who expected scrutiny of their business activities, but not their personal lives. A warning followed about the "security risk" that could be posed by any reports about their homes or private lives.
Back to wikileaks again!

Ah Glencore... our favorite shady oil distributor. Reva and I have had some fun monitoring of this ridiculous company. They have alot of Russian ties.
Glencore has lots of Russian ties, and pumps Venezuelan Crude, and apparently Belarus crude oil as well! And the intelligence agency refers to them as their "Favorite shady oil distributor" And the Clinton's have extremely deep running ties with them.

             "Completed Research: US Assets of Major Energy Firms Supplying Iran" Dated? 09-17-2009
There are a total of 6 companies listed, in 2009, as supplying Gasoline to Iran:
British Petroleum(UK)
Glencore(Swiss)
Total(French)
Reliance(India)
Vitol(Swiss)
Trafigura(Swiss/Dutch)
What that email is to, is a link to an intelligence report from 2009 listing foreign companies supplying Iran from US Assets. Glencore AND BP are both on that list. Why is BP important? Because disgraced BP Oil Exec Tony Hayward is on the Board of Directors at Glencore. So why was the Obama administration knowingly allowing US assets to be diverted to Iran? We've already seen earlier in my write-up that Glencore was busted just 3 years after this report supplying Iran with aluminum for their Nuclear Program
Our intelligence agencies knew they were supplying Iran with Gasoline. John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, and Obama all have ties to Glencore. Clinton through Rich, Kerry through Peter Grauer's financial firms, and Obama through his two Secretaries of State.
