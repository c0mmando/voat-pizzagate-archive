<p><strong>Forever removing doubt</strong> by going into UK Pedogate Scandals connecting to Madeline McCann and drawing arrow straight to Podesta/right into the heart of the campaign?</p>
<p>This piece on Medium does 2 things very clearly:</p>
<ol>
<li>How can anyone discredit anything that has just happened in the UK in the same <strong>exact</strong> trajectory as is happening here in Pizzagate?
UK has 30 years long (at least) childcare home scandals leading right into the seat of the Prime Minister: </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>New investigations have revealed pedophile rings operating out of multiple UK children’s care homes with half-hearted investigations and thwarted prosecutions spanning the last 30 years. The UK has been plagued with child care home abuse scandals with multiple coverup accusations made against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, lost evidence, even suspicions that peodphile ring whistleblowers had been murdered.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Jimmy Savile is our John Podesta and our John Podesta is Jimmy Savile. HOW CAN ANYONE NOT SEE THIS??????</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The remarkable similarities between Jimmy Savile and John Podesta cannot be ignored. Accusations against Jimmy Savile began in at least 1970, but were dismissed as ludicrous-exactly the reaction to the idea that John Podesta could be similarly inclined. And yet, 30 years later, the NHS releases this stunning report detailing Savile’s easy ability to abuse without impunity-precisely due to his connections and protection of being a political “insider”. The report: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-and-department-of-health-investigations-into-jimmy-savile">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-and-department-of-health-investigations-into-jimmy-savile</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads me to a new thought: Child Care homes in the UK-are our CPS and other \'child care\' protective services including CENTER for MISSING AND EXPLOITED. </p>
<p>Questions:
1. Are there any connections between any UK care homes and US politicians or US adoption agencies/etc connected to UK care homes?</p>
<p>With all of this documentation of PEDOGATE IN UK, how can people still doubt this is happening in the US RIGHT NOW?</p>
<p>Are we actually going to have to wait and are the children going to have to wait until he dies for this to come out ABOVE GROUND INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY?</p>',
