            <p>
             Most unsettling of all is that Horizons for Homeless Children is an offshoot of Bright Horizons Family Solutions, the nation’s single largest provider of employee-sponsored childcare with 700 locations and a larger number overseas.

            <p>
             A current director of Bright Horizons is another co-managing partner at Bain named Joshua​ Bekenstein, whose biography mirrors Lavine's in every way except his once having flown to California to post a $500,000 bail for his brother Seth Bekenstein. The charge: purchase and

              The investigation began in December 2010 a few thousand miles away. Homeland Security Investigations agents searched the home of a Vancouver child-porn collector and trader who then agreed to cooperate. Agents assumed his online identity and started emailing the sender of a message that included information on accessing a child-pornography hard drive.
             </p>
             <p>
              The sender, later identified as Seth Bekenstein, emailed hundreds of child-porn images, including photos taken by McVicker, to the agent. Bekenstein, a U.S. citizen living in Mexico, was then arrested when he visited Portland in February 2011. (Bekenstein was sentenced last December to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexual exploitation of minors and transporting child pornography.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Bekenstein then cooperated with authorities, allowing them to assume his online identity to email McVicker, the court filings state. McVicker sent Bekenstein links to several secure, encrypted files that included hundreds of images of child pornography that McVicker had produced in Ecuador, the government memorandum states.

              OPERATION BLUE ORCHID
             </p>
             <p>
              Date: On March 26, 2001, the U.S. Customs Service announced results of an on-going international child pornography investigation called Operation Blue Orchid.
             </p>
             <p>
              Subject: The investigation centered on the Blue Orchid Web site, run by Russian pedophiles for the purpose of posting and selling pictures and videos of young boys being sexually abused.
             </p>
             <p>
              Background: Operation Blue Orchid began in May 2000 when the Moscow Police Department contacted the U.S Customs Attaché for help identifying the owners of the Blue Orchid site. The Attaché requested the Customs Service CyberSmuggling Center in the United States to make an undercover purchase of pornographic materials. The information gleaned from the purchase
             </p>
             <p>
              led Moscow police to two men responsible for producing and distributing a number of tapes depicting sodomy and rape of young boys.
             </p>
             <p>
              Results: Moscow police seized 400 videos, equipment, and billing records. The resulting information led to more than 50 leads around the world. Investigations have been completed in Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands and are ongoing in several other European nations. The U.S. Customs Service has announced four arrests and the execution of fifteen other search warrants across the country.

            <p>
             Roger H. Brown (born 1956, Gainesville, Georgia)[1] is president of Berklee College of Music, cofounder of Bright Horizons Family Solutions, and an international relief agency manager.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brown graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Davidson College with a degree in physics and public policy in 1978.[2] He then spent a year teaching science and math in Kenya before returning to the U.S. to attend Yale School of Management.[2] After his first year at Yale, he and his wife, Linda A. Mason, co-directed Land Bridge, a famine relief program on the Cambodia-Thailand border. Working under the auspices of CARE and UNICEF, the program served as many as 25,000 people a day and was the largest emergency food distribution effort ever attempted.[2] He then returned to Yale, earning a Masters in Public and Private Management in 1982.[3] He and Mason wrote a book about their experiences in Cambodia, Rice, Rivalry, and Politics.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             After graduating, Brown took a job with Boston management consulting firm, Bain and Company, but left in January 1985 to co-direct famine relief efforts in Sudan for Save the Children. The innovative program developed by Brown and Mason established many local food distribution centers, rather than a few centralized ones

It’s also tied into areas of energy, national security, and even environment: mines, pipelines, oil, natural gas, nuclear power (involved in 80% of U.S. nuclear power plants), solar, and even Google Fiber.
