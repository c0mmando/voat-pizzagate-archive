             This new case has some curious bits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Busch was arrested and charged with "statutory rape of a child under 15."  She is 18 now.  Under 15 means the first offense happened over three years ago.  So how did they discover this?  Did they catch him for something else and search his computer?
            </p>
            <p>
             She did not attend the school he taught in, so they don't know how they met yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did the Weiner angle leak?  She was still a minor, normally news outlets keep the identity of underage victims secret.  They don't name her, but she's been on TV, people in that town absolutely know who she is.  So why connect her to this?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Sources told Channel 9 the accuser is the same teen whose text messages led to prison time for former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Also look at this

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I think that would make it 2 years ago not three.  This whole bit seems like speculation.  It seems like the reporter asked Neece about the Weiner angle, but it does not seem this defense attorney actually knows of any Weiner connection.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Former Gaston County prosecutor Michael Neece is now a defense attorney who said any connections between the two cases can't be ignored.

             <p>
              "A defense lawyer is certainly going to be looking into that situation,” Neece said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Investigators haven't spelled out their case against Busch, but Neece said attorneys will likely have conversations with the judge about how evidence in Weiner's case should be viewed in Busch's case.

            <p>
             Are they just speculating or hinting at something?
            </p>
            <p>
             ON the age and the timeline, here's a local report that doesn't mention she is connected to Weiner.  It's also has a different timeline and different ages

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Jonathan Busch, 54, was arrested in Gaston County Thursday on two counts of statutory rape of a child over the age of 15 and two counts of indecent liberties with a child under the age of 16.
.....
Gastonia police said the alleged encounters involved the same girl in 2016 between June 1 and July 31, and then between Sept. 1 and Sept. 21 of the same year.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             If it happened in 2016, then should be would fifteen and this paper has the charges right.  Those dates mean it probably was at the same time she was talking Weiner.   Her story broke in Sept 2016 and say it was "months long."  At mininum that means July to August, August to September.

             In 2017 the  girl told Inside Edition that it was she would made first contact.  She reached out to weiner on twitter claiming she was a huge fan of his.  When asked the reason she reached out to Weiner she said
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "I knew that Hillary Clinton would be running for president in the year 2016," she said. "I wanted to see if Anthony was still up to the same antics."  In this interview. Her father would not show his face on camera but allowed his underage daughter to show her face
             </p>

            <p>
             To Inside Edition she claimed it got inappropriate real fast and she was disgusted.  But the reality was that she kept texting with him for months.  The girl did not go to the police.  Her father did not go to the police.  Instead they sold their story to a UK tabloid. They were paid apparently $30,000 for their story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who What Why says they did a lengthy interview with Chuck C Johnson, the alt-right blogger/reporter.  Johnson who runs GotNews.com says he was the one who introduced the girl to the reporter for the Daily Mail and that he paid his own money to make this happen somehow.  It curious to me that Johnson didn't put this story out on his own news website, but gave it to somebody else. This is him from an AMA in 2016.

              No doubt Weiner is guilty of this and probably more, but I of course agree something else is going on.   You're saying it was a Blackwater/Academi honeypot op from the start?   Prince's association with Trump, you think it's about Frontier and Africa/China too?  I'm still trying to figure what his deal is since he was so closely associated with both Clinton and Obama.
             </p>
             <p>
              And this why Betsy DeVos is SoE?
             </p>
             <p>
              For the sake of argument,in your opinion, what did they use the teacher for, and what deal did the teacher break that exposed him?  Because there is a fishier (literally) connection here, that Blackwater was named after the color of a swamp in North Carolina where BW had their "training grounds".
             </p>
             <p>
              The teacher Busch is from North Carolina.  If we can connect him to Blackwater all of this would make sense.

               I don't really know.   I think more likely the girl and her family had an idea and they reached out to people like Sydney Leathers.....they also reached out the gossip blogger who broke the Sydney Leathers-Weiner story.
              </p>
              <p>
               As they started reached out Chuck Johnson heard about it.    Once it was far enough along Chuck Johnson took it to Eric Prince.

Erik Prince was close to Clinton and Obama?   I don't think that was ever true.   They might have government contracts.  But the Prince family has been hard right for decades.  Their father helped started the very anti-gay, very anti-abortion Family Research Council. James Dobson of Focus on the Family said a eulogy at Prince's father's funeral. In the 2008 campaign, Obama wanted more transparency about using military contractors, but Hillary went further.
Hillary Clinton has just become the most significant US political figure to come out in favor of banning Blackwater and other armed private security contractors from operating in Iraq. “When I am President I will ask the Joint Chiefs for their help in reducing reliance on armed private military contractors with the goal of ultimately implementing a ban on such contractors,” she declared in a major policy speech on Monday.

               Also right after Obama got elected Blackwater made some big changes.
In February 2009, Blackwater announced that it would be once again renamed, this time to "Xe Services LLC", Prince announced his resignation as CEO on March 2, 2009.

               Betty DeVos is certainly SoE because of what her brother did for Trump.  But that would probably be the case outside of this, because he did some other big stuff for Trump.  DeVos is absolutely unqualified to be SoE, btw.   She's a disaster.   Other things Prince did for Trump.

              <p>
               Prince pushed the Weiner NYPD story.   That ties into this, but could be independent of the beginnings of this.  The Weiner NYPD story I believe is certainly a disinfo campaign tied to Prince, Rudy Giuliani and certain FBI agents.

               Prince is under investigation for acting as a back channel for the Trump campaign to the UAE and Russia.  A person who helped set up this meeting, George Nader, adviser to the UAE, says Prince was lying when he told congress he didn't know a Russian emissary would be there.

                 ABC News has since learned that Mueller is also reviewing Prince’s communications, a sign that Mueller could try to squeeze Prince, as he has others, probing potential inconsistencies in his sworn testimony in an attempt to pressure him to turn into a witness against other targets of the investigation. In response to questions from ABC News, a spokesperson for Prince released a statement noting that Prince has provided Mueller with “total access to his phone and computer.”

            Yeah, they threw someone under the bus to detract and complicate. Wiener is ground zero waiting in the lightest possible sentence. I have seen the comments that she is the aggressor already. Is he the Mayor of pedo prison yet? Oh Wiener, ... the weak minded fool! This smells of desperation somehow.

             The magic word to use against anyone that says "she is the aggressor" is victim blaming.

             Now this is where things get concerning. How does a 15 year old become so sexually promiscuous? Receiving sexts from a congressman AND fucking a teacher? Where are the parents? Is she being trafficked?

               At the same time, knowledge is also dangerous, so private entities could also adopt and continue the program as well.

              Parents pressured by Clinton Goons and teacher might be an easy pick. They got the information downloaded. All they had to do was find the easiest perp. They still have to make it believable with the media's help though. Next challenge is to go through the court, and I would imagine the picked the patsy because of his jurisdiction.
