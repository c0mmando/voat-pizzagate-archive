The info is clearly fake, though it appeals to honest truth seekers pretending to expose scandals. Yet every article on it is false - clearly false. So it is made up to distract. Let\'s share together a moment to get over a few articles the site published who all together happen to be BS stories. Lets begin with this TWO major false articles today. </p>
<p><a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/bombshell-wikileaks-leaks-lost-clinton-email/">An image of an supposed EMail form Clinton to Obama.</a> The text is, Clinton would have emailed Obama using blatant code speak - but <strong>no source is provided</strong>. You can see it is a false message, if you have a quick google search on it. There is no such published email. <strong>The story is false.</strong></p>
<p>OK, you say, can happen once? What about this second article:</p>
<p><a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/breaking-biden-turns-hillary-ill-testify-necessary/">BREAKING: BIDEN TURNS ON HILLARY “I’LL TESTIFY IF NECESSARY”</a> <strong>Again, unfortunately no source to back this to-good-to-be-true article. So it is dis-info.</strong></p>
<p>The whole website deserves an exposure. Every article they put up is to discredit truth seekers. Well, you have a look at it. Every fucking article is BS. </p>
<p>Here are a few other BS articles that all together expose this site as a purposely made ur fraud to discredit PizzaGaters.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/intel-reports-confirm-obama-sold-us-secrets-to-n-korea/">Intel Reports Confirm: Obama Sold US Secrets to N. Korea</a>&quot; We all know it is Israel who sells american secrets. Even if Obama did act to be rightfully claimed as such, it still remains dis-info to whats important ATM.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/breaking-feds-raid-obama-bunker-in-search-of-evidence/">BREAKING: FEDS RAID OBAMA BUNKER IN SEARCH OF EVIDENCE</a>&quot; <strong>And again, if this were true, there must be other articles validating this with a SOURCE. But, there aren\'t.</strong> All this websites articles are purely fantasized articles designed for us to jump at, share and talk about it, to make us look as stupids who jump for anything that\'s a conspiracy so that they later can point at it and say how gullible we are. It is purposefully made up distraction.</p>
<p><a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/new-evidence-milo-yiannopolous-assisted-clinton-goons-pedo-ring/">NEW EVIDENCE: MILO YIANNOPOLOUS ASSISTED CLINTON GOONS IN PEDO RING</a> And another time fiction mixed with baseless rumor put together with a fancy headline without sources what so ever. They must think we are damn stupid to not figure this to be a falsehood website.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://undergroundnewsreport.com/the-truth/report-michelle-obama-underwent-sex-change-surgery-in-2016/">Michelle Obama had a sex change operation in 2016</a>&quot; That\'s of course a lie. The hormonal change was done prolly some 15 years ago, certainly not 2016. The adding of the year &quot;2016&quot; gives it away. It is purposely made up with errors to discredit truthseekers. Sure thing Michelle is a tranny. Nothing against trannies - but against lying. And that is what the whole system does. </p>
<p>Of course is Michelle Obama a tranny. Joan Rivers had an unexpected surgery over which she died after she had a moment of truth, here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KjdMtSQSs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KjdMtSQSs</a> You can find more about here unexpected surgery shortly after having this slip of tongue, f.e. here: <a href="http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2014/09/michelle-obama-is-man.html">http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2014/09/michelle-obama-is-man.html</a>  
</p>
<p>But the Website undergroundnewsreport.com is a scam website with the only purpose to discredit PizzaGaters and other truthseekers as gullible. Let\'s not fall for this. Just like the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ayzdy/some_thoughts_about_the_pizzarelated_handkerchief/">reddit article about the handkerchief</a> - go read that to see disinfo of an even higher order. That article deserves to be taken apart in a single thread. Its disinfo is very sophisticated.</p>
<p>So you all watch out what you share. Maybe sometime, you want to focus on what you really can verify - or what the authorities need to verify (so being f.e., the Podesta\'s-Wiener sketches related to the abduction of Madeleine MCCain).</p>

Does this mean you are a geographical bigot?
Or was that sneer in your tone an honest mistake. Like a child desperate to look tough?
That would be cute in a school yard, but not for adult subjects.

            Its a clickbait fake news site that exists to get clicks, i doubt its a coordinated attack on anyone.
At the very most its a psy-op to undermine peoples faith in alternate news sources.
More realistically its just clickbait to lure in consiracicsts to appease their advertisers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have called out several people i know for citing these sites, they are a plague for sure, but its a great lesson in fact checking. Unfortunately some people really do get fucked over by believing this shit

            Talking of disinformation, have you guys seen this? It looks like a new PIZZAGATE has popped up, maybe to distract from the real one?
Iceland’s president waded into the fray last week when a student asked him a question about pineapple on pizza.
By Tuesday Jóhannesson was forced to back down from his remarks on banning it after a social media storm, dubbed pizzagate, erupted.

            Seriously, what evidence would it take to prove to a flat-Earther that the earth is a spheroid?
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, low earth orbit transcontinental flight is maybe ten years off as a common thing. Or would they find a loophole in their own observations as passengers? "It's drugs! It's video footage on the windows!"?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems more like an ideological stance. That evidence itself isn't evidence. How do you prove anything?

             Anyone who's taken a flight in excess of 500 miles sitting in a window seat is a direct witness to earth curvature. I've got dozens of photos to disprove flat earth. I can't believe that flat earth is believable by the millions of people who've personally witnessed the earth's curvature.

            Did you guys hear about the snowflake cry baby liberal fake news site that reports on the world as though Hillary Won?!

            EXAMPLE:
WASHINGTON D.C. -- At a moving White House ceremony freighted with historic symbolism, President Hillary Rodham Clinton awarded her predecessor, President Barack Obama, the Congressional Medal of Freedom on Wednesday, calling him, "one of America's greatest presidents."
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton's close relationship with Obama has only grown more intimate since she defeated failed GOP candidate Donald Trump by 3 million votes in November, becoming the first woman to be elected president.

            Well.  If the public can finally get the message that the MSM is lying, that will be the start of something good.  We can haggle about the rest of it after they swallow that bitter pill.  Whether it's with a fake site or whatever, getting them to see they've been lied too.  I saw tweets today about what might be coming in the CNN stuff.  This could be big.

             replies like urs keep me going actually. so thank you. while u got the same conclusions as i did, feel free to contribute good stuff to. this site is clearly run over by shills. i say it again, i bet around 50% of all comments would vanish if no shills were involved. its striking. anyway. thx anon

             I had to post this up to Steemit as it was getting passed around there as well.

            Apparently they wrote a

             new article

            Yep. I'm sure there will be many more to come as they continue panicking. I saw this the other day and was initially hopeful but soon realized it had to be fake. Validate the source before depending on it

            Very good post. Thank you for making sure this is clear with everybody. For many, this is how they became redpilled, so they do not yet know all the games and tricks Tavistock  will throw at them. I knew Milo was a contrived character and would be used to confuse everybody about what is going on. Been aware of what has happened years before PG. Also, be ready for the reality that there will be no meaningful arrest, and they will stretch this out until it gets old and becomes clear that nobody, law enforcement or citizen, will do anything about it. Never forget they got away with 9/11 despite the fact that a massive amount of the population became aware, yet most of those same people still voted, went to the movies, bought music from their industry etc. They will wait this out. What do any of us intend to do about it? No matter how much you reveal, and for how long, they will simply not arrest themselves. Won't happen. Let me know when you are all ready to denounce Trump. I give it 2 months tops.

            The fact that someone would waste their time to sign up in an attempt to discredit the myriad of rabbit holes we go down is a direct indicator that they are either insane or paid.  No rational person would waste their time otherwise.

            YES.  I saw pic today of comet w the ping pong adult jacking off w the alien child at other end. someone wrote "SKIPPY" and photo shopped this ON THE PIC.  it's not there on the "original".  it's soooo hard to know what is original and what is edited.  be careful.  try to verify with at least 2-3 sources before you share.  this mis info is on purpose to hurt the truth movement.  esp w pizzagate.  we KNOW there is teeth in pizzagate.  too much is stacking up.  I don't know what happened to the supposed child porn set to DC police.  we should all email

            u name titus frost disinfo? that alone discredits any statement of urs, as far as im concerned. his three documentations were right on spot when they got published. a few things i would have made differently but overall they were right on. so IMHO u just discredited urself. lets see if we find a mod who figures if u do contribute good things too or only shout wolf at this forum.

             I suspect GonnaNeedMorePrisons is an armyseer alt.  There are many reasons to believe armyseer himself is a shill pretending to call out shills, such as his extremely tenuous reasons for labeling important researchers as shills, as well as at least one case of outright misrepresentation of fact.

              yeah. thanks for the reply. while it is so easy to register i guess it just doesnt make sense to block every shill for they come back then again and again. so thanks anyway. we need to stick with good writers instead. thanks

            I saw this "email evidence" (the first link) the other day on twitter...Its so poorly written and stupid that I hope most ppl will know its fake...But I thought the same...they're gonna flood the internet with BS to muddy the waters. I mean...if you write an email to someone you work closely with everyday and have known for 10 years you DON'T write: Dear Barak,  ...thats just one example but if you've read her other REAL wikileaks emails its clearly fake.

             Yeah but you know they are going to suck at it. I mean that fake email is really bad. It's not even in the same format, different font, no email addresses listed or even subject line ffs

            These are excellent observations. I wonder if the goal is to flood the internet with so much disinformation that the sheeple do a quick Google search and look at the first 5 results which say "XXXX is fake bullshit."
           </p>
           <p>
            Honest to God, if you had asked me a year ago if I thought all of these mass shootings were fake, I would've laughed in your face.  Today, I spent about 2 hours working on an analysis titled "Facebook Mourning - Something Isn't Right."  I started digging into Newtown.  No, I'm not covering new ground, I'm just looking at what is out there.  I am comparing that to similar, recent events like Ft. Lauderdale Airport, Pulse Nightclub, and of course, Comet Ping Pong.  The more I dig, the more I think all of these, and more events are faked.  Staged.  TRAINEX.  Live Action Roe Playing.  Whatever you want to call it.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They" are close to mastering the art of controlling information and perception.  Perception is reality.  Imagine what will happen if they get Google, FB, and a few others under complete control?

            1984 is upon us.  And the funny part is - 1984 is the #1 selling fiction book in the DC area, going to Dem zip codes.  They think Trump is going to go Orwell on them.  Crazy shit.

             I was just thinking the same thing...they are going to flood the internet with so much fake news that people in desperation will return to MSM to look for the "real" scoops..or so they hope. Looks like 1984 isn't fiction, it was a handbook. Plus, many people seem content to live in a virtual reality described by the elites and performed by actors. Control is easily maintained by fear of ridicule. Government dossiers are created by the subjects themselves in the form of forums like these, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Clever, really.

            People also need to check Wikileaks Email ID's. This started back when Wikileaks started releasing info in such volume no individuals could keep up. A bunch of people started posting fake emails they created from scratch, with fake email ID's and everything. People were sharing them and I was chasing them around twitter saying stop being fools. Check the fucking email ID's. Short time later fake articles started coming up on multipole sites like something The Onion would create. It was ALL made to discredit everything by association.
           </p>
           <p>
            More than one news outlet pointed to one of these emails and reports as "evidence" that no one could believe ANY of it in an attempt to help HRC. Obviously it didn't work, but tha method of attack has stuck. EVERYONE better fact check all their shit. The better it seems, the more likely you are reading something that's not even real.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get the part where some people want to be the first person to find something and share it with everyone digging through the evidence in the most public way they can like Social Media, but you make us ALL look very bad when you spread the fake stuff. Everything is then fake by association to many people. SO even though it takes twice as long, and sometimes more, VERIFY EVERYTHING. One bad post in an entire subverse that gains traction can give people legitimately looking for info on whats really going on reason to pause and doubt ALL of the things they have read there. Some of these people may actually be Dems trying to find out if their own party is playing them for fools, so the last thing any of us want that devote hours or days per week to investigating things are fake stories mixed in with our hard work.

             I have been saying that about other things, mainly the fake WorldCorp site for weeks. No one wants to believe that it's fake. They're flying off on emotions rather than intelligent analysis. It's hurting the truth.

             Thanks for speaking up. They'll attack you for it though. :(

              hey, i did get ur reply just now. im totally with u on that worldcorp is a set-up! it is nothing of value there. it is an open website - who would put up CP there? it just a bog fuzz and nothing substantial. now everybody talking about podesta is not talking that he has a cannibalism picture at his office but that the voice of that worldcorp video "must be his" - which is totally unsubstantiated! it is merely distraction. i totally agree with what u just said. thanks.
             </p>
             <p>
              also i find around 50% of all comments distraction. its astonishing at once. when u see through this, it is a whole brigade of shills, also here, at this very moment.

               So what is the deal with that video thats supposed to be Podesta anyway? It does sound like him, I'll admit that. The accent is spot on too. Obviously there is nothing close to enough in that video to confidently say its him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whats most confusing to me though, is I have no idea where the hell it came from, where people claim its from, etc. I heard comet had a server housing some data, but nothing I saw proved that either.

               That's the thing. WorldCorp troll site has zero illegal content. And certainly nothing half as shocking as Mr. Hands which anyone can google and watch. For most of the people currently on this site the WorldCorp site is horrifying but I'm like...meh, one man one jar...that's horrifying. I was dying over the feather duster up the ass.

               . It's impossible to source the Fatherhood video from anywhere other than youtube. But they won't stop. The funny bit is they keep adding to the site. It's keeping everyone busy.

                  well, maybe i got rough at ya. that was not intended. my point is, that we r clear worldcorp is distracting, with keeping ppl from arguing over important leads rather, but making ppl talk about if that voice would belong to podesta. and what follows that established fact, is a discussion about the voice and podesta. this all makes no sense. i bet u, most distracting comments - to a large degree - are actually shill-comments. i bet here are some shills working day and night with multiple profiles acting as if ppl would care for this nonsense, stirring normal ppl into it. thats the point. and when we made this clear a few comments above, what happens, is, that someone starts about the voices again. u see the pattern?

                   They keep pushing that site. It's incredible. It's really disconcerting that people are so easily duped. Of course the video sounds like Podesta now. The audio has been altered. The original video voice had a Boston accent and child screamed a two syllable name that was either DARREN or TERRENCE.

                   I realize people have a hard time believing someone would make a fake site, but they clearly don't realize how easy it is to throw up a site and stick archive stuff on there knowing full well people in the know would see the globe and cyrillic text and take up the sword. Which they did.

             Veritas is exposing the media this week. Specifically CNN from insider videos. Not sure there's anything PG related expected.  AND WTF have I been trying to get through the hard heads pushing WorldCorp? It's fake on purpose. To distract and discredit. People keep falling for that shit.

            Thanks for this. I hate real fake news more than anything. I would call msm deceptive and biased news..but this is true fake news. Sometimes I think that people just don't care if it's true if it fits their narrative. That is a dangerous place to live.

             can we agree not to argue what questions u raised but agreeing on that michelle obama clearly WAS NOT undergoing a sex-change
             <strong>
              IN 2016
             </strong>
             ? thats the main point of this posting. so lets not get into if she was a man once or hasent been made into a female artificially - but
             <strong>
              she certainly hasnt been made a female in 2016 - so this does serve as evidence that the website clearly is without a shadow of a doubt distraction

             its just annoying how blatant they move onward with this. If you want to read something more sophisticated, look at the reddit article linked above about the handkerchief. That article qualifies as a masterpiece of dis-info.. First the major reddit got deleted. Then this was put up. The author circumvents to talk about the facts and does pretty well, in stirring discussion about nonsense. And this is now the second google hit if you google "handkerchief pizzagate". So it is a must if you were to write today about that, to include not to read that article for it is a master-piece of distraction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe someone takes the time to tear it apart? I discussed with youtube-shills a lot. You need to know how to manipulate in order to get what they are doing with this. In that case, they had the power to not only write that a good article, but to make disappear the original reddit thread and have this one now to show up as a google hit, right after the actual email which itself doesnt provide much. it serves as distraction, too.

              looking at the various false flags that have been happening over the years i used to be surprised at how sloppy some of them were executed. the sloppiness has continued into their pizzagate coverup. they really are this sloppy and transparent. the emperor has no clothes

                 Well the thought that gives me hope is that although they have always been many steps ahead of us, now this whole mess has thrown a monkey wrench into their plans and they are panicking and really have to be careful how they react because they are revealing themselves in their actions and overreactions. I think if we keep doing what we are doing and hope that the few honest members in govt and law enforcement etc know that we got their backs, it will be a big help. It really feels as if there are internal forces wanting to end the trafficking, end the blackmail and I hope seeing us keep on banging it out will give them even more courage to overthrow these tyrants. We may have a legit revolution on our hands but we still need to convince the decent if not VERY confused people who refuse to really look at PG. I have a feeling after all this PG goes down, the tensions between left and right will mellow out a bit because in the end it's really about the kids. That and it's gonna be pretty hard to defend these people after they're in jail(or FEMA camps. or hanging from the gallows..)

                  They've never had to defend themselves like this before. No wonder it's all so transparent. Their forte is building on the lie and deception and plugging tiny holes in a fishing boat. Well, this time, we're the iceberg to their Titanic. They've never before had to defend themselves from so many forces at once. It often feels like we're absolutely drowning in disinformation and shills, but all that means is that they're in far more danger than we are.

                  not to sound dramatic but this is a war for the human race and the human soul. for does a race deserve to exist if it lets the most helpless and innocent among them suffer the worst physical and psychological torture and death? fatherhood.webm is pure red pill. everyone should download that file and play it for anyone who wants to stick their head in the sand.

                   I'm not sold on fatherhood being podesta but it doesn't matter anyway, its all obviously true. But I do agree this at its highest level is a spiritual war. Which is why I feel we will be victorious.

                    I agree that at the core this is a war of choice.  (I'm not christian btw)
I also think the "other" side of the domino will use it to gain momentum. I've researched these groups who use trauma as friction//energy as they want to gain more through it.

                     Well I'm not Christian either per se but spirituality transcends all religion. Regardless I think there is power in belief and these sick fucks have sick beliefs. But winner goes to those with truth and love on their side. Not saying it will be easy but the deck is stacked against these demons

             I do not believe this has been created to lure us.   I think it is placed there for the media to 'find'.   Much like the swastika graffiti and white supremacist flyers being left about in my area.   Some in the media play along, the rest are just too gullible to question it.  The problem they have with Pizzagate is that they can't pick up any of our evidence and disprove it.  So what is their solution?  Make their own fake pizzagate, so they can put it on the news and debunk it easily.

              They're so lame with the shariablue "nazi" crap against Jewish centers. WE SEE THROUGH YOU, YOU DUMB FUCKS! They seem to forget we have them ON video plotting to "bird dog" Trump rally's and even using old ladies to do it. The thing that is ridiculous is Pence going out there and giving it any form of credibility.

               Yes!  Remember that black church that was burned to the ground, with 'Vote Trump' spray painted on the side?  It turned out it was a black member of the church that did it, not white supremacists:

                I'd be down for a cool mill on that bet. This was a coordinated attack. Has Soros and co written all over it. The actual neo nazis we have here live in trailers, can't read, and certainly can't coordinate nation wide. Give me a break.

             This is exactly what I thought when I read their piece about the 'Lost WikiLeaks Email'. It had me laughing so hard. I cant believe anyone could take it seriously enough to be angered by it. They included Ben Affleck as one of the addressees FFS!

             Yes, their is a satanic raping torturing murdering cult that runs western society, but you scoff at the other things you have not looked into. You should either look into them, or consider that your programing is still not shaken. Incredulous post despite what you have learned always strike me as thick.

               Your mockery includes legitimate evidence. You imply a humor site with conspiracy theorists to retard the evidence.
Then you reply with Flat Earth innuendo to make sure we all know your agenda and contempt.
Did I miss anything? Ah, yes. Fuck Off.

                Well this turned into a direction I didn't expect....
I'll note that having an opinion about a theory that one doesn't agree with isn't necessarily some agenda or even contempt. It's simply a comment.

             I saw a video of her and she looks like she is alive and well.  I could care less either way, but sometimes it seems the have a fake death to "retire" them and put them out of the spotlight for good. It is possible that this is the case. We can believe they kill their own to silence them, but our reaction is to be doubtful they fake deaths to stop people from running their mouths and put them put out of commision. Question everything. They lie about everything.
