<p>Mentioning of Awan: &quot;“I’ve been following the arrest of Awan – this is a guy whose name came up a couple of times in my investigation as someone that I should look at,” he said in a phone call to WND Wednesday. “I never really got a chance to look at them in the investigation – but what I did do – I met with the Capitol Hill investigators.&quot;</p>
<p>Did Rich attend an IT party on night of his death?</p>
<p>Wheeler for the first time mentions that through his investigation he learned Seth was at an IT party before going to Lous city bar the night he was murdered. Wheeler said he was determined to learn more about the IT party and who was in attendance, but all his questions have gone unanswered.</p>
<p>“Seth attended that party, and I wanted to know who else was at that party. But I could never find out,” Wheeler said. “When I went back to ask other people who should have known who was at that party – these were people who were close to Seth – they told me, ‘You don’t need to know who was at that party because it had nothing to do with his death.\'”</p>
<p>Uncovering more details about the attendees of the party is essential in the Rich homicide investigation, Wheeler contends.</p>
<p>“He was at the party before he went to the bar. What you do in a murder investigation is you work backward. You want to trace the victim’s steps as far back as you can – who was that person around the day before? – as far back as you can,” he said. “What was interesting is when I am told as an investigator that I don’t need to talk to people who were at the party. It makes you wonder why.”</p>
<p>Might be worth us trying to look into who could have been at this alleged IT party.</p>',

            The cat and mouse game is getting old fast. LEAs know the fucking score and need to do their fucking job, or one day someone is going to assume the role and throw the feet dragging cops in the hole with the people they should have arrested to begin with.

            Wow this is huge, if true that Seth was at an IT party. I'm thinking Awans would've definitely been there. Good news today with Trump firing Priebus and promoting General Kelly to Chief of staff. Hopefully this is the break we've been looking for. Awans lawyer statement bringing up pizzagate to. Damn.

            I would like to stress a few things, having watched a great deal of George Webb on YT.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't mean to ignore your post, but, getting to the root of it, the Awan's is where our attention is being steered. Just be aware of that.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The whole Webb family is suspect. Dave Acton and the fact they turned out to be brothers. They openly admit to being Mossad
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews always use Arabs as their pets / tools - just like they use blacks in America - and then throw them under the bus when things go south
            </li>
            <li>
             Webbs youtube spiel was probably to groom 'truthers' into focusing on the Awans, and make them ignore people like Janet Yellen (jew) who are about to crash the world economy - or slugs like Kissinger who probably are high up in these human trafficking rings...
            </li>
            <li>
             It's come out the Awan's are perverts subscribe to weird paedo youtube channels. All these people entrapped like this, with paedophilia, I ahve to think are just tools. If they're stupid enough to be embroiled in that stuff, they're being used.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            quote Webb
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pei-DIGHg3c">
             'I like Kissinger'.

            Was it really an IT party??
           </p>
           <p>
            There were playing the UFC fights at the bar that Seth Rich was at on July 9. It would have started at 10PM EST.
           </p>
           <p>
            when this whole Seth Rich thing first went down there was an event page for the UFC event Lou's City Bar, with a list of attendees and those invited... however it was deleted from the facebook page very quickly when people started digging in to Lou's City Bar... deleted  before I could archive or save anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the reason why I assumed Seth Rich left late because the fights finished in the early morning hours, this is all assuming is if he was there for the fights. He could have just been there the same day they had that event.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a major event too, so there had to have been lots of people going to see it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just putting this information out there... I wish I had saved the list of people attending.

             I'm aware of the ufc200 event at Lous City bar.
             <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ufc%20200%20seth%20rich&amp;src=typd">

            </p>
            <p>
             I think Wheeler said he was at the party BEFORE going to Lous City Bar. For all we know the IT gathering was in the morning or afternoon. Even if it was later that evening at 10 or so, Seth may not have been such a huge fan of the UFC as some of us and got to the bar late to just see the Lesnar event. So its possible he attended the IT Party and also went to Lous.

            It is ridiculous that every place and every person that Seth Rich had contact with that day, or even the last couple of days, were not even questioned. That is not how it works. Especially considering who he worked for. It's so obvious that there is a coverup.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a theory I've heard on YouTube where they think it's possible that an Awan brother was the one that leaked to Wikileaks and was using the information he had against them to blackmail Hillary, Debbie Wasserman Shultz. He had Debbie's password. He had access to all their emails. What if that's why he was on the payroll of so many, even after he was let go.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that's it's true. But, it's another theory.

             Interesting, but then why would Awan leak information to Wikileaks if his intent was to hold onto information in order to blackmail others with it?
            </p>
            <p>
             And then there is the fact that Assange basically admitted it was Seth Rich during an interview with a Dutch news channel. Plus he offered a reward for info on Rich's murder- Wikileaks has never done this before. This is strong circumstantial evidence it was Rich.

              Good questions. I question all that too. I don't know if anyone posted this, but I saw yesterday that there is a picture out now where it shows Seth Rich at a party with Imran Awan. Seth Rich and Imran Awan posed together for a picture with a bunch of other guys and they looked happy. I don't know if this was taken at the IT party that Seth Rich attended the day he died. But, it does show that they attended parties together. So, what if they were working together? What if it was Seth that gave it to Wikileaks, but it was the both of them gathering the data? Awan had access to everything!
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Why would Awan leak the info to Wikileaks if his intent was to hold that over them to use as blackmail?
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Think about this. Awan had access to several politicians emails. Democrats and republics. He even had the password to Debbie Wasserman Shultz things. He had access to even more than Seth Rich did. So, what if they weren't taking him serious so he released some to prove a point and said listen to me or I release more.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Awan brothers were being paid 3 times more than others doing the same job. Even after being fired, Shultz kept him on the payroll. He was also being paid by several other democrats. Why would they do this? Why did the whole family make millions over a 5 year period? Could it possibly be because he (or they) had a lot more dirt on the politicians than we even realize and he's been blackmailing them?

             would explain Awan's lawyer's use of the word "pizzagate" as code warning to top DNC pedophiles - Awan has the pizzagate blackmail goods as insurance, and he needs high level help now or he will spill the beans

              Ding ding ding. This pretty much sums up my sentiment. If he is still alive by the end of August, I'll be surprised.

              The use of the word "pizzagate" in the legal response to Awan's arrest is stunning.

               Thats most certainly not Imran Awan. Whoever mentioed that is putting disinfo. I've done research on his friends and the man being pointed at is Seths longtime friend Miguel Huerta. Handle is MiguelP27. Def not Imran Awan.

               I don't see Awan living beyond the next week. If Seth Rich was a liability to the DNC/CIA, then the Awans are the motherload of secrets and knowledge of crimes. I just don't see how they can avoid being suicided...

                Yep...  Prison is not a good place for a pedo.  He is probably a coward, just like the rest of them.  They are a bunch of pussies unless they have the government behind them.

            Super odd statement. Wouldn't that alone make anyone want to investigate?

            It would irrelevantly already have to be part of the police official investigation from the start though wouldn't you think?

              They really are. And I'm not being as hard on them as I want to be because they did lose a son but ... ???? What gives with them? Are they so brainwashed they don't want to hear the truth if it means them having to stop idolizing a cannibalistic wombat?

               There's a theory out there that Aaron was helping Seth to leak. Maybe there were several involved in trying to take down the clinton machine. If Aaron was involved, then that explains why he wants to shut people from looking into it. Its def a possibility. People finding out he was involved means his life would be at risk. So that could explain the sense of urgency in him wanting to keep people from further looking into it. Maybe the parents know Aaron is involved and by their letting the investigation go on, that could further put their sons life at risk. Or perhaps Clinton and crew know Aaron was involved but they are keeping him alive as a way to shut the parents up. Basically telling Aaron, "You speak, you die." and the family " YOu speak, your other son dies". This would explain their behavior, but who knows, we may never know.

                Conjecture is nice, but we have to deal with known facts. One of those known facts is that they asked Clinton for a signed photo for Seth's
                <s>
                 skank
                </s>
                , I mean, girlfriend. That completely contradicts the intimation rumor that is floating around like a bad smell. They were like lap dogs when The Cannibal Queen visited ... and did everything but lick her face.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't think they known anything except how to grovel to the image HRC projects. If Seth and/or were involved in the leaks (and I believe Seth was), then he definitely didn't tell his parents. I'm sure he loved them, but there's no way he'd confide in either one of them ... never.
