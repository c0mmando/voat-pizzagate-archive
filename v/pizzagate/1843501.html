            This makes me wonder quite a bit if she accepted bribes from american companies for special treatment, and because the media is owned by 6 companies, they are keeping it under wraps.

            Just for more information what was released that 4 chan is analyzing in linking Macron (France Pres) to spirit Cooking. Also linked to the South Korean Ex-Pres who was forced out of office due to Satanic paractices, allowing staff to read classified information&amp; giving financial favors to friends. Sound familiar.
           </p>
           <p>
            This happened in October with millions of South Koreans taking to the streets. I mean millions there was literally no room between human beings that flooded the streets of Seoul. Not one MSM journalist reported on it. President Obama made no statement and they are our ally.
           </p>
           <p>
            The President of South Korea was linked to the Moonies cult which then was linked to the Bushes &amp; the Clinton's. Photographs were even leaked. The Moonies were then leaked to Alefantis properties, Hubbard properties etc. in DC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Macron is an agent of the Rothschilds. He worked in a Rothschild bank in a very high position. He came out of nowhere is right. He is chosen &amp; groomed just like Obama. He was a 15 year old who married his 40 year old teacher. It has been leaked he is actually gay and the whole thing is a sham.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now it has been leaked Macron and his "wife" son are actually together and the marriage is a cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NK part comes in as part of the Wikileaks Vault 7 pre- release as well. They showed an image of the seed bank in Norway where countries store "seeds" for vegetation and food to regrow should doom wipe out the planet. They also posted a picture of the Nazi Vault where the Nazi's stored all their gold.
           </p>
           <p>
            A video has now been released showing an interview inside the seed Vault where a tour is given and the worker explains and even shows various storage containers of seeds by country. She even mentions North Korea has a space next to the US...very strange.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is asked about packaging and she states no one at the seed bank knows what is in the countries individual containers. They just receive them and store them.
           </p>
           <p>
            How is that F...no possible? These selfish bastards want to depopulate the earth and have their elite bloodlines survive. That was the Nazi's work genetic engineering. Wonder if "seed" means other things?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did wikileaks release those pictures?
Why the sudden near hysterical attention to North Korea right after DJTrump takes office, but literally the entire South Korean population were marching in the streets over a Satanic corrupt president and Obama does and says nothing?

            ) leftist government sponsored pedo ring Jeju International English Village, after a class full of kids came to me saying they were groomed / touched. 
That link above is the cunt operating that illegal unlicensed pedo ring camp making the countries education law. I did a miniwon (Korean government slang for FOI) and the guy didn't even have a degree to his name, yet he was making educational policy for the whole country because he was a child pimp.

            Put the same Korean experts looking at 4 chan on the image file attached here to prove i'm not joking.

            I wasn't surprised after the SeaWol (Ferry) shit went down, there is dark satanic shit linked to Korean politics. A mass child sacrifice on an auspiscious day for the occult, whilst all the children were ordered to film their own deaths on their smartphones as the captain jumped ship, later to kill himself in guilt for what he was put up to do. There were on the way to Jeju where that pedo camp I fought to shut down on the national news but was sued for truthful defamation by the Korean Police so I had to leave Korea.  There is also this cult that hasn't got any attention from the media that worship the ring. Won Bul, a Buddhist cult that's also a rival faction to the satanists. They freak out the locals as much as them, at least from my life experience.

            From my look over the note, it's authentically wrote by a native Korean. But you need an expert on Choseon Language, which is basically Korean with loan words from China instead of English. Also with the torpedo incident with the cheonan warship going down, the torpedoes were marked with 1-bon not 1-ho, the latter being Cheoson number prefix. That showed the markings of the false flag. The only other people that had the same torpedoes as the South Korean's were the Germans and the Jews. I am personally aware of the Yangpyeong Island shelling incident being a western orchestrated false flag to force the North to respond, and I have personally caught Fox News and the ABC publishing fake news when I was in Korea teaching English for the Pyeongtak 2nd Fleet HQ (Korean) brass'es kids.

            Only after diligent investigation can we get to the bottom of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a university in Seoul that specializes in North Korea / North Korean politics. I could use my contacts to get someone to hand-deliver the note to them for analysis and feedback. I wouldn't trust the Korean government with wiping it's arse it's so corrupt, and it just had KNIS have their logo re-worked to be the same as the satanic cult in power now. If the leftists DUP Minjoo scum got in it would have been worse. The two party system - is a less of a democracy than communism at least from my trips around the world.

            Ya...reminds me of Obama. Some unknown guy becomes President. They were both groomed fo sure. That Dennis Montgomery audio basically says Obama was born in Kenya and the Birth Certificate was fake.

            It would be about control through fear. I've read only enough about them to make me seriously wonder. And enough to not worry anymore about some nuclear conflagration that will destroy the world. I'm more concerned about what took the twin towers down, per Dr. Judy Wood's hypothesis.

            THIS IS FROM MACRON'S HACKED EMAILS ON 4 CHAN;  The Macron leaks contain secret proposals that would lead to the islamisation of France and Europe. These are shown in a Powerpoint presentation which appears to have come from the Institut Montaigne. Harmonising education between countries on different sides of the Mediterranean is one of the key objectives. Create a common history textbook with Italy, Spain, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia (3) in order to put in historical perspective the mutual contributions and religious convergences between the two shores of  the Mediterranean - to develop a sense of belonging to a common history -to create a common base of objective historical knowledge founded on the logic of a historical "draw" [stalemate] of the Mediterranean' Within the 3+3 framework, we recommend the creation of a commission of historians responsible for drawing up a common history textbook. The aim of this work will be: . -to create a common base of objective historical knowledge founded on the logic of a historical "draw" [stalemate] - to develop a sense of belonging to a common history- to reduce the fantasies of victimisation on one side as well as civilisational superiority on the other The document also recommends the introduction of Arabic teaching to French schools, including bi-lingual classes. This is justified by with the claim that Muslims are currently getting their "Arabic fix" from mosques, where they risk being radicalised. I previously noted that "soft islamisation" is being advocated as the remedy for "hard islamisation" and that this represents a kind of de facto reward being offered to jihad violence. Jihad gets results. It leads to societies being islamised, one way or the other.Other plans for measures to islamise France include facilitating mosque construction by making it easier to arrange finance for it and providing reserved Muslim areas in municipal cemeteries. Again this is justified by claiming that it will lead to the emergence of a "French Islam *****   Assuming the doc is authentic - my initial response is that this is about appeasement in the sense that France knows they're stuck with Muslims. So in order to placate them and to stop their explosive murderous nature they want to find a way to invite Muslims into the larger conversation and pretend they contributed something to the development of France.

              Yes again I am sorry for the print, but the information scared me immensely.  This is there global plan, for us here as well.  They want to strip us of our history and past.  Want to make sure our children do not know what happened, no way to learn from mistakes, THEIR Mistakes.  I am hoping enough young people checked the 4 chan site to make a difference.  Macron is another Obama and Trudeau, a brainwashed robot.

               This world is seriously turning into a gigantic Sodam and Gomorrah.  And I can't understand how those falling for the Political Correctness crap do not see they are being used as slaves for the agenda of Globalists. Well, I guess they are brain washed through education (or lack of it) but the parents are just as guilty.

               If tomorrow there was only enough food and water for 500,000 world wide, these same slave people would be left to die and the top tier Globalists wouldn't bat an eye.

                Yes I totally agree.  Our elections are carbon copies of their chosen candidates due to their fake news.  We have the outcomes we have due to election fraud by OUR officials and they always point fingers at Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela. Today  I am hoping to God the Young French People have the insight to see the forest through the trees.

            Note that "chef" in French is "chief", so that kinda translates to "spiritual leader", and may not be related to "spirit cooking".
           </p>
           <p>
            Or that the term "chef spiritual" was noticed by some english speaker and started a meme about "spirit cooking"?

             You are right.

             Chef = Leader

             Chef de cuisine = Kitchen boss
            </p>
            <p>
             But with the popularity of French cooking, the shortened Chef became a fancy way to designate the head cook elsewhere in the world starting in the 70s.
            </p>
            <p>
             In French "Chef Spirituel" cannot be associated with cooking, it can only mean "spiritual leader", the same as a "Pope" or cult leader.
