            Yes, Kessler is a jew. Other Alt-Right figures involved in the staged protest:
           </p>
           <p>
            Mike Enoch - jew alt-righter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Spencer - the most visible figurehead of the Alt-right, agent and student of his mentor, PaulGottfried, the jew who coined the Alt-right name and was perhaps its primary inventor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Baked Alaska - Buzzfeed and Warner Bros. marketer who managed jew shill Milo Yinnopoulous' speaking tour in 2015. An obvious shill, perhaps a jew himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Augustus Invictus - you guys are gonna "love" this - an OTO and Thelemite satanist, obvious fan of Crowley who is libertarian by day and drinker of goat blood by night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Matthew Heimbach - plays the role of the traditionalist Christian, but has received unusually much airtime in the mainstream media. His ex-girlfriend was the rabid jew zionist Ashley Rae Goldenberg, also an alr-righter. A good chance that Heimbach himself is a jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            The event in Charlottesville was filled to the brim with government agents, paid actors and some useful idiots. It took place on jew Soros' birthday - what are the odds. Of course his BLM and Antifa were there to oppose the government-created Alt-right. Probably that woman didn't really die and for sure the accident was a false flag operation. Driver was a jew, so was his mother (assumed to be his real parent) who was interviewed in a staged fake video wherein she doesn't prove herself to be much of a crisis actor.
           </p>
           <p>
            All fake. As the jew Lenin said, "the best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves". And that is exactly what they do. Look at a number of "neo-nazi" and "far-right" groups and you will soon find that they are mostly either created or soon eventually co-opted by jews and freemasons. Same with KKK. The whole point of the Charlottesville debacle was to sow seeds of discord in society and defame real white nationalists opposed to the genocide of their people. Other reason too, of course. And all this because of a statue of some freemason confederate general? Yeah right.

              I found another exposure of the Charlottesville Riots from a different reporter live streaming it - Was he in on the plot, you decide, I have decided he knew all about what was going on before it took place, ie it was STAGED imo:- (long but worth the watch if you want to know the truth) by YouTuber - SonofNewo - Analyzing Charlottesville's Zapruder Film: the Ford Fischer LiveStream

            noticed that fake news site YourNewsWire, has changed its name to NewsPunch. If this story is true, we need to spread this everywhere.

            I am sickened by the pervert from Vice having sex with a childlike doll. Obama was so decent that he let that pervert interview him. Wow. Can you imagine if the roles were reversed and it was Trump that allowed himself to be interviewed by a trashy pervert?

             We found other brothels where you can get schoolgirls who will chain themselves up to a fake train, so we can mimic groping them in a train. And we found another one where they’re in schools, doing math at the board, and we just go up and ravage them. It’s a very civilized, superior country, Japan. Lots for any fetish.”

              <p>
               He ravished praise on another liberal 'journalist"  bob costa

              <p>
               He definitely loves him some Obama

               He fits in nicely with CNN.

                Snopes talked to CNN a week ago.   Seems to be also a third Jason Kessler who works in politics as well who was confused with this Jason Kessler.

                I'm not even addressing the thrust of your post, because I think knee-jerk false flag theorizing is silly. I think is just a psychological defense mechanism and I've never going to get you to admit he's a True Scotsman.

                I'm just pointing out the CNN Kessler is a different guy.

               <p>
                *wait, I just got what you are talking about, you're saying CNN is biased if this guy DID work for CNN.  NOT if it CNN's Kessler was a different guy.

             Wow. So many sheep follow along, not even realizing that they are being lied to and used for elite's agenda. They are blindly leading themselves and everyone else to hell. That's what it will feel like when the NWO takes over.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think so many people are being turned off by the crap these democrats are pulling. The media and social media want us to believe that the majority is on their side. In reality, I highly doubt that. I hope the 2018 elections will wake the narcissistic liars up. In a way, it's probably good that they are making such fools of themselves, as long as  we can keep Trump from being impeached.
            </p>
            <p>
             People are saying that Hillary is preparing to run again. It makes me smile from ear to ear when I think how much a 3rd fail would affect her. LOL. Not to mention, she'll be even older so she'll collapse more often. 😁
            </p>
            <p>
             Better yet, it would be better for her to be excited, refreshed and ready to,try again, and then get arrested and her hopes and dreams smashed. Hmmm. There are so many scenarious that could bring me joy regarding things that could happen to Hillary.

                The irony continues. Is there an end to it?
               </p>
               <p>
                So you believe the following:
               </p>
               <p>
                Democracy is real and the masses can affect policies through voting.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump the billionaire and elitist who hasn't done a single thing to take down the establishment is your friend.
               </p>
               <p>
                The establishment would allow a threat like him to come into office because, what, the masses voted him in through democracy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Although Tump's connections to very evil people are on flagrant display at every turn, he still must be your friend.
               </p>
               <p>
                Stop being a sheep. Stop having imaginary friends. My friendly advice.

              I feel the same way about that evil hag and her equally disgusting pet pig named Bill.  The thought of them in the WH with the pig having a seat on the UN rendering them the world's most powerful couple was nauseating and suicide inducing. The entire world dodged a bullet when Trump won.

              Im glad youre having fun larping in this morality tale youve concocted.  Have you even considered that none of it matters once whites are a minority?  Hell PG/conspiracy research ITSELF is probably a 99% white hobby.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you ignore the actual consequences happening right before your eyes while 100% BUYING this trump as savior bullshit.  Good grief woman.

               Usually it's Jews or Muslims you speak of. You don't like women, especially white women. So, why do you care if whites become a minority? You sometimes act black. Then you say you are not. You have Jew in you. What race are you donkey? Are you brave enough to at least say that? Jeff sounds white to me.
              </p>
              <p>
               This race war is not Trump's fault at all. It's the lying media. They want to portray Trump as racist so they can divide people. That's why Soros funds Black Lives Matter. Yes, I support my president! He's not racist. So who in this world do you like besides yourself?
              </p>
              <p>
               You are such a weird person that I'm actually curious. What race are you since that is your focus 95% of the time.

                Oh my fucking god.  This is why we are fucked.  A woman is naive enough to think if you transplant 30m mexicans somewhere else that place wont become mexico.  And she feels ZERO loyalty to her race or perhaps even despises it.

                That is all you would need to explain 20th century to a martian:
               </p>
               <p>
                women acquired the right to vote in the west, promptly made the state their caretakers, stopped procreating because they were told to spend their fertile years working in order to achieve financial independence they didnt need when they married young, then also support the demographic displacement of their own people.
               </p>
               <p>
                And jews are proud to have promoted it all, read their own sources if you dont believe me.

                 How can you say what I believe? I am proud of my race. There is good in any race tho. But it's ridiculous that white people are becoming so hated by some of these liberals because they think white people are racist and priveledged. I was asking why YOU would care if white's become a minority? So, I guess that means you are white.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You always try to label me as something different so that's it's not obvious that you are equine. You know I'm more old fashioned and not like that and I hate feminism. So I'm proud of my gender too!

                  You might have noticed that mexicans tolerated a single political party in office for 100 years straight.   Your caveats reveal your womanly and justified lack of confidence in what you say.  The races can be ranked according to their inherited intelligence, physicality, and testosterone.  Blacks have more of the latter two and correspondingly less of the first.  Whites have the best combination and thats why they produced the industrial revolution.

                  MODERN AMERICAN CULTURE IS NOT WHITE, IT IS JEWISH.  The catholics lost the culture war because they were pussies i guess.

                  No..average age of marriage is around 30 in all those countries.  A huge number of women just want to enjoy their 20s showing skin, dancing, and attracting different guys.  Not surprising given that theyre told they should behave more like men.  So they are literally trading sustainable birthrates, for which theyd have to marry around 25, in order to suck dicks.

                    you said they had to supplement their husbands reduced wages but its worse, theyre actually crowding out males seeking employment and using their wages to rent their own place and car:  the only advantage that has over marriage is number of men she can sleep with.  They are sluts dude -- notice japan has a lower birthrate than even us but they aren't sluts because they lack jewish propaganda to undercut their traditional culture

                     The Japanese lack the subversion but also the opportunity provided by a flood of artificial wealth (which comes from guess who) here in the West which amplifies the cultural degeneracy here (provides the fuel), yes. "We The People" became the God and rule of law in America after the theocratic puritan rule was overthrown which means no absolutes and if men are inherently evil as the puritans taught, then depravity, lawlessness, and total degeneracy are the end result unless and until there is some sort of spiritual awakening, whether that be innate or from above, to stem the tide.

              You will accept that "Muslims have aligned with the far left as early as the 1980s to turn Western civilization against itself" but see nothing significant about total jewish control of media and entertainment, blaming muslims for 9-1 etc.  Incredible brainwashing.

               I will give it to you that there are  many many Jews in the entertainment industry, including  the MSM,  and banking and financing.  I will give it to you that if Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son, then human sacrifice is evidently part of the history as the Israelites.  There are other cultures as well

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Many scholars firmly believe that the ancient Israelites performed a “burnt offering of children” in the name of an ancient Canaanite god named Moloch. Not all of ancient Israel practiced this ritual — experts believe it was only practiced by an Israelite cult that dedicated their lives to worshiping Moloch, and that the ritual had a Canaanite origin.
               </p>
               <p>
                Some scholars don’t agree with this, contending that Moloch never existed in ancient Israelite society. For these scholars, the word mlk from which the word Moloch was derived doesn’t mean “god,” but rather “sacrifice.” As such, sacrifices may have been made in a more general sense, or perhaps not at all. Scholars can’t agree on the matter, and the debate continues to this day.

                I think you guys WANT it to be a coalition of satanic cults, and you RESENT someone like me presenting a neat and elegant solution because youre brainwashed into thinking its a CLICHE that risks painting us as Nazis.  So they win and the Holocaust movies will continue to be made at a worldwide rate ive seen cited as one film/series/documentary every TEN DAYS.

                  Who would you trust, the batshit antifa and jewish professional liars, or simple educated white guys who put their job prospects for life at risk because they know whats going on? And this is INDEPENDENT of pizzagate, which they dont mention.  Theyre our allies and thats why they have to be demonized so much.

                    A couple centuries ago it would have been TAKEN FOR GRANTED! If the jews lie about everything else, why would you believe them when they say invariably that blood libel is a "myth"?

                   <p>
                    Christians from Italy to Poland painted murals and depictions of Jews sacrificing babies -- what a bunch of stupid assholes, right?? Blood libel is a myth!

                The Jew seems to be kind of like a Mafia group.  The leadership has always been Luciferian from the beginning.  The normie Jews dont seem to be too aware of this.  They always believe when they get Pogrom'd and removed from country after country that this is just their lot in life as Jews.  That they seem too be the most hated people in history and they believe their leaders who say they can not truths the Goyim.  They are missing the point their leaders demand they dont breed with other races and other tribes.  Not for religious reasons but to keep their stupid minions beholden to their commands.

                No one is evil from their own perspective, right? It's a divide and conquer and sabotage strategy they evolved over the centuries, yes.

                Other scholars like e michael jones point out the revolutionary spirit jews seem to carry wherever they migrate as something innate since the rejection of christ.  Along the way they developed these secret societies based on Kabbalah who are behind Pizzagate.

             Yeah I would be careful about using NewsPunch as a source, they blatantly lie. That article 'proving' Fields is a HRC supporter has absolutely NO evidence to support that. The only thing the article mentions is a scrub of his social media after being arrested, which is indeed suspect but doesn't prove any support for HRC at all. They straight up lie so I wouldn't link them.

            Yes, it's becoming quite obvious the whole Charlottesville event was staged on both sides by the left/Deep State. Aside from Kessler and all the other curious inconsistencies around the event, just think about the timing. Supposedly "Neo-Nazis" decide to stage a rally just about the time the deep state's Russia narrative has completely fallen apart, Assange/KimDotCom are ready to talk, and Imran Awan has been arrested. Why provoke the Left when you are winning? Funny coincidence that the "Nazi's" just felt an urgent need to march...
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, the deep state is trying actively to remove the POTUS and even to start a civil war if needed to cover their tracks and maintain power. In fact the war has already begun and it is first being played out with staged events and pitifully transparent propaganda.
