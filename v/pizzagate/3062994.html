            Upvoat and Thank You for posting this. We have really hit the bottom of the barrel if this is allowed to pass.   I can't even wrap my head around that age.  9?  This should be Bigger News.   It's a shame people are hitting Twitter and Instagram while grown men are discussing the sex lives of their 9 year olds.  Perverted and Shameful.  Connecticut is a Pedo State, imo.

            They have been trying to push this failed vaccine for some time. Rick Perry pushed it in Texas. A court recently ruled it has and can cause death. It has a lot of other bad side effects. While they try to say the virus leads to cancer I don't think there's proof of that, as well as the risks outweighing the benefits on this one. My daughter got soccer career hopes ending asthma from this shot.

              The CD tries to say the HPV vaccine is "safe and effective", however this study from Japan says otherwise:

             <p>
              Over HALFof the girls who received the HOV vaccine experienced a medical issue as a result of vaccination! That risk is way too high to force this vaccine on all children!

               HPV has one of the worst track records with a high risk to low benefit ratio. Must be another reason for this vaccine. Now they are trying to foist it on boys. Unfortunately, the sheep are suckers for vaccine fear porn.

             ALERT! They are coming for YOU ADULTS:
            </p>
            <p>
             CHD Press Release: CDC’s ACIP Considers Expanding Recommendations for HPV Vaccine to Ages 27 to 45
            </p>
            <p>
             "Washington, DC – The CDC Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) will consider recommending the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine to both women and men ages 27 to 45 in a meeting Feb. 27-28, 2019.  This recommendation would possibly expose over 80 million adults to the Gardasil 9 vaccine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. sent a letter to Chairman Jose R. Romero and ACIP members on February 25th, on behalf of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), a non-profit organization devoted to children’s health. Kennedy has diligently followed the work of the committee to evaluate and recommend vaccines to the American public for over a decade and is well aware of the dangers of this vaccine given its track record with children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kennedy states that CHD considers an expansion of the HPV recommendations reckless based on the safety information available and outlined numerous reasons to support his concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
             These include the fact that during Gardasil’s clinical trials an extraordinary 49.5% of the subjects receiving Gardasil reported serious medical conditions within seven months of the start of the clinical trials. Because Merck did not use a true placebo in its clinical trials, its researchers were able to dismiss the trial participants’ injuries as coincidences, employing the term “new medical conditions,” rather than classifying their injuries as “adverse events.”
            </p>
            <p>
             HPV Vaccines have been reported to cause death and serious adverse events in the children and young adults age group at a rate higher than for any other ACIP-recommended vaccine. "

              My big question now about vaccines is: how much of the damage to people's health is unintended consequences due to inadequate or biased research, and how much of it is deliberately engineered population control. I'm reading
              <em>
               The Moth in the Iron Lung
              </em>
              right now about the development of the "polio epidemic" and subsequent vaccine. Pretty damn interesting. Looks like most of the polio deaths and disabilities were caused not by a virus, but by the use of mercury, lead and arsenic in pesticides and medicines at the turn of the 20th century. Disgusting. I'm only a few chapters in, though. The author is coming out with a book on autism, but Amazon may ban it.

              How is this related to vaccination? This same NYC ultra-orthodox group refuses vaccination on religious grounds:
The LARGEST most recent measles outbreak is among this group, NOT Washington state.  See "Measles is Hitting Ultra-Orthodox Communities. Why Aren't they Vaccinating? BY ARI FELDMAN  JANUARY 11, 2019  FORWARD online
             </p>
             <p>
              "The worst measles outbreak in recent New York history is hitting the Hasidic Jewish community due to low vaccination rates.
             </p>
             <p>
              With 55 cases in Brooklyn and 116 in two upstate counties since late September, it is the second time in five years that the community has seen a measles crisis. The previous record outbreak, in 2013, was entirely within Brooklyn’s Orthodox enclaves."
             </p>
             <p>
              "The New York outbreak began after Orthodox Jews who were visiting Israel became infected with measles. Israel is experiencing a massive outbreak of the disease, with over 2,000 cases reported as of late November of last year.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the U.S., outbreak has been almost exclusively contained to the Hasidic community. Hasidic Jews are often characterized by their insularity and rigid social structures."

              Actually, I support the group's stance on non-vaccination. They are similar to the Amish and have very low AUTISM rates as a result:

              Low prevalence of autism seen among Israel’s minorities
By REBECCA MCKINSEY

             </p>
             <p>
              "In Israel, a lower percentage of ultra-Orthodox and Arabic children are diagnosed with autism compared with the general population.."
"Broken down into population groups, though, minorities in Israel have even lower prevalence rates: 1 out of 833 for Israeli Arabs living in rural populations, and 1 out of 386 for ultra-Orthodox Jews, compared to 1 out of 182 for the general Jewish Israeli population."

              </a>
              NOTE:  The CDC's latest US autism rate based on 2014 data is 1 out of 59.

             <p>
              WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER?  1 out of 386  or  1 out of 59.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the practice of mouth-after-circumcision, IT SHOULD BE OUTLAWED. With this and FULL BIRTH ABORTION allowed in NY, it is a city of ABOMINATION. Just my opinion.

             The study also found that majority of the extra deaths among women who had abortions were due to suicide. The suicide rate among women who had abortions was six times higher than that of women who had given birth in the prior year and double that of women who had miscarriages.
            </p>
            <p>
             6 Times Higher.  What more do we need to know?  The pain and suffering they endure inside after aborting, I can't even imagine.  God help them for at that point many have no other way to turn, or at least that's what they have been told. So sad.

              It's terrible. There is a whole structure set up to tell women this is best for their health, and what really happens is "undesirables" are eliminated -- both the children and their poor mothers. Globalist population control at it's best, running like a well-oiled machine. And then the babies' remains are used for longevity treatment research for those same elite. Diabolical.

               There is a woman in our extended family that had a baby out of wedlock and she was advised to have an abortion by friends.  Thank God she had the courage to decide against it.  Everyone in the family banded together and helped her out.  She has a beautiful daughter that is a blessing really.  Usually the problem is that these women feel they will be all alone with no help and also still be shamed.  Abortion is not a contraceptive.

             Good info! By the HHS's own reckoning, only 1% of all vaccine injuries are reported.  More importantly, the way the legislation is written, it would affect FUTURE STD vaccines forced on children. This would be an issue for pedos who want "safe sex."  Sick, sick, sick.
THIS VACCINE ABUSE MUST BE STOPPED.

              Absolutely! And until it's stopped, parents need to refuse to give their consent for their children to be vaccinated. I will NEVER again allow my child to receive a vaccine. I don't care what laws they try to pass, I won't do it. We all need to stand up and say no together.

                Where exactly do they do that? As much as the US is trying to force vaccines on us, it's not the law that your child must be vaccinated to exist, just to attend school or daycare. It's not illegal to not vaccinate your child, nor is it deemed to be child neglect per child welfare laws (in my state at least). Maybe that's different in other states? But I haven't heard that. My kids are not vaccinated and they have an exption for school, no questions asked per my state law.
               </p>
               <p>
                You're right though, I'm sure one day they will have trampled so much on our rights that they will try to pass laws to take our kids away if we refuse vaccines. Pretty scary!

                 Be aware that Big Pharma is on the move to get ALL states to have FORCED vaccination. That is why Bill Gates' state is using Measles Outbreak Fear Porn to get Washington to pass a law like California's. In Cali you can home school or leave the state to escape mandatory vaccination. Trump's new FDA appointee is trying to use FEDERAL mandate to force vaccinate citizens in ALL states:

                <p>
                 "As measles outbreaks continue to impact communities across the United States, the commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Scott Gottlieb, told Axios that states must act to reduce vaccine exemptions, or the federal government will be forced to do so. Gottlieb was not specific about what actions federal regulators could or would take if states do not tighten or change vaccine exemption laws. But he did note, “This is an avoidable tragedy.”"

                 THIS IS A HOT TOPIC RIGHT NOW. I've already posted how they are using this issue to try to shut down free speech on social media. NO VACCINE CRITICISM. The internet has allowed parents to research the true facts about vaccines and make a true informed consent. Big Pharma does not like the outcome.

                  I have started using this article as a way to "red pill" people who blindly believe the MSM "all vaccines are safe and effective" narrative:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8572826/ns/health-pet_health/t/still-vaccinating-your-pet-every-year/">
                   http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8572826/ns/health-pet_health/t/still-vaccinating-your-pet-every-year/
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm really surprised this NBC article hasn't been scrubbed yet (I also have it archived just in case), because it clearly points out that vaccines are not "safe and effective", should not be administered in a one size fits all manner, and are not always necessary. Yes the article is talking about vaccines for cats and dogs, but it's interesting that they acknowledge the dangers vaccines pose to animals, while telling us we're crazy if we question vaccine safety for ourselves!

                 <p>
                  I think this is a good way to show normies there's some discrepancies in the narrative.
