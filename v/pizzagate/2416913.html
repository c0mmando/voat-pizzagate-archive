             If Corsi is actually making claims about pizzagate, we need to leave this up. Corsi has not been proven to be disinfo, Q has not been proven to be disinfo. Mods don't get to personally choose which sources are legit and which aren't (mods aren't allowed to "curate content" under Voat's anti-censorship policies.) If the headline is accurate, and Corsi really talks about pedos going to Gitmo, then we need to leave this up, as it is clearly pizzagate related.

             , can you provide the timestamp location(s) in the video, and perhaps a quote from Dr. Corsi, that supports the claim you've made in your title?

              I'm leaving the 24hr flair decision up to you. I've watch the YT clip twice now... Doesn't mention pedophilia. So it should be rule 1 (relevance). My bad.

               I watched it also. at 9:03 or so, he mentions Gitmo, but then AJ cuts him off and starts selling his schlock. I left the flair because of this. Let's see if

               has additional info supporting his headline. If he does, we can remove the flair. If he doesn't, then the post fails both Rule 1 and 3.

              By what standard? If I were to take the time I could go back through the history and come up with a big ol list of totally false claims that didn't happen, were not true, or never proven. Kidnapping Soros and locking him up in Camp David being the star in the crown.

               To prove something disinfo, IMO, you need to show that it was actually untrue, not that it is unproven. No one has made a thread documenting QAnon spreading things that are provably lies.

                 To prove something disinfo, IMO, you need to show that it was actually untrue, not that it is unproven. No one has made a thread documenting QAnon spreading things that are provably lies.

Some anonymous source saying something on the internet that cannot be verified any other way does not pass the smell test by any means. "an anonymous person on the internet said XYZ" does not pass the smell test for other threads.

                Soros is not locked up in Camp David. He just heckled Soros in Davos. Obama's library getting raided has no shred of evidence behind it except some anon on 4chan said so. Obama obviously didn't get locked up over it either.

                 Oh? I've seen dozens of threads about FBIAnon, Esoteric. And many addressing the anonymous sources of Alex Jones and True Pundit. So, no, it hasn't "always been this way." We weigh claims all the time made by various DC characters. The votes decide.

                  I want to make this pont. If Soros had ended up in Camp David for real, you would never let us forget it. Q would be a hero. Since it was bogus you don't want to touch it, because, semantics. You are playing Russian Roulette with this forum after it just got itself straight. Good luck.

                  That is not playing fair. Q said they have a "special place" for Soros. Then later the word "special place" was in a Trump Tweet and that was hailed as confirmation that Soros was locked up in Gitmo.

                  Q leads with a jumble of direct statements, implications, and questions. If you want to play that way you can play word games and pretend to get Q out of some of his disinfo but its not straight shooting.

                 <p>
                  We both know the implication was made that Soros went to Camp David. That Obama would be on his way to jail for the library. 3000 kids got saved.

                  Two of those we know didn't get locked up, and other than "q said so" we have zilch about 3000 kids getting saved. If the standards drop that low, you will have tons more Q enemies lined up at the gates.

                  You are not helping your case for Q by doing this because it is so obvious that too many of the things related to Q were lies, didn't come to pass, or whatever. Q's reputation already slid off the cliff for most of the people that were watching with interest. All that is left is a few hardcore followers.
