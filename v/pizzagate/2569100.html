<p>The Groucho Club is a private members club, set up in 1985 whose members are mainly drawn from publishing, media, entertainment and arts industries. [7]</p>
<p>In 2010 the Groucho Clubs web forum was found to have hundreds of web pages and links dedicated to gross and indecent material of young children [6].  This was reported to Metropolitan Police and CEOP but nothing appeared to be done. [6] Googles cache pages of the evidence also kept being removed.</p>
<p>Links have been made between Charles Napier of the Paedophile Information Exchange and the Groucho Club; Jeremy Hunt Health Secretary and sugar daddy JHJ Lewis of  Groucho Club; church premises nearby being used by men associated with the Groucho club to make child porn films ; and surveillance cameras being used in the club for improper purposes</p>
<p>There is the suggestion that various members used to snort cocaine and that there were extra surveillance cameras, initially vehemently denied by the Groucho Club, but proved to be present after a failed libel case by the Groucho Club  [10]. If this was the case, the cctv could also be used to collect evidence other indiscretions. This evidence, in the wrong hands, could be used for blackmail purposes.</p>
<p>The Groucho Club private members forum had 42,000 members, 900,000 posts and was operating for almost a year with children on sale for sex. The forum also had thousands of posts, photographs and videos of young children. However, the child abuse network operating on the Groucho Clubs forum was covered up</p>
<p>( article has many links at the end)</p>

<p>On the 10th of November 2010 it was discovered that an online member\'s forum operating under the name of the Groucho Club forum was being used over a prolonged period of time by a network of paedophiles. </p>
<p>The forum contained hundreds of web pages and links to pornographic videos and images of young children and infants available for sex</p>
<p>The preservation of the evidence at this stage was crucial to assist any criminal investigation and prosecute the offenders. Murphy again contacted the Metropolitan Police Service and CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre) several times by telephone and e-mail as a matter of extreme urgency, and he relayed his concerns that the evidence was now being destroyed. </p>
<p>In some cases a domain name can be hijacked, if this is indeed the case, then who is making the requests to Google? Who has deleted the forum pages and directing all links to the Groucho Club home page? This is a cleanup operation on a colossal scale, has been ongoing over a number of months and must be costing substantial sums of money. According to Google the legal owner of a web site or domain can make specific requests for the removal of cache pages and links. This prevents a website\'s pages from being listed in the search results or from appearing as a cache copy in the search listings. This is done by submitting a webpage removal request to Google. The search engine will then take steps to verify legal ownership of the domain or website before a specific change can be made. </p>
<p>The forum has posts made by child pornographers as late as September 2010. The forum has 42,348 members, 663,709 topics and 900,987 posts. Hundreds of the web pages and links are dedicated to gross and indecent material of young children. Murphy has compiled a list of the forum members with their age and birthdays. Some of the forum members are still very active on the internet and one user is listed on a number of websites for toddlers and other websites for girls dress up games. What is even more disturbing is that another user has stated their preferences on another website as bondage, sadism, masochism, beating and self mutilation. </p>
<p>Whoever owns and operated the Groucho Club forum seems to be somewhat of a mystery. What is certain is that someone is going to a lot of time, trouble and expense in making the requests to Google for the removal of the cache pages and links. Given that the forum was being utilised by the child pornography ring for such a prolonged period of time, did anyone in the Groucho Club management team or the new MD Matt Hobbs ever conduct a complete review of the clubs affairs or its online profile, as one would expect.</p>

            In my youth (17-18) I used to visit Browns nightclub in London, I listened to this interview
            <a href="https://www.hooktube.com/watch?v=EKB6NCrePLQ">

            Brian Harvey of E17 talks about secret Red rooms there where he saw children and he thinks that's why 'they' have been out for him ever since. The club was busted for selling drugs out of the toilets years ago and closed down, I felt so sick listening as I frequented a lot of these celebrity hangout clubs back in the day and there was always something seedy about them, JetBlack was another one, Mayfair club, and 10 rooms also. It dawned on me that it was probably a perfect cover for their disgusting behaviours as well as offering ample opportunities for cctv/blackmail. Drugs were openly available in all the VIP rooms at these places, so God knows what else was going on behind the velvet curtains. I looked into the owners of Browns a little bit and they own a LOT of chauffeur and courier companies - maybe for trafficking kids or drugs :(

              It was JetBlack in Holborn, used to open at 3am and close at God knows what time (I'd usually leave by 10am and it was still going) was full of modelling/music industry people and old rich guys who looked completely out of place in suits, lots of escorts/porn stars &amp; drugs...there was few little corridors with doors that lead to the club next door...can't remember the name of it, but once when we went through there and ordered a drink at the bar the barman offered us a big pile of white powder that he had...we respectfully declined...will try and remember the name of it...found it -Den &amp; Centro, West Central street London - that was the main club name, Jetblack was the private members afterparty bit. (it was previously called The End)

                Oh yes - Blacks in Soho, never went there but I know it's one of the original 'home away from home' members clubs, whatever that means... Yes, I think they must've tightened up a lot to hide what goes on in these places, seems they were quite brazen with it back then...

            <p>
             "Having been at the club for over 20 years, looking after everyone from Jaime Winstone and Sienna Miller to Noel Gallagher and Damien Hirst, he knew all the secrets of the A-listers that called the place home - and earned a fearsome reputation as a fixer. In 2015, we featured him as one of the 100 Most Connected Men in Britain..."

              come see the thread on Megs Sparkles. References to Soho House. Aren't Groucho House + Soho House near each other in the Middle of London? My fashion friend from London has been to Soho House but not Groucho but Groucho is more exclusive and harder to get in I think?

              Yes, a separate group within the forum no doubt.  Great idea to investigate Marx's sexual proclivities.  Fantastic idea to put up flyers.  It would need to happen now.  The article said the final decision from the liquor authority would happen June 1st.

              I think the whole thing with the rooms available and cameras reads like a brownstone operation that started in the 80s, looking for compromisable new talent in the publishing, media, entertainment and arts industries.
