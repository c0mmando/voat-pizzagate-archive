<p><strong>Overview or Survey</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few days a survey was conducted on members of voat.co/v/pizzagate, as well as some respondants from twitter (#pizzagate, #pedogate). 100 people responded, at which point surveymonkey no longer would collect results without payment (lame - as Im a student I opted not to pay)</p>
<p>The survey topics were: (this could be expanded on a paid survey - again I\'m a student - no money) age, income, marital status, religion, country of origin, advocacy level, history of abuse, career field, child status and gender</p>
<p>With surveys generally the more respondants involved - the more accurate results you will achieve. With this in mind someone with money may wish to conduct a larger survey, however I feel that the results would generally hold true across the greater pizzagate population.</p>
<p>Areas identified as similarities</p>
<p>Marital status, Age, Children, Religion and previous advocacy work - were areas of the survey that corresponded with significant similarities</p>
<p>Based off of the numbers collected - our prospective audience is -</p>
<p>**25-45, married with children,</p>
<p>male/female 50/50</p>
<p>christian/catholic/non-specific</p>
<p>with none-some previous advocacy work</p>
<p>most likely not a survivor of sexual abuse **</p>

           This is pizzagate related in that it shines a light on those who would support us in our fight. Which will make it easier for advocates to identify these people in their communities - thus increasing awareness, and increasing the number of researchers. As well as provides a tool that I created for use by other researchers to keep an organized list for ease of referencing material.

            Your intentions are good but the data is,  unfortunately,  inconclusive bc the survey set is already skewed. I'm not going to get into parsing the statistical errors bc I don't have time to type up a primer on stats and I'm not trying to be a dick,  anyway.  I just don't want people to assume the results are correct thereby ignoring significant groups. (Eg: surveying people on voat is already  skewed bc it doesn't represent the average person who doesn't even know voat exists bc they are so brain dead that they don't look beyond their little cocoon. That was mostly editorial,  but hopefully you get my point. ) HOWEVER, if someone involved in research/stats with the resources to do an accurate survey could help, that's a great idea!
