<h2>Dreamflight logo</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dreamflight logo includes <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4214/35141226615_2dde347421_o.jpg">two comets</a> and in 2001 there were <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4280/35016940901_d7e801fc03_o.png">four comets.</a> Image <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925181309/http://www.dreamflight.org:80/">source</a></p>
<p>I don\'t know what a comet signifies to the Illuminati, it could have occult significance, or as of late it may be a reference to Comet Ping Pong Pizza Restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/Laskar">@Laskar</a> posted <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1848403">a thread</a> about the unusual cover <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4288/34754303450_b1ef69cf33_o.jpg">of the January 2017 issue of <em>The Economist</em> magazine</a> that contained a comet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On that cover, there was a card called The Star, which did not have any of <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4241/34296345834_c95ee2567d_o.jpg">the usual features,</a> but instead, it has fourteen, eight-pointed <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4285/35101240876_d298ca0b36_o.png">stars with a black and white <strong>photo of a child</strong> in each.</a></p>
<p>These photos are reminiscent of the missing children photos which were once featured on milk cartons. Who are these children? Why are they on the cover of The Economist? Most surprisingly, why is there a COMET in the middle of these stars? Are the elite trying to say something to each other?</p>

<h2>Jill Dando murder</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mid-1990\'s BBC presenter Jill Dando is <a href="http://archive.is/oVB49">said to have reported to her employers that a pedophile ring was operating at the BBC,</a> and yet no action was taken to protect children.  </p>
<p>In 1998 Jill was the host of Crimewatch, a show that appeals for help in solving cases, and <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4269/35102674306_a765cfe36a_o.png">appeared at a Dreamflight event.</a>  Six months later she was murdered, in 1999 (inverted 666); the case is still unsolved.  Not until 2011 was BBC child and toddler rapist Jimmy Savile publicly exposed.  </p>

<h2>Operator of Dreamflight -- Joe Macari</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/hMJo1">Joe Macari</a> became a <a href="http://archive.is/gCEX5">race car driver</a> in 1988, the year after the first Dreamflight.  He is currently a leading <a href="http://archive.is/rtpzC">luxury car dealer</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/U8Ud7">event planner.</a>   </p>
<p>He is a complete mystery to me.  I only found that <a href="http://www.billionaire.com/cars/ferrari/905/joe-macari-cars-ferrari-dream-machine-">his parents were originally from Monte Cassino, Italy, where his father owned ice cream and coffee shops.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606143743/http://www.billionaire.com/cars/ferrari/905/joe-macari-cars-ferrari-dream-machine-">Archived</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/0GwH7">This quote</a> struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>In a New Yorker piece on Jerry Sandusky, entitled “In Plain View: How child molesters get away with it,” Malcolm Gladwell said the most prolific pedophile is rarely the “disheveled old man baldly offering candy to preschoolers.” Rather, pedophiles can be agreeable members of the community. “People didn’t believe that [he] was a pedophile because people liked [him] — without realizing that [he] was in the business of being likeable.”</h3>

            The World in 2017 contains The Economist’s annual collection of detailed, numerate and opinionated predictions for the year ahead. The World in 2017 features leading figures from politics, business, finance, science, technology and the arts alongside prominent journalists from The Economist and other leading news publications.
           </p>
           <p>
            The World In 2017 looks ahead to a new American presidency, a Chinese Communist Party Congress, elections in France and Germany and the political and economic challenges of Brexit, and marks a number of poignant global anniversaries—500 years since Martin Luther published his 95 theses, 100 years since Lenin launched the Russian revolution and 10 years since Steve jobs unveiled the iPhone.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              In our 31st edition, we include a special section featuring forecasts from 14 globally-minded millennials, ranging from a Syrian refugee-turned-photographer, an iconoclastic Chilean reggaeton artist, one of ballet’s biggest emerging names and leading online voices for young Africans and Muslim American women.

             They are clearly older photos---look at the hair, clothing, etc.--, and in years past people looked more mature than those of the same age today. Have look at old yearbooks to see what I mean. the seniors in yearbooks form the fifties look to be thrity years old at least whereas they were only 17 or 18.

             People need to know that the medical system is complicit in all this. The also assist in the hoaxes perpetrated to keep the masses distracted from reality (e.g. Orlando Pulse fraud).

              Thank you. People that are ok with turning a blind eye or participating in the elites corruption are the ones they promote to higher and higher positions. That way they have connections to cover their butts and get away with everything. If not, they will make them with blackmail. They're so sick.
