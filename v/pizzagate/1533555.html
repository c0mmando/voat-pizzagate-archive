<p>Go back 10 years, sometime in 2007, a counter-P2P (peer-to-peer file sharing) company, MediaDefender, was hacked and over 700Mb of their internal messages leaked online. The ensuing storm brought down the company and even <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/ARTD">their parent company\'s stocks crashed</a> to worthless soon after.</p>

<p>In summary, the company pissed off file sharers by poisoning their networks with garbage, and got hacked in return, the hackers then got hold of company emails, source code, IP addresses of their servers, and much of their M.O., then promptly released the emails on Pirate Bay. This was prior to Wikileaks coming to the scene, mind you. Not long after the email leaks, the hackers also revealed that they had infiltrated the phone system of the company concerned and obtained recordings of phone conferences between the company execs and the NY State General Attorney\'s office to assist in investigation of CP.</p>

            They hardly investigate squat. They just grab a few high profile on s here and there, call 'em loan wolves and let everyone else slide.
