<p>Let\'s keep this 100% positive.  I posted today the following thing on my fb. It was the first time for years really.</p>
<p>I posted a photo on my timeline, and made a nice post to tell my (old) friends and family on fb how extremely I am happy with my life. And my lovely family. That I have great plans for this and that in the future.So I made a statement that I loved live. Some old friends responded quickly with happy reactions. I greeted them and it went such a nice way. I have not that much friends on fb (dont know tbh) but this felt as indeed not a bad idea. I want to tell my family and friends that I love a lot about life. And thanking them. I will need all my friend in whatever may come, so far.</p>
<p>I did this because I had some concerns about my happy life since i have been snooping around here and found that internet does not like me. Kind of shocking, seems since I refuse to give names or \'the\' evidence. Still a lot of people <em>keeps</em> asking me to \'give\' the evidence of this. People: I don\'t have it. I don\'t want it. CP is very sick. Don\'t fall for this.</p>
<p>Sorry for not keeping this 100% positive but I have to catch up some sleep now, very tired, that fb-trip i started gave me a boost, you cannot imagine.. Thanks fb.</p>
<p>Consider if you can use this same idea and take the opportunity to tell the people around you on fb how much you love em. You should do it anyway. In my post I am 100% trying to keep this sickness away from it. </p>
<p>People will love it (if they love you). This will do <strong>no</strong> harm, certainly not intended for any agenda or Likes, is not illegal and I could use anything positive while going through this.. Did you see how you can use fb as a weapon for it...? Think about this one. </p>
<p>Intention of topic is to share a way to make (a lot of) people aware of your will to live. Have a good night, I have great respect for the good ones.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and vote up if you think some people can use this idea. Thanks brothers and sisters!</p>',
