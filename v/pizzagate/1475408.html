This &quot;game&quot; is satirically mocking the Pizzagate investigation and us citizen investigators. The general storyline (at least from the first 2 parts) is an unemployed character who gets hired to do a job in a strange town he doesn\'t live in (i.e. alluding to an austist anon). He moves to this town and his job is to sit at a computer all day and read archives online related to child sex and pornography rings (he is working for some kind of supposed illegitimate bureau/agency).  The game/video constantly mocks what the character finds as &quot;evidence&quot;, and one of the forums on his computer even resembles the 4chan design. There are a LOT of insulting passive aggressive blows in the dialogue. The weird thing is that these videos were allegedly posted around early 2015. This is extremely strange, as it alludes to Pizzagate investigators very effectively, however if the date is correct (early 2015) then it\'s almost as if this &quot;game&quot; foreshadowed the Pizzagate citizen investigator situation. I can\'t explain it. It\'s extremely questionable that Voat would have this as a sitewide advertisement, and it\'s even more strikingly strange how accurately the game\'s storyline mocks some aspects of our investigations. I really can\'t explain it, if you watch the videos then you will understand better what I mean. It\'s too coincidental to the point that I want to believe that the dates are forged by Google, and that this video was created as some sort of PsyOp against us.

            dude, whats weird is somehow this is not fake it has been around! there are pastebin walkthroughs and video walkthroughs and people discussing that the uncensored version would break youtubes policies. this thing is real. someone had the foresight to see this coming out years ago. and possibly because they are part of it. the thing is this group is not the first to research this sort of thing, it is only the first to make the word pizza so important to the investigation. If you were inside of this ring, and knew the word meaning.. It would be something you could predict would happen. now I am going to actually watch the videos.. but I did sorta confirm that this isn't new its been around, they couldn't have faked the community surrounting it. I don't think.

             I've been keeping quiet about my suspicions, since I think this movement is important because I've believed for awhile now that child abuse is the center of all corruption, but considering how far you can go in each direction with the password Pizza  (most back to 2008) to either CP or extreme conspiracy like Keshe (that guy is the trip to end all trips) Sterling Allan, and since I found this guy (

Too late now though to close pandora's box of synchronicity.

            I'm sure it's here to poke fun at this investigation; worst case try to make voat look bad. unteralterbach is not new, it's not hidden, it's a commonly known game in the right circles and  you'll keep stepping into those circles while investigating pizzagate. Everything is going to appear to be extremely peculiar and unlikely in this atmosphere; it's what you're surrounding yourself with.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a lolicon game with characters based on real children and real pedophilia related cases. The ad is misleading and insecure and should be taken down on
            <s>
             their
            </s>
            those merits alone, but it's more than likely not important here. You really should focus on proof of actual child abuse and not perverted little games.

             The only way to know for sure is to play the game, but some comments on the youtube said that the full game could not be posted since it would be deleted by youtube for inappropriate content. not sure if that statement was true but it was made over a year ago, so as you say it is nothing new, but is very weird. so I guess whos side is it on? seems like the bad guys side.
