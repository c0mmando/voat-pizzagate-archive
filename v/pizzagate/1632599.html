            Like for fuck's sake, what part of "investigate and raid RIGHT FUCKING NOW BECAUSE THE CHILDREN ARE GETTING RAPED" is so fucking hard to do? The entire might of US military is busy fucking shit up in allied and hostile countries, but the underage brothel within US borders is somehow impossible to fuck up?

            I do not like criminal organizations.  I do not like human trafficking or drug trafficking.  This is a slippery slope, as we know some in LE are very crooked.  This could turn very ugly when those people feel threatened.  Threatened enough to intimidate, falsely accuse, arrest, charge completely innocent people.   The president needs to address this and make sure everything LE does is by the book legal.  He also needs to talk about civil asset forfeiture, this practice should be illegal if you are not convicted of a crime and only assets proven tied to the crime should be taken.  The drug war has been largely unsuccessful and has put many non violent low level offenders in jail, cloggin up the courts, wasting resources and further ruining lives.  I know I do not think much of the rights of pedos, but they should have some civil liberties...once they are convicted...well...I want to say put them to death, however if this starts becoming a grab of innocent people because of pressure from above or "financial incentives to convict" I have to rethink that.

             My thought is Julian is compromised, as is wikileaks.  The wiki tweets are actual threats directed at trump, as to disclose 911 truth if he does go after the swamp.  This causing the ultimate diversion.

              You believe Trump is implicated? That I doubt...
My main concern lies with the signature codes not being present. It's hard to imagine that Assange would pilot Wikileaks totally outside of his previous methods.
You think they've got his family hostage?

            I find this section interesting in particular...

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Sec. 2.  Policy.  It shall be the policy of the executive branch to:
            </p>
            <p>
             (a)  strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit activities that present a threat to public safety and national security and that are related to, for example: 
(i)    the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons;
(ii)   corruption, cybercrime, fraud, financial crimes, and intellectual-property theft; or
(iii)  the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Sooo... strengthen Federal law against transnational criminal orgs and their subsidiaries, criminal gangs, cartels, racketeers, and any other groups involved in something slimy that could be related to
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             (i)    the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons;

            which, if I'm reading this right (though I'm not as thoroughly read up on everything as you guys are) seems to be directly, though indirectly worded, aimed at PG and all involved parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            My interpretation of this is that the 120 days bit is just to fan the flames under everyone's ass a little bit and see who jumps first... maybe see if little Jimmy is the first to point the finger elsewhere at the guy sitting in the corner looking intently at a picture on his laptop, or maybe nobody will point the proverbial finger and he'll decide he's had enough of the silence from the internal crew and maybe look elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            My unofficial recommendation would be for all of us to hang tight for now... let's let the 120 days pass and see if anything big happens.  In the meantime, might be worthwhile to start drafting a carefully worded e-mail that links to every various source that is worth looking at (including the Summary posted here) and of course would be sent to the Prez's publicly known e-mail, and just save it as a draft... if there are no high(er) level arrests, we flood The Donald with e-mails pointing him in the right direction... I would think 10,000 e-mails that say the same thing but come from different people would be hard to totally blow off.
Of course, use an e-mail address that doesn't link you to us crazy conspiracy theorists pushing that shitty fake news story about the poor pizza joint in DC... and if you attached an e-mail to here, use a different address for cryin' out loud... and even if you and five other posters on here get together every Wednesday for coffee, don't use anything that might tie you to them!
           </p>
           <p>
            But, that's just my thoughts.

            Look up &amp; look at their hands(mainly Hannity's) when they shake hands at the start of the interview and you can blatantly see that "meh at best" CGI was used. One can draw their own conclusions about what that means.

            Personally, I have little to no doubt JA is compromised and is either being held somewhere, or more likely was killed prior to Trump taking office. If he isn't dead and is being held somewhere he most likely wishes that he were.

            Just wanted to point out that the issue with Nordstrom and Ivanka was not new news when Trump chose to tweet about it. Then Kelly Anne tells people they should buy Ivanka's stuff. The news has been running in circles over that tweet and KA's comment all while Trump is signing these EO's. "Look over there! Fire!" Kek

            I think drug and human trafficking go hand in hand. Sellers would offer all sorts of narcotics along with the rent/sale of a human. Two birds, one stone.

            I mean, is it still a rumor? I thought it was more of an open secret. Just go to random places on reddit and bring it up. It's not like people start calling you a "conspiracy theorist". At least that hasn't been my experience.

            Trump himself has said that the military and government agencies are too open &amp; public about their tactics and actions. 
Trump is playing the ultimate game of poker and keeping his cards very close to his chest. I believe the arrests will come suddenly, and unexpectedly. The ultimate "Trump" card!

             I disagree. They need to make sure all I's are dotted and all t's are crossed to keep them from finding a legal loophole to weasel out of.  If I had to guess,  the bulk of their arrogance (hubris!) Comes from the fact that the brigade of lawyers knows the legal loopholes and probably created half of them. Ultimately this will be played out in a court of law.  Sincerely praying for DT's divine protection as he is the only one who can make an executive order to counter the little Maze they created for themselves to escape.

              I think it's intentionally broad to encompass a variety of crimes against humanity. Note the Executive Order targets groups that "derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life . . . for example . . . brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts." This would cover pedophiles and producers and distributors of child porn and snuff films.

             Strange thing is this reads like suggesting that the "organizations" derive revenue from "brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts". I guess the lord of the world rewards those who dedicate such acts to him.

              Some of the stuff CTR posted in the Pro-Sanders Facebook groups back during the NY primary appeared to be snuff films by the thumbnail. Specifically, a woman impaled on a spit over a fire.  Yay for me seeing that (wasn't even the worst one I saw). I hope these ppl are hunted to the ends of the earth and everything comes out about exactly who they are and what they do.

             I am surprised people think that such a massive operation/investigation could be done overnight. Also, it says "within" and as he has proven to this point Trump gets things done under budget and ahead of schedule I doubt it will be different here. :)

             Especially if the feds are forced to use the climbing of the ladder via the little fish up to the middle size fish then to the big fish and finally the whale(s) tactics. Additionally, there have been EXTENSIVE busts already including one each day for the past 2-3 days and this was with an "interim-AG" at the helm until today, obviously. I still believe Trump and his administration are acting in good faith as I see nothing they have done to this point to make me think otherwise.

             Finally, trump standing in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson and saying the following is essentially a declaration of war against "The Fed" or "Deep State" or whichever moniker one prefers

             This is opposite than anon said and it is more pushing the goal post back. In four months everybody will say "soon" again. According to anon, the investigation was complete and they were waiting for Sessions to be sworn in. He was briefed about the existing investigation and they just needed to have him aprove warrants when he got sworn in. Now it has turned into, possibly four months from now? I tire of this "some time in the future" shit. Either anon is worthless, Or Trump is trying to stretch this out so you get used to nothing happening. And then in four months you will be speculating about possible arrest weeks or months from then. This is nonsense from where I am sitting.

              I believe in Trump wholeheartedly, he's trying to move fast, but the DC swamp is actively trying to obstruct and sabotage him every step of the way. It's everyone else who shouldn't be trusted, and as much power as the President has, he can't do it alone.

             Sounds more realistic. Although we could be seeing some major crackdowns this month if Wikileaks is actually threatening the FBI to release these Clinton emails. Hints at Feb 22.

              Perhaps Feb 19 according to AnonScan on twitter. I was under the assumption that the investigations had been performed by FBI/NYPD/NSA, but they just lacked a DOJ that would sign off on the charges, hence it would be possible to have quicker prosecutions. But I guess they want to be thorough to get all the leads?
             </p>
             <p>
              Arresting ~1,100 in low level stuff around the country is probably just building a solid base of connections/convictions to move further up the levels and onto cases with less direct evidence (ie. not undercover/backpage sting operations).

               Or it is an excuse to say "see we arrested 1000's of people. What more do people want? Be realistic. I give a 10% chane anybody meanigful will be charged and brought to justice. Maybe a scapegoat like Weiner. That is about it. If I am wrong I beg you all to clown me daily. I want to be wrong. This is the same establishment that is complicit in 9/11. Think about that. We did 9/11 to ourselves and the Congress, DOJ, Inteligence agencies, Propaganda press and celebrity propagandist were all in on it. And now they want to open this door? Yeah, ok. If they reveal this, why just this and stop there? They could never acknowledge this. It would have a snowball effect for the entire matrix. Trump was on Epsteins Island more than once but that doesn't matter? Admits that Larry Silverstein is a good friend and the first person he calls on 9/11? Doesn't matter? Did he report to atuhorities what he saw on the Island. What he knows? This makes no sense to me. No arrest within a few days means he is controlled opposition. Time to grow up kids. There are no white hats that will save us. We have to do this ourselves.

               This is correct. The investigation was done and waiting for Sessions to be sworn in. If nothing within a few days, nothing will happen. Expect continued propaganda and surface back slapping about "fighting terrorist".

             I hope (for them) that they don't wait 4 months before doing something. There is no way that the #pizzagate community would tolerate such a huge delay. They would lose support.

              Sadly they would tolerate this. Anon, who they generally trust, told them the investigation was already done and they were simply waiting for Sessions to be sworn in, then they would move quickly within days. Now this, maybe in four months you can give us your report crap. How many of you posted on your social media sites that "arrest were imminent within days", and now are jumping to the next hope of 4 months from now? Or some time in the distant future? This is how it works. Keep moving the goal post back whenever the day nears. After years of this, nothing happens and you are used to having no hope. Ask the 9/11 truthers about this. Nobody cares. The news will continue to do their job and lie. Late night comedians will continue to mock you and push globalist elite agenda while talking about racisim every day. .....You guys are new.

               There is good reason to believe this time can be different. Trump was not supposed to be president. That can really fuck up a plan imo.

               I know... I have been disapointed so many times along the years while seeking the truth in this world. What pushes me forward is the strong feeling I have inside telling me that the future is going to be incredibly bright for normal people (i.e. those who are not psychopaths). The frustrating part is no one knows WHEN the shit will hit the fan. I want to believe it will be soon, like tomorrow or next week. Even a month would seem like 100 years at this point. I got no more patience, #pizzagate removed the little amount that remained. Can't stand the madness, the violence, the lies and the creepy psychos anymore.

              Considering that the Trump admin, especially Trump himself, has shown surprising (to me) cleverness when tackling issues, and that he actually cares about – or acts thoroughly enough to the point where it is irrelevant whether or not he cares – what he aims to accomplish, I have high hopes. Cautiously high. But high regardless. All of the events surrounding Sessions' swearing in and the conduct of POTUS and AGOTUS during the swearing in has all but convinced me that they both do care about this issue, and will go about it in the best way possible.

              I hope I'm not wrong. If I am, I'll be the first to say that I was.

               72 arrests at once sounds great but would give Soros the green light for a massive civil uprising. When the peaceful conservatives finally fight back? Attack Trump.Try to impeach. He has an IQ  of 156. I'm certain no one on voat could boast the same. His strategic posturing and decision making so far has been outstanding. To the naysayers i ask.....would you prefer Hitlery? Then they could be enjoying watching  WW3 on CNN.

                Psh, watch yourself, I took an online test once and have an IQ of ~270.

                More seriously, you're right. I feel for my fellow users here; everyone is antsy and itching for these slags to be thrown in prison, but unfortunately the situation is more complex and fluid than that. You're right about Hillary. Just look at the trail of destruction she left when she was only SOS. No telling what she'd be up to now as president.

                 i took an "are you an asshole?" test online. 96%. So proud. So much more complex. Not forgetting delicate and dangerous. This is the bravest and best Prez since Kennedy. Losing 2 good men would send patriots over the edge. The restraint  of the Trump supporters has been remarkable. But it isn't limitless and if the dam wall breaks, much blood would be spilled and many crayons broken.

               People forget that Trump hasn't centralized his power yet and can't snap his fingers to make the world better instantly. He's an expert Machiavellian who is slowly gaining more political capital by the day.

             it doesnt mean a moratorium on arrests in the meantime - and indeed interim arrests could be used to ply for evidence needed to make those reports

              They've been investigating CF for TWO YEARS! I'm quite sure they have what they need but need to make a surgical strike. They've also had the info on Epstein for many years along w apparently 104 witnesses. I have faith we will win.

              Right, I'm talking about the rumors of a dozen or more top politicians, mainly Dems to be arrested this morning.
             </p>
             <p>
              That would feed into the left's 'Trump coup' narrative, that there would be an incoming hit-list rather than having the institution of the Justice Department go through the proper channels, e.g. FBI investigations.
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems there are more child trafficking arrests lately and this EO certainly puts the heat on child traffickers and pedo networks.

               So very sick, evil criminals shouldn't be arrested because the MSM is going to make a fake news narrative about it? Give me a break. That's exactly what THEY would want to happen, they've been protected for far too long.
