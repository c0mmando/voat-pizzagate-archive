<p>WTF?</p>
<p>Senate committee Democrat Mark Warner stated:
&quot;As numerous inteligence and national security officials in the Trump administration have since unanimously re-affirmed, the ICA findings were accurate and on point.&quot;</p>
<p>GOP members of the House panel have cited &quot;signigficant intelligence tradecraft failings&quot; in the findings and stated:
&quot;We disagree with the narrative that they were trying to help Trump.&quot;</p>
<p>But some key Republicans have said in the past that it seemed Russia was, in fact, trying to help Trump win.  In a statement earlier this year, Rep. Try Gowdy, R-SC, said it was &quot;clear based on the evidence&quot; that Putin wanted Clinton to lose in November.</p>

<p>Today\'s report was one of several the committee will issue as part of its investigation.  &quot;While our investigation remains ongoing, we have to learn from 2016 and do more to protect ourselves from attacks in 2018 and beyond,&quot; said Vice-Chaiman Mark Warner, D-VA.</p>
