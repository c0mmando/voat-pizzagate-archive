            What in the world, this will be fourth and final attempt at a post. Webb is a democrat and that is the top post? Webb is reluctant to press an issue that he is not actually investigating. He does say that what he has found has led to areas outside his scope of research. Why is there so much fighting here? Why is there so much distraction with what is deleted? If this gets posted I will be surprised.

            Do we actually have an email where Podesta references Eric Braverman?  I know there is one where Podesta talks about a mole.  Can anyone reference either of these?

            I'm partially sold on George Webb.  He's an autist when it comes to researching, and takes what FBI Anon suggested to do by following the proverbial money trail (adding in oil, guns, children).  He does seem to have a child's naviete when it comes to Obama and trustworthiness of the MSM.  On the counter, he states that he has retired and active FBI sources that seem to be funneling good info.  He's also completely sold on the corruption with the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking / Epstein connection.  While he's not completely red-pilled he is serving to help our cause for the most part.  The farther he gets down the rabbit whole the more awake I think he become.
           </p>
           <p>
            His work also makes the Podesta mole email that much more incriminating.  Anyone have the reference to this one?

            Webb ranks alternative media is the least trustworthy in his opinion of media with the most trustworthy being "Pulitzer" winners, followed by "Pulitzer" nominated and so on. Guccifer and Larry Nichols aren't Pulutzer prize winners so George probably doesn't put much stock in what they say even if Larry Nichols stood side by side with the Clintons for decades. I don't know his background but obviously he trusts the Establishment MSM a bit too much.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the information he presents for the most part that makes sense comes from his sources in the FBI in conjunction with his media sources. The rest of it like "obama good" and "why doesn't everybody just go back to morality and walk away from this now and not go down with Hillary" is his naïveté showing.

             It's not naïveté, he's been active on twitter for years. He's a gatekeeper, his job is to pooh-pooh the more sordid claims. His early vids were deleted by himself most likely because he claimed the pedo-trafficking aspect to this was bunk and that pizza meant weapons etc. He used to chime in to gamergate discussions and was never on the side of truth or facts which is why I instinctually distrust him.

              Thanks for that info! I've been thinking that maybe It was too hasty and easy to attribute naïveté to him. To be honest as soon as he started talking about how good and innocent obama is, I began to distrust him too. Although the rest of the info he talks about does ring true, do you agree?

               Yes, it does. But I think that's his intention. People here are getting red-pilled fast and he's feeding naive diggers mountains of them. Focus is dissipating away from the wl emails into a conspiracy rabbithole. It would take all day to research all the shit in his vids and that's the point of him being spammed here every day.

               Yes, disinfo is always a mixture of truth and lies. Developing discernment is key. This is a good place to do that.

                How is it possible that suddenly ALL this detail on numerous interrelated schemes that have been going on within the military industrial government criminal complex for decades is suddenly coming out? Its literally taking Webb MONTHS to get this info out, it's so complex! Any other time 1/1000th of Webbs info would be a major news story. Pulitzer Prize worthy (to use Webb's obsession). Are they releasing all of this to soften us up so that it doesn't have the impact it should have? It's just so hard to believe this guy has suddenly put all these pieces together. Even if he is being fed this info by the FBI, how is it that Webb seems to understand it all so well. Don't know about you but I listen to his videos multiple times a day and I still don't undrstand more than 5% of what he's talking about. Getting very very suspicious....

                 Around the time coleslaw came on to the scene/the big board move many were speculating about Cole's involvement in the fbi. Autists searched all gg mentions on sus accts and this guy came up. I believe his profile outright stated he's ex-intelligence. There might be screencaps in one of the gg wikis or elsewhere.

            I think Webb is a democrat.I believe I read that he voted for Obama twice...and also mentioned under one of his videos that he liked Bill (for which he took a lot of flack ) I am wondering...to get more liberals on board ...might it be a good idea to have a meme that George, who is uncovering EVERYTHING, voted for O twice? I mean, really...who woulda thunk, a LIB is coming out with the nails in the coffin. He's proof there are some with integrity. God bless George Webb.

             Yeah it was definitely perturbing to see him say something about liking bill, but his research does assist in understanding the broadness of the clinton foundation, its connections, and how its operates geopolitical in the seizure of a country's assets once it been overtaken.

             He can't get passed his love for obama. How many times has he said "when obama found out he demoted that person" or "obama wouldve never gone for that!" or "the Obamas are good people"?

             Something else odd about George is he describes himself as "a wannabe Israeli". WTH?

             I do trust his information, but he how can you get this deep into the corruption at the upper levels and yet still think the president himself is clean? That's cognitve dissonance of the highest order.
