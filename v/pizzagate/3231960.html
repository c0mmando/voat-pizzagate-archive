<p>It can\'t possibly be Allison Mack again, she is all over MSM still and was arrested. Another actress has to be involved. Also former leaders? Which leaders involved? This implies NVIXM was not fully disbanded. We know NVIXM has had child slaves before. This connects this to pizzagate as it very well could be happening again.

            Doxxing has been a selective outrage issue on Voat, in the last few days, but I posted NXIVM email addresses and passwords a while back. I gave them to Frank Parlato before I passed it onto Voat. I promised myself to stay away from the Internet because I have a lot going on... but I needed to check in with the OIG report. So, I'll make this quick.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were running multiple "executive car" services. Renting out limousines and... seemingly... company with the cars.
           </p>
           <p>
            NXIVM is merely a blueprint. It is repeated in many ways with slight variations throughout history and is quite widespread. NXIVM is just a high class faction, where others like SNCTM and other sex cults were acting as feeder cults/cooperative entities. SNCTM was doxxed fairly well, last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last night, someone sent me doxx on OneTaste that I haven't had a chance to go through, yet. It wasn't from anyone I recognize, but they had a lot of stuff that I had seen before. OneTaste is renting out sex slaves for $10,000 a month and the slave does not keep the money. It goes straight to the organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            NXIVM is also connected to the Santa Muerta death cults that Tavistock seeded in the 70s. The son of a Mexican president was providing snuff films and gang rape films to Keith Rainiere so that he could use them to initiate NXIVM members into the cult within the cult, DOS. These are Sinaloa Cartel players... the recipients of the Fast and Furious firearms. You can find a few human sacrifice videos on the Internet conducted by Sinaloa members.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope that helps.

            She believed the land below was her birthright, her reward, her refuge from the coming apocalypse. Her church built the twin towns — Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City — by hand.

           <p>
            Nobody knew why God had left Short Creek. But the prophet said Zion was somewhere else, that wickedness would soon spill over the mountains, and Barlow watched from above as God's kingdom crumbled.

            The worldwide Dream Center is a Christian based organization that is commonly known for helping people overcome addictions and escaping prostitution in the middle of urban cities. The Short Creek Dream Center is dealing with Polygamy and the issues it causes within their small town community. This community is lower income, 80% minors and 20% uneducated adults. They lack simple life and job skills that we take for granted, there is little to no positive male influence and our true God is unknown. To the people of this community Warren Jeffs is known as their god. Warren is completely opposite of the kind of love our God gives us. Infants would be separated from their mothers at birth, family members would be taken in the middle of the night, and moved to other houses nationwide without contact with their siblings and mothers. If they were to contact them, they would be kicked out of the order without any money, documentation and cut off from any friends and family. Because of this they never had the opportunity to build any kind of loving relationship. Those left at the house were under constant scrutiny to maintain there worthiness under the leaderships eyes. Rape with women and children was a continuous issue. Relationships with others were hindered/controlled by wire tapping, being sent to the ‘quiet house’, and being moved to different locations in Canada, Mexico or somewhere unknown in the U.S.. These are just a few examples of the control this community is under.
           </p>
           <p>
            This house is now being renovated into a safe/halfway house for those families who are escaping Polygamy. At the Dream Center there is a staff there who teach basic life skills as far as cooking, education and hygiene. They also provide trauma counseling and guide them to Jesus by simple love. Numbered and watched sleeping quarters have been transformed into beautiful, inviting rooms of restoration. Individuals and groups have adopted these rooms and redesigned them with their own unique flavor. Some rooms are designed for moms, others are for multiple children while others are designed for men. The former Jeffs bedroom is now a comforting, inviting conference room where new tenants will first meet with the staff.  This house that was once a place of horror and sin is now a home for the Dream Center filled with peace, love and the Holy Spirit. Former residents of the Jeff’s house have visited and have noticed the difference of how the house feels. What they feel and don’t know, is the Holy Spirit and the love of Christ which is now evident in the home.

            You might wonder what all of this has in connection to Hollywood. Well, first of all, the financing of course all comes from our A+ list mogul. There is one very important other thing. Have you wondered why every male celebrity over the past couple of years goes to a rehab facility in Arizona, but you never see any photos of the rehab facility or them in the rehab facility? Have you wondered why no female celebrity has ever gone to this facility? Have you ever wondered why the men who go to this facility seemingly always stay longer than a normal 30 day rehab and often seem to go back every few months for followup treatment? Have you ever wondered why all of these male celebrities seem to be the ones with the longest histories of sexual indiscretions? When they don't mention Arizona, they will say an undisclosed location. Well, apparently all these guys like going to the same location and the flow never stops. It is not just celebrities, there has been a surge of high paid executives and others that have suddenly decided this rehab place is the one that they need to go to.

           <p>
            They have figured out a way for them to go to "rehab," and get "better," so the world will forgive them and let them get back to making a lot of money.

             Dream Center in Haiti was funded by Mormon family (Kimballs) in cooperation with Michael Zaleski and other Clinton donors. It was a short distance from where the Silsby children were headed... which was temporary at a resort with a pool and hot tub rented by the Jesuit Order across the street.

            NXIVM isn't disbanded at all. Obviously, it is being run from Mexico now. Also, the male secret society within NXIVM still seems to meet. (There was an article on the Frank Report website about it.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday, I read a news report about how brainwashed the NXIVM members were. sometimes it-s hard to belive that adults would believe-such a crap.

            The claim that all the girls are innocent brainwashed victims is the misdirection and spin. It plays into an easily believable and false narrative for white knight tards to jump behind. Meanwhile, the really evil psychopath brothel madams escape- stage left.

            This one has a ring of truth.

           <p>
            Plus none of the political leaders covering and implicated in the cult have been indicted. I doubt very much rumors weren't floating around Albany. Especially with NXIVM being designated a cult and the Times-Union on the case. It appeared in other media also. Then there were the charges of branding and psychological torture and still Cuomo and the politicians/law enforcement in Albany just didn't have a clue, eh?

            They should all be in prison.......but you notice the same justice dept. that covered for them for years allows them to be out and about on bail. ? Systemic problem with western governments and catholic church.Biggest whistleblower on the catholic church , Kevin Annette has announced a satanic ritual killing of children in Vancouver in July. He was detained at the Canadian border by men who would not identify themselves....released two days later .....UN, Europe was outraged and are talking about sanctions on queen and vatican.

             Don't know what to make of Sasha Stone and his bringing charges against Kevin Annett. Seems to me that this Sasha Stone is a real snake oil salesmen. He reminds me of character in Guru Of Sad, a short film I made about phony gurus. If you want a laugh have a look, it is about 12 minutes long

             CAVE™
The CAVE™ is a multi-person, room-sized, high-resolution 3D video and audio environment invented at EVL in 1991. Graphics are projected in stereo onto three walls and the floor, and viewed with active stereo glasses equipped with a location sensor. As the user moves within the display boundaries, the correct perspective is displayed in real-time to achieve a fully immersive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bright Advanced Technology (BAT) CAVE™
In June 2001, EVL built the next-generation Bright Advanced Technology CAVE™, or BAT CAVE, using Christie Digital Systems’ Mirage 5000 projectors - the first DLP-based Active Stereoscopic projector - and near-black screens for higher contrast.
            </p>
            <p>
             The BAT CAVE’s brightness, clarity and enhanced depth perspective produce more captivating real-time, real-life projection simulations than previous CAVE™ technology.

              means. So many moving pieces, it's hard to know where to disassemble the machine so that you can lay it out disassembled yet still make it recognizeable.

             I think you need to do it (whether we understand it or not), as it will allow us some structural narrative to vet/guide our continued research and dissemination.

              On this forum yes.  I was more referring to those outside of it. Will do a summary in the future, or try to at any rate.

             I wonder whether you might consider writing a summary of your research,

             Nobody has a better overview of all connections. we could maybe sticky it, or put it in the sidebar .

              I'll think about doing a summary but feel it's still a bit premature. Atm want to focus on documentation. Summary pencilled in for the future.
