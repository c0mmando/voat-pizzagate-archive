            My child's grandfather is a mason and I find it concerning.

             Abusers can have the same split, where the day doesn't know the night.  Perhaps some Masons are naive and kept that way as a cover for higher ups.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't let him babysit or be alone with a child is my recommendation.  Fear is a big drag, I don't want to spread it, we need multi-generational family's, but stay aware.  Being a Mason is not good.  Rotary seems different? Women can join and it seems not to have secrets like the masons do.

              Yes I'm sure they have some masons thinking they "know all the secrets" but have no idea what the higher ups do.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes I have asked of this but have no reason. I had fears of it long before your comment, don't worry.

              I hadn't heard/payed attention to the rotary. Is that a female version?

               I mean the Rotary Club, similar to Elks, etc.  They are mostly businessmen and seem to do good work around the world.

               The masons have a female group, forget the name, they embroider the Maps.

                I thought I knew a lot about conspiracies and secret societies .. and then I found this place. The information and intelligence is overwhelming (in a good way).  I came to the conclusion not so long ago that most philanthropists and worldwide charities = organised evil.

             1.7 days
            </strong>
            , this important topic is
            <strong>
             page 4
            </strong>
            of the
            <strong>

            </strong>
            section.
           </p>
           <p>
            That no conversations (I'm interested in) survive in the first page limelight beyond 24 hours is ............ Just don't know what to say.  It's beyond frustrating certainly.  Some of the garbage does hang around.  Maybe it's necessary cover for the good work that is being done by so many.   ?

            On the other hand, here I get to talk privately with some of my favorite Voat names.  Unicorn and Sparkles, the name awakens my heart.

             Thank you for your comment. I feel truly heartbroken with the lack of traction on this post.

            <p>
             I felt that not only would it show the world we want a peaceful revolution it would direct curious minds where to go and look at the evidence for themselves.

             You'd think a company on the brink of closing down due to funding would do what they can for publicity.

              Once in a while I remember how far this situation has progressed.  It used to be sexual abuse of children was too awful to talk about.  Talking RSA was evidence of having gone bonkers.
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel much less alone within this forum.  Being a survivor with a recovered memory, isn't easy.  Close family believe as best they can to begin with.  Then they grow tired of the subject and want you to move on.  To Politics or something more relevant.  A small proportion of the abused go on to abuse.  Stop that cycle and we will have such a better world.

               Yes I very much agree. We have now found so much evidence and signs hidden in plain sight that there is no longer denying this.

               I believe every man and woman on here 4chan/Reddit/Steemit etc will not stop until innocent children are free. To undo corruption to the core, including care systems and reeducating people is going to be a long journey but we are all willing to take it.

               This place is beautiful and I am glad you feel heard and believed here. I am sorry for what happened to you and maybe one day would like to understand what happened to you more.

               You are right .. you had a choice to become abusive, use it as an excuse for every problem in your life or to change the world and stop abuse in its tracks. You very bravely chose the latter. I hope you wake up every day proud of yourself. Much love.

                Hopefully you've made my day! I was struggling this morning.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am proud of myself on a level that is way hard to talk about. I've the ordinary life explanation, moved here, did that, etc. and a second scenario with a lot of horror and some powerful magic in it. It took sixty years to recover the second memories. Now they are more vivid for me, than the first set.
               </p>
               <p>
                It started with a grandfather who had Masonic friends, and proceeded right up through MK-ULTRA. That shit is weird to the max. if memory serves me well.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pedo's are frequently offering you the choice they made. Join us and you will have unlimited sex friends money power, the good life. In life you have one choice to make. "Become a fucker or get fucked", is how they put it to me other times. My choosing was in an altered state, a non ordinary reality. In that reality, Christ is very real, Thank God. (He only showed up in the absolute worst moments.) I didn't have that certainty in my ordinary daily memories at all. This awesomeness came back with the memories of so much abuse.
               </p>
               <p>
                He made me see, look back into, all the horror I'd experienced, all over again. AND that it was all my personal voluntary choice before coming into this life. There was no room for complaining or feeling sorry for myself, just much still left to do. He can't do it for us, something about Free Will. No one is given a life path that they can not endure, we have enough of what we need always, even if it doesn't seem that way. Suck it up, was part of his all loving message.
               </p>
               <p>
                After accepting that necessary step, I got to see some really cool stuff. We flew all over, through time as well. The future is going to be just fine, even better than that.
               </p>

            Whistle blowers can only come out in an environment where retribution is not immediately expected.  A Truth And Reconciliation commission, like in South Africa is the only solution with safety for all.  Seeking retribution like so many ask for here, the "string em up" folks, will only drive it back underground into the shadows with a few scapegoats getting caught and nothing else admitted.  r.e. Argentina experience compared to Uruguay dealing, each with their own military's death squads.

            An excellent statement and necessary given the frequency of calls to violence from what I interpret as shills.  It is also important that we use ALL our discernment and not be naive. Disrupting naive people is the easiest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Multiple divisive tactics are aimed at all potentially disruptive groups.  Sowing confusion is sufficient to destroy any groups potential.  This is done most easily by generating fear and distrust among the group. Marginally sane individuals with nothing else to do are inserted into the groups leadership circle, their job is to create fear and confusion.  Then in the confusion they grab power by "volunteering".  They are ever present and always willing. Their minders need pay very little, it's cheap.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm encouraged by the number of strong statements here supporting nonviolent resistance.  (The shills were asleep! )
           </p>
           <p>
            Gandhi said his choice of nonviolence was tactical as well as moral.  It's a matter of recognizing who has what strengths and sticking with your own.   Ours is Light.

            Those talking shit are trying to start shit. The good news is that those who've studied their techniques for douche-baggery know the proper response is peaceful persistence. Those who advocate for violence are shills, imho.

            Agreed.  These shill asshats are trying to bait one of us into saying something which they can try and pin on someone in order to shut this site down.  The next crying Alefantis victim to pick up the "fake news hurts" torchbearer as the public is waking up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another month or two and CNN may implode in such a spectacular failure, that the topic of Pizzagate might actually stick in the MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            Protip: Go hit the investor boards hard with anti-CNN shit.  Let them know about their relations with the PedoState.  It isn't slander when its true.  Or at the very least, unconfirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's almost, but not quite as fun, as scambaiting the NIgerians when they send out email.  The Nigerians, honestly, are smarter than the shills.  IMO, the best thing would be to completely ignore and downvoat the shit out of them.  All they do is upvoat each other.  There are a lot more of us than them.  DOn't comment on their BS and downvoat 'em.  I'll do my best not to play with them.  They are fun to play with though...

             That is AMATEUR stuff, and it's horrible advice.

             Written is LIBEL, not SLANDER.

            <p>
             It hasn't been proven to be true so it isn't.  Ergo, you are committing libel.  I guarantee you if you affect CNN's traffic via that tactic, you'll be hearing from their Legal Department.  (No, I don't work for CNN so FUCK OFF with the "shill" bullshit!)

             Yep... it's so obvious. Even if something doesn't happen. They are prepping for something just in case the opportunity presents itself. I'm still banking on a prominent attack, probably against someone in the MSM. They hope this fully converts them into the "victim" category, while perpetuating the belief that forums can somehow encourage action.

             Just like the CPP shooter "listened to InfoWars" as his inspiration to carry out the shooting (which magically destroyed the same PC that allegedly had CP on it)... even though Alex Jones was relatively dismissive of the whole Pizza narrative from the very beginning.
