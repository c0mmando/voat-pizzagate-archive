             How could a wandering group in Chinatown get a hold of dolphin skins?
            </p>
            <p>
             I know that is the question you have been dying to ask.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me tell you.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Trail Of The Murex Snail began in Sri Lanka where a certain individual took on their multidimensional form. This was the creation of time, some kids call it zap, others zap, some do zig and others zag? Sound like nonsense? Yes love is a lunatic on earth. The language of love, is the word which seeks to take you from your mortal prison. The french call the climax, the little death, for the mathematical form in heaven it is the beginning of all creation the radiant form of wisdom in absolute.
            </p>
            <p>
             I clothed you with embroidered garments, and gave you sandals of Tachash to wear, and wound fine linen about your head, and dressed you in silks.
            </p>
            <p>
             G-d calls for the covering of the sacred parts of the Tabernacle (see Exodus 25) “with the skin of the dolphin.” Why the dolphin?

             Talking of Sandals, didn't Jesus wear those (Hi Michael)? Well yes, he did for he was part of the line of Delphi (dolphin). The Beloved (meaning of David) was Lucifer of course, who was Helel in Hebrew, comparative to Nero...

              <strong>
               Now The Prophecy of God's Holy Days
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm about to explain the details of the Amended Plan of God. I had only told you of the Reincarnation/Resurrection before, but the plan of God goes deep, as it must for Christ and Satan are locked in battle over the future of all souls on this planet.
             </p>
             <p>
              It begins with Passover. Christ became Passover for all Mankind. Christ died so that all souls would cease needing to experience multiple death and birth cycles.
             </p>
             <p>
              God is helping reincarnation with the resurrection, as the amended plan that will guarantee every soul on the planet can achieve paradise. Did that mean God made a mistake?"
             </p>
             <p>
              God did not anticipate the Rebellion of Lucifer. Time will be cut short. Instead of millions of years for souls to achieve oneness with God, less than 100 years is left unless Christ intervenes. Satan will influence mankind to destroy itself before the year 2100.
             </p>
             <p>
              Christ died so that all debts of all souls for all wrongs in any lifetime could be paid for by accepting his sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why was that necessary?
             </p>
             <p>
              Satan knows that if he can seduce mankind into destroying this planets ability to support life then the reincarnations will be permanently suspended.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why can't God just patch the earth like he did at Genesis? Lucifer destroyed almost all life on the planet and what was left was going to die when God showed up and restored everything.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because if Satan can seduce mankind to destroy itself, he won't be directly responsible as before, and this planet will have failed in achieving its God Potential by its own combined will.
             </p>
             <p>
              Chester we have enough nuclear weapons and biological weapons to totally destroy all life on the planet, but I'm sure that mankind will never use them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Christ died for our sins but we must do our part. The Days of Unleavened Bread follow the Passover and last for seven days. The first and last days are Holy Days. Avoiding leavened bread for seven days is symbolic of avoiding sin. Think of it as avoiding further acts of bad karma out of respect of Christ wiping our karma clean by his death sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              That covers Passover and the first two Holy Days. There are five more.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pentecost represents the sending of the Holy Spirit to Mankind. The Holy Spirit uniting with our spirit so we achieve Oneness to God, now in just one lifetime.
             </p>
             <p>
              But if we all die in World War Three, what good does it do us?
             </p>
             <p>
              (Laughing). The next Holy Day is the Feast of Trumpets and it represents the 7 trumpets spoken of in Revelation that preceeds the coming of the Messiah, the return of Jesus Christ in all his power with his Angelic Hosts, preventing mankind from destroying itself and of destroying the planet's ability to sustain life. The Eternal will send Christ when Christ's intervention is necessary to divert warring mankinds attention from destroying one another.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why will that help?
             </p>
             <p>
              Mankind will treat Christ and his angels as invaders and switch to attacking Christ. Christ and his Angels will destroy the weapons and the men who wield them. Unless those days be shortened no flesh shall be saved alive.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are you begining to see the big picture?
             </p>
             <p>
              Continuing with the story, The next Holy day is the The Day of Atonement. This represents the second war of the Angels. Michael and his Angels will fight Satan and his Angels and will throw them into the endless abyss. Satan and the unrepentent Angels will be imprisoned for one thousand years!
             </p>
             <p>
              Why one thousand years why not forever?
             </p>
             <p>
              (Taking a deep breath). The Feast of Tabernacles also lasts for seven days but it represents Christ creating a paradise on earth that will last for one thousand years. For one thousand years, souls that have almost achieved God Oneness but need just a few more lives to achieve their God Potential, will be reincarnated during Christ's rule. Christ will do what Lucifer refused, to help mankind achieve their God Consciousness. After those souls have achieved Godness, near the end of the one thousand years, souls of bad karma will begin the reincarnation to judgment. At the end of one thousand years, Satan and his Demons will be released for a short while to finish their work of deceiving the evil. Satan will once again seduce mankind into war. A final war that prepares our planet for the day of judgement! When the war is over, Satan and his Angels will be thrown into the Lake of Fire where they will exist forever.
             </p>
             <p>
              (What about all the other souls that have ever existed. How do they achieve Christ Consciousness? How about all the souls ever born in China before Chrsit was born. How can they become saved if they never heard of Christ.)
             </p>
             <p>
              After this war, the days of Judgement begin. All souls that have yet to achieve God Consciousness will be resurrected and will be judged. This time they will have complete knowledge of past lives. Every man and woman will know of the complete plan of God and their true potential to become One with God. Those that are judged unfit to continue will be thrown into the Lake of Fire. This is known as the Eternal Death. They will end up there because they refused to improve their karma despite all of the chances thay had during their reincarnated lives, including the one they had during the Utopian Reign of Christ, so they will forever be cut off from God. After the judgement God will create a New Heaven and New Earth will be the ideal environment for the remaining souls to continue their journey to become One with God.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that is one blended religion. Sounds like you got a little Hindu and Buddhism in with the Christianity and the Judaism, don't your think?
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Koran it says Be they Muslim, Jews, Christians, or Sabians, those who believe in God and the Last Day and who do good have their reward with their Lord, They have nothing to fear, and they will not sorrow." Koran: The Cow verse 62
             </p>
             <p>
              So it turns out that all of the "Jewish Holy Days" were about Christ. Some have come to pass and now look back as memorials and some have yet to happen which are the shadows of things to come.
             </p>
             <p>
              Blessed be the innocent Jews and Gentile.

              <strong>
               Reincartion The Original Plan of God
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The first Master was a Hindu. And Hinduism keeps the flame of the first plan of God burning. Reincarnation tells us where souls come from, much like evolution tells us where physical bodies come from. God instructed Lucifer to mold Mother Earth into an environment where souls would be born and die over and over until they became the souls of men. The Eternal knew that intelligent self aware souls would be able to grasp their connection to the Infinite. God creating God through the evolution of the Now.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have fossil records that prove life went from a set of simple systems to a set of complex systems over billions of years. There has been a soul for all these trees and animals.
             </p>
             <p>
              The physical bodies progressed so did the souls. We are the Created God remembering we are God. Lucifer wants to stop the progression of our souls so that we will not become God beings. This is the reason for the Rebellion of Lucifer. Lucifer became our Eternal enemy by trying to stop our reincarnations from achieving God Consciousness.

              <strong>
               Resurrection: The Amended Plan of God
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              When we die we go to  the unseen state. Unfortunately the English translation for Sheol from the Hebrew was translated as hell or grave. Hell means, to most people, where evil people go at death and the grave is where the body goes at death. However, the best translation for Sheol is the unseen state or a place of waiting for the dead. Sheol is where souls sleep until either they are reincarnated or resurrected.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why does God need both reincarnation and resurrection to achieve his master plan?"
             </p>
             <p>
              (Dancing under the moonlight) Both the original and the amended plan of God are in still valid. However, God knew there was limited time on earth before Satan would deceive mankind into trying to destroy themselves. You can still connect to God in a single lifetime and discover union with God like Enoch did. However, it is rare and the reincarnation plan of God needs millions of years to insure all the souls achieve union. The Resurrection is God's way of making sure every soul has as chance to achieve union once time is cut short. After the thousand year reign of Christ, all souls that haven't already achieved God Consciousness will be resurrected and will live in the paradise of Christ on earth and will have the ideal environment to achieve God Consciousness. For you see, the Amended Plan of God is needed because of The Rebellion of Lucifer.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are two resurrection, one at Christ's return and another after Christ has created paradise on Earth for 1,000 years. God's Grand Master Plan is to bring all souls back to God Consciousness. For one thousand years, souls that have almost achieved God Oneness will be reincarnated during Christ's rule. Christ will do what Lucifer refused, to help mankind achieve their God Consciousness. The 1,000 years of paradise will be an ideal place to be born. The Earth will be the ideal place to achieve God Consciousness. The second resurrection will occur after the 1,000 years of paradise. Before I go any further I need to explain the role Christ plays in the Plan of God.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Jesus Christ
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Christ was among us for several reasons. He came to show us how to connect to God in one lifetime. He came to pay our karma debt for us. To wash away our sins. To deliver the Wisdom of Faith, and his most important purpose was to qualify to replace Satan as spiritual guide and ruler of this world.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lucifer's name was changed to Satan after the War of Rebellion. He lost the war but since a replacement had not been found, Satan still held his office as Spiritual Ruler. Just before Jesus began his ministry, Satan took Jesus up to the highest peak to show him the Kingdoms of the World and their splendor. Satan offered to give it all to Jesus if he would just fall down and worship Satan."
             </p>
             <p>
              Had Christ yielded, mankind would never achieve God Consciousness. But since Jesus refused, Jesus became qualified to replace Lucifer as King of this World."
