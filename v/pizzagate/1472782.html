            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53016">

            Podesta talks about his finger surgery June 2014: "Went well. He was able to do all the fingers which he thought he may not have time to do because of the time they have to keep a tourniquet on my arm. Now onto rehab pain torture. Happy to be over with it. If my fingers curl back up when I'm 80, I'm just going with the fists."
           </p>
           <p>
            Given this serious blood loss risk, I wonder if it was related to spirit cooking ritual of cutting fingers.

             I think it is just due to the surgery itself, which reportedly has complications associated with it.  And there is only so long you can leave a tourniquet on..in fact, if you ever apply a tourniquet you are supposed to write on the injured person what time it was applied.  Here is a link on the surgery:

              Tourniquet is only used in 3% of patients, so highly unlikely. The close up pic of Podesta's fingers shows rugged and wide scars that clearly look like self inflicted wounds. Surgery scars are narrow, clean cuts.

               Really?  The only detail I was trying to make go away was the untrue assumption (mine included) that Podesta's hand appearance was due to occult ritual. The fact that I found the Podesta emails regarding the disease that causes the appearance of his hands and debunked that assumption only serves to strengthen the case of pizzagate.  The worst thing we can do image wise is to present untrue information as proof of pizzagate.  Would you rather be fed truth or confirmation bias?

                How do you know it is untrue that his hand is scared from occult rituals? The close up pic of Podesta's fingers shows rugged and wide scars that clearly look like self inflicted wounds. Surgery scars are narrow, clean cuts.

                 I look at other people's surgery scars for a living, Monday through Friday of every week, and they are not all "narrow, clean cuts".  Everybody heals differently, especially when there are complications such as post-op infection, which Molesta was documented to have.

                   OK, fine, but my point is that the appearance of his hands as a result of self-harm should not be presented as fact.  On the one hand (pun not intended), you have confirmation that he has Dupuytren's contracture and underwent surgery for this.  On the other, we know of his connection to spirit cooking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So, when presenting this to normies...which one sounds more plausible?   My final point is that the pedo symbology, occult symbology,  coded emails and association with known pedophiles is much more damning and does not explain away so easily.
EDIT:  BTW, it doesn't have to be either/or...it could be a combination...but again, see above point.

            I've heard this too, although it doesn't explain the band aid on the middle finger or the cryptic message on his hands.

             True on the middle finger band-aid + symbolism.
He had surgery on Jan 13, 2014 per this email...

            </p>
            <p>
             Then he apparently got a post-op infection in his little finger and was emailing his doctor about it..
