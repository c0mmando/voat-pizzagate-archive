<p>Chachi has said he is not helping Joanie, but The Fonz will. Henry Winkler, who is an incredibly nice guy, is working to get Erin Moran work again and to generate some income so she can pay her bills and take care of herself.

<p>Really? Henry Winkler is an incredibly nice guy who was trying to HELP Erin Moran? Let’s see, in one fell swoop, enty bolstered Winkler and took a shot at everyone’s favorite conservative piñata Scott Baio, and completely whitewashed the alleged abuse that went on on the set of Happy Days. Even if we make Baio the ‘’bad buy’’ in the scenario, you mean to tell me all these other knights in shining armor didn’t notice Moran was allegedly being molested?

<p>&lt;Crazy Days and Nights blind item, concerning NXIVM murder of Libyan teens, debunked here
August 5, 2018
 …
There are a lot of problems with this.
First Sara Bronfman did not meet Basit Igtet of Libya until around 2012 – a decade after Gina Hutchinson’s death. There was no Libyan connection during Gina’s life time that I know of.
In fact, there was no Bronfman connection.  Gina died just when Sara Bronfman was first joining the cult.  There was no overlap of years. At best they both knew Raniere for a couple of months. And Basit Igtet was not involved at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I said, you can’t wish facts out of existence. Evidence: it’s what court cases need and conjecture doesn’t and throws another bad light on CDAN for printing things that could have been checked out. So why didn’t he? But we’re only halfway there. There’s another very troubling blind and an even more recent one – all attacking the character of the same person. Trying to put ideas in our head, enty? Naughty, naughty.  Here’s the first blind: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-4_25.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/blind-item-4_25.html</a></p>

Apparently this former reality star turned celebrity turned possible author has recordings and texts/sexts from a married A++ lister that would cause just about every jaw in the country to drop. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s Omarosa shopping around recordings and TEXTS/SEXTS from our POTUS. And every jaw? Really? Now the upshot: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/omarosa-secretly-recorded-trumpand-played-the-audio-for-people-while-shopping-her-new-book-sources-say?ref=home">https://www.thedailybeast.com/omarosa-secretly-recorded-trumpand-played-the-audio-for-people-while-shopping-her-new-book-sources-say?ref=home</a></p>
<p>For months, it has been rumored that Manigault had clandestinely recorded on her smartphone “tapes” of unspecified private discussions she had in the West Wing. Audio actually does exist, and even stars Manigault’s former boss.
&lt;One person confirmed to The Daily Beast they had heard at least one of her recordings featuring President Trump. Multiple sources familiar with the “Omarosa tapes” described the recorded conversations between Trump and Manigault as anodyne, everyday chatter, but said they did appear to feature Trump’s voice, either over the phone or in-person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the blind was sort of right. There were tapes, BUT they were #ANODYNE. For non-English majors, it means everyday chatter. So where’s the ‘’JAW DROPPING’’ part enty? Was that put in to slur Our POTUS?  And a chief proponent of enty didn’t waste much time putting out this tidbit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDoe78359022/status/1027941757147865088">https://twitter.com/JohnDoe78359022/status/1027941757147865088</a>
If Kim Masters says Aprrentice exec producer Mark Burnett has tapes of President Trump saying the n-word.... then it definitely seems like it might be more than just a rumor. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s see one fire is put out and another started? Why does it seem likely that there’s a tape where Our POTUS says this? It seems most unlikely to me. And before anyone says this John Doe isn’t enty, enty’s problems with Trump goes back aways: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2012/03/donald-trump-kicks-out-transgender-from.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2012/03/donald-trump-kicks-out-transgender-from.html</a></p>
<p>Donald Trump has one rule when it comes to any contestant who has a chance to be Miss Universe. He needs to want to have sex with them. I always thought if Donald was horny enough he would have sex with anything, but apparently he draws the line at transgenders. Jenna Talackova was a Miss Universe Canada finalist and then someone found out she was born a man and she was kicked out of the competition. She is a woman now, but The Donald does not go for that kind of thing so Jenna was kicked out. The rules say you have to be born a woman. The Donald is old fashioned like that. Perfectly fine to saw a tail off an elephant, but if you were born with a peen he wants no part of you in his competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of the story I could see being a gossip columnist’s dream. Do I know that’s true? No. Perhaps started by contestants who didn’t win, or perhaps he did carry on an affair with a contestant who did win. But why in blazes would enty care that he wouldn’t  have sex with a transgender? Trump not being ‘’pansexual’’ is not a problem for me, so why would it be to enty? There’s also the aspect that when enty publishes these blinds, that Trump’s name is almost assuredly attached to it in the comment section. Now this can’t necessarily be viewed as deliberate, but under the circumstances, it’s yet another reason for having this blog. </p>
<p>Summation: I believe enty is an insider of PedoTown and is on a side that ‘’punishes’’ members of the cabal when they misbehave. The people he outs are those that fell out of favor either through not following orders, or through blabbing. He also would be in a perfect position to warn transgressors that they’re in trouble, and to STFU. </p>
<p>I was intrigued with the war going on between elitists in PedoTown. I do believe that theory has merit. Rose McGowan is definitely disinfo. She’s a straight up Satanist and on the side wanting to change leadership, but not the way of doing business. Liken it to a mafia war. Everybody loves the idea of ruling through blackmail and tyranny, but little Rose wants to be on top and not taking orders from all these old guard members who most likely did do her wrong. I tend to believe that part of it, but not the rest. </p>
<p>I’m just putting this out there to make some readers of CDAN aware of these discrepancies. Like I said, I’m not an ardent follower, but I have noticed these.</p>',

           So the blind was sort of right. There were tapes, BUT they were #ANODYNE. For non-English majors, it means everyday chatter. So where’s the ‘’JAW DROPPING’’ part enty? Was that put in to slur Our POTUS?  And a chief proponent of enty didn’t waste much time putting out this tidbit:

            If Kim Masters says Aprrentice exec producer Mark Burnett has tapes of President Trump saying the n-word.... then it definitely seems like it might be more than just a rumor.

           Let’s see one fire is put out and another started? Why does it seem likely that there’s a tape where Our POTUS says this? It seems most unlikely to me. And before anyone says this John Doe isn’t enty, enty’s problems with Trump goes back aways:

            Donald Trump has one rule when it comes to any contestant who has a chance to be Miss Universe. He needs to want to have sex with them. I always thought if Donald was horny enough he would have sex with anything, but apparently he draws the line at transgenders. Jenna Talackova was a Miss Universe Canada finalist and then someone found out she was born a man and she was kicked out of the competition. She is a woman now, but The Donald does not go for that kind of thing so Jenna was kicked out. The rules say you have to be born a woman. The Donald is old fashioned like that. Perfectly fine to saw a tail off an elephant, but if you were born with a peen he wants no part of you in his competition.

           The first part of the story I could see being a gossip columnist’s dream. Do I know that’s true? No. Perhaps started by contestants who didn’t win, or perhaps he did carry on an affair with a contestant who did win. But why in blazes would enty care that he wouldn’t  have sex with a transgender? Trump not being ‘’pansexual’’ is not a problem for me, so why would it be to enty? There’s also the aspect that when enty publishes these blinds, that Trump’s name is almost assuredly attached to it in the comment section. Now this can’t necessarily be viewed as deliberate, but under the circumstances, it’s yet another reason for having this blog.

           Summation: I believe enty is an insider of PedoTown and is on a side that ‘’punishes’’ members of the cabal when they misbehave. The people he outs are those that fell out of favor either through not following orders, or through blabbing. He also would be in a perfect position to warn transgressors that they’re in trouble, and to STFU.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was intrigued with the war going on between elitists in PedoTown. I do believe that theory has merit. Rose McGowan is definitely disinfo. She’s a straight up Satanist and on the side wanting to change leadership, but not the way of doing business. Liken it to a mafia war. Everybody loves the idea of ruling through blackmail and tyranny, but little Rose wants to be on top and not taking orders from all these old guard members who most likely did do her wrong. I tend to believe that part of it, but not the rest.

           I’m just putting this out there to make some readers of CDAN aware of these discrepancies. Like I said, I’m not an ardent follower, but I have noticed these.

            I thought I read in the comments of CDAN that it's understood that some of the blinds are fake, and there is a disclaimer on the site which says they sometimes publish content that is completely fictitious.  I don't think Enty (some guy claiming to be an '80s celebrity on 8Chan said she's a woman and legit) is a Q warrior at all, and she's definitely down with the LGBT movement, but that doesn't necessarily make her a shill.

             I don't like misinformation spread. Obviously, in chasing a cabal, speculation is needed, but it has to be grounded in facts. And I will totally admit to being guilty of quoting enty like he's some oracle. He's not. And you mention The Enquirer and Star, etc. They do break big stories, but that really muddies the waters because how do you know what's true and not true. And, yes, the same with enty.

            The stuff about Heather O'Rourke from a medical perspective does check out. Done mt own independant investigation into these events.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll have to find the medic account that says Heather having congenital (birth defect) stenosis is bull shit. Note that her symptoms didn't happen until 1987, about two months AFTER the date of the incident mentioned in the blind (which I identified as 11/7/1986).

             Heather O'Rourke I'm unsure about. What calls the story into question is the fact that the NXIVM story was circulated with impunity. No one checked the dates and yet it was taken as a given. That's what bothers me. That enty is completely given a pass when the instances I cited are absolutely incorrect. And at least two are proven incorrect. And as for the medical perspective, those symptoms fit many illnesses. And congenital does not necessarily mean that the symptoms show up at birth. As you well know, it means that the individual is born with a defect that may show up and afflict normal bodily functioning later on in life. So because she didn't exhibit symptoms earlier really does not mean a damn thing. It neither proves or disproves anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the case of those ridiculous tapes that were alleged to be ''jaw dropping'', thanks to this jackass enty, the story has been out there for months. And because of his the validity accorded him, the story was circulated the same way NXIVM's was and the same way O'Rourke's was. And since you are more than valid, do you actually believe the blind about Assange and Soros? I would find it difficult that you would. And what about Henry Winkler? Do you actually believe that garbage also? Henry Winkler has been more than a common thread also. He just magically appears on sets where there was suspected molestation, but nope! He's clean because enty says so!

              Winkler is a VERY likey suspect in terms of the "other show" (have deduced this to be Happy Days) in regards to the O'Rourke case.
             </p>
             <p>
              In regards to NXIVM, my theory is that the Bronfman NXIVM connections occured BEFORE Sara joined the cult. Likely how NXIVM sex trafficking ops are done. The Bronfmans are a known mafia family financially joined at the hip to the Rothschilds, and a BIG one.

               You could very well be right in terms of the Bronfman family being involved before she joined the cult. But it still has to be proven. The personal testimony of The Frank Report in terms of this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                While Gina may have been killed – I doubt – I know in my heart – that Gina would never kill teenage girls – from Libya – or anyone else. She had been raped by Raniere when she was a teen. She was not a murderer for Raniere.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I've dismissed. I sincerely doubt anyone knows anyone, and this is a tactic used by Liz Crokin to be a PedoTown apologist. (Oh, Sandra Bullock couldn't be mean because I know here and she's so great! Lady Gaga we have to forgive because she doesn't know what she's doing and she's so kind! And blah, blah, blach, blither, blither!!!) But the facts are the facts, and the point you brought up MAY (I say MAY because it is not proven) skirt the facts and make the possible relationship between Gina and Sara begin earlier than her joining lets on.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for Winkler, the fact that the Mr. Nice Guy image is plastered over any search done for Henry Winkler and Erin Moran means a whitewash has occurred. Before when when conducted a search, all sorts of crap showed up! Fights ... the fact he wouldn't ever speak with her. The double entendres he used referring to her. It was all there, but now? NOPE!!!! His reputation is squeaky clean and in line with Rob Reiner's and Ron Howard's. There's also the question of Gary Marshall. Did anyone ever do any digging on this guy? He was pretty damn big and if something were going on ... ???? Just wondering.

                I'll have to check regarding Marshall.
               </p>
               <p>
                For the record, I consider him along with Winkler and Bobby Hoffman a suspect in the O'Rourke case.
               </p>
               <p>
                The sctmn lead may have identified a possible relative of Winkler as part of the group.

                 To me, Marshall is dirty. If you go by opportunity alone, it makes him suspect. Then when you add in his position?
                </p>

                 Definitely on the radar.

               The thing is that people are very reticent to read anything negative about these sacred cows that are anything but. Information has to be vetted, and when published articles are shared like rote, there's a problem. Especially when we now have proof that some of these items are no better, in terms of accuracy, then TMZ or The Enquirer or Page Six. Those gossip columnists also get it right sometimes, but other times ... questionable or wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point, we can't be just letting this slid and rely on misinformation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks again.

                Oh I agree many are ready to believe anything about pedowood.  But they themselves have caused it, by being so giving about their personal info, they are an open book and a lot of people are searching their twitter and instagrams now, so that is why anything will be believed.  They deserve it.  But yes, also we have had to read between the lines and in the blinds.  But the blinds are purposely drawn up to protect the writer.  That's the world we live in now unfortunately, Lawsuits.

            Here's another example of what I'm talking about. It wouldn't fit within the word count constraints, but why would enty call out Assange? The man has been locked up WITHOUT ANY FRESH AIR OF SUNLIGHT, had his rights to the internet terminated, and HAS NO RIGHTS TO HEALTH CARE!!!! And yet, this fucking asshole enty fabricates a post using Assange and this is all right?

             I really wanted to call this one full circle, but think I have used that name before.This involves three women and a few men, but it is the way this all came to be which is the most interesting thing. The first woman we will call A. You all know her and she ended up with the job. She was not the first or even the second choice, but in the long run, she has worked out well and looking back, probably the best choice.  ...
            </p>
            <p>
             So, in the end, A was chosen and has been doing it for several years at this point. She has made over $1M for her work. Will she end up going to jail? I think it is more likely she will end up killed rather than jailed.

            And posts like these are okay because enty has the right to fabricate things in-between telling the truth? Why the hell is VOAT publishing anything he's posted then? And why treat it as if it were sacrosanct.

            CDAN's model to prevent lawsuits is to have a few real items buried in a bunch of made-up stuff.  This doesn't make him a disinfo agent.

             VOAT members have practically all been quoting the Heather O'Rourke story as if it's factual. And why do reveals? So he's making things up, and then revealing names that aren't accurate? That would not prevent a lawsuit.

               That's an old question. People always raise this whenever someone says something outrageous.
              </p>
              <p>
               The prevailing wisdom is that suing validates a wild claim. Ir's why celebrities/politicians usually don't touch these allegations with a ten foot pole. They prefer to just let them blow over.
              </p>
              <p>
               Plus, even if crazily inaccurate, the claim has to be proven to be malicious.

              It's not supposed to be anything but entertainment, the guy isn't a journalist.   The thing is, we have no idea which parts are real and which are made up.  Even the reveals, they're mostly things that have shown up reported in the Daily Mail or on TMZ, nothing shocking.   The shocking ones like Heather, there probably is enough truth in the story to prevent anyone from suing him and having to show their cards.
             </p>
             <p>
              I read (and sometimes participate) in CDAN daily, mostly for the comments.  Usually there is more insight and truth there than in the blinds.  I don't think the few examples here prove Enty's a disinfo agent.
