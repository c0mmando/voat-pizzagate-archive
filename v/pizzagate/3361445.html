Epstein (...) had an unusual dream: He hoped to seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition.</p>
<p><em>Mr. Epstein’s vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of improving the human race through controlled breeding.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the same tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics (see below).</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. </p>
<p>They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist <strong>Murray Gell-Mann</strong>, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong>; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist <strong>Stephen Jay Gould</strong>; <strong>Oliver Sacks</strong>, the neurologist and best-selling author; *<em>George M. Church\'</em>, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be altered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist <strong>Frank Wilczek</strong>, a Nobel laureate.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p>The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein’s money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. </p>
<p>Some of the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, and even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein’s half-baked scientific musings.</p>
<p>Scientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, where Dom Pérignon and expensive wines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at <strong>Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics</strong>, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation.</p>
<p>Others flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his private island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. Epstein had chartered.</p>
<p>The <strong>Harvard</strong> cognitive psychologist <strong>Steven Pinker</strong> said he was invited by colleagues — including <strong>Martin Nowak</strong>, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist <strong>Lawrence Krauss</strong> — to “salons and coffee klatsches” at which Mr. Epstein would hold court.</p>
<p>While some of Mr. Pinker’s peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an “intellectual impostor.”</p>
<p>“He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack,” Mr. Pinker said.</p>
<p>Another scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, <strong>Jaron Lanier</strong>, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual reality, said that Mr. Epstein’s ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous proof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace.</p>
<p>Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor.</p>
<p>Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At one session at <strong>Harvard</strong>, <strong>Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation</strong>, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Pinker said he had rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been “voted off the island” and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein’s gatherings.</p>
<h1 id="md-section-2"></h1>
<p>Then there was Mr. Epstein’s interest in eugenics.</p>
<h2 id="md-on-multiple-occasions-starting-in-the-early-2000s-mr.-epstein-told-scientists-and-businessmen-about-his-ambitions-to-use-his-new-mexico-ranch-as-a-base-where-women-would-be-inseminated-with-his-sperm-and-would-give-birth-to-his-babies-according-to-two-award-winning-scientists-and-an-adviser-to-large-companies-and-wealthy-individuals-all-of-whom-mr.-epstein-told-about-it.">On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it.</h2>
<p>It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the law.</p>
<p>Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein’s mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein’s goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as working at NASA, but he did not remember her name.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts of the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted to strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. The repository discontinued operations in 1999.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen candidates to bear Mr. Epstein’s children.</strong></p>
<h1 id="md-section-3"></h1>
<p>Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA.</p>
<p>One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier’s interest in cryonics, an unproven science in which people’s bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen.</p>
<p><em>/rolls on floor</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Southern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it was engaged in DNA analysis.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>In 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which now operates under the name Humanity Plus.</strong></p>
<p>Luminaries at Mr. Epstein’s St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. <strong>Hawking</strong> and the <strong>Caltech</strong> theoretical physicist <strong>Kip S. Thorne</strong>. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. </p>
<p>Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated with how certain traits were passed on, <strong>and how that could result in superior humans</strong>.</p>

          </p>
          <h2 id="md-on-multiple-occasions-starting-in-the-early-2000s-mr.-epstein-told-scientists-and-businessmen-about-his-ambitions-to-use-his-new-mexico-ranch-as-a-base-where-women-would-be-inseminated-with-his-sperm-and-would-give-birth-to-his-babies-according-to-two-award-winning-scientists-and-an-adviser-to-large-companies-and-wealthy-individuals-all-of-whom-mr.-epstein-told-about-it.">
           On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it.
          </h2>
          <p>
           It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.
          </p>
          <p>
           The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the law.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein’s mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein’s goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as working at NASA, but he did not remember her name.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts of the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted to strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. The repository discontinued operations in 1999.)
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen candidates to bear Mr. Epstein’s children.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <h1 id="md-section-3">
          </h1>
          <p>
           Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA.
          </p>
          <p>
           One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier’s interest in cryonics, an unproven science in which people’s bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen.

            Kip S. Thorne

           . One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated with how certain traits were passed on,

            We are truly living in the last days. Satan is pushing his agenda very hard on his minions and the idea of attaining your own form of godhood/eternity is everywhere. I know that Jeff Epstein is probably terrified of what is coming next. Personally, I am praying for his survival. I want him to get his heart right so he'll find the courage inside himself and start telling the truth. Not for a deal, but because it's right. I'm a dreamer, I know. But if you don't ask you won't receive. 😉

            I'd bet that 'dream' became more than a mere fantasy --that is to say,  a reality.  There was plenty of time to implement, or at least experiment. Just a hunch, but I'd lay a paycheck on it.  Excellent work, @ think-.

           </p>
           <p>
            The web they've set up is complicated because of the shell companies, diverse agencies involved and complicated business arrangements.  I'm still putting data together and one day I will summarise the processes and procedures involved for pizzagate researchers to understand the patterns to look for...But for now I'll try to put here a few excerpts from some links but really, to undertsand this you MUST go those links and read them in their entirety.  Your post has highlighted to me that it is now beyond time for me to put together my research in a visual diagram, to provide the information in a visual format.. it is the only way for people (including myself) to get out heads around this whole operation.  Anyway...

            Let's start with links between Raniere and Epstein (NXIVM had there own baby farm, right?) ...

            So, remember we have had a spate of NYPD cops 'suicides' and I wrote a number of posts about various Departments of Human Services?  (
            <em>
             An aside:  the recent spate of fires in Baltimore where police are saying that they cannot find the connection between them?  One connection is that they are all very close to the Baltimore Department of Human Services.. just sayin'...

            ).  Here's one series of comments where I mention the Raniere and Epstein link.. in the post about the New Jersey Department of Human Services ...

            At Epstein's school where he taught, at one point during their history, they were running a program on disabled/dyslexic children called the DALTON PLAN and there were reports of
            <strong>
             strangers taking children  down into the basement.

             ...Drawing on unprecedented access to both Eisner and Roy Disney, current and former Disney executives and board members, as well as thousands of pages of never-before-seen letters, memos, transcripts, and other documents, James B. Stewart gets to the bottom of mysteries that have enveloped Disney for years: What really caused the rupture with studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, a man who once regarded Eisner as a father but who became his fiercest rival? How could Eisner have so misjudged Michael Ovitz, a man who was not only “the most powerful man in Hollywood” but also his friend, whom he appointed as Disney president and immediately wanted to fire? What caused the break between Eisner and Pixar chairman Steve Jobs, and why did Pixar abruptly abandon its partnership with Disney? Why did Eisner so mistrust Roy Disney that he assigned Disney company executives to spy on him? How did Eisner control the Disney board for so long, and what really happened in the fateful board meeting in September 2004, when Eisner played his last cards?

             Ok - would you perhaps have some sources or links I could add to my OP - thank you! And why write an article about this projet alt all - to me it reads like a whitewashing article a la 'the scientists kept in touch with him for the money' (not because Epstein provided them with underage girls).

            Yet another in a long, long line of DEMOCRATIC RACISTS who would deny health care to the poor (who are largely of races other than white) 'cause they'd overpopulate the world. And of course Epstein advocated populating the world with depraved, perverted elites such as himself, Sir Jimmy Savile, Prince Andy, Prince Charlie, James Comey, Roman Polanski, Hillary, Sir Clement Freud and Marina Abramović specialist in spirit cookery to name a few.

            Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through
            <strong>
             John Brockman
            </strong>
            , a literary agent whose bestselling science writers include
            <strong>
             Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif., where Mr. Epstein was introduced to scientists, including
            <strong>
             Seth Lloyd
            </strong>
            , the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. Epstein to be “charming” and to have “interesting ideas,” although they “turned out to be quite vague.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman’s
            <strong>
             Edge Foundation
            </strong>
            , were the Google founders
            <strong>
             Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos
            </strong>
            , who was accompanied by his mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Brockman was Mr.
            <strong>
             Gell-Mann’s
            </strong>
            agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 book “The Quark and the Jaguar,” thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr.
            <strong>
             Pinker
            </strong>
            said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. “Needless to say, I find Epstein’s behavior reprehensible,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr.
            <strong>
             Thorne
            </strong>
            , who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein’s 2006 conference, believing it to be co-sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, “I have had no contact with, relationship with, affiliation with or funding from Epstein,” he said. “I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving minors.”
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Lee McGuire
            </strong>
            , a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. “Mr. Epstein appears to have made up lots of things,” Mr. McGuire said, “and this seems to be among them.”

            **While he might have been truly interested in eugenics and transhumanism for his personal gain, please keep in mind that he very likely is a Mossad (and CIA) agent, so he possibly tried to collect info on scientific research for Mossad (and maybe the CIA as well).
