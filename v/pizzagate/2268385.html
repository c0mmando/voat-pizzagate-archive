            Something people need to keep in mind is that
            <strong>
             pedophilia is 'baked-in' to Islam
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It's specifically mentioned and approved of in both the Koran and in the hadiths.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fundamentalist Islamic authorities have repeatedly issued fatwas stating that child marriage, paraphilic sex with children under 9 years old, and penetrative sex with children older than 9 is all lawful. The most famous fatwas on this issue were written by Ayatollah Khomeni, the leader of the Iranian Islamic revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is all laid out clearly here:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pedogate/1903145">
             https://voat.co/v/pedogate/1903145
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But it does seem like the real problem is in fundamentalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            To my mind, it's no accident that Catholic priests (and nuns) and orthodox Jewish rabbis have been so repeatedly exposed for being pedophiles. So much that they've become a byword for child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among 'moderate' Christians Jews and Muslims, pedophiles don't seem to be more numerous than in the general population, and this seems to be true of their clerical people as well.

            Not all Muslims and not all those that are of the Islamic faith are Pedo Rapists.  BUT.  They went out of their way to bring many of them into Europe, the EU to turn the children into Pedos as well.  Keep raping them over and over and over and they may just turn as well.  They want to turn the world into ONE Big Pedo World for Themselves.  The more this happens the more Sad this will get.  Those poor children.  I can imagine that many believe this is how things work, for they see it in the Refugee Camps.  The Camps are Breeding Grounds for Child Rape.  This can't get more disgusting.  Well, maybe it can.

             Lol they invited a Muslim army to repeatedly rape millions of children so that they too would become child rapists and continue the cycle?  Why would you say such a ridiculous thing, woman?
            </p>
            <p>
             THERE ARE NO MORE CHILDREN IN EUROPE!  THESE COUNTRIES HAVE SUB-REPLACEMENT BIRTHRATES BUT MUSLIMS DONT!

            <p>
             THEY BLACKMAIL POLITICIANS PRECISELY TO ACHIEVE VOTES LIKE AMNESTY! EVERY WHITE CHILD IN AMERICA UNDER FIVE IS A MINORITY AMONG PEERS.

             The only conceivable reason you could get things SO INCREDIBLY ASS-BACKWARD is EXTREME NAIVETE on the subject of demographics and race.  And obviously as a western woman (the worst of God's creatures) you have ZERO LOYALTY TO YOUR OWN.

            TBH, I think it has less to do with pedophilia normalization (that's just a symptom) , and more to do with the reality that EUropeans of all nationalities are now majority non religious (well over 60+ % atheist according to all the polls and surveys I've seen since the late 1990s) . Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and again, and Karl Marx was right when he called religion "the opiate of the people". The EUropean elites think  EUropeans are insufficiently obedient and docile now, but they would be if they were fervently religious , as they were believed to be in yestercentury. Since Christianity has failed to turn the EUropean masses back  into docile serfs who will do and say exactly what the priests and ministers tell them, well, what else can they do but import a bunch of vicious third-worlders well known to believe that their prophet was the last prophet, whose teachings abrogated all previous prophets', AND that his believers have the right and duty to enslave, convert, or murder all nonbelievers, AND that any atrocity including rape and torture is acceptable if it terrorizes populations into accepting the dubious "blessings" of islam? The eventual goal , after several generations of terror, is a pan EUrope population that at least pretends to be moslem, which the EUropean elites think can be controlled via state-controlled imams , because that's what they think they see when they look at majority-moslem third world countries ; whether that's an accurate view is irrelevant because all people (EUropean elites included) see what they want to see. And what they see is, islam as a  sure-fire way to create social cohesion and easily controlled populations...After a few generations of terror, torture,and  banning of "hate speech" in protest, of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who thinks this is just a conspiracy theory : Read some history books about the spread of islam, and about the utterly brutal invasion of India especially. Read an English translation of the koran. For that matter, just look at online videos: Whatever else they are, moslems are honest about their intentions ; you can find many online videos in which they'll tell you precisely which verses or teachings justify any atrocity to spread islam, their right to enslave non moslems, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The western elites want a  one-world government (they've been quite open about that goal over the last few decades)  ;believing pious  moslems are supposed to want a global caliphate ; the former think they can use the latter as a cats' paw towards their goals. God help the rest of us.

             The Mughal invasion of India was the worst genocide in all of history. Made the Nazis, Stalin and Mao look like amateurs:

             Just as one example, Tamerlane (Timur Barlas) himself recorded that in Delhi alone, he surrounded the Hindu part of the city with his army and systematically slaughtered approximately 150,000 people.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of Tamerlane's techniques for getting a local ruler to surrender was to pick out a town to set an example of, then his army would surround it, and if any Muslims were in it they were allowed to leave. His soldiers would then set the entire town on fire, and capture and execute all who tried to flee the fire. The goal was to have no one left alive from the town's non-Muslim population.

            Where is the legal information about this website? 
Its filled with anti-Islam propaganda with the only purpose to hate muslims. And I get that after all the bad news people in the west hear about Islam (mostly second-hand) they slowly but surely create antipathy towards muslims in general. How does the human brain work? If you keep repeating the same stories eventually it doesnt need proof for the formation of opinion. Each person with a scarf and long beard becomes a suspect. Now what do you call that again? Exactly. Divide and conquer. So let me tell you. The same entities that promote #refugeeswelcome promote these anti-Islam websites aswell. It doesnt matter which side your on, you remain a powerless pawn on the chessfield and you fall for it.
Now that doesnt mean youre not allowed to critize Islam. Of course its not flawless. But there is no ISLAM. There are many many groups with different ideologies within it. The most brutal one is wahhabism and takes credit for almost every major „islamic“ terror attack in the last decades. Main supporter of this ideology is Saudi Arabia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know not a single muslim who supports pedophilia or is married to a child. And I know many. Ive been to many muslim countries and have never seen anything like that. Not saying it doesnt exist. 
But hearing about all these busts of massive underground pedo networks of europe and the missings of thousands of minor refugees who probably got kindnapped, trafficked, tortured, killed and sold on the darkweb I wouldnt point the finger to anybody else.

             Shut up dude, nobody wants to hear you try and defend Muslims.   Islam is a culture that belongs in the Middle East,  not the western world lolol fuck outta here.   Just because YOU know Muslims who wouldn’t rape children doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.  I mean, they worship their prophet who raped a girl at 9 years old.   WAKE UP

               Imagine official Muslim law was "if it bleeds it breeds" even a 14 year old: at least SHES MARRIED I.E. WHEN SEX IS APPROPRIATE.

              Thanks to Jew media western 14 year olds are often sexually active anyway!
              <br/>
              With sex separated from childbirth and marriage we see an explosion of illegitimacy, poverty, sexual disease, debased culture, and (the endgame for the Jews) COLLAPSED BIRTHRATE AS WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRICKED INTO TAKING BARRENNESS FOR LIBERATION JUST AS THEY WERE TRICKED INTO SMOKING AS A FORM OF ASSERTING THEIR FREEDOM!

              Wow you guys think youre redpilled but at the same time biased as fuck without even realizing it. Seriously, whats wrong when people around the world unite against evil? I talk about my personal experiences and you dont want to accept it, thats just sad.  I say people of the world unite and this is all you black&amp;white thinkers get out of my message.

              Yeah Muslims rape children, white Europeans never do though. Wrap it up folks. pixiesbitch has solved the world pedophilia epidemic, because muh Islamzzz are the cause of all that is wrong in the universe. Its not like the Middle Eastern elite, the Rothschilds and European elite are directly connected in this massive web of filth. Its just the damn muslims man. They're the rapists. There's no such thing as rape in Europe without them. Of course.

           </p>
           <p>
            No! THIS is for sure not their plan. You guys are good at "oh look at fake news about trump". There was 15 years fake news about muslims. Man if you think these people are coming to europe to fuck kids instead of escaping rockets that blast your own kids into pieces than i dont know guys. Then you are fighting the wrong thing. Maybe THATS the plan of the elite? hm....

            Dont want to leave just a "deconstructive" comment. Just want to hint to you not to fight "me" and "my family" so to say. Islamic culture, pedophilia... Thats very offensive bro. Like VERY offensive in this whole fucking context.

                "In 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of Delaware where it was 7. The ages of consent were raised across the U.S. during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. "

               your efforts against paedophilia are welcomed. But this is not a false either-or proposition. Ayisha's age in the Quran is not disclosed. But in numerous Hadiths of the greatest Islamic authority aside from the Quran, it says she was 6 yrs old when married and 9 when Mohammed consecrated that marriage. The Quran also says its followers can take sex slaves from the age of menstruation upwards. If this makes you uncomfortable, perhaps you should reconsider your faith.

                I know EVERYTHING(!!!!) about spirituality. I please you from heart, dont think i cant read life just because you have a little "muslim" lable about me in your mind. I dont give a single motherfucking shit about Mohammed the pedo. There is another story behind all of this. Its a story of love, god. That we are all one, and for ever. I dont even know how to put this unimageable beautiful thing in words.
               </p>
               <p>
                And if you really want "muslims" to be better, to learn something new and accept truth, to be more enlightened, you also have to SEE it when its happening. Dont fucking think you can teach me something right away just because i wrote i'm a muslim. And dont think a muslim men cant look at a child and see god and its beautiful creatin in it and love it from the deepest depths of the heart. He does not have to drop all his faith to understand this. Fucking stupid assholes.

                 Dude. You can identify as spiritual and promote all those things. When you attach it to Islam then you tacitly endorse a 'holy book' that is utterly abhorrent and can all too easily lead men to hatred.
Sounds like your worldview is completely incompatible with the edicts of the Quran, so i have no clue why you elect to identify as Islamic

                 Finska's point can be summarized as follows and its something that disturbs me greatly too.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to Islam, its not rape unless witnessed by four males (women aren't considered valid sources of testimony), even if forensically it WAS rape. Without the sufficient witnesses, the woman is to be executed under adultery (the rapist doesn't get punished at all). The four wives thing too.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Basically Islam regards women as mere sex slave property.

                  and the 4 male witness provision is only available to Muslim women at that. Where the woman is not muslim, there is no such thing as rape

                   Let's also not forget about the whole "forced marriage" thing where women and female children face honor killings, torture, and mutilation (includes acid attacks) for trying to resist or escape.

                 I understand there is a deep connection to God and spirituality available to muslims through certain sufi ideas and practices such as oneness. I dont know much about the rest of the relgion but I am surprised to hear you say you dont give a shit about Mohamed when so many others are willing to die for him. Also why do many muslims treat women and female children so poorly if they believe in oneness?

             Don't take it too personally, the Jews get it too. Try and look at it objectively rather than emotionally, because I found it hard to accept all the notion of people hiding behind Judaism to be pedos and I was willing to support Israel, but I'm learning to become more and more skeptical as we move forwards.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should be able to relate to this because I have close family ties to Judaism, though I am a Christian, I didn't want to believe what I heard at first.

              Here is this my advise from the first post: Dont fly to high and think that this refugee situation is not because of war, real shit, but because in truth its a secret deep state mission to infiltrate europre with pedos, so we can normalize pedophilia in europe. Do you hear yourself? Jesus... help them please.

               Its worse than that. You forgot to add that there are foundations sucking hundreds of billions of dollars into their pockets from taxpayer money. They keep the money and leave the refugees hanging with nothing. Its a huge scam.

               Hooray, let's take all the refugees in just like Sweden does and get bombed by the extremists that blend in with them! I'm not saying that there aren't Muslims who are "decent people" and innocent of any crime, but the numbers show that Islamic terrorism will shoot up, rape and pedophilia will greatly increase and political correctness will make me want to put my own head through a pike.

               The innocent asylum seekers are not worth our own innocent people dying or becoming victims because you feel like guilt tripping us all to our own suicide when we open the floodgates to the sick people who hide behind the MSM PC representation of a "peaceful religion". We just aren't that gullible. Maybe in your 14 days of being here you too could learn not to be.

            There's also a whole gnostic freemasonic luceferian angle to it. Eliminate all gender, sex, race, religious and age-based differences by combining them all. This is baphomet. The union of the devil and the divine, man and woman, day and night even man and beast. The arms bear the Latin words SOLVE (separate) and COAGULA (join together). That could also be called divide and conquer.

            OP is an idiot.  LMAO!! The goal is to Islamicize Europe to normalize pedophilia (officially a capital crime in Muslim countries) although Europe and US had age of consent laws as low as 9 only 120 years ago.

           <p>
            <strong>
             We now have to consider the fact that the Vatican/RCC actually created Islam

           </p>
           <p>
            which makes the Vatican historically the most violent organization in the world ...
           </p>
           <p>
            an award they already had pretty much for Crusades and Inquisition ...
           </p>
           <p>
            and seems likely that at the time there would have also been sexual abuse of women and children ...
not mentionable, of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLUS their Papal Edicts to Discovers/Invaders here to "enslave or kill" Africans
in slavery here and native people here ... ending up in Genocide of 112 million
native people here and theft of their land.

             Feminism died a long time ago. It is now a war on women, men, children, and everything else that is not as perverted as it is. 3rd wave feminism is what it has now warped into. If you look up most of the tenets of third wave feminism in a reputable psych document they are listed as mental illnesses. True story. See: Transgender, also known as mental illness Gender Dysmorphia

             You know all about that. You tried to sell it to me and even told me that almost 20 percent of children were "unsure of their gender." NOT.

               Your "matriarch" you want to bring in is Maitreya. I will have none of it, and obviously the overwhelming majority of the population is not sick enough to fall for it either. And at least he grabs the correct gender instead of raping little kids. You know how you know that is true? Because the baby rapers hate his guts, thats how.

soil of the planet with blood-letting but which has so destroyed all of Nature

                Humans are part of Nature ... when we do harm to Nature we are doing harm to ourselves.
And a clue to that is the endless illnesses suffered now by humans and still a growing list.
               </p>
               <p>
                Male-supremacist religions -- like Maitreya, -- underpin Elite patriarchy.
               </p>
               <p>
                And have encouraged destruction of Nature via the fakery of "Manifest Destiny" 
and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" which are licenses to Elite Patriarchy to exploit
Nature, Animal-Life, Natural Resources ... and even other human beings according
to various myths of "inferiority."

                Patriarchy came to power only by violence and holds power still only by murderous violence.

                   It is estimated that roughly 10% of the population is involved in the dark occult, which means 90% of the population thinks you are so disgusting that you should not be allowed to roam freely in society. This is why you slither around and sneak in your poison pills as secretly as possible. Cock roaches hide and scatter when the light comes on too.

                  You're denying that organized patriarchal religion is male-dominated/male-supremacist?
Or that it offers only an all-male god?
I'm sure you know that many Popes have spoken of the male-female nature of all life -- 
including "god."  See:  Pope John XXIII/Vatican II

                 <p>
                  In fact, it is the long and destructive history of Elite Patriarchy that is the biggest BASH against men.

                  Males are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males according to studies.

                   Why don't you stop ass covering for the black Jesuits and call them out by name and their affiliations to the Jewish Zionists instead of bashing all men? You don't because you are a destroyer of cohesive social systems. Its what you do because you are a parasite just like the rest of your associates.

                       That is what your transgender agenda is. Don't say you didn't promote it because I can screen shot it. Females are some of the worst child abusers in human history. You are engaged in a war on women with your Neo Feminism. You keep posting your social safety net destruction program and I will keep pointing it out, satanic asshole.

Well, I guess our government/military and the medical establishment is
support genital mutilation then?
What an upside down world you live in.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        People are supporting the HUMAN rights of transgenders to make decisions
about their own bodies.  THEY make the decisions about what to do or not to do.

                       <p>
                        Females are NOT our sexual abusers of children which is made clear every day.
Women and children are sexually abused and physically beaten every day by males.
Females 82% of the victims -- males 12%.
Males are our sexual abusers of children.

                        I have no clue what "Neo-Feminism" but presume it's another bit of right wing
propaganda.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The best definition I know of Feminism is:  Feminism is anti-domination of anyone by anyone else.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        What social safety net -- ?  Anything that existed to support the unemployed or the impoverished or
children in our nation has been destroyed by right wing male "Christians" in our Congress.

                          Police arrested a 75-year-old former cult leader, who allegedly tortured children for years, for the murder of a child in her religious boarding school.

                          Police arrested Anna Elizabeth Young, aka “Mother Anna,” in Marietta, Ga., last week after multiple witnesses who once lived at Young’s Florida boarding school, The House of Prayer for All People, came forward with stories of abuse, torture, and even murder, according to The Washington Post. Police charged Young with pre-meditated first-degree murder of a child in the case of Emon Harper, a young boy who died at age 2 or 3 from torture and starvation in the 1980s.

                          “We think there are many, many more. We can document other states and other missing children that we believe are tied into this,” Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey told The Gainesville Sun. “They ran a religious institution — exorcising demons and other things like that. We have documentation involving her clear back the ’60s. We did extensive forensic examination on the property this summer. We are still analyzing the evidence that we gathered.”

                         <p>
                          Young’s arrest comes as the culmination of a year-long investigation into allegations of child abuse and murder at Young’s hands, but it is only the latest charge in her history of child abuse. Police charged Young with felony child abuse in 1992 for bathing a 12 year old girl in chemicals, giving the child severe burns, according to a press release from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. Young fled the state and remained a fugitive for eight years until authorities found her living the attic of a relative’s house in Illinois. Young pleaded no contest to the charge and served six months in jail in 2001.

                          Young later moved to Marietta, Ga., and remarried under the surname Anderson, but police arrested her Nov. 30 after developing new information they claim substantiated stories of murder from witnesses who once lived at the boarding house.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          “Witnesses came forward from the House of Prayer alleging brutality and even some children being murdered,” Forgey told ABC20. “It’s not just one isolated incident of beatings. There were numerous children that were beaten, locked in solitary confinement, food-withheld.”

                          Young opened the boarding school in Micanopy, Fla., with her late husband Jonah Young in 1983. The boarding school operated for almost a decade, during which children were subjected to exorcisms, chemical baths, starvation, beatings, and other horrific practices, police claim. Police described Young as a former cult leader and said that her abusive practices were religious in nature.

                         <p>
                          “This is just the tip of the iceberg that we know of,” Forgey told ABC20. “The arrest is in no means going to close this case, because there is so much more and so many more potential victims and witnesses.”

You know that too because you are probably one of them. Always the man's fault huh? Women just don't have the capacity to be fucking evil do they?

                            At times, my mother and stepfather would leave us with a couple of friend of theirs - a man and woman about their age, who, unknown to us at the time, were also friends of my paternal grandfather, Art - while they went out for the day, or to a movie, or shopping.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            Before the end of that first month home with them, before Thanksgiving 1956, the woman babysitter called me to the bedroom. My mother and stepfather were not home.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            The sitter was laying nude on the bed, and told me she was going to train me and show me what sex is. I felt that it was wrong, but because she was an adult - and because she threatened to tell my stepfather I had been disobedient, I obeyed.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            She told me to strip and climb on the bed, and then forced me to examine every part of her body as she described the function of each - and what it felt like to be touched. She forced me to touch her breasts, her vulva, to insert my fingers inside her vagina. When I hesitated, she told me that I was being selfish pig like my real father.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            She then told me to lay on my back - and she performed oral sex on me, bringing me to a ejaculation-less climax - I was scared and excited, but had no idea of why it felt like it did.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            I told her I was scared, that it didn't feel right - and again she told me that I was being stupid, that I was wrong - that resisting her was the same as withholding love, that it was selfishness. I felt intensely guilty - but didn't say anything because I did not want to upset or displease her - I internalized the feelings, out of guilt, out of shame - and because she was the adult whom my mother and stepfather said I must obey - or pay the consequences.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            She stimulated me to another erection, and guided me to having vaginal intercourse with her. It was frightening, shameful and yet exciting; the physical feelings were intensely pleasurable and overwhelming.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            This happened several times over the next couple of weeks; then she initiated the next phase.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            She told me that she had been showing me "love" by giving me pleasure, and that it was only right and natural that I return that "love." She reinforced that by bringing me to climax again, orally - and then she made me perform oral sex on her. I gagged, and she yelled at me, told me I was being selfish again, and forced my face back in; forced me to continue licking her clitoris and vagina, forced me to bring her to climax.
                           </p>
                           <hr/>
                           <p>
                            Afterwards, she told me how good I had been to her, how loving, how kind - how proud she was of me - and she took me and my sister and brother out to a dinner and a movie as a treat.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            This happened over and over again; even when she was menstruating -

             Stop blaming those terrible "white heterosexual Christians" for things they did not do. In our last conversation you lamented the plight of the poor black slaves and the torment they suffered from us terrible white heterosexual Christians. When I pointed out that the black slave trade was run out of Newport and Charleston and was a Jewish operation you called me racist and anti-semitic. Please say that you condemn the Jewish slave traders for black slavery in America. And please admit that holding white people in bondage as "indentured servants" up unto death is the same as slavery.

             As documented below they also owned the whiskey distilleries and gunpowder factories that destroyed the American Indians. Please apologize for the Jewish destruction of the American Indians.

              The date of the above letter was November 27,1773. We have not yet concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful compilations made available by the “Carnegie Institute.”
             </p>
             <p>
              On November 29,1767, the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez—who had been cheated by one of his kind— from Charleston, where he had journeyed to better control his Black cargo, wrote Aaron Lopez at Newport:
             </p>
             <p>
              “These Negroes, which Captain Abraham All delivered to me, were in such poor condition due to the poor transportation, that I was forced to sell 8 boys and girls for a mere 27 (pounds), 2 other for 45 (pounds) and two women each for 35 (pounds).” (No doubt, English money)
             </p>
             <p>
              Abraham Pereia Mendez was very angry and accused Aaron Lopez of “cheating” him. This letter delineates to us that this generous and fine citizen of Newport was insatiable in his greed for money. This is what caused the Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein to present this nobleman, Aaron Lopez, to pursue his objectionable methods. Negroes presented to him but a commodity.
             </p>
             <p>
              In all of the letters which the “Carnegie Institute” published, it stresses the lack of human sympathy for the poor Negro slaves. This lack of feeling and compassion for the
              <strong>
               abused and pitiful Blacks at the hands of their Jewish dealers
              </strong>
              , can be read out of the diary of a captain who manned a ship owned by Aaron Lopez. The entrees concern a trip from the African Coast to Charleston. Moreover, they are authentic documents, published by the “Carnegie Institute” in Washington, D.C., calling attention to an organization which had heretofore known little or nothing about; neither had they encountered further publicity in books or newspapers.

             </p>
             <p>
