            In my opinion these pictures focus on the wrong issue. It would be colossally stupid to use real human remains instead of legally obtainable animal bones and organs. And the skull in the 3rd picture isn't even real (a real skull is hollow).
           </p>
           <p>
            You are calling for an investigation in those memes. So what happens if these pictures get investigated and nothing damning comes out of it? It would hurt the credibility of the rest of Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I thank you for the effort, but I think these memes will do more harm than good.

             Here's the thing,  most  animal rights activists (that I know)  would be all over those bones.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wasn't going to use the 3rd one and thought I might delete it.  I think I'll go back and delete it.

            <p>
             If one sees questionable pictures, especially involving children,  it would be great to be proven wrong. Fear of the outcome doesn't change the fact that this type of  so-called  art-ritual would be worthy of investigation.   I'm not sure why you think   a  non-damning verdict would change the overall point.

               The  flesh had to be peeled off that bone. 
 okay,  let's say they   "most likely"   come from cattle?
               <br/>
               Are you sure it's cattle?   Most likely sure? 100%  sure? 
 You're  ASSUMING that you're  most likely sure.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've given this some thought in the last hour and I believe that it's the type of  ""most likely""   assumptions that has produced the degraded world we live in  where everything is accepted and nothing is questioned by anybody because they assume that it's just animals.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or they assume that picture one isn't an actual dead woman.
              </p>
              <p>
               This type of  assumption has been a slippery slope, which has led to a gateway where ritual is shown as art in public and nobody  calls for a simple investigation!
              </p>
              <p>
               That's where we are today and we shouldn't be surprised that this is the outcome we're here posting on this forum about!  You can go on average people's media and see  cannibal photos or pedo-signs  in plain sight.   It's spilled over into the general public.  Look at the reddit owner for hells sake!
              </p>
              <p>
               Yet your solution is the same one that's brought us here through  apathetic and accepting assumptions as gateways to here and now.  And you want me to continue to follow down this path?    NO.   I've seen where it leads.  If you want something to change you have to do something differently, otherwise you're offering me the definition of insanity (doing the same thing over and expecting different results.)
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't give a fuck if it's pigs bones,  and since this  wikileak group   seems to favor pigs and pig farm access (AF.'s Instagram photo and j podesta's history)  it may well be pig farms that supplied these bones,  but where's the woman in the body organ removal photo?
              </p>
              <p>
               ...  but considering the compendium of  Abrahomovic photos that show  people  eating  food   in the form of humans under the  guise of  various  ''art''  in the forms of food, with human heads as  table centrpieces centerpiece,  and their fascination with removing organs from human bodies  (podesta's pic of cannibalism of a human body)    how can anyone be sure the woman in the picture is alive, or the bones are animal bones?
              </p>
              <p>
               If people see something suspicious and ask for an investigation these types of things might not have come into the mainstream like we're seeing today.
              </p>
              <p>
               Meanwhile,  millions of children go missing each year globally, while many people are either so apathetic or uneducated and don't give 2 shits.

              </p>
              <p>
               The public doesn't place a phone call to demand investigation, which causes this type of snowballing and   desensitization of cannablism  aka   Abromovic  from  flooding society as acceptable then I don't care if it's pigs bones  -- if it  prevents this from going unprevented and move into culture undenounced.

            second one seems like beef bones, they're huge at joints and stuff.
third - I believe skulls can be found/purchased at medical supplies. not 100% certain.

            but yes, great stuff. Her quote about art not being art, when it's not in the "space" (exhibit) I think is very telling.

             Everybody's apathetic until it affects their world, and it's the apathy and ignorance that needs educating.

            I think they are strong images that illicit a strong emotional response. The first one could use a little less words. But it's not a big deal they will get people asking questions. Shock value is important in order to raise a public outcry:  I really like them and I will share too. Thanks for making them I wish I knew how to do that.

             It's not too hard once you spend a little time playing with it.
             <br/>
             .
 you can buy an easy photoshop program,  or get a free one you'll be able to do this.
             <a href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/pixelbasedwin/tp/freephotoedw.htm">

             I use free  paint program, but it doesn't have as many features as other programs. 
Most programs have a bubble that shows up to guide the user.
Your laptop may come with  paint as a freebie.
            </p>
            <p>
             go on a picture and right click, save image to your pictures
Click on your pictures,  right click on a photo, and see if paint comes up.
The right click  tab will say  "open with"   and you can click on paint,  or  your photoshop program which has been installed on your system. 
Once you  open with  paint or whatever photoshop  you have installed,   you can play with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paint is basic and doesn't allow much playroom,  but play with things and then save it by clicking the save button on the top left.
you can resize, by changing the number of pixels.  Once you click save you can't go back and undo something.
Undo by clicking the undo, back arrow.
If you want to type info, click on the  ''select''  icon.  Click on transparent so the letters show up over the poster. (if you don't click on transparent you'll get an opaque background.)
 then click on the   "A"  which gives you print.   now take your cursor and drag it, it makes a square, you can make the square as big as you like.  within that square you can type.   a font screen shows up and you can change the size of print or font.    You can change the color.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the right and bottom of the picture is a little square box.  If you drag your cursor over it, pull it down or to the left, a space will   enlarge for you to type more words.
You can keep it white, or play with the paint can by clicking on a color and painting the space a new color.
Then print the words over top of it. 
Save it to your pictures.
Go to  sli.mg   webpage which is an easy free picture storage,  or imgr or whatever. 
Save your photo, copy and paste the url share link on the slimg or imgr photo and  paste it here for us to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're serious about having fun with photoshop and want a good and easy system I really recommend going to your local store and picking the salesclerk brain as to which program will work best for you.
             <br/>
             My friend takes photos and by using photoshops  turns them into incredible works of art.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good luck.

It can be so relaxing once you get familiar with the photoshop program.

            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring.   Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle)     YWCA  Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ )
            <br/>
            This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">

             I get your point, but I wanted the first to  give a little backup  explanation in case somebody doesn't know who this person  is.
             <br/>
             Cause that's a  barf-up picture if you don't have a little info provided.
            </p>
            <p>
             but look at the   eyes on number 1 photo.
            </p>
            <p>
             That shit should be investigated by a computer forensic.
            </p>
            <p>
             People are visual and need something to  interest them toward checking out the hashtags, and I think these 3 will lead right to podesta spirit cooking with Chef Abramovic  WikiLeaks.
             <br/>
             Which hopefully will lead to voat where they can get more info.

                  I didn't see any reaction to her posting the dog photo. Not a peep. Maybe the remarks were censored or deleted, but there it was.

                   I am simply going by memory but when the spirit cooking went viral a lot of animal rights activists also posted reactions such as don't eat Fido.....I am simply going by memory I don't have a link or anything.

                    Understood. And you may well be right. I didn't see anything, but we're probably following different people so I might not have been had access to it. I'm glad they spoke out, but she lives on people being outraged. Makes her feel all big and strong and more evil.
