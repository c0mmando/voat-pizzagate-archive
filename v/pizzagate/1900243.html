            Interesting tidbit and thank you for posting it although I do want to offer the small correction that technically this is not a "pizzagate" logo per se, it is a general pedophilia logo as per the FBI dossier. It does of course relate to pizzagate, however.

            This may not have shown a statistically reliable  cause and effect wherein molested children become molesters but the anecdotal evidence is enough to warrant serious study as to cause and effect in order to break this vicious cycle. Are there any studies out there?  This really shouldn't surprise anybody as the notion of imprinting is valid in the animal world and there's no reason why it shouldn't apply to us humans. Are there any experts amongst us?  The cycle of sexual abuse calls for stringent intervention during childhood.

             I'm for sure not an expert, but you don't really have to be an expert to know that humans mimic one another. Most of us are familiar with the term "meme" which is phonetically related to "mime". And imprinting is a really good way of putting it, almost like the normal behavioral "photograph" gets replaced with a different image that the subject becomes obsessed over. Sexual pleasure involves powerful neurochemistry that has the power to redirect pathways in the brain. Some molested children do experience pleasure from the molestation event, even as they are disturbed and confused by it. They can't help the natural response of their bodies. This is one of the many reasons why it is always abuse to have sexual contact with a child, even a child that does not appear to be under duress. Sometimes the negative response is delayed or not obvious to another observer, and that child has been changed forever. Sometimes the child will not be able to enjoy healthy sexual relationships or sometimes they will start abusing others. Sick, sad cycle. I can certainly sympathize with a pedophile who was abused and developed pedophilia as a result. I cannot sympathize with their acts of abuse but I can understand how they were corrupted and that they need help. But they are not a "sexual orientation". They are disordered, mentally ill beings. And regardless of this, if they hurt children as adults, they are not excused from legal action. Period.
