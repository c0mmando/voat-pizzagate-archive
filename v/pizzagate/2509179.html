            Here's BBC's version of the Slovakian Rafael crime family, pictured in the Daily Mail article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "A Slovakian gang who made a 'family business' out of trafficking homeless people from central Europe to the UK has been convicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The group, based in Newcastle, bought and sold victims for as little as Â£200, Teesside Crown Court heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            They all faced charges of forced labour, money laundering and conspiracy to traffic with a view to exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seven of them, including a teenager who cannot be named, were convicted. One was cleared of all charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Headed up by Roman Rafael, the group trafficked vulnerable people from Slovakia and the Czech Republic to the UK to work in food packaging factories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Victims were forced to sleep in cellars and crammed into shared rooms, put out to work and received a fraction of the pay they earned as they were not allowed control over their bank accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their lack of English and any documentation, as well as little access to money, effectively trapped them, the court heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Elvidge QC, prosecuting, said: 'The defendants were running a family business and the business was slavery.' "
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "The court heard the victims included a homeless Slovakian father and his son who has learning difficulties.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were brought to the UK 'with the promise of work and good money', Mr Elvidge said.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were confined to a house in Newcastle's West End and told they could go no further than its back yard as there were 'men with machetes' in the streets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The jury were told they were sent to clean houses and pull springs from old mattresses for the scrap metal."
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR
            <strong>
             So this is slavery and human trafficking, but no allegations of sexual trafficking or particularly child sex trafficking with the Rafaels.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            [Unfortunately 'men with machetes' in the streets is somewhat accurate for the modern UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note the suffix 'ova' just denotes a female. Chec appears to be Roman Rafael's partner, based on age and address, so indeed one big family.]

             No, it isn't. I'm from the UK and I've never seen anything like that. Are you American? You may want to try to get a life outside the media, perhaps? Jeez. Most of you guys sound like you're scared sh*tless of even travelling to Europe. It sounds pathetic.

               That area is equivalent to the Bronx or Harlem at their worst. And it STILL could easily be a fabricated story. You guys are just too obsessed with the UK. If you enjoy your lives in the US so much, then I why do you obsess over us so much? You also seek an easy rise out of the misfortune or struggle of strangers in other countries, as if it raises your own social status. It's just weird.

                How would you know so much about me? I'm not concerned about my social status.

                The UK and Sweden are leading examples of what happens when you have massive immigration into a highly PC culture. We don't want that here in the US. You can buy a hand grenade in Sweden for $30.
               </p>
               <p>
                I could understand the logic involved in letting in people from former Commonwealth countries. Why diversity at all costs is now the goal, I can't.

                 The UK is nothing like Sweden. And the Hilary vote showed that most Brits are more freedom-loving than tens of millions of Americans. Swedes actually BUY INTO the social programming. While Brits are sceptical and try to find ways around it. I won't go out of my way to make enemies of any brown person, though.

                 "We don't want that here in the US." That's why so many Americans voted for the Democrats in the last election? And why you had a President with open connections to the Muslim Brotherhood for eight years?
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Why diversity at all costs is now the goal" Because it's American foreign policy for Europe, and you have the USAF stationed in Germany to put down any nationalistic uprisings, like you did in Serbia in the 1990s.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "There's also a lot of acid attacks in the UK now." I can just imagine you sh*tting yourself in your basement right now.

             <p>
              You are the isolated one, here's a report from earlier this month:
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               One machete crime every 90 minutes on Britain's streets as police try to deal with thugs carrying out murders, rapes and burglaries
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              "Figures uncovered using freedom of information requests show that in the last two months of 2017 police dealt with 928 crimes involving machetes. This is an average of 15 a day â or one every 90 minutes.
             </p>
             <p>
              London saw 425 of the attacks, with 99 in Greater Manchester, 77 in the West Midlands and 29 each in Merseyside and West Yorkshire.
             </p>
             <p>
              It represents a dramatic rise from just three years before, when the deadly blades were used in only 100 crimes a month over the same period.
             </p>
             <p>
              The machete was originally intended as a tool used to cut undergrowth or sugar cane in Latin America and Africa.
             </p>
             <p>
              Critics say they have little legitimate use in the UK, but they are not on a list of banned blades such as butterfly or flick-knives.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gangsters are increasingly carrying the fearsome blades as status symbols and to spread fear with gruesome attacks."

             <strong>
              Ex Pro Footballer Lifts Lid on African Child Trafficking and Prostitution
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Al Bangura, 27, who played for Watford, described how he left his home in Sierra Leone at the age of 14 after refusing to become the leader of a secret society previously headed by his late father.
            </p>
            <p>
             Speaking to the BBC, he said:
            </p>
            <p>
             "I said I didn't think this was something I wanted to get involved with. I want to play football and I'm going to school so I don't want to do that."
            </p>
            <p>
             Bangura said that he then traveled to Guinea where he met a French man who promised to help him in his dream to become a professional footballer.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I didn't know he had another different intention â to get me into the sex trade."

            it's no accident.  Britain has a paedo epidemic, from our PM ("losing" tonnes of paedophile ring evidence), to other MP's and politicians and the many sex scandals in parliament, from the judges to the police (all freemasons) to the doctors, adoption workers, school teachers....not to forget the mass amounts of islamic paedophiles running child sex rings, covered up by the paedo police themselves. there are vigilante paedo hunters doing the work of the police.  the police's priorities are arresting people for hate speech (i wish i was exaggerating) Britain is like an orwellian state now, i can't wait to get out of this country.

             No, you don't get it. Our "owners" are extremely devious. Sure, there are obviously some problems with the Islamic population in the UK and inadequate police responses. However, paedophilia is NOT endemic in the UK. This a demoralisation technique which aims to attack things like community cohesion, national pride, even personal morale. It also attacks the trust of women and children in adult men generally. These people want you to be depressed and helpless, above all. But if you think there are child molesters on every street corner in the UK, I'm afraid you've been tricked.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also very much doubt the stories about doctors, teachers and adoption workers. Ask yourself where these stories originated from. The BBC and the police hierarchy/NATO, correct? There we go. There's something sinister going on, but not quite what people think. And it's Anglo-Saxon Protestant values that are under attack, which is why the UK "seems" worse. Because that is one of the main countries that is being targeted.

              Iâm in agreement with you and you make valid points.  Iâm only a Young British woman and the women I know are good - and we would all stand by men as our allies and fight. Not sure what âmistakesâ you mean.  So Iâm sort of on board until your last point. I donât think you should make it a man vs woman issue.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do see where youâre coming from, although with the highest amounts of freemasonry here I do think paedophilia is rampant within the top sectors (much like it is anywhere I guess)
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate has opened my eyes probably more than they shouldâve been opened.  I still think people are inherently good, though.

               I think we should still hold on to the possibility that Pizzagate was a hoax (on some level at least), but of course that doesn't mean these people are not criminals.

               Have you looked into the transvestigation community online? I think the objective of the world elites is a "post-gender, post-human" world. To achieve this they have to pretty much destroy Christianity. That could be a clue as to what is going on.

                listen, no offence but it sounds like you have your own personal issues with women.  not all women are the same, and not all British women are either?  I shouldn't have to feel like defending women to a random stranger on the internet...I'm sorry if you've had your troubles with women.

                you know nothing about my life, or why I want to leave this country.  You don't know about my heritage, where my family live, or anything of the sort.  You don't know my dreams or my long-term goals, which I had even before this whole thing started.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's just kinda rude to assume shit, and then to be "disappointed" over a stranger's actions (I haven't even moved anywhere yet though).  I'm not going to argue with you, but pizzagate isn't a hoax, and I am unsure why you are on this website.

                 I meant it's a disappointing attitude in general. Anyway, I don't have personal issues with women (and I'm not referring specifically to your actions, so don't misunderstand me). I care about my surroundings and my own country, so I dig deep in order to try to figure out how the world turned out the way it did.

                 For me it's just interesting how people assume that leaving the UK will change everything. But obviously, if it's for a career move, or for a higher living standard/lower cost of living etc., than it can make sense from that point of view.

                 I have to say the "Orwellian state" issue seems like mostly a mindframe battle. The UK has common law and very few police, especially armed police. By contrast, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Russia are closer to a full "police state" culture, but the media is less politically correct in those countries.

                  I think the British public need to be better at standing up to things.   We all just sit by idly and complain on social media.  I can agree itâs lazy to just up and leave at the first sign of trouble.  I agree with the rest of your points.
