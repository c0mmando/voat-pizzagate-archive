<p>Childhood Disney actor and star of the 1992 cult classic &quot;The Mighty Ducks,&quot; Brock Pierce, also threw his hat into the ring as an independent candidate – and is continuing to gain steam on the 2020 ballot with a tech-centered platform.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very concerned about our country\'s future, the nation is very divided, and we are doomed if we don\'t do something different. Technology is possibly the most important issue,&quot; Pierce, a 39-year-old father of two, told Fox News. &quot;The U.S. is meant to be the capital of innovation, but we are falling behind. Technology is neither good nor bad, it is a tool, and it depends on how we use it.&quot;</p>
<p>From his lens, the key to progress and the mandate of &quot;life, liberty, and happiness&quot; – as well as keeping in lockstep with rising global superpowers like China – is all in the name of cryptocurrency. Pierce says it would add trillions to the U.S. economy if implemented effectively by the federal government.</p>
<p>The Minnesota-born former screen sensation appeared in commercials as a small child, before scoring a young Gordan Bombay in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; and a bevy of other prominent roles in the likes of the 1996 film &quot;First Kid&quot; – his first foray into Oval Office life – as well as &quot;Little Big League&quot; and &quot;Ripper Man.&quot;</p>
<p>But by the age of 16, Pierce had had his fill of the lights and camera – instead, moving his acting skills into the realm of entrepreneurship, venture capital and tech startups. However, he credits the early fame and fortune to pushing him into greater strides – including a virtually impossible bid for the top job.</p>
<p>Last month, the retired actor recruited two-time Grammy-nominated artist, hip-hop mogul and cryptocurrency impresario Akon as his campaign manager and even received an endorsement from the New York Independence Party, which has some half a million members statewide.</p>

            Ridiculously perfect case of Reality being stranger than Fiction. Most of us here know about Brock Pierce's involvement with pedo Bryan Singer's DEN enterprise. And all I remember about about rapper Akon is his scandal after he pretty much sexually assaulted a young girl onstage on camera at one of his concerts. Sick fucks!
