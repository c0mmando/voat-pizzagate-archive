             <strong>
              Facebook will ask its 2 billion users to rank their trust in news orgs for 'Newsfeed' makeover
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Facebook today announced major changes to their 'newsfeed' which 2 billion people use monthly. Now, Facebook plans to begin asking each user to rank their trust in various news organizations. CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg today said the social media platform will prioritize “trustworthy” news outlets on your Facebook stream, in an effort to counter “sensationalism” and “misinformation.”

            I retweeted. I follow this account (and ALL pizzagate accounts I've come across -- hit me up if you need a follow @ Vindic8tor)
           </p>
           <p>
            One observation on ObamaTruth1, though: his content is not that strong, and that may account for his lack of retweets. It's the information you share, or your pithy summary comment, that gets you retweeted (and followed).
           </p>
           <p>
            We need much, much better infographics and memes for our research. Sharing Voat links is fine if it's four steps down a thread where you've already hooked people in. But they are ugly and totally uninformative. They do not work as standalone tweets. Also, the vast majority of our threads are disorganized because the author never goes back and edits the body of the submission to add links to what was added in comments. The information is jumbled and undigested. Too hard for normies. Also, it's all text (you have to click on images to see them). Also a turn off.

             <strong>
              Facebook &amp; Google Promise Congress They'll Brainwash You With Their Own 'Counter Propaganda' -- Time to Move to STEEMIT
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Tech giants Facebook, Google and Twitter testified to Congress this week about extremist content appearing on their platforms. In an odd admission, the companies promised to suppress extremist ideologies online by distributing their own "counter-propaganda."
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management told Congress on Wednesday that the site plans to take matters into their own hands.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             "We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of violence. That's why we support a variety of counterspeech efforts," Bickert said.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, representatives from Google admitted during the testimony that they use an algorithm to send anti-terror messages to people who they suspect of viewing seditious material. The use of this algorithm is known as the "Redirect Method," and was developed by a team at Google called the Jigsaw research group
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Juniper Downs, YouTube's head of public policy, also said that the company has plans to implement censorship on videos that they deem to be extremist.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             "Our advances in machine learning let us now take down nearly 70% of violent extremism content within 8 hours of upload and nearly half of it in 2 hours," Downs bragged during the testimony.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, Twitter has set up over 100 "training events" all over the world including at elite locations like the White House or United Nations.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Twitter's Carlos Monje Jr., director of public policy and philanthropy in the U.S. and Canada, said the company has participated in more than 100 training events since 2015 on countering extremist content.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             While countering terrorism is certainly a noble cause, as TFTP has reported at length, these tactics are also used to snub out peaceful views that simply challenge the status quo.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             In recent months, social media organizations have come under fire for the negative impact that they have had on human interactions and society at large. These groups have taken the blame for the recent divisions that have been tearing friends and family apart along political lines, and that blame is well placed for the most part.

            How about a hash tag #LOCK THEM UP ALREADY........I don't do twitter, but I am getting so frustrated that only one person is sitting in jail right now, Weiner,.....here we have this memo, they are saying it is a danger to the country, and that it names, names......yet with all the lawyers up there no one is being carted off to jail, then I have heard people say many of the big fish players are being taken to Gitmo, that turns out not to be true....it is turning into a big joke, and once again the corrupt crooks in DC are doing nothing but talk talk,talk, dragging their feet and making excuses.

            <p>
             Twitter sent out an email to users letting them know that the platform is actively working to understand “Russian-linked activities” that took place during the 2016 presidential election.

             The oligarchs are running scared. MEDIA DECEPTION is their main weapon for controlling the masses. Looks like they are doubling down since alt media ate their lunch for the 2016 election.
BTW, Twitter CONFIRMS that Pres. Trump did not collude with Russia BECAUSE HE HAS A VERIFIED TWITTER ACCOUNT!
LOL!

            Pizzagaters should use the FISA memo, as well as all the manufactured drama from D.C. like a backpack or a Trojan Horse. D.C. wants us to focus on their drama. If pizzagate uses the FISA memo situation like a backpack, and stuff the backpack full of pedophilia information, pizzagate can ride the wave. With every Tweet about FISA inject pedophilia into it as well. If we keep doing that we can take advantage of their drama in D.C. Infect their drama with pedo information like a virus.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            They create drama for us to focus on all the time. If we continually piggyback on their fake drama and add pedo information to it we take their drama and infect it with our message. We become their plague.

             Yep. This is exactly what I've been doing all week. "#FISAgate Why won't they #ReleasetheMemo? Gee, I wonder..."  insert Haiti meme.

            <p>
             The biggest problem I am having right now is not enough great Pizzagate memes. We never focused on meme warring much. We need to rectify that.

             I use the techno-savvy college intern that answers the phone for our elected officials to get my message out. I never identify myself (Personal Privacy Policy). I tell my pizzagate related scoop in a very clear and compelling story, with verbally transmitted links. While I rarely have hope that it will impact the elected official, I have had great success influencing someone who can quickly get the compelling message out to their DC connected network. Most are quite interested in what I have to say, and have never heard the information before. I have had some listen to me for 30 minutes at a time. This is because I have researched for years and have committed key information to memory. I also choose a few compelling links to back up what I say. When you speak to a fellow American, with passion in your voice, it can be quite persuasive. I call ALL DC elected officials.

             Yes. My issue is that I am SEVERELY censored on Twitter. I just did a thread documenting it. If you do not follow #Obamatruth1, it is easy. Just go to Twitter, enter that address, and you cannot even find me. The only people who can see me are my followers (in a search). Only a VERY SMALL group of my followers can see my tweets. My tweets cannot be found if you do a public search for them on twitter. Try it:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en">
