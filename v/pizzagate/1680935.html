            Oh yes, before I forget, since Max had died on the couch of a sci-fi author in Poland, here are some links to the pedo problems within the sci fi community.  There is substantial information here.

             That's what everybody thought at first, and what makes the whole thing interesting because then this satanic ritual stuff started coming out.

            This is my first time making a post here.  A while back, before I heard of pizzagate, this story had caught my eye and I saved the things I found as I looked into it.  Putting this here in case it's helpful in some way to pizza gate researchers.   It initially caught my eye because there were a few UFO types who were dying in a short period of time then.   But this one took on the potential of a satanic ritual. Then the revelation that he was going to drop some dirt on that from back in the 1980s.

was a classmate of Orlando Bloom.
Died apparently vomiting up black liquid.
