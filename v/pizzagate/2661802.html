<p>Article on the scene</p>
<p>&quot;Colin Farrell stars as American colonist John Smith in “The New World,” and 14-year-old Q’Orianka Kilcher plays Pocahontas. The flick is said to be slavish to period detail and the love scene between the two was “in good taste,” according to a defender, but when studio lawyers for the film saw an early cut, according to a report, “they nearly had a heart attack.”</p>
<p>“Farrell was told to get romantic and sensual but knew there was a certain amount of kissing involved,” a source told the British mag The People. “He played the scene brilliantly and he really put Q’Orianka at her ease. But when the lawyers saw the finished product with Colin and Q’Orianka rolling around on the ground kissing they just flipped out.” The lawyers were concerned about child-pornography laws, and a tamer version of the scene was reportedly re-shot.&quot;</p>',

            You've also got things like the film "Nymphomania" where the main character (who was played by an adult) lost her virginity at 15 and she was dressed in full-on 'Lolita' mode for that scene in which she also engaged in anal sex. That scene was clearly promotion of pedophilia.
