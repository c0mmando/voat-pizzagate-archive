            I have been listening to people carry on about Hawking as though he were some kind of god.  But he was a simple man--he loved to exploit women along with the best of them.  He went to strip joints and, yes, he went to Epstein's island.  God knows the poor women who had to 'service' the dude.

            My friend did work for Eps, for several years.  Someone ask Dershowitz why Branson had to buy him a car, and why Cronkite (RIP) was a frequent visitor to the island.

            Many will be surprised by this "interest in science" from a US equivalent of Jimmy Savile, running a compromise and control ring. Why target academics? Academics influence public opinion and beliefs, and politically correct lies need protection. To get to the top of academic fields, where public influence is great, it helps to be seen to be "reliable". Who would be more reliable, than someone filmed on Epstein's "Sex Jet", travelling to "Pedophile Island".
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that Epstein has claimed to have been a founding director of the Clinton Foundation, which also appears to run a compromise and control scheme, which appeared at the heart of PizzaGate.

            Epstein compromised a large number of academic scientists. His science funding was for compromise and control. He flew many University academics on his Sex Jet to "Pedophile Island", and spent countless millions funding evolution and neuro science. Here's a Hawkins and academics story with photos :

           </p>
           <p>
            On the funding side, this article gives a taste of it (Many articles have been scrubbed). Tens of millions spent on Evolutionary and Neuro science and buying "scientists":

            There is a list of big names that he took on his sex jet shown in photo copies of his flight log that are no doubt still online, and a list of names in his phone book including billionaires, royalty, politicians and key university academics. Note that Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz were frequent flyers on the "Sex jet". Brilliant article by Nick Bryant:
            <a href="http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971">

           </p>
           <p>
            Alan Dershowitz, who stood to be prosecuted himself for using the Pedophile Jet, was a key defender of Epstein. When Epstein was let off with a slap on the wrist, it looked bad enough to the public, that a new case was taken up against the state on behalf of some of the young women used as slaves in this scandal. That seemed reasonable. But then added to that case was a new claim from "Jane Doe 3" that Alan Dershowitz had sex with her in many places. The court then found that to be "impossible". Was that new claim added so that later publicity dismissing that claim, could "exonerate" Alan Dershowitz in the eyes of the public?

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But why did Epstein fund these "scientists"?
           </p>
           <p>
            In my view Epstein's role was to further compromise paid academic propagandists. Academic scientists are paid to indoctrinate students with known lies, and manage public opinion. Managing such a system of lies can be done with peer pressure and the potential to end careers. But surely someone might grow a conscience, even if only near retirement. So at the highest most influential levels of "science", further compromise is extra insurance. After a filming session on "Pedophile Island", an academic can be trusted and his career in controversial areas can progress.

            Note that our state religion as taught in public schools and university is Evolutionism. To give you an idea of how carefully protected that religion is consider the following two articles just regarding evolution and global warming.

            Is it just science that's complete nonsense? Is it just science that is "compromised", with most papers being fraudulent or mistaken?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well... no. Harvard Business school was exposed in the very good Charles Ferguson documentary "Inside Job". It's brilliantly funny and absolutely nails the leadership of Harvard Business school and the Fed Reserve in very revealing interviews. For example, Harvard indoctrinated generations of students on the great economic benefits of banking de-regulation, while professors sat on the boards of companies set up by the very same Investment banks that stood to gain from shifting public opinion on the issue. That is not unusual. That is how everyday life in academia works. Just search for "Inside Job" on Amazon. A superb documentary.

            How much do academics lie? Surely they wouldn't lie about anything life threatening, like a drug trial or vaccination...
British Medical Journal: "Most scientific studies are wrong" - Published by "amateurs" to advance a career, or outright fraudulent. 60% wrong or fraudulent by well known estimates.

            But what about peer review? Surely that must ensure a high standard of honesty and accuracy?
           </p>
           <p>
            When a computer program was put online generating scientific papers using buzz words and phrases, at least 120 fake papers were published in peer reviewed journals, some very prestigious publications. How did so many bogus papers get published in prestigious peer reviewed Journals? Peer Review is merely to ensure political correctness. Its not for scientific accuracy. Had any of those papers been published with a title like "Anthropological Global Warming Questioned", it would not have been published:
            <a href="http://blog.scielo.org/en/2014/03/31/in-the-beginning-it-was-just-plagiarism-now-its-computer-generated-fake-papers-as-well/#.WqoWEci-lE4">

           </p>
           <p>
            In context of the massive levels of fraud and propaganda in academia, particularly in "science", it is no surprise that top university academics are a target of Epstein's sexual compromise and control scheme. This is what is needed to get to the top in academia today. That is what makes a propagandist, truly reliable.

             And tens of millions to Harvard. At one point he gave them a 16m USD grant to set up a new unit studying evolution. He also spent a lot on neuro science. He bought a lot of influence with academics, and focuses on "education", ie, straight propaganda, from compromised assets. He also claims to be a founding director of the Clinton Foundation.

            Just a thought:  We know, that many celebrities have been there. And Hawking was mingling with celebrities  -  and  he was himself some kind of a "popstar".
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I think he was a pedo? well, we know, everything is possible. But I also admit, it would surprise me.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is now, if really everyone who had been at Orgy-Island also was a pedo or pervert  and took part in the sordid shenanigans   - or if you also could spend a holiday there just enjoying sun and sea?
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe Epstein invited celebs to spend a holiday on his island, and then tried to find out, if these people were also perverts  - and could be blackmailed?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the article there is something about a submarine Epstein payd for. So maybe that's how he groomed him?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to know, if there are people, who have been invited to that island, without being pedophiles  - or even  without even knowing what was going on behind doors on this island?
           </p>
           <p>
            What do you think?

            Think I also read, that Trump had been there at least once.

             Epstein had an altar on the island. It's not just pedophilia you have to worry that happened there. Rituals happen to include kids that aren't raped. Just killed (massive sarcasm alert).

              Yes, I do not doubt that these things happened there.
The Question is just, if everyone, who  had been invited to that island, also took part in these things - or just knew about them.

               I think it's like the testimony of Paul Bonacci and Alisha Owen: Some just went to a party, some were there for the "After Party". The difference is always that "ye shall know them by their fruits": Did Trump go? Yep. Has there been any circumstantial evidence of him benefiting from it or doing something there? Not really.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the other hand, did Stephen Hawking, Chris Tucker, Kevin Spacey, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton go? Yep. Is there any circumstantial evidence of them benefiting from it or doing something there? Hell yeah: Leaked nasty photos (Spacey and the nude butt picture comes to mind), miraculous health improvements (probably due to babies blood transfusions), unrealistic wealth gains (think Clinton Foundation), unrealistic success growth (think Chris Tucker. He's not THAT talented). Yes all this is circumstantial, but all circumstantial claims should be investigated instead of just ignored. We've had enough of that for the last few DECADES.

             I would give anyone who went there only once the benefit of the doubt, although I'm pretty sure everybody knew what Epstein did on this island.
            </p>
            <p>
             But people like Bill Clinton who went there 26 times didn't go there only for a holiday with consenting, adult prostitutes.

              of course, Clinton is out of discussion here. At least 26 trips to Lolita Island... and we know his "appetite"...
              <em>

              But I think we should try to get lists of the people, who ever took a trip on the Lolita express or went there by boat...
             </p>
             <p>
              Who went there and how often? And are these people also already suspicious for being pedos - or definitely not?

               I think these people were listed in some old pizzagate threads about Epstein's Island. At least those who were in the flight logs that were scrutinized during his trial.

            The time frame is during the stem cell hype of the mid 2000s, back when it was claimed that stem cells could cure anything.  There may be a lot more to this then we are aware of.

              He left his wife while in a wheel chair, only able to talk through a computer, and married another woman. His first wife was devastated, and wrote a book about their life together. Its difficult to know what was going on. But yeah, given what we know from PizzaGate (Epstein claims to have helped found the Clinton Foundation), anyone going to that Island was going to be compromised.

               What do you know about black cube? Black cube is the company that weinstein hired to suppress his sexual crimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also note, that Christopher Steele(man behind the fake Russia dossier)  owns a similar company.  There is evidence that FIFA hired steele's company has suppressed sexual misconduct allegations when they were being investigated for fraud and bribery. The FIFA people were bribed with more than just money.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, the piss dossier may have been seeded to steele's company for the purpose of undermining them. Not by a foreign government, but by another private intelligence firm.

             The whole point of Epstein's operation was that the girls were slaves from Eastern Europe, and under age. He had a "modelling agency" that recruited them with over the top promises, then they were trafficked to Tel Aviv and New York. Epstein's "models" were there to compromise. They were useless if not under age.

              Funny story.  Me and a friend of mine attended a talk.  As we were walking out and discussing it, I noticed some people standing to my left and one was in a wheel chair.  I did not think anything of it, but my friend goes "Look!  There's Stephen Hawkins!"  I turned to her to say it is rude to make fun of people, but then I looked and it was Stephen Hawkins.

            Meaning he controls the scientists through blackmail which is likely why Hawing came out against God, an expert scientist declaring why atheism is a superior way of thinking. Leading expert said so so it must be true, right?

             Yes, Stephen Pinker's name is also on the Lolita Express flight logs which was disappointing to see.  I'd bet a lot of money that Bill Nye is involved with these creeps too.  DeGrasse-Tyson is suspicious too because of his willingness to push establishment narratives despite flimsy evidence.

            Don't ask that. Of course it can get weirder. Let just assume every big name you can think of is on it.

             I think its reasonable to assume that Epsteins Island was used as a rich persons playground for which the average visitor had access to adult prostitutes, for which the special 'top-shelf' entertainment and loyalty ritual darker shit may have not always been known/apparent/suspected, and perhaps they didnt even realise that some/many of the adult prostitutes were not in the job 'of their own volition'

              - I think Epstein's playground was for the creme de la creme.  Not the run of the mill billioniaires, but the ones with true power.  That was Wexner's plan.  We need to get more info on Wexner.

              - Unfortunately, this consumed a lot of my thought today.  I know someone to pass away from ALS and it was fast.  I've seen others from afar and it was fast.  There is no other documented case anyone surviving as long as Hawking did with ALS.  Generally 5 years or less.  Done.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about how long HRC, RBG, BJC, CS, NP, DF, GS, etc. have all survived beyond probability.  Imagine if the DS approached Hawking a long time ago and said "hey, we can't make you walk but we can keep you alive.  Just shoot this up and do what we say..."

              This is  troubling, but I think you  are  making a  good  point that  needs  to  be discussed-we are all too  quick to  fall  victim to  our own "conspiracy" mentality  at  times; Hawking wasn't  capable of frolicking with  females,  doubtful  he was  there  for this-I have only  heard the worst  cases at Epstein place, seems reasonable that much  of the  "traffic" going on  here is  on  par with what  you would see at a  casino  in  Vegas

               He re-married while in the wheel chair. People wrote a number of articles about it. His former wife was pretty upset about it. He left her. So while he may not have been able to initiate physical contact in the way people normally do, perhaps other things went on.

                Did you hear of the theory that he actually died in the 80s and was replaced with a lookalike who used Hawking's stellar (pardon the pun) reputation to spout NWO propaganda?

                 I did hear it, and have looked at his work before. Some of it is fascinating. Unfortunately given the source (an apparent collection of writers under the name "Miles Mathis"), and given Hawking married his sweetheart from University days who has written a very interesting book about their life together, I am very skeptical of that claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Note that "Miles Mathis" appeared to have been started as government response to books and articles by author David McGowan. Dave's daughter now runs his site. His last two books were a revelation to me on how deep politics work. His writing style is full of black humour, and just an enjoyable read. This is David McGowan's site :
                 <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/">
                  http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 I definitely recommend his books. Programmed to Kill, about the serial killer phenomenon, but without gore, and done with great black humour, all info taken from public sources like court cases, and laid out so that the reader can see the patterns emerge. His last book was "Weird Scenes inside the Canyon". Which is related to the first, but looks at the Military Intelligence creation of the hippie movement, its music, clothes, drugs and culture. It was the "Weird Scenes" series that appears to have triggered the creation of the "Mathis" site.

                  Good to know, thanks. I'd definitely take the Mathis stuff with a pinch of salt, nothing would surprise me anymore though. I've read some of McGowan's work on whale.to, must check out the website you mentioned - thanks for the link
