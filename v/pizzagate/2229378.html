<p>Texas church killer Devin Kelley was legally permitted to purchase firearms thanks to a glaring mistake by either the Air Force or the FBI during President Barack Obama’s tenure, according to federal officials.</p>
<p>Either the FBI failed to log Kelley’s criminal history into its NCIC database or the Air Force and Pentagon failed to forward the file to the FBI.</p>
<p>Either way, Kelley was apparently allowed to purchase guns “legally” because his criminal history was not warehoused by the FBI NCIC database used by federal firearms dealers for background checks.</p>

            In the big scheme of things the Texas shooting is a blip on the radar. Think bigger. I'm not saying that the following is the end all be all but I can assure you the big players are not focused on that church shooting.

             Oh, well, Karl Rove was nuts. Everybody knows that. Pedosta is nuts and so is Weinstein. Weintein thinks he's come to save the world from laws that govern rape. What a messiah!!!! Hitler was nuts ... so is Killary and that POS she's married to. The problem is that when crazy people get together., they can cause trouble. They have no muzzle on their actions because they're sociopaths. Think of Dahlmer, Manson, Bundy, and whoever else you think fits in this category all getting together and forming a bullying squad. Now picture them having an agenda. That's all the Freemasons or whatever other stupid cabal is. NUTCASES WITH AN AGENDA. So while the rest of us diligently go about our jobs, their jobs were easy because they had that agenda that read: PROMOTE BRETHREN TO AS MANY POSITIONS AS YOU CAN AND LEGISLATE OUR LAWS!!!! Yeah, did you ever notice you can't get any of the members here to do anything because, beyond posting about #pizzagate, WE DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA. We can't come together and decide anything or get anything done! We all go our separate ways doing what we can and we decide is best.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nope, they had an agenda. From the beginning. Would I protect a neighbor that raped a kid? What if he were a friend? HELL, NO!!!! He's going to jail, but they would because ... like I said ... THEY HAVE AN AGENDA!!!! It's been easy for them because we're such happy little goddamn idiots. Throw us a carrot or two. Give us our flat screens and weekends off and we're in hog heaven. Meanwhile, women are raped, children are raped, human trafficking abounds, Soros money is paid to terrorists to destroy the country from underneath us, and you know, the sociopaths did such a good job of brainwashing the masses, that some people think they'd be better off without America!!!! Imagine that!!!! The country that allows them to disrespect EVERYTHING!!!! Yeah, right!!! The country that is probably praying them benefits because their fat asses are so big that they can't even stand up straight without help!!! Yup!!!! They think the disability and welfare checks are just gonna keep coming!!!! Are they in for a surprise, but that fat gluttonous mob of unrepentant slobs was necessary for the cabal of lunatics to keep getting elected to: ADVANCE THE AGENDA!!!! Yup, that's right. No, I'm not buying their reality. They stink on ice. If only 1% of us see that the emperor that drinks blood, gets sells organs, and molests kids is a fucking madman that belongs in jail then so be it. But it's because of that damn agenda.

              I'm curious what the purpose of Soros moving that big wad of money of his is all about, if its true. I have not looked to see which orgs it supposedly shifted to but i'm sure there is a purpose to it. It also comes around the same time that the Saudi piggy bank is getting rattled around. Big money moving round and round and where it stops nobody knows....

             Because it was alleged that this POS was ANTIFA. He fit the profile. Remember that ANTIFA was supposed to start this "war" and the speculation was whether this was part of that war. ANTIFA, as we know, is financed by Soros.

             No, that's exactly what he would do. He had to have bought the gun because it gives an opening for alt-left to scream about tightening gun control laws, and he's allowed to buy the gun because the Air Force never reported that he beat his wife. If the gun appeared by magic, it wouldn't have the same impact.

             Except that 'see screw ups happen so best to ban guns/or need to have stricter vetting, like everyone who buys a gun needs face recognition and gee whiz, guess we need a data base of everyone's face'.  Something, just anything to increase surveillance ya know?

               <p>
                The Air Force tells CBS News Kelley's case was a general court martial, the most serious level of military trial proceedings. It is reserved for more serious criminal allegations, those substantially similar to felonies in civilian jurisdictions.
               </p>
               <p>
                While personnel tried under general court martial can be subject to dishonorable discharge, Kelley received the less severe bad conduct discharge. Federal law prohibits those who have been dishonorably discharged from buying a firearm, but the law does not include a blanket prohibition on those who have received a bad conduct discharge. However, certain types of bad conduct discharges can stem from cases that would bar defendants from purchasing firearms.
               </p>
               <p>
                Texas and federal laws prohibit those with domestic violence convictions from owning firearm. The military is supposed to report to the FBI, for the purposes of prohibiting firearm purchases, convictions on domestic violence charges, as well as convictions that carry maximum potential sentences of more than a year in confinement. It is unclear if the FBI was notified about Kelley's case, which fit both conditions.

               Nothing wrong with that, I'm not religious either.  The reason that Christianity is superior to Judaism and Islam is that Christians are tolerant of people that lack faith as long as we behave.

                 Theologically speaking, Christianity says God is Love and thus will not force anyone to remain in his presence. God is also Life...Being...Goodness...Beauty...Peace...Satisfaction -- so if you choose to leave that presence, by definition, you find yourself "burning" in "Hell." The only folks in Hell are those who choose it.

               That is all information someone else could acquire and post, though. It doesn't necessarily mean it's T.

               I'm going to assume this is an elaborate LARP until I see more... the +++ post was not posted by Q first. Whoever made that image did not take time zones into account, at least that's what I had read yesterday

              In Biblical studies
Q = Quelle
Quelle = hypothetical and undiscovered source material for what is found in gospel of Matthew/Luke only (no John/Mark)
Quelle source is thought to have been a written collection of Jesus' sayings.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is Q speaking on behalf of someone?
Is Q the voice of "Jesus"
Who is "Jesus" if so?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is it significant that Obama mentioned "God"? Who is "God"?
What is +++?
Could +++ = Trinity?
Trinity = Father, Son, holy Spirit
Trinity = God
Father = God
Son = God
Holy Spirit = God
Jesus = Son
Who is "Jesus"/"Son"?
Who is "God"/"Father"?
Godfather?! III = 3 = +++?!
PRAY!?

                Yeah, that is the one I was talking about.  The original post by the anon was altered...don't know if it was altered to correct for time zone difference or as a distraction...going to work now, will look at it again as soon as I get to work, while stealthily looking like I'm doing something relevant to my job.

                    This tweet with +++ may have been before Trump's +++ tweet, but I'm pretty sure the Q anon post with +++ was posted
                    <em>
                     after
                    </em>

              Me too. But in "coding" Y++ is typically short for Y = Y +Y. Where Y is any variable.

               More specifically, X++ means "increment X" or "count up one"
              </p>
              <p>
               This is important for loops that count something, each time around they just write (X++) instead of (X = X + 1)

             This is just unbelievable.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it's not even scare tactics. They're trying to swing votes their way with the election tomorrow. There was a huge outcry over the NYC terrorist attack, and now we have the diversion tactic used that Trump, Christians, and white people are to blame for EVERYTHING!!! Really? Then why the shake up in Saudi Arabia? Why is there a putz dictator running North Korea? Oh, so stupid!!!! Man, am I voting tomorrow!!!!
