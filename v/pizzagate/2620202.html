            We have a 22 year old boy 'heading' an umbrella organisation of more prestigious 'humanitarian' NGOs and digital media administrators being taken down for child porn and this being hailed as some sort of progress.

            Epstein is a Mossad asset and they have hundreds of hours of blackmail videos of major power players in D.C. having sex with young girls and boys on the island. That's why Epstein will never go to prison he's above the law thanks to his friends in Tel Aviv. They are loyal to him they are protecting him and most likely Mossad has video of Trump raping a 13 year old girl at a sex party in New York from the 1990s when Trump and Epstein used to pal around going to parties all over Manhattan. This is why Trump is doing everything he possibly can for Israel they have him blackmailed real good.

             is correct.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know with 100% certainty that Trump is compromised and complicit to extreme levels of criminal corruption, racketeering, treason, sedition, blackmail, bribery, fraud, embezzlement, laundering, drug and human trafficking, abuse of power, and an endless list of other crimes involving some of the most elite politicians and businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump was provided detailed information before he won the primary, and repeatedly since. Every level of law enforcement has also been provided with detailed information. What happened with the investigations? They targeted the victims and witnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is absolutely compromised and is making deals with pedos, criminals and traitors, including child rapists and murderers. He is endorsing 5G artificial intelligence to maintain control of the population and keep the People at odds with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know the Truth. Trump knows the Truth. He is a traitor to America and a FAKE world leader. He has sold out America in exchange for business deals with pedos and criminals while allowing more innocent children and families to have their lives destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one gets into power without being compromised along the way. Trump is not an exception, he is just better at hiding it.

              you cant convict with a corrupt judicial system, as for being around pedos, criminals and traitors, including child rapists and murderers, show me a place with BIG money that those people are not at, doesn't mean all of them have been compromised
             </p>
             <p>
              maybe by endorsing 5G AI, he is trying to protect the people
             </p>
             <p>
              as for more innocent children and families to have their lives destroyed, look at Dem controlled cities, who have had control for decades if not longer, and tell me how those families and children are doing
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no proof of what you say,if there was,Trump wouldn't be where he at
             </p>
             <p>
              am sure he had bad business practices, heard a story from a lawyer who worked with a group who went after him about one of his businesses, you don't get up there on looks alone, we all know this, but all I've heard is talk that isn't really backed up

               Look at all of the downvotes for telling the Truth!
              </p>
              <p>
               Your rationale is that it is all Standard Operating Procedure? Pedo crimes and trafficking are normal. Racketeering is normal. Corruption is normal. There are just a "few bad apples" and no one will stand up to them, so we should just move on?
              </p>
              <p>
               You claim that 5G AI will help "protect the people"? Have you researched anything about 5G or AI?

               You are playing the R v D game they want you to play. You are falling for it all, hook, line and sinker.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are a witness to extreme criminal corruption, murder, trafficking, blackmail, bribery, extortion and a long list of other crimes involving people much more powerful than Donald Trump. He knows about it all, yet remains complicit. What does that tell you about his integrity?
              </p>
              <p>
               If 100 people witnessed a murder in cold blood and all named the same person as the shooter under Oath - would you believe them, or would you require video footage and a sworn confession by the suspect to convict them? Do you think the mafia keeps a paper trail of their hits and money laundering? Do you think human trafficking is fake? Do you think criminal corruption, blackmail, and murder is just how things are?
              </p>
              <p>
               What would Jesus say about Trump, Clinton, Epstein and 5G Artificial Intelligence?
              </p>
              <p>
               We don't have time to wait for everyone to figure out that Trump is a FAKE. Stop believing politicians, criminals and traitors, and start listening to your fellow citizens who have witnessed the Truth.

                Your rationale is that it is all Standard Operating Procedure? Pedo crimes and trafficking are normal. Racketeering is normal. Corruption is normal. There are just a "few bad apples" and no one will stand up to them, so we should just move on?

                 In all of your due diligence, did you dismiss his long-term friendships and relationships with the Clintons, Epstein, the mafia, Kushner, the Rothschilds, the Saudis, and everyone else he regularly deals with? Are you friends with child traffickers, rapists, murderers, and global cartels?

             <p>
              There's no proof (yet, and that I know of) that Clinton or Trump actually went to Epstein's island. Clinton was listed 26 times on flight logs for Epstein's plane, however, which is what you're thinking of. Epstein's brother testified that Trump flew on the Lolita express once, although I don't believe his name has come up on flight logs yet.

               Politico is a propoganda site... the unknown accuser was a woman going by the name of Katie Johnson, which was a fake name.. she was from another country and was not living here at the time of her alleged "assault", she filed a fake claim in a california court about something that supposedly happened in new york.. she refused to put down her name, address, or any other info and when pressed by cops, her story fell apart co.pletely.. she was paid to smear trump during the election and that was it... I looked all of this up a while ago (she even had a friend make up a fake name and pretend to be a "witness")...

                All news is propaganda. Regardless of your opinion of Politico and whether or not Trump raped this specific girl (he's been accused of sexual assault numerous times), I was simply addressing your confusion over whether this particular case involved Clinton, which it didn't.

                 Don't bother apologizing, this troll is trying to erase the endless Trump connections. There are zero politicians that get on the ballot who are not controlled. Stop your Trump trolling, he is a piece of shit like the rest of them. He is one of them and pushing the 5G eugenics program like no other.

                  Trump has never been a politician. If they had dirt on him, either he would never had been elected OR the powers that be wouldn't be in a perpetual state of panic because they would be controlling him.

                   OR they would put him into one of the most powerful jobs in the world and use said dirt to control his every move. Do you seriously think he would've been allowed to be elected if they weren't able to control him? You have too much faith in the voting system.

                     Sounds exactly like Trump &amp; his promises to drain the swamp. Look at all the people who still sing his praises because they believe he's in some kind of battle against the elite, when the reality is that he is an elite himself. He says all of the things people wants to hear, but look deeper and things don't add up.

                  I completely agree with you that Trump is controlled and no different from any other politician. He's money, politics, and Hollywood all rolled into one. Anyone who thinks he's some magical unicorn who surrounded himself by pedophiles, mafias, and the elite but has remained unscathed is fooling themselves.

                   Trump is 100% compromised, complicit and corrupt. Trump is making deals with criminals, pedos, rapists, murderers, traffickers, the mafia, Scientologists, Luciferians, and basically all of the worst people in America and the world while turning his back on the People. We know this to be an Absolute Truth through personal experience, private and public investigations, and corroborated witness testimony.

                  <p>
                   They couldn't have Hillary in office or the people would revolt because her corruption was too overt. Trump is the Trump card making the deals to cover it all up while they implement 5G artificial intelligence with the corrupt tech and business elite. Hillary and other criminal elites remain free and the corruption remains unabated.
