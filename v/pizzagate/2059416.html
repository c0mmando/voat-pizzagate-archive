            I was wondering about Agnew yesterday as a matter of fact. Most people ended up writing her off finally, maybe out of exhaustion. But when it first hit Voat, someone commented and I saved their comment because based on what he said, I knew it would get deleted. Not only was that comment deleted-- the user deleted his Voat account too. Most people didn't see his comments. Here they are (in place of the user name I'm substituting "REDACTED"):

Just checked my jobs systems. (Long Island based company) She's here age and full name match even middle initial. For some reason she's classified as declassified. Also all her docs have been wiped.
I have phone numbers and a new address... debating if i should check up on her and call.

Keep us updated somehow. In what context do you mean her 'docs' have been wiped? Very interesting.

Well I work at a banking institution located on Long Island we must keep all documents saved for legal purposes. When I looked her up I got a different box than usual and the Box said Declassified usually when this box pops up it says citizen or non-citizen so that set me off to dig a little bit more. During my digging I tried to find relevant information and found more weird stuff than good. All her documents (Membership cards, change of address, ID, bank statements, Certificates) all paperwork gone. Two things I did manage to find (though I don't know if they are up to date is a phone number and a p.o. box address) I have a strong feeling it's her because I looked at those Twitter and found her age and did some math. Everything matches Catherine F Agnew. I don't know if I should give her a call.

That is very interesting/odd, which seems to be the only words I can find to describe this whole situation. Have you ever encountered that before, where it says declassified instead of citizen/non-citizen? I don't want to encourage 'doxxing' or whatever, but you're probably the only person, at the moment, that has enough info to be able to possibly speak with her.

I HAVE NEVER seen it say "Declassified" EVER. I have been here for 3 years now and have helped many many people. I also was browing vote pizzagate and saw this:
Full Name: Catherine Agnew Gender: Female Birthdate: 09/06/1966
My system has the SAME birthdate!!! Also she stayed around the Port Jefferson / Ronkonkoma Areas
