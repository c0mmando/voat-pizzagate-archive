<p><strong>The Subud Cult and its Connections to the Arquette Hollywood Acting Family (Hollywood Connections)</strong></p>
<p>I’m sure folks know about the famous Arquette acting family: David, Patricia, Alexis, Rosanna and Richmond Arquette are all pretty well-known Hollywood actors, and all are the children of Hollywood actor Lewis Arquette. The Arquette family literally goes back generations in the Hollywood film industry, the 5 Arquette children’s’ great-grandparents were Vaudeville-era actors. As crazy as it may be to know, apparently the <strong>Arquette family are also deeply connected to Subud</strong>.  In this 1995 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/movies/none-of-that-sultry-innocence-for-a-change.html">New York Times article</a> about Patricia Arquette, (star of movies like “True Romance” and “Beyond Rangoon”), the article states: “<strong>The Arquette children were raised on a “Subud” commune in Virginia</strong>. (Subudism, says Lewis Arquette, is a “nonsectarian fellowship, originating in Indonesia, that fosters meditation.”  
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the NY Times article describes actor Patricia Arquette as “…playing roles that emphasize her amalgam of <strong>sex-kitten</strong> and cracked innocence.” Also, it describes Patricia Arquette going through extremely difficult teenage years: “At age 12, she was arrested for shop-lifting. At 14, <strong>she shaved her head</strong> and ran away to live with Rosanna. At age 19 she became pregnant by a musician.” As I’m sure many are aware on this forum, shaving your head is an act often connected to mind control-related abuse by some researchers, and Britney Spear’s well-known head shaving incident is often attributed to some kind of mind control programming breakdown. To be clear, I don’t know any more about Patricia Arquette’s head shaving incident other than what the article says, but considering her background literally growing up on a Subud-owned property, one has to wonder.</p>
<p>Even more bizarrely, I found this other <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lF0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=patricia+arquette+los+angeles+magazine+mcmartin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3N96pNKxDS&amp;sig=ACfU3U1lVk44hty4rYPqCNqcUq_4ZeBVkA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikmt_ewo7hAhUGON8KHfobDUwQ6AEwCHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=patricia%20arquette%20los%20angeles%20magazine%20mcmartin&amp;f=false">article</a> about Patricia Arquette and her movie career in a 2005 edition of “Los Angeles” magazine, a very mainstream Southern California “lifestyle”-type magazine. The article is basically a “puff piece” about the movies and TV shows Patty Arquette was starring in at the time. However, mid-way through the article, which describes the author’s one-on-one interview with Patricia Arquette, (and you can’t make this up), you find out this horrifying and bizarrely-written information about Patricia Arquette from the author of the piece. To quote directly from the article:</p>
<p>“In person, Arquette is warmer and earthier, more bohemian than ingenue; she has motherly curves and crooked teeth, unpainted nails and a tangle of blond hair. For the occasion, she wore a faded <strong>T-shirt that proclaimed her a graduate of McMartin Preschool</strong>, the Manhattan Beach day care center that during the 1980s was at the center of horrific (and later discredited) tales of ritual abuse. “<strong>If I did go, I guess that would explain my level of damage,” said Arquette […] “It’s a bad and foul joke</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>So what the hell are we supposed to make of this??</strong> If Patricia Arquette is denying she ever went to McMartin preschool as a kid, or if she was giving some kind bizarre “non-denial denial,” so to speak, about McMartin, we can’t be sure. But regardless, for what earthly reason would she wear a t-shirt that says “McMartin Preschool” during an interview for some mainstream magazine, in 2005?? Are we supposed to think it’s some kind of sick joke? The article doesn’t explain Arquette’s bizarre behavior at all, leaving only unanswered questions. Sure enough though, right after the bizarre reference to McMartin in the article, the author goes on to describe Patricia Arquette’s deep personal connection to…. Subud:</p>
<p>“What does explain Arquette is a childhood spent at <strong>Skymont, a Virginia commune that her parents helped settle on the banks of the Shenandoah River</strong>. Her father, Lewis, and her mother Mardiningsih, a poet and therapist, were followers of Subud, a spiritual movement founded by Indonesian prophet Pak Subuh…”</p>
<p>The article completely backs up the NY Times article about the Arquette kids growing up on a Subud property. Investigator Wayne Madsen in his “Manufacturing a President” also describes the <strong>Subud-owned “Skymont” compound in Virginia, which is located in Front Royal, Virginia, interestingly-enough only a little over an hour’s drive from Langley, VA, home of CIA headquarters</strong>. If Patricia Arquette’s father and mother were the ones who actually founded a major Subud compound near DC, presumably they must not just be members, but pretty significant leaders within Subud, whatever that might mean. </p>

            I keep seeing an ad in my Twitter feed for an app called "Head Space" supposedly to teach you transcendental meditation. Gives me the chills every time it pops up. What do you want to bet it's just mind control. Think about it: you download the app and start using it. They can track your progress. They can probably tweak it to feed you hypnotic suggestions while you are trying to blank your mind. Then via GPS on the phone, if they ever want to develop you further as an asset, they can just track you down and randomly "meet" you at your next trip to Starbucks.
           </p>

            Chilling.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if from a spiritual warfare perspective, clicking the "accept" button on their terms of service is tantamount to consenting to demonic possession?
