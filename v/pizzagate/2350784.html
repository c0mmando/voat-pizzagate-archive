            Why would he be pushing something like that?  He would not want to be sharing that he is pushing Satanic Psycho-Babble.  If he was wrapped up in that kind of stuff like Hillary is, then he would want to keep it under wraps as they have for decades. Another attempt by Hillary to Turn The Tables per chance.

            I'm not so sure the Trump administration understood what that magapill site truly contained when they Tweeted it because that site fooled me. When I heard they tweeted it and everybody was going nuts about it I went to the site. I thought "so what is the big deal, it is a list of Trump's accomplishments, with a picture of a white rabbit at the top?"

            People kept talking about it so I went back to the site to see what all the fuss was about. I still didn't get it. Finally I wondered if there was a link in the picture of the white rabbit. I clicked the rabbit and sure enough it was a link with all the child trafficking stuff.

            I seriously question if they understood what was behind the link of the white rabbit pic.

             Are you kidding? It CAME from them. You really ought to give the evidence a serious look, Esoteric. I know you don't like Trump and worry we're all lemmings going over a cliff in tiny MAGA hats, but there have been SO MANY demonstrations this person is part of the Trump inner circle, I just don't see how anyone who rationally weighs them could conclude otherwise.

             Now, it's possible that the Q leaks (white rabbit) is part of a psyop which includes the Podesta and DNC email leaks as well as the 4chan pedo food code post all designed to sabotage the Dems and GOP and bring a new cabal to power. That yet remains to be seen. But I don't think anyone can doubt Q is part of Team Trump.

                CHABAD IS A HERETICAL CULT
               </p>
               <p>
                Chabad Lubavitch is a nasty Jewish supremicist cult that serves the Illuminati. Despite only having 200,000 followers, it has intimate ties to nearly every powerful government leader on earth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Founded in 18th century Russia, Chabad is a branch of Hasidic Judaism, a form of Orthodox Judaism that promotes Jewish mysticism as the path to enlightenment. Chabad Lubavitchers study the Kabbalah, the satanic creed that erases moral absolutes and believes God is 'subjective'.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Chabad's power derives from two services they provide the Illuminati:
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  They work with Israeli intelligence in criminal and intelligence operations.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  They promote a supremacist ideology that encourages Zionists to do  dirty deeds.
                 </p>
                </li>
               </ol>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Chabad believes Jews are God's chosen people and everyone else is trash.  In the book "Gatherings and Conversations" the Great Rebbe tells his followers that Jewish people are an extension of God and Gentiles are destined to serve the Jews.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Two contrary types of soul exist, a non-Jewish soul comes from three satanic spheres, while the Jewish soul stems from holiness."
               </p>
               <p>
                "A Jew was not created as a means for some [other] purpose; he himself is the purpose, since the substance of all [divine] emanations was created only to serve the Jews."

                 <strong>
                  Kushner Foundation Gives $342K to Chabad — Still Surprised About Jared and Ivanka’s Synagogue?
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 It might seem odd for a Modern Orthodox Jewish family to join a Chabad synagogue. But Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are already quite invested in the ultra-Orthodox outreach movement – or to be more precise, their parents are.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A Haaretz examination has revealed that Charles and Seryl Kushner have been major benefactors of Chabad over the years. Between 2003 and 2013, their family foundation donated a total of $342,500 to various institutions and projects associated with the movement, their tax records show.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Chabad has benefited not only from Kushner’s side of the family. It turns out that President-elect Donald Trump has also contributed to the movement – even before his daughter, who converted to Judaism, was married. Altogether, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has donated $11,550 to three Chabad institutions.

                Kushner is a Chabad Kingpin. Chabad is a particularly nasty organization to say the least. Israel is ga ga eyed over Kushner. Kushner let Netanyahoo stay at his house.

               My theory about AWS is he is someone close to either Podesta or Alefantis, perhaps from Georgetown. He's too educated to be one of Brock's H1b visa flying monkeys. And he goes to great lengths to try to debunk the most damning Haiti/Clinton Foundation evidence. It would be interesting to do a deep analysis of his comments. He's definitely not a Voat goat. Only ever posts or comments in

                I agree with you that AWS is a higher caliber and more sophisticated shill. He typically always keeps his cool and sticks to the "debunking" agenda. He's too smooth compared to the other sloppy shills

                Georgetown is Jesuit headquarters in the United States and they have other universities. Meet the Farnese family. Q is famous for saying "expand your thinking." You seem to only have one target named Democrats. You don't mind using that label but you shun all others such as Zionist, Jesuit, etc...you just named the headquarters of the Jesuits when you mentioned Georgetown.

                The Society of Jesus or Jesuits are Roman intelligence serving the Black Nobility. Jesuits use their universities for recruiting Roman-Vatican agents. The link above is an image of the Jesuit's headquarters called the Gesu Church in Rome with the IHS Jesuit logo and Farnesivs engraved above. Farnesivs is for the Farnese family which officially established the Society of Jesus through their Pope Paul III or Alessandro Farnese under the Papal Bull; Regimini Militantis Ecclesiae which means Military Regiment of the Church. The leader of the Jesuits is called a Superior General.

                Today Arturo Sosa is the Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Jesuits are a military order. Queen Elizabeth Farnese of Spain married Philip Bourbon V of Spain and their first son Charles III of Spain reestablished the Farnese line through his first son Ferdinand I of Two Sicilies under the new name of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. Philip Bourbon V's other son Philip, Duke of Parma established the Bourbon-Parma branch as the continuation of the Farnese Dukes of Parma. The Farnese family often intermarried with the Medici, Gonzaga, and Este, families of northern Italy.

                The House of Gonzaga were involved with the Jesuits and have the University of Gonzaga in Spokane, Washington named after the Jesuit priest Aloysius Gonzaga. Prince Maurizio Ferrante Gonzaga is the head of the House of Gonzaga today and an prince-commander of the Jesuits. Today Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is the head of the Farnese bloodline and a top authority over the Society of Jesus. The Bourbon-Two Sicilies family also own and run the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George which is a military council that oversees the Society of Jesus. Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies serves the Sovereign Military Order of Malta as a Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of the SMOM and then runs the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George which manages the Society of Jesus.

                Prince Carlo's cousins Prince Pedro, the Duke of Calabria and Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Parma are other members of the Farnese bloodline. The Farnese family lived in a pentagonal fortress called the Farnese Villa Caprarola in Italy. Jesuit alumni and professors dominate leadership positions in US military and intelligence headquartered at the US Pentagon because the Jesuit Order is militant. Prince Carlos, Duke of Parma is the head of the Bourbon-Parma branch and Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma is a French member of this family and him and some of his children reside in Florida. Georgetown is the Jesuits headquarters in the United States.

                 Jesuits are the premier teaching order of world's largest church. Long before ANY country provided education for it's citizenry, when universities were still primarily training for the priesthood, the Jesuits began creating schools, colleges and universities for regular people. As a missionary order, they frequently created the first system of formal education in New World territories -- including Canada and the United States. Millions upon millions of people have received a Jesuit high school or college education. Most of them aren't even Catholic, let alone "Jesuit". In fact the vast majority of schools in the Jesuit system -- including Fordham -- do not have Jesuit presidents or even more than a small handful of Jesuits teaching. It would not be an exaggeration to say that there is no group more committed to providing quality education to a wide group of people in the world than the Jesuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They virtually created several fields of science, including seismology and linguistics. They are responsible for numerous discoveries in mathematics, astronomy, paleontology, botany and chemistry. They created most of the first dictionaries translating languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese into European tongues, and were among the first Europeans to record the histories of non-European peoples. To cast shade on someone because they availed themselves of this knowledge by attending a Jesuit school is just dumb.

                <p>
                 Please point out one nefarious thing that is part of the required curriculum at these schools?

                  Wrong jocko. I know more about Jesuits than most people in the truth community. I know a lot more than I ever post. I never said every Jesuit was a bad person, but I definitely am saying that where you find the absolute worst depravity you will find some Jesuits and I know it for a fact.

              Not true. I wanted Trump instead of Hillary. Judging by fruits I see the new world order rolling along as usual. I base my judgements on what actually happens instead of what I wish were happening.

              Which is what? I posted a list of news articles recently, you probably saw it. Continued spying on the public, cracking down on marijuana, civil asset forfeiture, record breaking weapons deals, colluding with Israel which is the capitol city of the new world order, and a ton of other stuff. My point is that the Neocons are still Neocons. You seem to be perfectly happy with Zionists in control of humanity which means you either don't understand those people or, or something....

               I meant it when I told you I don't feel I have enough information to judge "Zionists". The anti-Zionist hype is just as bad as the pro-Zionist hype. When I get a bunch of posts citing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as evidence pushing a narrative hard, it only raises my skepticism.

                 Likewise, I remain stunned that your only sources of information are those with an agenda focused on black propaganda. You have given me many links about Zionism and Jesuits, but all of them are from sources with an interest in denigrating an entire group based on at best the actions of a few. Nowhere have I seen you weigh the positive contributions of these groups against the damage they're purported to have done. It's never a fair reckoning. This is precisely why I don't trust the information.

                  I have spent tens of thousands of hours learning what I know. You pretend not to know enough about Zionism to make a judgement about it. As long as you have been doing this, don't know shit about Zionism, don't know shit about Jesuits, pretend that Jerusalem going to Israel is prophecy fulfilled, and your singular target of "its dem democrats", you cannot hold a candle to me.

                  While I am reading things from prominent historians from my 123 gygabyte library you are fucking around with some larper who is spreading disinfo at a rate that is incredible. You have a lot to learn, and I have noticed that your radar is incredibly selective.

                  You also admitted to making a bait thread for me another poster. So your criticism of me is falling on my deaf ears. You have an agenda and its different from my agenda. My agenda is to follow the truth where ever it leads. Your agenda is to ignore and deny any truth you don't like and to go along with manufactured propaganda that is obviously false.
