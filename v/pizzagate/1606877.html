            I'm glad people are asking questions about Turnbull, whose only achievement in his entire career is sabotaging the Australian republican referendum in the '90s so that the British queen remains Australia's head of state. I'm glad Trump didn't invite him to the inauguration.

            Also interesting to note about Kreamer, his Congresswoman wife Jan is described as a "frequent visitor to Haiti".  Hmm...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “The short answer is yes,” said Rep. Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois and a frequent visitor to Haiti. “As challenging as it is, there is no question about it straining our capacities at home. This is a tiny country. It’s close, and it’s not going to be our job alone to rebuild.”

            Creamer was caught on camera in Project Veritas video sting coordinating money exchanges between HRC super PAC and his fake business D. A.  In the videos the parties also agreed to accept foreign money. They then paid and trained protesters to attend DTrump rallies to incite violence. In strutting them about provactive dress language, had fall guys, etc, The worse was Chicago where the paid protesters from Creamer and the DNC along with the Soros paid BLM clashed and riots broke out. They are on film attacking police, each other and serious injuries happened. Additionally Whitehouse records show Creamer personally visited President Obama something 40 times in as all of this was going on an dnpeople were calling Trump supporters names. They are caught on camera admitting to cooperation and personal approval from HRC &amp;'others. Oh and by the way Creamer was in jail in years prior and while there he allegedly was helping write Obamacare.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just one more thing his wife also mentioned by the ex/FBI agent is a Illinois congressman. Find her name.
You think after Creamer and his fake nonprofit were exposed a few months ago including his visits to Obam and approval by HRC (illegal in so many ways) you think he would go hide. Nope no shame Obama had him in the front row of his farewell speech in Chicago.

            I noticed an interesting comment under this video. Mentions Bush.  Also mentions Malcolm Turnbull -Has he been investigated by the Pizzagte crew?
           </p>

            "Alexandria CM1 month ago (edited)
Thank you for your video. Australia has held for the last three years a Royal Commission into Child Sexual abuse of children. It is currently still under way. In the last 2 years it was exposed that through Australia children had been trafficked to the USA for President Bush junior who you mention in the video, who shut down the pedophile investigations. Bush was personally sexually abusing children, he was also doing this on Airforce one on the tarmac. Children where trafficking in wooden crates to the USA to Gov parties to be raped. Children also died. I have the documents filed in the court proceedings naming many US Gov officials, including former Presidents of the USA and former PM's and Government bodies of Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one has been charged, not one. Thousands of victims gave evidence. Documents also filed. Nicole Kidman's father was a medical professional and he was also the head of a sex cult in Australia - held sex parties for the US Gov elite as well. Children also killed.
When all this was exposed with legal documents as well, 3 days later Kidman dies in Hong Kong. Nicole Kidman files law suits to silence the victims. Yet Nicole Kidman was named at the Commission by multiple victims at being present at some of these sex parties witnessing the rape of children when she was a child herself. 
Our people are constantly threatened and abused for exposing the truth.
I have worked on child sexual abuse cases for 20 years and human trafficking for 10. As you said many victims dont come forward, our of fear out of shame, when the victim has done nothing wrong. And there are thousands of cases reported, and zero is done to follow through with cases, and then you have thousands of cases where victims are abused by the police and courts for coming forward. 
All that has happened now is the PM of Australia Malcolm Turnbull also George Soros Puppet and the Shadow Gov of the US foot soldier covered up everything. Yet this is an official Royal Commission, there are official documents. He has gathered up this evidence presented and now used this to black mail the elite and Gov Bodies from Australia and the USA.
           </p>

            "The legal system is infested 
with paedophiles 
and paedophile enablers
''Senator Bill Heffernan 27/2/16.
Turnbull Gov in Australia are threatening the good people in gov to resign. 
Senator Bill Heffernan resigned May 2016, for taking on George Brandis the ATG 
and exposing a net work of elite pedophiles in the Legal system and Government. 
Senator Heffernan was bullied and threatened by the Turnbull Gov, 
by George Brandis ATG for exposing sex crimes by the 
elite against children. Something the LNP Gov
has always hidden and helped cover-up. Protect their 
secret society of elite child 
sexual abusers, who rape and murder children.
The Government use the Media Oligarchy to destroy
those who expose crimes of the elite, the victims
who come forward, breaking their silence. 
They are the sexual abuse enablers of this world.
           </p>
           <p>
            **Malcolm Turnbull **owns the rights to all pornography in Australia, he and his wife also own a string of brothels, making millions of dollars a month from crime. He is worth over $200 million and his bank account is the Cayman Islands. He is running a world wide crimes syndicate. Up to his neck with the Clinton Foundation, stole from Australia over $460 million and gave to the foundation. 
As a lawyer he represented the elite pedophiles and child pornographers, this is all public record. 
When a female journalist Sally Anne Huckson exposed Malcolm Turnbull and his wife, she ended up dead. Ray Martin from 60 Min's then exposed this carrying on her work. His life's work as a investigative journalist was then destroyed by Malcolm Turnbull.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turnbull changed the media laws in Australia so Rupert Murdoch pedophile can now own 100% of main stream media in Australia, a Shadow Government player. Main stream media controlled by Gov hides the truth from the people, it is up to human rights activists who also have careers in many areas such as forensics, or lawyers, doctors, medical professionals, even former special ops. 
Malcolm Turnbull is now having twitter control what is published with his name in the tweets. They are now blocked.﻿"

              Yes, pornography is copyrighted, when you try to download it from pirate bay, there is an FBI warning that stealing copyrighted material is a federal crime no matter where in the world you are.

               That's not my point.  I think it's ridiculous statement.  It's like saying he owns the copyright on all books in Australia or all music in Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyone with a camera and a lack of shame can make pornography.  Does he go around and buy up all the copyrights?  When some Australian husband and wife decide to put up a website, he buys the copyright?  Media of all sorts including news and political opinion are cheaper to produce and distribute than ever and thus more decentralized than ever.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know nothing about the Australian porn industry, but Google tells me this guy is one the big operators.

            This is somewhat odd,I am also seeing that his son-in-law from first marriage died in a snorkeling accident on vacation in mexico. he was very experienced and bob was the first one to get to him and found him dead. Michael McLaughlin (the son-in-law) was noted as being a documentary film maker in the article i found about his death (2009) but i can find no information about his documentaries. which makes me very interested in what he may have been looking into.
