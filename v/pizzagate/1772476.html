This serves to suggest to the reader that Pizza, which is an anagram for Azz-Pi, was brought to the United States in the 1950\'s purely for the purpose of symbolic worship of sodomy, the central practice of the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, Freemasons, and a very specific order of Jews who worship Satan. They believe that ritual sodomy, especially of children, enlightens and opens the third eye (pineal gland or asshole. not sure). Accompanying this practice is cannibalism, and a host of freak practices that we are only beginning to understand. </p>

<p>I would like to reintroduce you to Granbury Solutions: 
This could give us a list of people, across the country who run Pizza shops, and fuck/sell children on the side. A list of around a couple hundred. I am not starting with the conclusion that Granbury Solutions, specifically their company Thr!ve, create cryptographic solutions for human trafficking. I am starting with the observation that the language on the website does not add up, just as we found in the emails of Johnny Pedoesta. Let me show you:</p>

<p>Here are select quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can even track expected coupons and compare performance with our extensive driver reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One does not need to track expected coupons. Even if they want to keep track of coupons, they are not &quot;expected&quot;. That does not fit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Top notch security and control over drops, runs, and who gets to take what delivery when.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a Pizza company it is not necessary to have security in deciding which employee will drop off pizza(s)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thr!ve Loyalty will send email or text message offers to welcome new customers, reward frequent guests, or poke the lazy ones – all automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One does not need a POS company to notify you to order pizza. This would annoy the fuck out of customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your customer can choose how they prefer to get your content, which you can back up with “surprise and delight” rewards that show up in their online account or when they order at the restaurant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe someone can clarify this one. What are &quot;surprise and delight&quot; rewards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get to know your customers better with Thr!ve Loyalty\'s Social Profiles. When a customer enrolls with their email address, we\'ll scour the internet to find out everything we can about them and supplement their profile with publicly available photos, contact information, and more. From Facebook to Instagram to Twitter, you\'ll find out how many followers they have and what their Klout score is - all valuable information to help you segment and appeal to your customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do not need to stalk your customers. This appears to be measures to conduct a light background check on who is ordering, hoping it is not a cop.
Lastly, and most importantly, none of the apps that they make actually work. It\'s so bad that they aren\'t ripping people off at this point. </p>
<p>When more than 70% of your apps don\'t work (look for yourself on Google play store &quot;Granbury Solutions&quot;, and people are still paying for them, it becomes exceedingly likely that the application is meant to be used in a way that is not seen by the average customer looking for real pizza. Many of the applications WILL NOT SHOW UP unless you search Granbury Solutions, not the name of the Pizza parlor.</p>
<hr />
<p>The symbolism of pizza, and why the occult use it, can be explained to you by our friend 17Stormy17. He will show you how Pizza is tied to ritualistic sodomy, what the symbolism of the Illuminati triangle really depicts. The raping of God for his power, in the eyes of the satanist. It is becoming exceedingly likely that pizza was created and introduced in the 1950\'s into the United States and Canada purely as a symbolic act of worship.</p>
<p>Think about it. pizza was everywhere when we grew up. It was the best meal at lunches. Every single speech and debate tournament I ever went to in high school served pizza. Indeed, pizza was a rave in the United States before it was in Italy: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/tpZQK#selection-1007.0-1007.200">http://archive.is/tpZQK#selection-1007.0-1007.200</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>until the 1940s, pizza would remain little known in Italy beyond Naples’ borders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pizza itself is a symbolic worship of the central Illuminati practice of ritual sodomy. This is why they like 33. It is two butts next to each other. This is what the All Seeing Eye is. It\'s a butthole. This isn\'t really obvious at all. It seems laughable. But as you watch this mans detailed exposé, it will become clear.  
</p>
<p>17Stormy17 is extremely religious. He is a tad &quot;crazy&quot;, but he knows the twisted biblical language of these people. His expose is thorough. </p>
<p>I give you, the best of 17Stormy17: </p>
<p>Pizza and Sodomy in cinema:</p>

<p>His Pyramids videos have a little more symbolism from movies: </p>

<p>Arguably his best work. The symbolism of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;:</p>

<p>This is all symbolic worship to the people who rule this world.</p>
<h2>If any of these videos are deleted, I have downloaded them all. Ask for them if they go away.</h2>
<hr />
<p>Lastly, I would like to show you that my 8ch comments regarding Granbury solutions were shadow-removed. I actually did not realize this myself. I stumbled across it in this post:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateuncensored/1598497">https://voat.co/v/pizzagateuncensored/1598497</a></p>
<p>Let that sink in. I can post chainsawed off heads, talk about how Hitler was right, but I can\'t talk about a POS company for Pizza?</p>
<p>Pizzagate is going to get extreme resistance. It is the evisceration of the secrecy of the Illuminati, Freemasons, and Synagogue of Satan. They\'re not going to go down without a fight. We\'ve literally uncovered the core of their practices. It\'s as sick as we would have guessed, and they unfortunately rule the world.</p>
<p>Don\'t worry. We have these fuckers by the balls. Thousands of us are out there. Knowledge is going to fuck them over.</p>',

           Pizza itself is a symbolic worship of the central Illuminati practice of ritual sodomy. This is why they like 33. It is two butts next to each other. This is what the All Seeing Eye is. It's a butthole. This isn't really obvious at all. It seems laughable. But as you watch this mans detailed exposé, it will become clear.

           17Stormy17 is extremely religious. He is a tad "crazy", but he knows the twisted biblical language of these people. His expose is thorough.

           Lastly, I would like to show you that my 8ch comments regarding Granbury solutions were shadow-removed. I actually did not realize this myself. I stumbled across it in this post:

          <p>
           Let that sink in. I can post chainsawed off heads, talk about how Hitler was right, but I can't talk about a POS company for Pizza?

           Pizzagate is going to get extreme resistance. It is the evisceration of the secrecy of the Illuminati, Freemasons, and Synagogue of Satan. They're not going to go down without a fight. We've literally uncovered the core of their practices. It's as sick as we would have guessed, and they unfortunately rule the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Don't worry. We have these fuckers by the balls. Thousands of us are out there. Knowledge is going to fuck them over.

             Looks like you won't need to delete it. The immediate down votes were enough to suppress organic research. You guys (mods) have a great platform for mitigating any dangerous revelations that might come out of this movement.

              Jeez, man. That's on you, not me. I left it up and even promoted the entertainment value of the links. Most people think mods can't be trusted anyway -- why would what we say cause downvoats?

               No. No. I'm not saying that you caused the downvotes with words. I am saying that you're a bunch of shills who operate a honeypot.

                Well, if I'm getting paid, it's news to me. :-)  If you think this is a honeypot, why post? Makes no sense.

                Honestly, your theory has merit -- in theory. It's just that it's a pretty out-there interpretation of material that is otherwise highly mundane. In a world where the enemies of this investigation are constantly looking for ways to point at us and ridicule us for being conspiratards, don't be surprised at downvoats when you can't provide substantial evidence for substantially "out-there" propositions. Really, that skepticism makes this board the opposite of a honeypot, IMHO.

                   It will be judge on its own merits anyways? Part of the reason people are even here is because they don't buy bullshit from someone because they've been given a label.
