<p>Back in 2014, at a <a href="https://archive.is/q9ELZ">meeting of the Arizona Human Trafficking Council</a>,    (<a href="http://azgovernor.gov/sites/default/files/minutes/estaz/humantraffickingcouncil/2014/htc091014minutes.pdf">original pdf</a>) : a concern was raised about THORN\'s handling of the overlap between child porn and sex trafficking.  This was raised by Mr. Jon Eliason (Deputy Maricopa County Attornery)..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Eliason inquired about the availability of data on child pornography and how it overlaps with sex trafficking. </p>
<p>Ms. Istook replied that Thorn has not seen any data that shows a correlation between perpetrators in those two areas. </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Eliason remarked that several of the technology companies listed on Thorn’s Technology Task Force are hesitant in assisting law enforcement or prosecutors on the issue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Given our recent postings here on voat, that really comes as no surprise</em> (for example, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1698620">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1698620)</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that THORN chose Arizona to start with its roll out of Spotlight, is also not surprising because of the state\'s long tradition with miliatry level technology.  It is home to <strong>Fort Huachuca</strong>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Huachuca">United States Army installation</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fort Huachuca has a rich tradition in Army Signal and is currently home to the Network Enterprise Technology Command whose mission is to plan, engineer, install, integrate, protect, defend and operate Army Cyberspace, enabling Mission Command through all phases of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The technological arm of the military is very important to its 21st century approach to warfare, and some of that history is here in this post on <strong>Michael Aquino</strong> and his involvement with <strong>“Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA)”:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagateTNT/1703915">Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), Technology warfare and a Satanic Connection</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCain\'s support for Fort Huachuca is demonstrated here: <a href="http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=09bf0475-6d16-4325-b952-e891f73b6d00">http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=09bf0475-6d16-4325-b952-e891f73b6d00</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ), Representative Ron Barber (D-AZ), and members of the Arizona congressional delegation today sent a letter to the U.S. Army Environmental Command arguing that cuts to Fort Huachuca’s budget would compromise national security and negatively impact the economy of southern Arizona.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the <a href="http://financialaid.arizona.edu/undergraduate/financial-information-military-members">University of Arizona is also very supportive of Fort Huachuca</a> : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a great deal of financial assistance available to military members and their dependants.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, in October 2016, Politico did a piece on McCain entitled <strong><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/john-mccain-reelection-pork-229824">McCain is making his ability to steer defense business to Arizona a key tenet of his reelection bid.</a></strong></p>
<p>And to bring this back full circle, let\'s not forget that the <strong><a href="https://revengeoftheherd.com/2017/03/02/mccain-institute-caught-stealing-millions-in-child-trafficking-donations/">McCain Institute was caught stealing millions in child trafficking donations</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The McCain Institute claims it exists to fight human trafficking, but despite receiving millions in donations from Saudi Arabia, the Rothschilds, and Bloomberg, it has been revealed that none of the money was spent on fighting human trafficking.</p>

            If you really want to change things, wake up and don't ignore evidence that disagrees with your narrative. Don't be guilty of the same biases as the liberals. We all want Trump to be a hero, but just proceed with caution. The second they rolled out Ashton (who was the boy toy of both Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Puff Daddy) I knew we were likely getting played.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to be wrong about Trump, but well researched submissions like these, are a reminder that we have to be careful. It is common knowledge that McCain is running a Clinton type foundation ie. The McCain institute. And I can't stress enough how absurd the whole Ashton-Thorn child trafficking heroes is. If they were legit, Ashton and his team would be arresting McCain, not working with him!

            This is great work and almost better in your follow up in comments!  It is just stunning how all of these things are tying together with the same bad actors.  Someone mentioned it in another thread...but almost like every conspiracy theory on earth is turning out to be 1.  TRUE and 2.  Shockingly connected...

             Through its Arizona NOW Campaign, the University of Arizona Foundation has raised more than $1 billion toward the $1.5 billion goal. Caris’ gift for the GMT supports all of the campaign’s key initiatives, including academic research, the engagement of students, and expanding the UA’s global impact.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It takes a special person to build a global company and then apply that same scale to his philanthropy,” said James H. Moore, Jr., president and CEO of the University of Arizona Foundation. “Mr. Caris may be supporting the Department of Astronomy at the UA, but his influence on big science, and the exploration of our universe, stretches well beyond our university’s boundaries.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The following organizations and institutions are participating with the UA in the GMT project: Astronomy Australia Ltd., The Australian National University, Carnegie Institution for Science, Harvard University, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, Smithsonian Institution, Texas A&amp;M University, The University of Chicago, The University of Texas at Austin, and Universidade de São Paulo.

            Does anyone know Miss USA's, Tara Elizabeth Conner,story? She became addicted to drugs and Trump helped her get into rehab. I heard her on tv this morning. She says she is an incest survivor at age 3 by her uncle.
