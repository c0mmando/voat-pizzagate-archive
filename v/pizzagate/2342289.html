<p>British actress Joan Collins disagrees with her son’s claims that his late father was a child molester.</p>
<p>Collins’ son, Sacha Newley, recently said his father — Joan’s ex-husband Anthony Newley — was a pedophile.</p>
<p>“My father was drawn to youthfulness, he thought innocence was an aphrodisiac,” the 52-year-old artist told The Sunday Times.</p>
<p>As an example of his father’s alleged proclivities, Sacha referenced one of Anthony’s movies, the 1969 X-rated musical film (Editor’s Note: This link may be NSFW) “Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?,” which starred Anthony as the titular Heironymus Merkin — an internationally known singer who recounts his promiscuous relationships with an adolescent named Mercy Humppe in front of his wife (played by Collins) and his two children (played by Sacha and Tara Newley).</p>

            The actress who is the star of this blind is foreign born and probably permanently A list. She spent enough time in front of our faces that she deserves it. Maybe A- list. Back when she was first starting out many many decades ago, the parts were small, but she had expensive tastes. I don't think that has changed one bit over the years. The main difference is that as she got more famous she could afford the expensive things. She had been in Hollywood for about a year and was making some money but wanted to make more. How to do so? Our actress had been hitting the casting couch but was not always seeing much return from that. She said that when she hit the casting couch she at least made sure she was going to get dinner out of it so she wouldn't starve. Our actress brought over to the States her barely legal sister. It was just going to be a gap type year for the sister. Well, it turns out the sister was being constantly approached by producers and directors and executives at parties. They all assumed she was an actress and were looking to play the same casting couch type game they enjoyed with her actress sister.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our actress sister though had other plans. She started charging the men to have sex with her sister. When her sister tried to complain, the actress sister blackmailed her. No one is quite sure how. More than a couple people said that the sister had a baby in her mid teens and the actress sister threatened to tell all her friends back home in their native country. Anyway, for nine months, the actress sister sold her sister and made tens of thousands of dollars which was a ton of money. Our actress sent every last dime that came and had nothing left to show for selling her sister when her sister went home. Now, the very interesting part of all this is that the sold sister made an entire career based on those nine months and made far far more money than her actress sister because of it.

             She may be having a hard time admitting to herself that she should have refused to let her husband make this movie with her children and also taking part in it.  I don't know how immersed she was by Pedowood.  Did she think this was OK which is really sick, or was she one of those Whimpy Women that let men totally control her and never spoke up.  She now refuses to see what she should have seen then as well.  Really Bad.
