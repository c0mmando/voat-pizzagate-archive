<p>Kamala Harris is right up to her eyeballs in #pizzagate. It was on her watch that Jonah Rief was given to a pedo who abducted him, and on her office the people of California marched, demanding she get him back. She didn\'t. She\'s been mentioned as the presidential candidate in 2020, and she made a video appearance at the BEYOND RESISTANCE Secret-Secret Strategy meeting hosted by Soros and Pelosi (EW!), and Kamelback\'s sister attended Pedosta\'s pizza parties and is even memorialized in that Wikileaks email drop. </p>

<p>There have been a few members questioning and speculatng as to why the Cannibal Elite sometimes sacrifices one of their own. The name Michael Jackson comes up in this regard. If he were part of the cabal, why would they have allowed the child molestation allegations to have been heard? Why the charges since those in positions of power would be able to quash such legal remedies? </p>
<p>This post gives an answer to the above by highlighting a current example. It\'s the sacrificing of Judge Alex Kozinski in the deep ocean of sexual harassment claims. Is he guilty? I\'m sure he is. No doubt in my mind, but the question is why? Why would they do that if he were a member? The answer is simple: Payback and revenge. In Koznski\'s case, the incendiary inciting incident is obvious and transparent. In Jackson\'s case it\'s not, but it\'s there. Basically, it boils down to one thing: DON\'T GET IN THE WAY OF THE CANNIBAL ELITE\'S AGENDA OR YOU\'LL BE CRUSHED. </p>
<p>In this instance, Kozinski was so foolish as to go up against the female Obama. The whore is poised to be the next Presidential candidate and if that isn\'t enough to make you throw up and recoil in horror, maybe this will. I had come across the Kozinski lambasting in my previous post. I followed up on it, and intended to post, but there\'s no time like the present. And let me assure you that Kozinski is a member of the cabal. He\'s a distinguished member of that infamous 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Yes, the same one that ruled against Trump\'s travel ban. CBS invited Kozinski to comment on Trump and he jumped at the opportunity to dispense advice. and Trump? Trump specifically called out Kozinski in his censure of the 9th Court of Appeal judges.

<p>In terms of the Kozinski and Kamala, the incident goes back to her days as AG and the office she presided over manufacturing evidence. Here\'s an article, whose title I love, going into detail about Ms. Harris and touching upon the case: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/kamala-harris-is-either-the-stupidest-or-the-cruelest-senator-in-america/article/2632478">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/kamala-harris-is-either-the-stupidest-or-the-cruelest-senator-in-america/article/2632478</a></p>
<h1>Kamala Harris is either the stupidest or the cruelest senator in America</h1>
<p>Then again, maybe Harris is just a legal monster. Sure, she might not oppose all pardons but as the Golden State\'s top cop, she certainly didn\'t mind breaking protocol to bolster her office\'s conviction record. At least that seems to be the opinion of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Two years ago that court refused to uphold a murder conviction in a case that the attorney general\'s office won previously using false evidence. Judge Alex Kozinski warned Harris to give up on the conviction &quot;obtained by lying prosecutors.&quot; And if she didn\'t, he promised that the court would begin to &quot;name names&quot; and the result would &quot;not be pretty.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody puts baby in a corner, and nobody ... NOBODY ... threatens the whore. She\'s tapped to be the next president. Judge Kozinski, didn\'t you get the memo? He probably did, but his ego got the better of him. He thought he could get away with it because of his rank and position, but JUDGE: YOU ONLY HAD THE RANK AND POSITION BECAUSE OF THE CABAL WHO PUT YOU THERE!!! </p>
<p>But what about this naming of names? I gotta say I was intrigued by that phrase, and as stated above, I followed up on it, and here\'s what I found. </p>

<p>A U.S. Circuit judge named prosecutors in Washington state who he believes violated a defendant’s rights.
• Prosecutors who engage in misconduct rarely face discipline.
• Legal experts call the judge’s actions “bold and significant.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors are the most powerful government agents in the U.S. criminal justice system. And when they get caught cheating, they rarely face public scrutiny. But one judge took a radical step this week by naming several prosecutors he believes may have misbehaved.</p>
<p>In an opinion filed Monday and first reported by the blog The Open File, U.S. Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski identified three people — Zachary Wagnild and Gary Enrsdorff, deputy prosecuting attorneys, and Kelli Williams, a public records officer for the King County prosecuting attorney’s office in Washington state — and accused them of violating the rights of Joshua Frost, a man who was convicted for committing a series of armed robberies over an 11-day stretch in 2003. Kozinski, a leading voice on prosecutorial misconduct, says there is cause to believe that the county prosecuting attorney’s office willfully withheld evidence, allowed a key witness to lie on the stand and supplied Frost with incorrect or misleading information.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to name names — something that almost never happens in situations like this.</p>
<p>“The individuals we have named may wish to furnish a copy of this opinion to the state bar and seek to clear their names by providing an explanation for its consideration,” Kozinski wrote. “This would seem to be the prudent course.”</p>
<p>What makes Kozinski’s actions even more remarkable is that this section of his opinion was not supported by a majority of the court. In a scathing dissent, Judge Richard Tallman accused Kozinski of launching a “groundless, personal attack” against the King County employees that he said amounted to defamation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, groundless, personal attack for a judge doing his job and calling out someone that wasn\'t. And a mere year later? KABOOM! Alex Kozinski is jettisoned out to sea. </p>

             Every once in a while I get plugged in and the response to this POS is unbelievable. It is tantamount to that of The Kenyan in that they're both magic mirrors and when people gaze into them, they see whatever it is they want to. Liken it to an hallucination.

             The anecdote you recited is exactly when we can't identify and exploit her vulnerable spot soon enough. We can't let her get traction. She has to be uncovered in a way that makes her massively unappealing. If it takes dragging her skank sister into it, then so be it. I thought that a simple campaign where people tweet her and ask: "Where is Jonah Rief?" Add the same hash tag. It might make people curious about the story, and the very least it would bring attention to Jonah.

              You are right.  The best way is to Nip It In The Bud.  Get out ahead of the story before as you say, she gains traction.  On a better note, I have a friend that thinks she is toxic.
Also, the other one is not too much of a Bright Bulb, as I have discovered lately.

               It's interesting you said that because that's my contention. The more intellectual you are ... the more susceptible to the propaganda. It seems highly targeted to those who want to be thought of as smart, or who are smart. I'm friends with a couple of highly educated people ... some in psychology .... and, man, they're all over this nonsense. The open borders, defacing statues, the whole Killary mysttique of her being a feminist ... it's frightening so we stay off the subject of politics because we've really gotten into it a few times. I can't stand lies. But I also am just astounded how they even believed the Russian collusion narrative ... I mean, what? WHAT? REALLY? But, yeah, you're spot on. These pedo/satanist are projecting "intellectual" in their approach to shut down critical thinking in that crowd.

                Lap Dogs.  They lap up everything the propagandists dish out.  They suck it up and then spew it out to those of us that they think are beneath them.  I have one in my family and I have to listen to her while she eats the food I just cooked.  Yuck.

                  Yes well I got the last laugh after Thanksgiving.  She went on and on defending Al Franken and taking down the woman by saying she was a Playboy Bunny at one time and worked at a Conservative Station.  Oh Please.  Now he has to leave in disgrace after many accusations.  I did not even call her.  I need not say another word.

                   I had the same kind of argument about PedoWood. I made a general statement about what a bunch of scumbags they are. Said they're the last ones that should be talking about morality since they have none and are nothing more than sexual pervs. Well, this friend defended them and ended with, quote And I just love Kevin Spacey. He's such a great actor and such a gentleman. unquote The very next week is when the first story broke about him!  What timing!
