<p>Excerpts from the article:</p>
<p>“By his own admission, <strong>Stanley S. Rosenfeld</strong>, a Jewish educator who worked primarily in New York City and Rhode Island, <strong>sexually abused “hundreds” of children</strong> — nearly all middle school-aged boys — during his five-decade career. From a beloved summer camp in New Jersey, to elite Orthodox schools in New York, to a small Conservative synagogue in Rhode Island, Rosenfeld assaulted and molested children with near impunity, <strong>charged with a crime exactly once</strong>.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I asked Rosenfeld if he was sorry.</p>
<p>“It’s that feeling, of knowing what you’re doing is wrong, but it gives you pleasure,” he replied.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Rosenfeld <strong>began a habit of inviting middle-school students over to his home for “Shabbatons,” or Friday night sleepovers</strong>, and using the opportunity to grope them as they slept. On at least one occasion, he brought a student to his childhood home in Boro Park. He would continue this predatory practice for over a decade.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Rosenfeld acknowledged that he rationalized his molestation of children over and over to himself — that he “put a shine on it.” <strong>He considered the molestations a kind of transaction.</strong> He served the boys foods they liked at sleepovers. He took them bowling, swimming and to baseball games. He taught them about religious observance and the warmth of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>He also believed that sexual experience was something he offered the boys kindly.</p>
<p><strong>“I was thinking of myself as doing good for them,” he said. “Of giving them a sexual experience from somebody who was not gonna hurt them</strong>, because I was going to leave them as children.”</p>
<p>In exchange, he tried to take control over their bodies. In 2001, his probation officer noted that “power and control over children excites him.”
“I wanted to feel that they were mine, and I could do with them what I wanted, and all I wanted to with them was to touch them.” </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“ <strong>“I can’t imagine that they knew, and continued to employ me, and make all my victims available to me</strong>,” he said. “Of course, my head was always making excuses for what I was doing. Finding positive reasons for it. But I always knew that it was wrong. I always did.” “</p>
<hr />
<p>Why would any parent think it\'s a good idea to send their children to sleepovers with adult men?  The approval signal it sends to their kids is devastating and is no doubt a large part of the reason so many of them stay silent in the face of abuse.  It amounts to child endangerment.</p>',
