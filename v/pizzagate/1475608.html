<p>I\'ve participated in potlucks in the past, and this sounds like people planning a potluck. Some people have speculated that John uses the word pasta in a way that is inconsistent with how it is normally used (i.e. &quot;I\'ll do a pasta&quot;), therefore it is evidence that he is talking about something else. It would be plausible that he is speaking in code if it weren\'t for the fact that he is talking about pasta in a way that is consistent with how it is used in everyday speech. &quot;To do a pasta&quot; could be referring to preparing a pasta, which would make sense given that they are discussing which dishes everyone should prepare for the potluck.</p>
<p>Further problematic is that they discuss other food items that are not on the alleged pedophile code (i.e. pork tenderloin and wine). Technically it is possible that John is talking in code and simply doing this as a way of covering his tracks. If this is the case, then I believe he covered his tracks so well that it is impossible to determine for sure whether or not he was speaking in code. So I do not consider his usage of the word pasta to be credible evidence that he is involved with a pedophile ring.</p>
<p>That being said, I did find it interesting that James Alefantis was at this dinner.</p>
<p>I\'m not necessarily dismissing all of the evidence #pizzagate has turned up, but I do think it\'s important that everyone remain objective on this issue. It is true that pedophilia is a heinous crime, but I think it would be an equally heinous crime to falsely accuse people of pedophilia.</p>',

            Agreed. I can't recall ever hearing someone say "I'll do a pasta," and tbh it sounds a little strange to the ear, but I've ever definitely heard "I'll do a salad" or "I'll do a turnover" or "casserole" or something like that. It might sound strange just because I don't really think of pasta as a dish someone would bring to like a picnic or gathering or something, but maybe I'm just strange.

            Agreed. Wrote this one off while reading through the original Wikileaks emails too.

           <p>
            "I'll do a pasta" makes perfect sense grammatically because he's talking about making a pasta dish but apparently hasn't yet chosen specifically what type of pasta it will be(i.e. spaghetti, lasagna, etc.).
