<h2>Massage Associations Claim Human Trafficking Report is “Off Base”</h2>
<p>November 29, 2017 | Karen Menehan</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A report that details human trafficking within the massage industry is misguided and off base, according to two national massage associations.</strong></p>
<p>However, the director of the organization that charged a task force with creating the report stands by it.</p>
<p>The Human Trafficking Task Force Report, released about a month ago by the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) claims that between 6,500 and 9,000 illicit businesses use massage or another type of bodywork as a front for prostitution in the U.S. and that such businesses create a threat for all massage therapists.</p>
<p>The FSMTB is the membership organization for U.S. state boards of massage therapy. It provides the massage exam, the Massage &amp; Bodywork Licensing Exam (MBLEx) used by states to license massage therapists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) and Associated Bodywork &amp; Massage Professionals (ABMP) released a joint statement, provided to MASSAGE Magazine by AMTA, that critiques the content and purpose of the report and demands that any implied support by either massage association of the report’s findings be removed from it.</p>
<p><strong>Inappropriate Burden?</strong></p>
<p>The human trafficking report notes several areas within FSMTB’s purview that could help fight human trafficking, including: increasing awareness of human trafficking; exploring the concept of one national massage-school accrediting authority; and amending its Model Practice Act to include a representative with a background in human trafficking to member boards. Additional areas are mentioned in the report.</p>
<p>According to the massage associations’ joint statement, there are recommendations made in the report that, if implemented, “would inappropriately burden the practice of massage therapy.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the associations stated that both human trafficking and prostitution operate outside the massage field, not within it. (The full statement is shown below.)~</p>

<h2>Breaking News: FSMTB Releases Report on How Human Trafficking Impacts the Massage Field</h2>
<p>November 8, 2017 | Karen Menehan</p>
<hr />
<p>Humans forcing humans into servitude and slavery is a practice dating back to the earliest records of civilization, but the growth of modern human trafficking—the coordinated, large-scale transportation of people who are forced into servitude, including prostitution—over the past two decades means the problem for the massage field has deepened.</p>
<p>In response to this problem, the Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) has just released the Human Trafficking Task Force Report, which details the connection between human trafficking and massage therapy and provides ideas for combating the scourge of trafficking.</p>

             Often the sex workers are trafficked and sometimes they are also underage. The authorities seem to tolerate or protect this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of prostitution under the aegis of massage, laws are in place in most states that massage therapists must be licensed. Massage parlors, especially Asian Massage Parlors (AMPs) have proliferated in recent years across the US. Authorities claim it's hard to bust this sort of prostitution, but they already have a mechanism they could use.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a 2011 LA Times editorial that describes some particulars for California: 'The [2009] law swept aside local regulation of therapists in favor of uniform state certification, but it allowed cities to demand that massage businesses show their state credentials. Other cities in the region required businesses to do just that, but in Los Angeles, officials merely asked the businesses if they were state certified. Presumably, many that had no state approval said "yes" because they didn't have to show any proof.'
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/24/opinion/la-ed-massage-20110324">
              http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/24/opinion/la-ed-massage-20110324
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             'In other cities, officials are cracking down on the exploitation of women, many of them underage, whose illegal immigrant status makes them virtual slaves in the sex industry. ,,,massage parlors have arguably made northeast Los Angeles the region's prostitution capital.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually there's been a growth in massage parlors and AMPs across the US since this editorial and officials
             <em>
              aren't
             </em>
             cracking down on the trafficking. It seems they are here to stay.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very strange that Massage Magazine, the leading publication for the industry would say no problem exists.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't seem to find it, but there was a discussion here on voat, I think in this subverse, that the strange 'emoji' type symbols used in massage parlor ads on Craigs List and BackPage (these ads now gone) sometimes indicated the prostitutes were underage. They often talked about "young girls" and so on.

             <p>
              According to the U.S. Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons 2014 Report: Country Narratives, human traffickers bring people—including children, adults, women and men—into and through the U.S. for forced labor, including prostitution and domestic servitude. Some people are taken out of the U.S. for such purposes as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Trafficking can occur in both legal and illicit industries or markets, including in brothels, escort services, massage parlors, strip clubs, street prostitution, hotel services, hospitality, sales crews, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial services, construction, health and elder care, and domestic service," the Trafficking in Persons report noted.

              The United States is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children—both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals—subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor, including domestic servitude. Trafficking can occur in both legal and illicit industries or markets, including in brothels, escort services, massage parlors, strip clubs, street prostitution, hotel services, hospitality, sales crews, agriculture, manufacturing, janitorial services, construction, health and elder care, and domestic service.
