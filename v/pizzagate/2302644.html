<p>EXAMPLE #2     <strong><strong>Enumclaw horse sex case</strong></strong>  <strong>Kenneth Pinyan</strong></p>
<p>&quot;a United States Boeing engineer residing in Enumclaw, Washington,[3] died from injuries received during receptive anal sex with a stallion at a farm in an unincorporated area in King County, Washington, near the city of Enumclaw. Pinyan distributed zoophile porn under the alias Mr. Hands.[4][better source needed]</p>
<p>During a July 2005 sex act, videotaped by a friend, Pinyan suffered a perforated colon from receptive anal intercourse with a stallion and later died of his injuries. The story was reported in The Seattle Times and was one of that paper\'s most read stories of 2005.[5] It was informally referred to as the &quot;Enumclaw horse sex case&quot;.[6] Video footage of Pinyan and a horse was later disseminated through the Internet.[7]</p>
<p>Pinyan\'s death rapidly prompted the passing of a bill in Washington prohibiting both sex with animals and the videotaping of the same. Under current Washington law, bestiality is now a Class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison.[8]</p>
<p>A documentary of the life and death of Pinyan, and the life led by those who came to the farm near Enumclaw, debuted at the Sundance Film Festival 2007 under the title Zoo. It was one of 16 winners out of 856 candidates for the festival,[9] and played at numerous regional festivals in the United States thereafter.[10] Following Sundance, it was also selected as one of the top five American films to be presented at the prestigious Directors Fortnight sidebar at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.[11][12]&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kenneth Pinyan had worked for <strong><strong>Boeing for eight years</strong></strong>.[2] He was previously married to a woman and had children with her. He had previously moved from Seattle to Oak Harbor, Washington.[13] Before his death Pinyan was building a new house and a barn, in which he planned to place a horse, on the Key Peninsula Highway in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was about to begin making payments on his 30-year, $144,000 mortgage on it.[2]&quot;</p>
