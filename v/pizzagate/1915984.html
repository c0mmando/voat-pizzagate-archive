            Guccifer 2 is a CIA/Deep State Operative.  Anything they say is meant to deceive.  Kernels of truth wrapped in deflection.

            I also think George Webb is FBIANON and is doing the same thing.

            Thank you for reposting this. I think it's seriously possible that fbianon may have meant these cards when he told us to "follow the cards". The holiday card file,  made allegedly by Seth rich,  names the voters whose votes were switched to Hillary Clinton's name, plus much more incriminating data.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could guccifer2.0 be fbianon? If these are the cards of which he spoke, and they may not be, but if they are, how did he know?? He had to know Seth rich to know he had a file named "Holiday cards" in order to tell us to "follow the cards to bring down the DNC".

            So this puts Guccifer 2 as working with Seth, instead of what George Webb said about the DNC using Guccifer 2 as the leaker at a later date so that they can say it had to do with Russia? If this is true, dear God. This would mean that the DNC has blackmailed TONS of people in government and the police to do what they say. Read this...

             DNC BUSTED!
            </p>
            <p>
             NGP VAN INSIDER DATA LEAKED BY GUCIFER 2.0
            </p>
            <p>
             NGV insider data from within the DNC, contains all the data which proves DNC voter fraud, data the DNC was not legally allowed to have, how it conspired with state officials to steal voter data, sell it to private companies, use it to elect Obama and try to elect Hillary, and more!
            </p>
            <p>
             Complete financial data of the DNC, showing DNC crimes!
            </p>
            <p>
             Data leaked by DNC insider, it was not a Russia hack!
            </p>
            <p>
             BOMBSHELL!
            </p>
            <p>
             NGP van thumb drive proves the DNC leak was a leak and not an external hack!
            </p>
            <p>
             It contains all Panda data from Seth on the DNC, which he released via Guciver 2.0 after he was upset to see the DNC corruption!
            </p>
            <p>
             Seth Rich was a DNC insider who saw Hillary steal the election from Burny Sanders and set-up alternative polling stations in all states, only for Hillary voters, while Republicans voted as separate locations. The DNC set up a program linked to distributed servers, via a proprietary voter system which allowed it to have access to all state voter data, market their campaigns, and use all the resources of the DNC to first elect Obama, and then next, to try to put Hillary into office!
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the biggest event in recent US history and proves that the DNC is a criminal crime syndicate, hacked the elections, manipulated voter data, set up secret systems to work with state politicians to rig the elections and much more!
            </p>
            <p>
             After Seth and Gucifer 2.0 released the NGP VAN insider data, Seth Rich was murdered and Julian Assange mentioned specifically the 27 year old source that leaked the data to Wikileaks, tying Seth Rich into the Wikileaks upload!
            </p>
            <p>
             SVR was monitoring Seth and Alpha Jolla, a Pakistani terrorist brought into the US under Obama by the DNC to work with a criminal car robbery crime cartel, and to be used eventually as an FBI informant to murder Seth Rich, via a DNC pre planned sting operation, with the help of Comey and the DC Police, which were blackmailed by DNC officials to participate. Imrn Awan connected to Podesta, Hlllary, Debbie Wasserman, the DNC, car robbery to fund proceeds to the DNC and connected to the Blackberry take over of all major Senate Intel Comittee members, who have created a climate of fear in Congress, where all House Employees have had their personnal data sent over to the Pakistani crime syndicate private cloud server. All House employees have been compromised and this criminal cartel connected directly to the DNC has been stealing data from Congress for years and putting politicians into power via blackmail, threats and subversion!

              Interesting. Maybe Liberia? Liberia is the country that receives the most financial support from the USA. Without this support, the Liberian people would be dying of hunger. This is also where the Ebola virus killed the most people out of all the african countries affected by this virus.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               When the epidemic occurred, many ordinary
               <strong>
                Liberians were so profoundly estranged from their government
               </strong>
               that they assumed it was lying to them and actively disbelieved the warnings that Nyenswah and others were desperately broadcasting to the nation and the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               “The people from the district came and told us all the signs and symptoms, but we did not believe them,” the village chief—a woman—explained when I asked her why the villagers reacted this way. “
               <strong>
                We were thinking the president”—meaning Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who has held office since 2006—“created it”—meaning Ebola—“to kill people.
               </strong>
               ” “Ebola came and they blamed me,” I was told by the nurse, who briefly fled the village and had only just returned. “
               <strong>
                They thought nurses had been given poison by the president to inject into people so they’d die and the UN would send money. Everyone in all the villages around here was believing that.”
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Early on in the epidemic, versions of the
               <strong>
                rumor that Sirleaf invented the crisis so she could dupe foreign aid donors into sending her money were aired in newspapers, on radio programs
               </strong>
               , and in Liberia’s ubiquitous teashops where men gather in the afternoon to talk about politics.
               <strong>
                Even a Liberian senator claimed that the epidemic was a hoax
               </strong>
               , although he did not seem to hold the more
               <strong>
                extreme belief that President Sirleaf had actually assigned nurses to poison people in order to make the ruse more convincing
               </strong>
               .6
               <strong>
                Ellen Johnson Sirleaf—Nobel Peace Prize winner, Harvard graduate, former Citibank executive and UN diplomat
                <strong>
                 —
                </strong>
                is not someone you’d ordinarily suspect of plotting a dastardly scheme to poison her citizens for money.
               </strong>
               She is a remarkable and, to many, a heroic figure. In 2007, she was awarded a US Presidential Medal of Freedom for helping to end Liberia’s notorious twenty-three-year cycle of civil wars.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fighting had been extreme not only for its brutality but for its bizarre conduct. Until 1980, Liberia’s ruling class had consisted almost entirely of
               <strong>
                Americo-Liberians, descendants of freed American slaves who settled there in the early 1800s
               </strong>
               . They wore three-piece suits and Edwardian dresses and took pride in what they saw as their own higher degree of civilization compared to the natives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Liberia’s lively and vociferous
               <strong>
                press began reporting a series of major corruption scandals.
               </strong>
               Millions of dollars in donor funds intended for health care, agriculture, and other projects had not been accounted for.7 Numerous contracts with foreign gold, diamond, iron, and agriculture companies had been signed without consulting the communities that were to be affected by the projects, and nearly all of these contracts have been found to be so flawed that they violated the country’s own laws.8 Bribes had been paid to legislators to approve offshore oil concessions, including one involving US oil giant Chevron, but President Sirleaf allowed the contract to stand anyway.9
              </p>
              <p>
               Meanwhile, the country’s economic growth has done little to improve the lives of most Liberians,
               <strong>
                over 60 percent of whom still struggle to survive on less than a dollar a day, while battling corruption in their everyday lives
               </strong>
               .
               <em>
                Police routinely steal goods from street vendors and judges take bribes from plaintiffs
               </em>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              So much corruption that the people believe their government is out to kill them. Imagine the deception of these people. At least, they are awake.

               Liberia is possible and so is Gambia. The Fulani people are all over West Africa but there is a concentration in the Fouta Djalon (hence the name) mountainous area of central Guinea and Fouta Toro area of Senegal. Also, if born in the US, Djallo is then a simple transliteration of the name..

            What kind of scams can they run?  Are unions allowed to use the factory or plant as a polling station and submit to the local precinct?  Someone should definitely know more than I.

           <p>
            THIS IS BOMBSHELL INFO! IT IS THE SETH RICH LEAK TO WIKILEAKS THAT GOT HIM KILLED!
           </p>
           <p>
            IT IS THE DNC LEAK THAT HILLARY AND THE DNC SAY WAS CONDUCTED BY RUSSIA!
           </p>
           <p>
            IT WAS CONDUCTED BY GUCIFER 2.0, A DNC INSIDER!
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS PROVES THAT RUSSIA DID NOT HACK THE DNC BUT THAT IT WAS AN INSIDER!
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the data upload that SVR warned the White House about and had its diplomats expelled as a result! In conjunction with this insider leak, Seth Rich or someone mailed all the Hillary e-mails to Wikileaks...must have been another insider!
           </p>
           <p>
            THESE ARE AUTHENTIC VAULT FILES FROM WITHIN THE DNC! THE SYSTEM WAS SO DISTRIBUTED ON SEPARATE SERVERS, THAT NO ONE HACKER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THESE SCATTERED FILES ON SEPARATE SERVERS without leaving a clear fingerprint! So this must have been leaked via a thumb drive! Enter Seth Rich!
           </p>
           <p>
            Enter DNC clean up job operation Seth Rich 1.0!
           </p>
           <p>
            Somehow Seth was connected to Gucifer 2.0! It may be one of the people listed in the list of IT employees at the DNC!
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth was sick and tired of all the DNC corruption and rigging of the elections and how Hillary stole the elections from Burney using this system and scheme set-up by the DNC, so he leaked the entire contents at the time of VAN and the DNC vaults, which expose all the crimes of the DNC!
           </p>
           <p>
            Note - this is only a preliminary assessment, not a statement of final fact. Subject to post evaluation and opinion, which may change...as only a few hours were available since the leak went public... more participants requested to join this challenge and help study the files.
           </p>
           <p>
            Files are excell, word, Power Point, text, images, videos, charts, data, detailed DNC data of operations, insider data on the functioning of the DNC criminal crime syndicate from within, rigging the elections to get a candidate elected, using proprietary systems, profiting from the sale of voter lists and on and on...

              Guccifer 2.0 was created by the DNC and the (((Deep State))) to frame Russians for the DNC "hack", a quick proof of this, is that all his activity stopped right after Hillary lost the election.. therefore.. no need to hire "Guccifer 2.0"
anymore.

              So Seth Rich leaks the files then DNC fabricates Guccifer 2.0 to implicate Russian hacking.  Interesting.  Damage control + drumming up support for aggression against Russia.
