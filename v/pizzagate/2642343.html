<p>Quote from above article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huston Huddleston, the Los Angeles man who years ago announced that he had &quot;saved the bridge&quot; of a discarded Enterprise-D touring set, has now pleaded guilty to one count of possessing child pornography. The other criminal charges pending against him were dismissed during a Wednesday court hearing.
Huddleston was sentenced to time served (63 days in custody, plus 63 days for good behavior), three years probation, and he now has to register as a sex offender beginning in September 2018.
The full docket was provided to Ars by Crystal House, a former volunteer who had worked with Huddleston. She had been <strong>one of a handful of people who reported him to authorities and was ready to testify against him had there been a trial.</strong>
Huddleston was arrested in April 2018, but it was not reported until just last month.</p>

            Dimwit actress Selma Blair is defending the pedo jokester saying he has "evolved"? WTH?? And there's a change.org petition with 80k signatures asking that Disney reinstate him??? I'm sure these are all the same outraged people who hate trump because he said some sexual remarks about adult women! Kids are ok to joke about though in looney libtard land!

            Guys these are only "jokes", nothing offensive happening here.. I can't believe the MSM actually say this.. Oh wait yes, yes I can. I see Ricky Gervais has come out defending these "comedians" wonder if he's afraid of being called out for his "jokes"

             I've mentioned it before and got downvoted for it. Gervais' family have worked in the care industry looking after vulnerable adults. You would think that would make him sympathetic to disabled people.. But Gervais actually takes pleasure in mocking the disabled.

              Yea I made a post not long ago because in his latest show for Netflix he "jokes" about a dead baby and mocks kicking it around on the ground, acts as if he is being aroused by a picture of his co workers 8 yr old daughter and he also mentions his "old" town he lived in was full of pedos but there's only a few left now... Wonder who the few he knows are?

             That is the problem, they are being called "comedians" when they are not.  They are sickos with perverted minds.  None of the stuff they say is funny.  It is Sexually Sadistic.  AND if any of it was in actuality really done, it would be Criminal.  Really, these people should be investigated by the FBI.

              Yea they think because they are "comedians" and their job is to make people laugh that they can just say whatever they want then fall back on the call that "it's only a joke", sooo many "people" out there right now shaking in their boots waiting for their name to be called out! Love it!!

              And here's something else to know about Bob Saget as reported by
              <a href="https://observer.com/2005/05/bob-sagets-full-mouth/">
               Observer.com

              :
             </p>
             <p>
              "In comedy circles, there’s a famous Saget story about the night his first daughter was born. After a very difficult birth, during which Sherri Saget and her baby almost died, a friend showed up to find Mr. Saget looking utterly destroyed, unshaven, unrecognizable, but holding his newborn.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Oh my God, Bob, she’s beautiful,” the friend said.
             </p>
             <p>
              “For a dollar, you can finger her,” Mr. Saget replied.
             </p>

             You're right, it's never ending.  However, more people than ever before have a good idea what is going on.  There are people, myself included who will never, ever accept pedophilia and the evil degenerates (the hundreds of thousands of them), know that.  They will keep pushing and we will push back.

              We need to push harder. Serious Pushback is Needed.  The problem is the Media.  Twitter will throw off people willy nilly.  That I think is the Prime Media for this Pushback.  Hard and Fast Retaliation and Replies to these Perverted Scumbags.
