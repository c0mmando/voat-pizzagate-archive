<blockquote>
<p><strong>In a suit filed Thursday, Teala Davies claims she was introduced to Epstein as a struggling 17-year-old and lured into his orbit with promises of financial support. For more than two years, the suit claims, Epstein assaulted her and trafficked her to his homes in New York, New Mexico, France, and other locations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I was the perfect victim. I was on my own and I needed help. Jeffrey Epstein preyed on me,” Davies told reporters. “I still have flashbacks, it still hurts, and like said, I am still scared. I am healing from this every day.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Representatives of Epstein\'s estate did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Davies’ suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, is one of at least a dozen suits filed against the disgraced millionaire’s estate after his death.</p>
<p>Davies, 34, was one of at least two dozen accusers who appeared in court when Epstein’s case was dismissed this summer. At the time, she made similar allegations of abuse and manipulation starting when she was 17 and added, “all I\'m going to say is, today is a day of power and strength.”</p>
<p>Davies is being represented by Gloria Allred, who is working with several other Epstein accusers.</p>
<p>Allred said Monday that Davies was living on her own and working full-time to support herself when she first encountered Epstein. She said the teenager had already experienced “tremendously challenging circumstances,” including being homeless for a year at age 11. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She is still just beginning to understand the impact of his pattern of manipulating, sexual assault and betrayal of her trust.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the suit, Davies was introduced to Epstein by her sister while the two were living in Los Angeles. Davies worked as a hairdresser at the time.</p>
<p>Her sister, who was already allegedly a victim of Epstein, introduced the businessman as someone who could help Davies with her career aspirations. Epstein convinced her to give up her job and apartment, so that she got totally dependent on him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It was after Davies quit her job and gave up her apartment to move to Spain that Epstein began his predation, the complaint claims. He allegedly began raping and sexually assaulting her and forcing her to massage him regularly—and Davies, with nowhere else to go, felt powerless to resist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After she returned from her semester abroad—still homeless and unemployed—Epstein allegedly continued to assault her, while trafficking her to his homes around the world.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>He also introduced her to his famous friends, including a well-known Hollywood producer. The producer, the complaint claims, “demanded and attempted to engage in abusive sexual behavior.&quot; Davies narrowly escaped.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint does not provide any further clarifying information about the identity of the producer.</p>
<p>(Someone on Twitter posted a pic of Trump\'s Secretary of Finances, Steven Mnuchin (lol), who produced Hollywood movies, and had ties to Epstein\'s fellow sex trafficker, Jean-Luc Brunel. But of course it could also be any other </p>
<p>well-known producer.)</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/1197633322203172865">https://twitter.com/thedailybeast/status/1197633322203172865</a></p>
<p>Teala says Epstein arranged for her to live in an apartment at 301 E. 66th St. in 2004 — just blocks from his Manhattan mansion. (This would be the house of ´Epstein\'s brother Mark Epstein, where many victims stayed.)</p>
<p>Davies says Epstein threw her out after two years since she had developed an eating disorder.</p>
<p>After years of abuse, the woman felt “deep despair and isolation” and developed a “severe eating disorder” which she struggled with for six months before confiding in Epstein, the documents charge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Instead, from the moment Epstein learned of Teala’s self-destructive behavior, he immediately cast her out,” the filing read. “Literally within hours of Teala anxiously confessing to Epstein that she did not know why, but had a compulsive need to binge and purge, he threw her out.”</p>
<p>“He instructed her to pack up her belongings and arranged for her to be flown to Arizona. But there was nothing left for her in Arizona. She still had no idea what had happened to her and felt it was all her fault.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teala, who currently lives in Arizona, sank into alcoholism after being abruptly cast out following two years of abuse at the hands of Epstein and is still struggling to put her life together nearly two decades later — feeling “constantly overwhelmed” and struggling to sleep, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, a soft-spoken and at times, emotional Teala said she was “a little girl” when Epstein “preyed upon” her.</p>
<p>At the press conference Thursday, Allred provided reporters with a photo purportedly showing Epstein and Davies on a helicopter ride over the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

            Gloria Alfred?? That doesn't feel good. Why is it that the Epstein case is receiving so much main stream and much like Jimmie Saville, the public is lead to believe a couple of sickies acting on their own. This is a NETWORK and yeah, people won't like it but their are much worse offences such as riitual abuse and children as young as infants. I have tried for over 20 years to bring attention to ritual abuse. It is  hard road and yes, you lose everything as a result but it is worth it. I doubt I will ever be exonerated but I did bring attention, (when nobody wanted to believe it) to ritual abuse, SRA. I did it for not just my children but all children around this world. having said all that I still is bewildered why Epstein is in MSM. Once people realize the severity of ritual abuse, that is something I am waiting for

            This is disgusting. And Allred makes me sick. Defending these poor women to make herself look like a caring do gooder. Who the He77 is this pervert producer that was paying Epstein to abuse this poor young girl. Could really be any of them. They are all pedo monsters imo.

             Bingo. That was the first name that popped up. I know you want him outed. We all do. It’s getting close imo. This Epstein stuff could blow it wide open.
