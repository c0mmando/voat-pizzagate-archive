<p>Sophomoric gestures towards explaining the genetics and possible theoretical interests in the condition to unscrupulous organ or blood harvesters have been made as well, none of which resemble anything someone educated in medicine (or any science) would likely write. Now don\'t get all offended if you are one of those who wrote them.</p>
<p>By all means, if you are smart, motivated and have any well grounded hypotheses to present, go ahead and research and write them up just as you would for publication. On the other hand, if you don\'t have a solid education in the subject, or a lot of years and books on hand to teach yourself, you might do better to give it a miss. </p>
<p>Fuel has been added to the eye symbology fire by the music videos of Majestic Ape featuring disturbing montages including eye deformities as well as  pizza, torture, and children  (along with other more tenuously connected and often deliberately fictional or misleading media related to the occult in one way or another). Eyes having figured prominently in symbolism of all sorts throughout history, so it is a fertile area for going off track, and there are many opportunities to take the wrong path, some of which seem fascinating to contributors here.</p>
<p>However, despite the enthusiasm for the occult and desire for great leaps of discovery, no additional cases of coloboma have surfaced in relation to pizzagate, unsurprisingly since its incidence is reported to be 2.4 cases per 100,000 people over a 40 year study period. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126628/">Incidence, Ocular Findings and Systemic Associations of Ocular Coloboma: A Population-Based Study</a></p>
<p>Now please don\'t go off half-cocked and downvote me or &quot;shitpost&quot; because you disagree with that. Read on and reconsider. Perhaps learn.</p>
<p>Many of the social media photos are not of sufficient quality to be determinative, but the ones that are focused and lighted so the eyes are well seen, show no colobomas. </p>
<p>Any eye in which a full circular pupil outline can be seen is negative for iris coloboma. To determine this from a photo it needs to be a good photo. All the pictures that have come up here via Alefantis and Comet associated social media postings have either shown round pupils or been too poor to tell. Some may show iris freckle or nevus, much more common findings. see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK12722/">iris nevus</a> </p>
<p>In nearly every case where an image appears ambiguous, allowing the possibility of an iris defect, other images either proven or purported to be of the same person exist and show normal pupils. </p>
<p>I am not aware of any at all that have clear pictures showing any iris finding of even vague similarity to coloboma, other than a few cases of iris nevus, best exemplified by our evil old MR Soros, seen below:
<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140312121128-george-soros-1024x576.jpg">Soros - from http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/12/news/economy/ukraine-europe-soros/</a></p>
<p>You will note the prominent brown spot on the iris below the pupiil of the right eye. If you have decent vision and a fair or better monitor, you will also no doubt not the visible rim of the round pupil just above the brown nevus. If you cannot see this you DO need a better monitor, or possibly glasses</p>
<p>I have been watching this trend of coloboma-related overreaching since November and commenting about it. Apparently some people just don\'t want to believe what they see, preferring to write and read speculative and sensational blogs and forum comments. </p>
<p>Since the trend has continued, I thought it time to make a separate thread to address the issue.</p>
<p>To go on pushing misunderstood information, demonstrably false information, and premature conclusions out onto the web can only damage and discredit voat as a whole, this sub, and more importantly the pizzagate cause itself.
There is much crookedness and evil attached to the foci of this investigation, please don\'t undermine it by promoting BS.</p>
<p>In a final and related note, there is a parallel in the recent postings on a certain person said to resemble another subject in the McCann e-fits, about whom nothing has been presented (to my knowledge as of today) definitively linking him to pizzagate other than his occupation as a democrat operative, and being photographed in the same room (no, not a &quot;kill room&quot;) as subjects of pizzagate, which is practically guaranteed given his occupation.</p>
<p>Try to stay rational and please keep in mind I am trying to help, and I do know something about eyes, having spent some period of years in related academic research. </p>
<p>Remember, developing interesting or grotesque theories about why bad things are done, does not stop them being done, or catch the people doing them.  
</p>
<p>Despite the common &quot;PC&quot; culture and even hate crime statutes, the law doesn\'t care why someone hurts a child, or an adult, as much as THAT they hurt them.</p>
<p>Connect the dots. Connect the people. Connect the money. Connect the crimes. Otherwise, there are plenty of ways to spend your time besides squinting at crappy pictures and lengthy postings online.</p>

            I think this post should be directed to the mods.  They think they are drs. and dismiss what investigators are posting with regard to Coloboma and ithey mmediately delete them.  Maybe the picture is bad so you cannot tell clearly, but let the people decide in their own minds if they believe they see Coloboma.  Don't play the dictator and dismiss them automatically as their guess is as good as an investigator's guess.  This is the problem out in the US right now.  People hear all this stuff about Pizzagate and believe it is ridiculous so they push it aside and dismiss it completely.  We believe it is true that is why we are here working tirelessly, but what if we were all wrong. What if these people were the mods and deleted our forurrm.  This is the exact same thing happening here.  If the mods don't like what we, the investigators, believe then they delete it and tell you to move on, nothing to see here.  We are investigating here, it should have some thought, people's ideas put out for discussion, instead it is being censored because we do not fall in line with their decision regarding Coloboma.
