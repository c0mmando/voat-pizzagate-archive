Be warned, for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. For me, I was a fan of her work when I was a kid. 1/1/2018 was the day Pizzagate became PERSONAL.</p>

<p>This chapter focuses on some potential other crimes Steven Spielberg may be involved in along with new details regarding the murder itself. Will be heavily deduction based (focus your attention on the deductions if you don’t understand the links’ relevance).</p>

<p><a href="https://amblin.com/meet-the-team/">https://amblin.com/meet-the-team/</a> Board of Directors for Amblin includes Spielberg (look into Starlight Children’s Foundation), Jeff Small, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Chris Floyd, Chris Leotis, Holly Bario, Jeb Brody, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Mark Graziano, Shelly Strong, Marvin J. Levy, and Kristin Stark. </p>
<p>Noting a lot of people connected to Universal and NBC in this group. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2026540/alibaba-forms-strategic-alliance-steven-spielbergs-amblin">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2026540/alibaba-forms-strategic-alliance-steven-spielbergs-amblin</a> Steven Spielberg and Amblin have had ties to Jack Ma (Chinese Communist Party) since at least 2016. Alibaba Pictures Group has a minority stake in Amblin. Alibaba Group BTW is a Chinese Internet Giant. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/Ox3mLP6FqyAZwRMLUIkHMO/Jack-Ma-Steven-Spielberg-strike-deal-to-bring-Hollywood-to.html">https://www.livemint.com/Consumer/Ox3mLP6FqyAZwRMLUIkHMO/Jack-Ma-Steven-Spielberg-strike-deal-to-bring-Hollywood-to.html</a> Here’s the two together. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.arroyomonthly.com/?p=738">https://www.arroyomonthly.com/?p=738</a> Alibaba has ties to NBC Universal, Disney, and Dreamworks via NewTV.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2014/10/03/whos-betting-big-on-chinas-growing-box-office.html">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2014/10/03/whos-betting-big-on-chinas-growing-box-office.html</a> Looks like this infiltration has been going on at least as early as 2014. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1SL22E">https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1SL22E</a> Jack Ma was present with Mark Zuckerberg at the China Development forum in 2016.</p>
<p>What do the above links tell me? Two things. If my deduction is correct, then those involved in Chinese infiltration of the entertainment industry may very well be guilty of TREASON. Second, this explains quite a lot regarding some of the censorship tactics being used against pizzagate researchers. Given how the left is in bed with China, it’s obviously inspired by Chinese censorship methods.</p>
<p>The next few links are relevant to some deductions regarding Judith’s death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.murdermythmystery.com/">https://www.murdermythmystery.com/</a> Episode 121 was about Judith. Contains some digs into Judith’s life. Turns out the child abuse reports were known about as far back as the filming of Jaws the Revenge. Josephz refered to women in general as whores. In addition, Judith’s murder became a justification for increasing funding and staffing to Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>The grave stone was constructed in 2004. Possible date for the mocking pedo butterfly at her grave referenced in earlier threads.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shared.com/judith-barsi-murder/">https://www.shared.com/judith-barsi-murder/</a> Seems the “lash plucking” behaviours started happening shortly after the filming of Jaws the Revenge. I’d say the timing suggests what happened there (sexual abuse) was the root cause. </p>
<p><a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=">https://searchvoat.co/?t=</a>“Child%2BProtective%2BServices”&amp;s=pizzagate&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on Previous Hits for Child Protective Services</p>
<p><a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=">https://searchvoat.co/?t=</a>“CPS”&amp;s=pizzagate&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on Previous hits for CPS</p>
<p>From these links, I can make the following deductions.</p>
<p>First: due to the stories of Josephz’s abuse being known during Jaws the Revenge, Spielberg’s pedo ring had the information they needed to set up their patsy back in 1987.</p>
<p>Second: since whoever tipped off Enty about what happened to Judith likely knew about BOTH incidents, it is possible the source was  Ruth herself or two different people who witnessed the incidents.</p>
<p>Third: given what we know about CPS’s extensive involvement in pizzagate, it’s quite possible that Judith’s murder being used as justification to expand funding for CPS is NOT a coincidence.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>

           This chapter focuses on some potential other crimes Steven Spielberg may be involved in along with new details regarding the murder itself. Will be heavily deduction based (focus your attention on the deductions if you don’t understand the links’ relevance).

           Board of Directors for Amblin includes Spielberg (look into Starlight Children’s Foundation), Jeff Small, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Chris Floyd, Chris Leotis, Holly Bario, Jeb Brody, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Mark Graziano, Shelly Strong, Marvin J. Levy, and Kristin Stark.

           Steven Spielberg and Amblin have had ties to Jack Ma (Chinese Communist Party) since at least 2016. Alibaba Pictures Group has a minority stake in Amblin. Alibaba Group BTW is a Chinese Internet Giant.

           What do the above links tell me? Two things. If my deduction is correct, then those involved in Chinese infiltration of the entertainment industry may very well be guilty of TREASON. Second, this explains quite a lot regarding some of the censorship tactics being used against pizzagate researchers. Given how the left is in bed with China, it’s obviously inspired by Chinese censorship methods.

           Episode 121 was about Judith. Contains some digs into Judith’s life. Turns out the child abuse reports were known about as far back as the filming of Jaws the Revenge. Josephz refered to women in general as whores. In addition, Judith’s murder became a justification for increasing funding and staffing to Child Protective Services.
          </p>
          <p>
           The grave stone was constructed in 2004. Possible date for the mocking pedo butterfly at her grave referenced in earlier threads.

           Seems the “lash plucking” behaviours started happening shortly after the filming of Jaws the Revenge. I’d say the timing suggests what happened there (sexual abuse) was the root cause.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           From these links, I can make the following deductions.
          </p>
          <p>
           First: due to the stories of Josephz’s abuse being known during Jaws the Revenge, Spielberg’s pedo ring had the information they needed to set up their patsy back in 1987.
          </p>
          <p>
           Second: since whoever tipped off Enty about what happened to Judith likely knew about BOTH incidents, it is possible the source was  Ruth herself or two different people who witnessed the incidents.
          </p>
          <p>
           Third: given what we know about CPS’s extensive involvement in pizzagate, it’s quite possible that Judith’s murder being used as justification to expand funding for CPS is NOT a coincidence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Phi Deguere Jr.. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
