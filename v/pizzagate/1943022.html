<p>Man opens sliding shower glass door and there is a kid inside with what looks like blue swim trunks with white waves or similar pattern on and something over his head like a pillowcase, they are shining a high flashlights.

<p>Man opens door real fast and yells, “Alright, Showtime!!!!” and men shine flashlights on him all together making a high beam.</p>
<p>The kid starts screaming when the door slides open and screams louder when he hears the man-hysterical panic screaming.</p>

<p>Man to kid: It’s ok, let me see. Stand up straight, stand up straight. That’s nice, that’s nice. You got a nice body on you.</p>
<p>Kid: moans in fear (an actual fear moan, which is not normal, it is as horrible as it sounds) Then he starts to sob and begins screaming</p>
<p>Man: What are you screaming at? It’s ok.</p>
<p>-There is water on in the shower stall-It’s clear the kid is experiencing like a waterboarding type effect with the water and the pillowcase over his head.</p>
<p>Man: What’s the matter, you never been in a shower before?</p>
<p>Kid: Screaming</p>
<p>Man: Take a shower, it’s ok. You don’t get hurt in the shower.</p>
<p>A lot of mumbling here I can’t make out about the man wanting the child to turn around or wash himself.</p>
<p>I see now all of the men have flashlights I think there are three men, there with 3 flashlights. At this part they start putting the flashlights all over and closing the shower door and hitting the shower door. I think the child has a pillow case or face covered the entire time, as he is in the shower with water running.</p>
<p>Man to kid: What are you screaming about?</p>
<p>Kid: (Says something I just can’t make out, it’s one sentence)</p>
<p>Man: I like this. I like this kid. He’s a real special guy, you know?</p>
<p>Kid: Screaming at the top of his lungs</p>
<p>Man to kid: Hey kid, you gotta relax.</p>
<p>Then man starts to scream at the kid Hey, hey hey hey real fast and louder and gets angrier and then stands up and rushes the boy and the video cuts off.</p>',

            Silva gunner is about liquid Chris and was made within the last couple of years. Silvergunna is 1/2 an ARG. The video is real, the story is fake or a reenactment.
The story begins  when liquid Chris is abducted. He is taken to the desert in the midwest and raped. When he returns, their is a guy by the name of "Solid Chris" who has stolen his identity, and the charcter he created named "Sonichu." Something happened to solid Chris in college or high school maybe dark project, frequencies idk. But they both go on to have multiple personality disorders. Solid Chris even becomes a feminist tranny.
So in that video that was posted on Silvagunners page  I would say Liquid Chris is about 8 -9 years old. See here
            <a href="https://ibb.co/h84M3Q">
             https://ibb.co/h84M3Q
            </a>
            but according to his driver license, which is a faker then fake, he is 35 years old, can you tell?

             https://ibb.co/dn7POQ
            </a>
            and and here is the the kicker for your retarded ass. He was 15 years old when  Caillou came out on tv.... But wait I have more, Solid fat fuck Chris is now fat fuck Rob  PGISizretarded... and he is here everyday. So fuck off with that bullshit research, chop shop shit.

            Thank you for doing this. I didn't watch the last video and I won't watch this. I can't unsee things and I can't handle something like this continuously running thru my head. That poor boy ☹️ I HATE those men!

                 a) why would you tell him earlier to call the fbi when u now say they won't investigate?  b)  have you called the NJ state police since you've scene a video tracing it to there? and c) do you think the vid is fake, and if so, why watch multiple videos on it?

                  Because Psychonaut thought it was real. I know it's a troll but they thought it was real. I simply pointed out if they thought it was real then it wouldn't do much good posting it here as we're not Law Enforcement.

                   i think it may be some type of psy-op which is also worth tracking/following.  it's pretty doubtful it's a bunch of teenagers or even hackers that think the time involved in making the site/videos is worthwhile to troll a bunch of people on voat.  don't you agree that it's pretty unlikely it's simply a troll job?

                    Absolutely. Whoever made these videos need to be put in jail. There's no question. Real or not the people who made the video are fucked in the head.

                   <p>
                    I suspect they're not getting arrested for the same reason no one else is. Trump is giving the FBI all the rope they want to hang themselves with. It's a classic move. Make your opponent think they're on to you.

                     i don't buy into either trump or the (top of) the fbi wanting to do the right thing.  that they do 'psyops' about this stuff is almost scarier/sicker than the actual deeds

            You know psychonaut the FBI and local law enforcement are really the people who you should alert not us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've got a bad back and my car's power steering has a slow leak in it. It would be hard for me to drive down to New Jersey to make a citizens arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now those FBI boys, shit, they have some serious vehicles. And they're often armed to the teeth. They'd get whoever produced these depraved videos locked up in no time.
           </p>
           <p>
            So how about you take a risk for the kids and make the call to the FBI. Do the right thing. Your conscience will feel better.

             Hey bud, go into your bathroom, look into the mirror and repeat: So how about you take a risk for the kids and make the call to the FBI. Do the right thing. Your conscience will feel better. And say that to yourself 10 times and then go do it yourself.

              Me nuts? You're the one who went to the trouble of creating a transcript to that video because you think it's so real but YOU REFUSE TO CALL THE POLICE.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is that? I'm not calling because I think it's a troll. That's a rational response.
             </p>
             <p>
              You NOT calling the police despite the fact you think it's real  means YOU'RE FUCKED IN THE HEAD.
