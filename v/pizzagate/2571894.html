            Reading this story (again) is  like looking into the soul of Sawtoon: there are  no  words  to  describe  the pure  evil; its  obvious GOD as people  envision Him does not  walk upon this earth-no GOD would allow these  things  to  happen  to young  children

             You are right in saying that. Actually, Revelation 12:12 says,* "On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.”*
            </p>
            <p>
             Satan has always roved about the Earth, but now he can no longer travel back to heaven since he was ousted. How do we know this? Job 1:6-11
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              6 Now the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and Satan also entered among them.
7 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.” 8 And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad. 9 At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? 10 Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock has spread out in the land. 11 But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.”
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Then Ephesians 6:11,12:
             <em>
              11 Put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil; 12 because we have a struggle, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also if we compare 1 Pet. 5:8,9:
             <em>
              8 Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. 9 But take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.
             </em>

              Christianity was created  by  Jews, as part  of their PSYOP  against the  planet-sorry to red-pill people, but as in OT many of these "characters" are literary devices to tell their story; most of the 'letters' comprising the early  Christians aren't even known or discussed  by  modern Christians; there is NO historical evidence that there even WAS a Christ-He appears  to  be a character based  on many figures; the Biblical Hebrews were BLACK, the closest tribe/Semites today are the ETHIOPIANS-not a blue-eyed white Jesus-this gives  you a  CLUE how much you  have  been DELUDED  re: true history.
    When I say God does  not  walk among  us what I mean is that we  have all been raised on ridiculous  fairy tales about  God, who He is, what he is like, etc.  Organized  religion stole much of what every  individual already  knew about God, and  used  it as a  tool for CONTROL. NO ONE ON  PLANET  EARTH  ever  needed  religion to  know GOD.
   If God were like we think, He would not allow children to  be tortured-He doesn't walk among us like that. I didn't say He didn't  exist or He  didn't create this world, or that he never visits; some things are not for us to know or  understand  right  now.

               The blue-eyed white Jesus any smart person would know that is not how he looked. Jesus is also not God. The Trinity is a false doctrine. You're so confused because you've listened to Christendom's teaching of God and Jesus. They are two separate people.
The Trinity’s Early Origins:
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bible tells of many gods and goddesses that people worshiped, including Ashtoreth, Milcom (, Chemosh, and Molech. (1 Kings 11:1, 2, 5, 7) Even many people in the ancient nation of Israel once believed that Baal was the true God. So Jehovah’s prophet Elijah presented the challenge: “If Jehovah is the true God, go following him; but if Baal is, go following him.”​—1 Kings 18:21.
              </p>
              <p>
               The worship of pagan gods grouped in threes, or triads, was also common before Jesus was born. “From Egypt came the ideas of a divine trinity,” observed historian Will Durant. In the Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, James Hastings wrote: “In Indian religion, e.g., we meet with the trinitarian group of Brahmā, Siva, and Viṣṇu; and in Egyptian religion with the trinitarian group of Osiris, Isis, and Horus.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Who Is “the Only True God”?
              </p>
              <p>
               JESUS often prayed to God, whom he called Father, and he also taught others to do so. (Matthew 6:9-11; Luke 11:1, 2) In prayer with his apostles​—only hours before his death—​Jesus petitioned: “Father, the hour has come; glorify your son, that your son may glorify you. This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”​—John 17:1, 3.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notice that Jesus prays to One whom he calls “the only true God.” He points to God’s superior position when he continues: “So now you, Father, glorify me alongside yourself with the glory that I had alongside you before the world was.” (John 17:5) Since Jesus prayed to God requesting to be alongside God, how could Jesus at the same time be “the only true God”? Let us examine this matter.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus’ Position in Heaven
              </p>
              <p>
               A few hours after this prayer, Jesus was executed. But he was not dead for long​—only from Friday afternoon till Sunday morning. (Matthew 27:57–28:6) “This Jesus God resurrected,” the apostle Peter reports, “of which fact we are all witnesses.” (Acts 2:31, 32) Could Jesus have resurrected himself? No, according to the Bible, the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) “The only true God,” Jesus’ heavenly Father, resurrected his Son.​—Acts 2:32; 10:40.
              </p>
              <p>
               A short time afterward, Jesus’ disciple Stephen was killed by religious persecutors. As they were about to stone him, Stephen was granted a vision. He stated: “Look! I behold the heavens opened up and the Son of man standing at God’s right hand.” (Acts 7:56) Jesus, “the Son of man,” was thus seen by Stephen in a role supportive to God in heaven​—“at God’s right hand”—​even as he had been ‘alongside God’ before he came to earth.​—John 17:5.
              </p>
              <p>
               Later, after Stephen’s execution, Jesus made a miraculous appearance to Saul, better known by his Roman name, Paul. (Acts 9:3-6) When Paul was in Athens, Greece, he spoke of “the God that made the world and all the things in it.” He said that this God, the “only true God,” will “judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.” (Acts 17:24, 31) Here the apostle Paul described Jesus as “a man”​—yes, lesser than God—​whom God had restored to life in heaven.
              </p>
              <p>
               The apostle John too described Jesus as subordinate to God. John said that he had written his Gospel so that readers might come to believe that “Jesus is the Christ the Son of God”​—not that he was God. (John 20:31) John also received a heavenly vision in which he saw “the Lamb,” who in his Gospel is identified as Jesus. (John 1:29) The Lamb is standing with 144,000 others, who John says “have been bought [or resurrected] from the earth.” John explains that the 144,000 have the Lamb’s “name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”​—Revelation 14:1, 3.
              </p>
              <p>
               Could “the Lamb” be the same as “his Father”? Clearly not. In the Bible they are distinct. They even have different names.
              </p>
              <p>
               Name of the Lamb and of the Father
              </p>
              <p>
               As we have just seen, the name given to God’s Son, the Lamb, is Jesus. (Luke 1:30-32) What about his Father’s name? It appears in the Bible thousands of times. For example, Psalm 83:18 says: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Sadly, God’s name, Jehovah, has been replaced in many Bible translations by the terms “LORD” and “GOD,” often spelled in all capital letters. The capitals are supposed to distinguish Jehovah from others called gods or lords.* Yet, in many Bible translations, the Divine Name has been restored to its rightful place.
              </p>
              <p>
               The English-language American Standard Version (1901) is a notable example of a Bible translation that has restored God’s name, Jehovah, to its rightful place. Its preface observes: “The American Revisers, after a careful consideration, were brought to the unanimous conviction that a Jewish superstition, which regarded the Divine Name as too sacred to be uttered, ought no longer to dominate in the English or any other version of the Old Testament, as it fortunately does not in the numerous versions made by modern missionaries.”*

               The Trinity​—Whose Teaching?
              </p>
              <p>
               What, then, about the teaching that Jehovah and Jesus are, in effect, the same God, as the Trinity doctrine proclaims? In its issue of April-June 1999, The Living Pulpit magazine defined the Trinity this way: “There is one God and Father, one Lord Jesus Christ, and one Holy Spirit, three ‘persons’ . . . who are the same or one in essence . . . ; three persons equally God, possessing the same natural properties, yet really distinct, known by their personal characteristics.”*
              </p>
              <p>
               Where did this complex Trinity teaching originate? The Christian Century, in its May 20-27, 1998, issue, quotes a pastor who acknowledges that the Trinity is “a teaching of the church rather than a teaching of Jesus.” Even though the Trinity is not a teaching of Jesus, is it consistent with what he taught?
              </p>
              <p>
               The Father​—Superior to the Son
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.” Our heavenly Father, whose name is Jehovah, is described in the Bible as being superior to his Son. For example, Jehovah is “from everlasting to everlasting.” But the Bible says that Jesus is “the firstborn of every creature.” That Jehovah is greater than Jesus, Jesus himself taught when he said: “My Father is greater than I.” (Matthew 6:9; Psalm 90:1, 2; Colossians 1:15; John 14:28, King James Version) Yet, the Trinity doctrine holds that the Father and the Son are “equally God.”
              </p>
              <p>
               The Father’s superiority over the Son, as well as the fact that the Father is a separate person, is highlighted also in the prayers of Jesus, such as the one before his execution: “Father, if you wish, remove this cup [that is, an ignominious death] from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.” (Luke 22:42) If God and Jesus are “one in essence,” as the Trinity doctrine says, how could Jesus’ will, or wish, seem different from that of his Father?​—Hebrews 5:7, 8; 9:24.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, if Jehovah and Jesus were the same, how could one of them be aware of things of which the other was not? Jesus, for instance, said regarding the time of the world’s judgment: “Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father.”​—Mark 13:32.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Trinity and the Church
              </p>
              <p>
               The Trinity is not a teaching of Jesus or of the early Christians. As noted previously, it is “a teaching of the church.” In its 1999 issue on the Trinity, The Living Pulpit observed: “Sometimes, it seems that everyone assumes that the doctrine of the trinity is standard Christian theological fare,” but it added that it is not “a biblical idea.”
              </p>
              <p>
               The New Catholic Encyclopedia (1967) discusses the Trinity at length and admits: “The Trinitarian dogma is in the last analysis a late 4th-century invention. . . . The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Martin Werner, as professor at the University of Bern, Switzerland, observed: “Wherever in the New Testament the relationship of Jesus to God, the Father, is brought into consideration, whether with reference to his appearance as a man or to his Messianic status, it is conceived of and represented categorically as subordination.” Clearly, what Jesus and the early Christians believed is far different from the Trinity teaching of churches today. From where, then, did this teaching come?

                The problem with your arguments is they are  based  on theology, doctrines created by "religious"  fanatics,  which is an endless circular  arguement, a train going nowhere. 
Also, most people make the mistake of assuming the Bible is a  history  book-it most  certainly is  NOT-it is a Jewish  Supremacist work, redacted, changed, modified, politicized, written and maintained by Pharisees, scribes, etc. FOR their  schemes &amp; nefarious  purposes. 
      To suggest THESE people could be trusted to be objective and be trusted to keep "God's Word" safe and tidy for the entire  world  is an exercise in MADNESS-this is the  kind of simple you usually find in school age children.
Keep in mind that all people have "GOD" in their heart, and NEVER needed a book from some ELITE coven of HARPY EAGLES  to  know  GOD

                 Except that the bible doesn't preach "all you need is God in your heart." That's where religion falls short because it preaches this. I'm somewhat in agreement. However, the bible is a history book and Jews only see the first five books of it.

                  The  Bible  is NOT a  history book-it is a religious work from a religious extremist Jewish Supremacist tribe including genealogies, doctrine, mythical stories, events-most of the main characters such as Moses and Kind David are mythical, absolutely no historical information that proves they even existed

                   You're a fool if you think there is no historical evidence. There is more historical evidence that Jesus was on Earth than there is of Alexander the great. Go to the MET tour in Manhattan and get back to me. How ignorant can you be to believe your own made up history. Just because there was no cameras or any recording device other than stone tablets, pen and parchment back then doesn't mean it's not recorded history. Actually, study it rather than choose not to believe a recorded history. Much about Egypt is recorded in the Bible, including that Joseph and Mary took Jesus there as an infant. The pyramids are sitting there today and you say there is absolutely no historical information. Again, do the MET tour.

                    There is ABSOLUTE UNEQUIVOCAL FORENSIC EVIDENCE that there were MANY CLONE CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS  that came  out  of  Egypt BC; same symbols, same numbers, a Christ  figure, 12 disciples, rising from the dead after 3 days, blah blah blah...There are a  number  of historical works that have histories about the Christ-but unfortunately those works have been revealed as forgeries, fakes, etc. There is literally ONE very simple unadorned reference to the Christ in one work.
     If you talk about OT works of fiction it is  much more evident, there is  no historical proof for most of the early characters, including Moses (I like the end  of  Exodus, where 'Moses' talks about his  own death, and  how he was the most  humble person in all of the  land...) and David.
The Hebrews were a black (Ethiopian) race, 'pussy hair on their heads,' and were referred to as the "Cut-throats," as they were land  pirates.

             I mean in the link they talk about how some Police was paid money to go and torch a bunch more evidence he had that they were going to use against him. It says in the info much of the evidence that was kept on him was burned in a fire where it was being held. Someone got paid to do that.

               I don't appreciate forcing the poster to jump through hoops to appease Nazi rules and Fascist regulations.
