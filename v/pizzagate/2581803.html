<p>ORTH FULTON COUNTY, Ga. - A sting on the sex-trafficking trade in metro Atlanta netted dozens of arrests and the rescue of dozens of children forced into sexual servitude, the FBI announced this week.</p>
<p>Operation Safe Summer was a collaborative effort between the FBI’s Atlanta field office and 38 law enforcement agencies in six metro counties, assistant Special Agent in Charge Matt Alcoke told Channel 2’s Mike Petchenik.</p>
<p>Hear from him on Channel 2 Action News This Morning.</p>
<p>The sting ended with nearly 160 children rescued, including one as young as 3 years old, and nearly 150 arrests, convictions or sentences, officials said.</p>
<p>Alcoke said the operation was scheduled before the summer months as a way to put a dent in a trade that preys on children at a time when they have more freedom.</p>
<p>In Alpharetta, police told Petchenik they arrested several suspected pimps and prostitutes and rescued one teenager who’d been forced into sexual servitude.</p>
<p>“A lot of people don’t realize these things happen here,” department spokesman Howard Miller told Petchenik.</p>
<p>Miller said detectives scoured the internet for evidence of prostitution and then moved in to make arrests, but he said it’s been getting more difficult.</p>
<p>And this. 3-month old girl??!!

<p>A 3-month-old girl and her 5-year-old sister were rescued in Denver by undercover agents during this month’s FBI-led sting operation against sex traffickers, CNN reported.</p>
<p>In announcing details of Operation Cross Country XI, FBI officials said 82 other juveniles were rescued during a nationwide sweep last week. The FBI said 120 people were arrested.</p>
<p>In the case of the two sisters in Denver, the alleged trafficker was a friend of the children’s family who made a deal to sell them for sex for $600, the FBI said. The friend communicated with an undercover agent. </p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the number of traffickers arrested -- and the number of children recovered -- reinforces why we need to continue to do this important work,&quot; FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statemen</p>',

             Me too. Not enough details and names in this story for me to believe it. This looks like the same blueprint of a rash of "children rescued" stories that came out a few months ago.
