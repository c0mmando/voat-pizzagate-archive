<h2>Another sick and twisted case</h2>
<p>April 2017 DOJ press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to admissions made in connection with the plea agreements, members of the group created false profiles on social networking and video sites popular with children posing as young teenagers to lure children to two websites they controlled. </p>
<p>Parson and Cortez admitted that they showed the children who came to the website <strong>pre-recorded videos of prior minor victims,</strong> often engaging in sexually explicit conduct, <strong>to convince those children that they were chatting live with another minor.</strong></p>
<p>Parson and Cortez further admitted that they used these videos to coerce and entice the children to engage in sexually explicit activity on their own web cameras, which could be <strong>viewed live by multiple adult members</strong> without the victim’s knowledge.  Further, Parson and Cortez admitted that these videos were automatically recorded and made available for <strong>later download.</strong></p>
<p>Parsons and Cortez also admitted that <strong>the websites ranked the efforts of members to successfully lure children to the website and to coerce and entice them to engage in sexually explicit conduct on live web camera.</strong> Law enforcement agencies have disabled both websites.</p>
<p>An estimated <strong>1,500 minors were lured to the websites.</strong>  During the investigation, known as Operation Subterfuge, the FBI identified 357 minor victims in the United States, and Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s (RCMP) National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre identified 43 minor victims in Canada. The FBI’s efforts to identify victims are ongoing.</p>

            Time and time again we are seeing people who are in charge of abused children recovery being actual perpetrators. We need a major rescue effort. These are clues that the FBI must recognize as valid and worthy of investigation. These people are worse than terrorists. While the FBI and other 17 spy agencies run around like the Keystone Kops, children around the world are being destroyed, kidnapped, and killed.

            BTW, Royal Canadian Mounties, I have read on here in a report, have been guilty of abusing the Indigenous Aboriginal Children in Canada.  There are bad guys all over.  The Indigenous are murdered and raped and abused all over the world.  Because they can.

              Yes, and from what I have read more than once, that she and Prince Phillip were in on it.  The articles are on the internet and have been on here.

            This is the kind of stuff that really makes my stomach turn.  What a lineup that must have been at the Police Station.  This is double disgusting because these are all people a child would trust.  Fireman, children's book writer, etc.  Also, do we really believe these guys saying they showed pictures to children of other children having sex in order to convince them to do it?  Hah.  They are trying to say these kids decided to do these things on their own, that they showed them the pics but the children then wanted to do it.  This is what they believe guys, that they did not have to force these children, the children were turned on by the pictures.  Sick.
