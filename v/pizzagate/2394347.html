<blockquote>
<p>Pop royalty Madonna was spotted at the Luz stadium on Tuesday night where she cheered on as she watched Portugal beat Switzerland in their final World Cup qualifier.
The star, who is in the process of moving to Portugal, was seen at the stadium with her son David Banda, who was dressed in a Portugal shirt sporting the name of Cristiano Ronaldo. 
<strong>In related news</strong>, <strong>King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of The Netherlands</strong> arrived in Portugal on Tuesday for a three-day visit that included meetings with government officials and businesses and also cultural visits.</p>
<p>The first day ended with a glamorous banquet put on by the President in the Palace of Ajuda.
On Wednesday Willem and Máxima visited the <strong>Champalimaud Foundation</strong>, lunched with business leaders at the Belém Cultural Centre and visited the National Museum of Ancient Art to inaugurate an exhibition of works by Dutch artists and from royal collections entitled ‘Rembrandt – Missing links’.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, they were received by Portugal’s Prime Minister, António Costa, at his official residence.
The final day of the visit was spent in Alverca, where the king and queen visited aeronautics manufacturer OGMA and the National Fire-fighters School, and the town of Sintra.</p>
<p>It is Maxima’s first time in the country, whereas her husband had previously visited in 2004 while still a Prince to watch a Euro match.</p>
