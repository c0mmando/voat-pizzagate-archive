            I've seen this shit close up.  About 80% of Afgan males are gay IMO.  Most of them don't even know what to do with a woman.  They would come into the forward SF clinics to treat locals not understanding why their wives weren't getting pregnant - it's because they were only screwing their wives anally.

            Man camps tend to have very high rates of STDs requiring MED interference as well.

             I've heard this from reliable people a few times, doctors, ex military Vets who did a few tours. I know it must be true, stupid fucking soddomite terrorist culture, that's not to say all muslims are bad/evil but islam is bad/evil and helps build these terrible cultures, rape, terror  and stupidity.

            Matteen was also rumored to want to run for President of Afghanistan.  Why should we trust this guy, knowing he was constantly cozying up to politicians including HRC?  That's exactly it.  We shouldn't.

             Counting of omer occurs for 49 days until 50 days on Shavuot.  At same time Omar mateen was shooting in pulse night club in Orlando, pulse club in boston was counting to Shavuot:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Mateen is slang for "sexy beast":
             <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mateen">
              https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mateen
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             49 omer are counted to the 50th day of Shavuot.  Omar mateen had 49 victims, aka sacrifices.  I am not saying "Jews did it", just observing synchronicities.

             Long before he became Public Enemy No. 1, Osama bin Laden was waging a different kind of war on Americans and their Western allies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the mid-1990s, while the spotlight shone on cocaine cartels in Latin America, Bin Laden fortified a drug-trafficking network that provided major revenues for Afghanistan's Taliban regime _ and financed his Al-Qaida network of terrorism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bin Laden's commerce in narcotics helped make Afghanistan the world's leading exporter of heroin, some 2,200 pounds of which reached the United States last year, according to the U.S. State Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             Worth at least $260 million in street value, some of the proceeds from the American heroin sales found their way back to Bin Laden, who stands accused by President Bush of orchestrating the Sept. 11 suicide hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
            </p>
            <p>
             "What better way to poison the Western world than through drugs," said Donnie Marshall, who headed the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from July 1999 through June of this year. "It's another weapon in their arsenal."

             Taliban use 'honey trap' boys to kill Afghan police

             The Taliban are using child sex slaves to mount crippling insider attacks on police in southern Afghanistan, exploiting the pervasive practice of "bacha bazi" ─ paedophile boy play ─ to infiltrate security ranks, multiple officials and survivors of such assaults told AFP.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ancient custom is prevalent across Afghanistan, but nowhere does it seem as entrenched as in the province of Uruzgan, where "bacha bereesh" ─ or boys without beards ─ widely become objects of lustful attraction for powerful police commanders.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Taliban over nearly two years have used them to mount a wave of Trojan Horse attacks ─ at least six between January and April alone ─ that have killed hundreds of policemen, according to security and judicial officials in the province.

             Should We Fight Pashtun Pedophiles?

             In his last phone call home, Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. told his father what was troubling him: From his bunk in southern Afghanistan, he could hear Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought to the base.
            </p>
            <p>
             “At night we can hear them screaming, but we’re not allowed to do anything about it,” the Marine’s father, Gregory Buckley Sr., recalled his son telling him before he was shot to death at the base in 2012. He urged his son to tell his superiors. “My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it’s their culture.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Rampant sexual abuse of children has long been a problem in Afghanistan, particularly among armed commanders who dominate much of the rural landscape and can bully the population. The practice is called bacha bazi, literally “boy play,” and American soldiers and Marines have been instructed not to intervene — in some cases, not even when their Afghan allies have abused boys on military bases, according to interviews and court records.

              Well first of all I will just tell you something that will keep some from reading the rest of my comment, because it sounds nuts, but I don't think Bin Laden is dead.  I don't believe that TPTB, especially the Bushes, would ever harm one little hair on the head of any Saudi friends.  Remember the family was escorted out of our country right before 911.  We are over in Afghanistan to guard the Poppy Trade.  Simple as that.  In the meantime we are allowing for the Fun and Merriment for the Taliban and the officers while they are all helping us guard as well.  It's all a Big Circle of Deceit, imo.

            Soldiers fighting in Afghanistan after 2001 spoke of their surprise at watching grown men walking down the streets of the conservative country, hand in hand with a young boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            But even the coalition forces looked the other way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lance Corporal Geoffrey Buckley Jr told his father he was forced to listen to the screams of young boys being raped at night.
           </p>
           <p>
            But last September, three years after Lance Cprl Buckley was shot to death on his base, Gregory Buckley Sr told the New York Times: 'My son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it's their culture.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Lance Cprl Buckley wasn't the only person to raise the alarm: Unicef compiled its own report in 2008, and an award-winning documentary followed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet nothing changed for years.
