            Putin once quoted "You would be heartless not to miss the soviet union, but stupid to want it back"
           </p>
           <p>
            He knows that communism failed, he saw it first hand, and he has taken Russia very very far. He understands that the survival of not just Russia,but the global quality of life depends on a a stable, strong united states.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect that he is not the only one that feels this way. We may be witnessing something very unique here, foreign and domestic intelligence communities working against a few dangerous but well connected individuals.

            I don't rely on the bible for anything I do. Using the argument that science just lies to us isn't good enough for me. That in it's self is a weak argument. You have to be able to explain in other ways why the sunlight is warm. Why gravity works the way it does. Why we are able to trace evolution in just about every living thing on earth. The point that I'm making is that if you are going to blindly follow a god that you have no proof exist, you have to basically deny every bit of science that points to the contrary. If that's the case, sorry to break it to you, but those same sciences developed the life saving drugs that will cure your current or future children. They'll give you a few extra years with the loved ones you so desperately love. In reality, when the skills of  surgeon save someone in your life's life, you're going to be more willing to say that God used that surgeon to save your loved one's life. You're completely ignoring the training and decades of science that gave the doctor the ability to save a life. I could go on and on. I come from a VERY religious family. I still attend church. I knew early in my life that I would question whether god exists. I never thought it would take this long to finally come out to myself and say it, but it's a pretty amazing feeling to admit to yourself that you know there are no gods. I can't even stress enough the feeling. By the way... I would call myself a very conservative, friendly, loving family person, who always cares about what other people think. I never want enemies, I want everyone to be happy all of the time... .etc.... There's a crappy sterotype that believing in a god makes you a good person, and not believing in one makes you heartless.

            Well of course it's internationally known as pedogate, the point is most of you are putting the horse before the cart and going off on these wild tangents that detract from the focus of the relevant facts concerning pizzagate. Especially when more relevant thread's are deleted at the drop of a hat.

            Fuck trump, he's a compromised pedo too. This is a pizzagawhatever thread. We need to keep this main thread focused on pizza gate, if you are not specifically focusing on alefantis, podesta, clinton, or related by only a few degrees, than you are intentionally or unintentionally engaging in thread sliding, an intelligence tactic. However, some mods odd subjective hypocrisy only compounds this situation and thread's that should have been sorted out remain on the main forum, only reinforcing the rumors of thiel's ownership in this site. However relevant or altruistic your endeavor is this thread is only contributing to the mess the pizzagate forum has become and should be relegated to the pizzagatewhatever column. Better threads have been straight deleted by these mods. time to clean this circus up.

             The Salacious Ammo Even Donald Trump Won't Use in a Fight Against Hillary Clinton

             In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at Mar-A-Lago, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.
            </p>
            <p>
             During this same period, Epstein and Maxwell were repeat guests at Mar-A-Lago. In 2000, they hung out there with Prince Andrew, who arrived for vacation on Trump's private plane. That same year, the Palm Beach Post reported that Trump, Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Maxwell were all at a tennis tournament/celebrity event at Mar-A-Lago.

            I don't buy this story at all. Who is this site anyways? If this stuff at CNN was so blatant to many employees it would have already been recorded and leaked.. you can secretly record if  one person consents(yourself).

               I just hope that DJT makes the same decision that JFK did to rage into the night. Right now I am skeptical. The entire him versus media thing could be a supereffective ploy to trick the "woke" and desperate.

                  Then its up to the people to fight back. Rise up and crush them . im so tired of this shit. Its time for real action. Many of us might be thrown in prison , murdered or have our reputation tarnished when they start using our tactics against us but it has to end now.

            I hate the fact that if there were to be a global flood, no one would ever believe it was gods work. A flood would be gradual if anything, and it would be blamed on humans, not god. That's the big issue I have with religion now. We will never be okay with mass extinction on ANY scale. The huge tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands? Is that not big enough to call it god's work? I don't want to follow a god that's willing to kill that many people, and I'm very weary of ANYONE that would be okay with millions of people being killed, as long as they can say that God meant for it to happen.

             Just for some perspective.
What if the ancient flood occurred because literally everyone except Noah's family was practicing child rape, ritual abuse &amp; murder as their religion? (This was part of many ancient religious traditions). 
theoretically God allows the earthly death of a world full of pedophile murderers to stop this insanity.
In regards to what we see as current earthly tragedies, He sees the big picture=eternal soul is more important than short time on earth.
So anything he does/allows is to bring as many ppl to heaven as possible.
I rejected the existence God for decades on the basis of how could a good God send someone to hell.
(And other reasons of course)
Until i was electroshocked into understanding each person chooses heaven or hell.
I hope you meet the real God one day. The enemy lies about who he is. so much darkness dissipated for me when i did.

              I believe in the power of nuclear bombs, I just don't believe in man-made nuclear bombs. It's egotistical to think that humans have the power to create a nuclear apocalypse, and there is sufficient evidence to show that nuclear apocalypse is part of the natural cycle that earth's climate has always experienced in the past.

              I don't fully understand your question. I'm not okay with ANY of it. I don't believe in god. It doesn't make sense for there to even be a god. People praise Noah's ark as if it would have been a good thing (had it been true) that the entire earth's population is killed. It's a freaking holocaust. Just because it's written down in a book and we think that an invisible entity caused it, everything makes that event seem okay! That's ridiculous. If it happened again today, noone would be singing praise to god for it.

               Of course not because man is more aware now that they are the sole destroyer of themselves.
Man loves scapegoats because their pride does not allow them to take responsibility for their actions

                I'll agree with that but would also like to add that scientifically, it's been proven, that we are pre-wired to WANT to believe in a higher power. We are also wired to find patterns and to want to make sense of why things happen. We don't like randomness. Belief in a higher power makes us feel less crazy because we live in a chaotic world that is NOT organized. Nothing is planned. It's all random.

                 I will disagree. Everything is planned. 
The elites want to be god of the earth. Satan lives vicariously through them .
God does exist. And the proof is our ability of free will.  Do you really think satan wants us to have free will? 
Of course not.
Satan wants us to eat each other figuratively and technically speaking.

                  I will just have to agree to disagree here. I am of the belief that there is no god and no satan. We are all athiest, including you. You're just an athiest to the thousands of other gods that came before YOUR god (christian I assume). That's okay. It really is okay to believe that, but just rembmer that those who worshipped the gods before your Christian god all felt the same belief that you do. There is no difference. Were they wrong?. I am also a firm believer that if there was a god, why would he ignore humans that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years before FINALLY sending his supposed son to save us from our sins. Were the Millions of humans before Jesus not worth his time? If EVERYTHING is planned, then why is it that we praise him when something good happens to us, like maybe we get a good bonus at work, but then when thousands of children are dying, we say he works in mysterious ways? Do you really believe that he is powerful enough to give you a couple extra bucks, but not save children's lives?

                   Free will and our ability to keep free will an option is a gift from the almighty. Lets call this omnipotent presence the almighty. Now if children are being abused and murdered it is because of our free will to allow it to happen. And it is of our free will to stop it.

                    So then what you're saying is God has no control over these children's safety? That's exactly what you should be saying because of free will. So if that's the case, God has absolutely zero power to control anything we say, do, think, etc... see the conundrum? There's no way that you can say an omnipotent god exists while also claiming free will exists. You can't truly have both.

                     God has zero say. After all we have free will. But god does exist. If Satanist believe in satan then you must also believe god exists.  Its a belief system dynamic.  If you do not believe god exists then god does not exist. If you believe god is dead then well...

                      Gotcha. Well.. again.. I don't believe in there being a god, or satan. I truly believe that we are all just particles that originated from an explosion and over billions of years became more and more complex. Natural selection and evolution gives us what we are today. Again... for me... satan and god don't exist. I don't believe in an afterlife, and that makes me extremely happy.

                        What's a black and white forum? Are you saying everyone here is religious? I've seen the opposite. I'm not being hostile by the way. It's just an interesting topic to discuss.

                         A black and white forum or i guesd i should say issue is that theres no grey area to advocate or condone the behavior of people who abuse children.   This pizzagate forum seems to be about exposing and stopping the systematic abuse of children by elites in power and their connections to human trafficking and 
Satanic agendas.

             We received an email tonight from an unconfirmed CNN insider.  Since we JUST received this information, we have not had time to fully vet everything, but we are currently working on confirming the source.

            It is very disturbing that people have been bamboozled over the last few decades. It's the slow and steady "Boiling of a frog" done incrementally hoping people don't notice. And when all the major networks are in on it, and most people are too busy to be "watchdogs" you can see the effect! Plus some people don't want to believe in this level of evil corruption (unless it's originating with  Trump)!!

             Before pizzagate was exposed  late last October i was constantly watching eyes wide shut for days on replay in july of 2016. I dunno why. I was getting red pilled. I studied the film using various online sites and was thinking about what if there is a satanic agenda going on with the on going ritualistic
Abuse of children and women.
And then when pizzagate emerged 
I was floored that such thing was really going on.

              Funny that. I am quite into conspiracy and had been looking at Eyes Wide Shut symbolism before it broke too.

              Dominos is also the name of those masks 🎭. "Dominos on pizza". Something people don't pick up on. JAs Instagram even has a photo with kids in masks in some occult ceremony

              Oh thanks but I can't take credit for it. A lot of social scientists use it to describe the situation of a group of people being unaware of the "threats" that are gradually building up around them because the establishment  doesn't enact the threats suddenly, but very gradually. The comparison to the frog is that supposedly if you throw a frog into boiling water he'll jump right out, but if you start with cold and slowly  heat it up, he'll stay in to his demise.

            This I believe, too. So the two standout pieces of info for me this week are: (1) McCain is the mole; and (2) CNN is terrified of Pizzagate. Both ring very true. If the truth is finally seeping out, it's more proof we're winning this war.

            Putin gave a speech on Dec. 25th where he openly talks about Satanism and pedophelia and how it was destroying the world. He first called out to His people then sat with Western press asking them to please tell their citizens. He gave over an hour and half open news conference. He did not accuse anyone outloud but said the world has to stop this. He could have chosen to capitalize on secrets of N. S. That were given/sold/leaked. 
I am no fan don't know anything but He called it out and said the evil will destroy.
He might be all the things they call him...probably is cutthroat in ways we don't know but who is greater evil. 
Lucerian pedophiles or him?

              Only one mention of
              <em>
               paedophilia
              </em>

              <p>
               Another serious challenge to Russia's identity is linked to events taking place in the world. Here there are both foreign policy and moral aspects. We can see how many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilisation. They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious and even sexual. They are implementing policies that equate large families with same-sex partnerships, belief in God with the belief in Satan.
              </p>
              <p>
               The excesses of political correctness have reached the point where people are seriously talking about registering political parties whose aim is to promote
               <strong>
                paedophilia
               </strong>

             Yes my thoughts exactly. Try having his convo with Liberals or any other slave to the MSM / Establishment orthodoxy. They like everything clean-cut in black and white boxes, all wrapped in a bow for them. They aren't prepared to put the research or critical thinking in, so they cannot appreciate that the world is full of shades of grey. The only want it presented to them in simplistic b&amp;w narratives; Putin  = #LiterallyHitler (or is that Trump?). So the idea that you can hold two ideas at the same time is anathema to them: like Putin might well be a bad guy but the NWO agenda is real and far more nefarious for us and our children's futures.

              I asked a coworker recently about their pin on their shirt that read "miss me yet?" With obamas face smiling. I asked, "aside from who we have as president now, why do you like Obama considering he bombed countless civilians, including children?" Their reply was, "well every president does that though." This is coming from someone in the never trump crowd. The person is intelligent but seems to be so deep in brainwash that critical thinking is not applied at all to situations that come up.

               I had an argument at work (social work dept!) in the Uk. Some twat calling Trump a warmonger, WW3, the rise of Hitler, all this total hysterical BS.
              </p>
              <p>
               I asked them why they had no concerns about Obama? They looked at me like I was mad and said "Nobel peace prize! He won it! And Trumps muslim ban is inhumane! It's the rise of fascism!"
              </p>
              <p>
               I said "so Obama has bombed 7 countries last year, all told 7 actual wars in 8 years, 3 more than the next most president (Bush 43). How is he not a warmonger? His policies supporting rebels throughout the ME has overthrown secular leaders, fuelled the rise of radical Islam, created a vacuum for ISIS, and flooded Europe with migrants. And what about 3000 no judge no jury drone strikes with countless collateral death? Or selling more arms than any president in history? Mainly again to Muslim nations?
              </p>
              <p>
               How the everloving FUKC is this guy given a pass when he is directly responsible for destitution, ruined families, millions homeless, 100s thousands of deaths... MAINLY MUSLIMS - yet TRUMP after 4 weeks is the reincarnation of Hitler for a temporary ban on immigrants from countries which OBAMA designated as high terror risks?
              </p>
              <p>
               What th F are you smoking?"
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway I let it all go and I guess I nailed my politics to a mask. Social work is very Leftie so I though "you've shot yourself in the foot there"
              </p>
              <p>
               The guy blustered and called me racist and a supporter of fascism but he was like a deflated balloon who couldn't wait to get out of there.
              </p>
              <p>
               Privately many of my colleagues said "that was brilliant! I agree" but most admit they don't openly say it for fear of the PC police. Instead they all nod along as if in agreement with the Left.  That's my experience: even the moderate Left are going through a phase of cognitive dissonance and many are closet Trump / Brexit supporters.
              </p>
              <p>
               The same schism is happening throughout the West. FOUR political persuasions emerging. Fake left right NeoCon NeoLib (different sides of the same Uniparty Establishment Con game), but break My away from each is an alt Right and alt Left. This schism is causing the hysteria as I think people are totally confused - which is exacerbated by the traitorous MSM

                Yeah completely. Some of my co workers don't give a shit about the pc crowd but when they are around its like " ok everyone we have children present, no offensive language." I can't go full red pill on them or I would probably get fired so I just leave it at "Obama killed so many children, how could you support that?" And they were flustered for the rest of the day. I almost felt bad?

             LATEST LEAK – From (((CNN)))
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            We received an email tonight from an unconfirmed
            <strong>
             (((CNN)))
            </strong>
            insider.  Since we JUST received this information, we have not had time to fully vet everything, but we are currently working on confirming the source.
What this insider has told us is:
           </p>
           <p>
            John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton and other republicans are in regular contact with
            <strong>
             (((Wolf Blitzer)))
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             (((Tapper)))
            </strong>
            , leaking negative info on Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The talking points against Trump are handed down by
            <strong>
             (((Jeff Zucker)))
            </strong>
            , and his lapdog is
            <strong>
             (((Brian Stelter)))
            </strong>
            . Everyone here is mad as hell at being accused of pushing fake news. But that is what they do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The insider claims on Sunday (2/19/17), the order came down to smear Trump with anti-semitic accusations.  The insider says “They decide what subject to smear Trump with and it’s always
            <strong>
             (((Zucker)))
            </strong>
            telling
            <strong>
             (((Stelter)))
            </strong>
            – and
            <strong>
             (((Stelter)))
            </strong>
            works with
            <strong>
             (((Wolf)))
            </strong>
            , Cuomo, and
            <strong>
             (((Tapper)))
            </strong>
            , and sometimes
            <strong>
             (((Gloria)))
            </strong>
            is consulted.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Our unconfirmed insider claims what they
            <strong>
             (((CNN)))
            </strong>
            always discuss off camera is PizzaGate.
            <strong>
             (((CNN)))
            </strong>
            treats it like fake news, but they are all scared of it.   Our insider claims Anderson Cooper was seeing an 18 year old man in NYC not too long ago and was terrified this would get out.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the source, as of the past week, they are frantically worried about the James O’Keefe leaks, and are wanting to temporarily focus on smearing him, to prevent him from crippling
            <strong>
             (((CNN)))
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the insider,  “
            <strong>
             (((Chuck Schumer)))
            </strong>
            has been really active – calling
            <strong>
             (((CNN)))
            </strong>
            at all hours and demanding to speak to
            <strong>
             (((Wolf)))
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             (((Schumer)))
            </strong>
            is always asking if there is news on
            <strong>
             (((Anthony Wiener)))
            </strong>
            and his laptop.  Everyone here knows
            <strong>
             (((Chuck Schumer)))
            </strong>
            is a pedophile.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The insider claims they have overheard conversations where someone heard
            <strong>
             (((Jeff Zucker)))
            </strong>
            tell
            <strong>
             (((Brian)))
            </strong>
            that if the
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘
            <strong>
             (((Schumer)))
            </strong>
            thing leaks, it’s over!’ We are not even allowed to mention Podesta, or PizzaGate, but that’s all everyone discusses here. It’s one big cover up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The insider has offered to send us photos of the memos and notes that are used during the meetings.

             wtf Tom Cotton??  dang... Him and Ben Sasse....  if it turns out the stuff they say is true I'm disappointed....  Got disappointed quick then Lyin Ted Cruz started taking up the spotlight and I did some looking into him.  I can believe Ben Sasse is a little wacked out from Hassert though....  Tom Cotton... Dang one of my heros for awhile... I'm gonna flip if Jim Jordan is implicated though...  I might suspect fakery and not even file away such intel with suspended judgement....

              Others make sense. Don't know about Cotton. 
Jordan, &amp; Gowdy &amp; Issa go most aggressive. Gowdy is a boss. Look up his youtube hits of taking it to HRC &amp; the Reb the Dem. The establishment. Watch his YouTube commencement address to Liberty. Emotional
Think Chaffetz is trying but not so sure who is the bigger threat he has powerful religious pressure from faction in Utah.

               According to one of the "insiders" on 4chan Gowdy has been compromised before (brownstoned). Even Rand apparently got tricked while in Israel a few years ago. Since they're the masters of that game it wouldn't surprise me. Chaffetz is someone to keep an eye on. I'd like to trust him, but don't.

            I truly hope so. I have a friend who is a journalist, and he does not believe anything pizzagate related. He will also not look any proof i send him, probably due to cognitive dissonance. I want something that would get the truth down to hard heads like him!

             I will put it to you this way...  My own father has been extremely polarized this election cycle...  Example:  He claims his neighbor was shooting again the other day, and that he doesn't know what it is but he can't get enough of it...  He then said he works as a correction officer... I asked was it a handgun or a rifle?  he said Handgun I think.. so I replied that he needed to practice at least once a month then especially if he's working in a Jail shesh if he has to use it ever and isn't a good shot he could end up in jail wth...  So basically my dad just hates guns and will not be reasonable about the situation, frankly owning or touching a gun is pretty much a sin in his eyes, he doesn't think past that... this is how it is for "Liberals" of they day, they do not examine, the memorize the party platform the end....  Ima try to get some tanerite and bring the AR over for Independence day this year LMBO!

             If your friend works for CNN and does not know they are propaganda, he is either an idiot or he is lying to you. Who refuses to look at evidence? That would mean if it was 100% true, he would never know, because he decided it could not be. And he is a "journalist"? Journalist don't work for CNN. Are you aware of this?

               Challenge him..  Ask him how could he possibly be a respectable journalist if he does not even have the balls to glance at available information. Information that he is already insisting will do nothing more than CONFIRM his presuppositions.

            I want more on this story. An insider at CNN, some low level person, or even better yet a professional infiltration ?? - Oh yeah. I've known those fuckers were crooked since 2014.  I could just feel the slime oozing out of the screen.

             I've known since at least 2011, probably 2009. Before that I wasn't even watching the news, so I wouldn't even have known.
