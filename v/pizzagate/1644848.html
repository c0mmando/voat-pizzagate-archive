<p>The Pace Memorandum was written by Bishop Pace. Over the course of two years, he interviewed children who claimed to have been subjected to Satanic ritual abuse. He prepared two documents. The Pace Memorandum and a 40 page summary of the evidence. Only a few pages were leaked and those were confirmed to be real by Bishop Pace\'s secretary, who instructed the copies to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Separately, Dr. Snow interviewed a number of children regarding Satanic ritual abuse in Lehi, Utah. There was one conviction, though many were implicated. Most of the perpetrators wore masks. Hadfield\'s defense was that Dr. Snow implanted the memories.</p>
<p>Bishop Pace and Dr. Snow never met, though I believe Pace was aware of the Hadfield case. Though the Pace Memorandum was leaked, other documents remain at large; LDS Social Services report on satanism dated May 24, 1989 by Brent Ward and a memorandum dated October 20, 1989 in response to Brother Ward\'s report, are what we know existed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Children are put in a situation where they believe they are going to die--such as being buried alive or being placed in a plastic bag and immersed in water. Prior to doing so, the abuser tells the child to pray to Jesus to see if He will save her. Imagine a seven year old girl, having been told she is going to die, praying to Jesus to save her and nothing happens--then at the last moment she is rescued, but the person saving her is a representative of Satan.</strong> He uses this experience to convince her that the only person who really cares about her is Satan, she is Satan\'s child and she might as well become loyal to him.</p>
<p>Just before or shortly after their baptism into the Church, children are baptized by blood into the satanic order which is meant to cancel out their baptism into the Church. They will be asked if they understand or have ever felt the Holy Ghost. When they reply that they have, they will be reminded of the horrible things they have participated in and will be told that they have become a son (or daughter) of perdition and, therefore, have no chance of being saved or loved by our Father in heaven or Jesus.</p>
<p>All of this indoctrination takes place with whichever personality has immerged to endure the physical, mental, and spiritual pain. Consequently, there develops within each of these individuals the makings of what I call a civil war. As the memories begin to surface, there are personalities who feel they have given themselves to Satan, and there is no hope for forgiveness. The core person is an active member of the Church, often with a temple recommend. As integration takes place, the civil war begins. Sometimes, in an interview, personalities of the dark side have come out. They are petrified or perhaps full of hate for me and what I represent. Eventually those personalities need to be dealt with spiritually and psychologically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the legal documents of the Hadfield case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;The activities described by the children involved satanic ritual, costumes and masks, photography equipment, men dressing in women\'s clothing, and frequent episodes of playing with and consuming human excrement. A specific instance of abuse related to Dr. Snow by W. and described by her at trial, for example, involved defendant\'s removing feces from W.\'s rectum with a spoon and forcing him to play with it.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets more weird, though. Mormon elite, like Romney, are tied in with our intelligence community. He owns Clear Channel.</p>
<p>The Kimballs are tied up with the Clinton Foundation, Google and orphanages in DR, like the DREAM Center, which happens to be a short drive from &quot;Casa Kimball,&quot; a resort the Kimball family owns.</p>
<p>One search in wikileaks for &quot;Spencer Kimball&quot; and the number of results is staggering.</p>
<p>I am convinced the LDS leadership has been compromised like other organizations. I believe there is a great deal of evidence to back this up, but you are not allowed to have a conversation about the inner workings of the Mormon leadership at <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/exmormon">r/exmormon</a>, even though that is the largest and most appropriate community to discuss those things.</p>

            Trauma based mind control is an epidemic. This is what the CIA has been doing for decades. People need to get angry... People also need to understand that their own believe in 'satan' or demons does not mean that these people do not... They very much believe.

             I feel they should be exposed. The Mormon church has already made efforts to infiltrate and gang stalk New Order mormon communities.

             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/exmormon">
              r/exmormon
             </a>
             . It should be known because exmormons run some risk of being exposed and rejected in their communities. Like the Amish or Jehovahs Witness or Scientologists.
