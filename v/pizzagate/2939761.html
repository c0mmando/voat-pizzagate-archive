<p><strong>Giger\'s Tarot</strong> </p>
<p>Some readers may already be familiar with Giger\'s involvement in the creation of a set of Tarot cards titled The Baphomet Tarot, <a href="http://archive.is/Graq9#selection-935.0-1003.1">produced with</a> the Swiss occultist, <a href="http://archive.is/Graq9">Akron.</a> The title of the series comes as little surprise, given the centrality of Levi\'s Baphomet image in of Giger\'s occult works.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/4AJqvEK.png">Akron in 2017</a></p>
<p>In researching Giger\'s work with Akron, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://archive.is/j93ig">lengthy interview of Giger</a> by the host of an occult-themed website, &quot;GlennFWright.&quot; During the interview, Giger at first professes very little knowledge of Tarot. Whether that response was truthful is a matter for speculation. Giger also <a href="https://archive.is/j93ig#selection-1455.0-1196.206">discusses his one-time fascination</a> with the Baphomet image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;jk: What about Baphomet? That was obviously an image you liked, but why did you use it, was it because it was an image you liked, or because it represented some belief?</p>
<p>Giger: I liked it as an image.</p>
<p>jk: But Akron has turned it into a religion.</p>
<p>Giger: You know, I did that back when I was doing my Spell paintings, 1973-’76 and I was fascinated by this Baphomet image, and so this was long before I met Akron, who I’ve known for about twelve years or so. Maybe ’88 or so. I mean, it has absolutely nothing to do with his ideas.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giger repeatedly makes an effort to separate his work from &quot;Akron\'s ideas.&quot; In accounting for his attraction to Baphomet, Giger also mentions having read Eliphas Levi\'s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302614.Transcendental_Magic">Transcendental Magic</a>. Levi, as discussed later in this article, drew the Baphomet figure on which Giger\'s images were based.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;jk: So, back to these Baphomet images, did you know that they originated with an occultist named Eliphas Lévi?</p>
<p>Giger: Sure. I read the whole book [Transcendental Magic] at the time.</p>
<p>jk: You did read that?</p>
<p>Giger: It was much earlier.</p>
<p>jk: What influence do you think those occultist writings had on you?</p>
<p>Giger: I don’t know. I can’t tell you. I was fascinated, like everybody, about these magicians, and I was fascinated by Crowley’s drawings and paintings—I got a catalog of an exhibition of his drawings and paintings in London. I was always very interested in his paintings, because I understood that better than his text. His text is very difficult, and it was not translated much at the time. </p>
<p>jk: It’s difficult in English also.</p>
<p>Giger: Yes, I think so. It’s really hard&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the interview, Giger and his interviewer are discussing a specific series of works titled <a href="http://archive.is/NTN4x">Pump Excursion</a>, painted in the late 1980s.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/IuUdUhM.png">Image of \'Pump Excursion\'</a></p>
<p>Fascinatingly, Giger confirms that the background in the series is intended to represent Mayan/Aztec pyramids. Going further, the interviewer directly references the ritual sacrifices which took place on such pyramids, including the removal of the heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;jk: Do you mean from India—or an American Indian?</p>
<p>Giger: American Indian</p>
<p>jk: So this pyramid in the back is Mayan or Aztec or something?</p>
<p>Giger: Yes.</p>
<p>jk: OK, good. And you may recall our discussion yesterday about the guillotine blade and how that seemed to be the Magician’s tool but this is not mentioned. And in the Taschen text, in the English version, they don’t even mention this image in the background. Akron talks about steps, but not about the pyramid. So you intended this figure to look Mayan?</p>
<p>Giger: Yes.</p>
<p>jk: What’s interesting, and I don’t know if you’re aware of this or thought about this in the context of the choice of this image for this card, but the steps leading up the pyramid remind us of the blood sacrifice, the removal of the heart, and there is the solar aspect of this, the worship and feeding of the Sun. This is also a part of the occult tradition we find in the discussions of the Fool card. Did you know this when Akron chose this image for this card?</p>
<p>Giger: No.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/JsshGs3.png">here are depictions of the steps</a> Giger included or referenced in &quot;Pump Excursion,&quot; in their ritual/sacrificial use.</p>
<p>This writer <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@whitedeer9217/maria-abramovic-s-trip-to-brazil-a-comparison-of-spiritcooking-and-shamanism">previously discussed Mayan/Aztec cannibalism</a>, in relation to Marina Abramovic\'s trip to Brazil. </p>
<p><strong>In this author\'s opinion, this Mayan/Aztec reference is far more indicative of experience or awareness of ritual abuse than the inclusion of Levi\'s Baphomet in Giger\'s works, or the depiction of Crowley in others.</strong></p>
<p>Giger also created <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/x9uLv9d.jpg">this image in 2009</a>, titled &quot;<a href="http://archive.is/ZP0x8#selection-65.0-65.29">Caravan (with Martin Schwarz).</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The image includes an eye, what looks like surgeons in surgical garb, blood and organs, a bird, thorns or beaks, and other material. The \'beak\' placed on the surgeon\'s mask is strongly reminiscent of the mask of a <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/wEvgn7k.png">\'Plague Doctor.\'</a></p>
<p>Two faces appear to be wearing clown-like masks. Although this is not a clearly occult image, the material has much in common with the accounts of ritual abuse survivors. In this writer\'s opinion it is much more strongly indicative of victimization, experience or involvement with actual ritual abuse than Giger\'s other works that focus on spells or typical occult aesthetic.</p>
<p>Giger also describes his creative process as intuitive, stating that he often does not recognize the artwork until it is complete, and does not feel as if he was the one creating the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;jk: Do you not like to tell people what your paintings mean?</p>
<p>Giger: I don’t know what they mean. To me it is sometimes like when I’ve finished them, they were done by someone else. And some things in it, I can say at that time I was doing the painting, I was fascinated about that, or just during the work on the painting, somebody came with something and I just incorporated that into the painting, like a box or a key or whatever.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this statement is true, then in this writer\'s opinion, it is highly suggestive that Giger was abused ritually. Whether he also became a perpetrator later in his life is not clear, but at minimum, he appears to have cognitively been able to choose specific symbols that we now know relate to child abuse.</p>
<p>It is a horrible reality that for some, being a victim of this kind of abuse is intertwined with perpetration: in fact, from the absolute earliest ages, many ritual abuse victims are made to kill small animals and participate in torture, or believe that the torture of others is their fault, in order to indoctrinate such victims into a belief that they are evil and culpable for abuse perpetrated against them and others, whether they are or not. The following are examples from the X-Witness <a href="https://archive.is/oOwJf#selection-435.1366-435.1544">testimony of the Dutroux victims</a>. Extra trigger warning on the following three examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/Iucnvl4.png">e.g. One</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/snzbq1b.png">e.g. Two</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/WVyfwM9.png">e.g. Three</a></p>
<p>This is the despicable reality we face when we see someone like Podesta and his &quot;alter-ego,&quot; Skippy. However, that does not absolve adult perpetrators in any way. It is simply something to keep in mind as we view people involved with these circles: victim and perpetrator are not always clearly defined, and this is absolutely intentional.</p>

            discusses his one-time fascination
           </a>
           with the Baphomet image.
          </p>
          <blockquote>

          <p>
           Giger repeatedly makes an effort to separate his work from "Akron's ideas." In accounting for his attraction to Baphomet, Giger also mentions having read Eliphas Levi's book
           <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/302614.Transcendental_Magic">
            Transcendental Magic
           </a>
           . Levi, as discussed later in this article, drew the Baphomet figure on which Giger's images were based.

          <blockquote>

            Giger: Yes, I think so. It’s really hard"
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Later in the interview, Giger and his interviewer are discussing a specific series of works titled
           <a href="http://archive.is/NTN4x">
            Pump Excursion
           </a>

           Fascinatingly, Giger confirms that the background in the series is intended to represent Mayan/Aztec pyramids. Going further, the interviewer directly references the ritual sacrifices which took place on such pyramids, including the removal of the heart.

           <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/wEvgn7k.png">
            'Plague Doctor.'
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Two faces appear to be wearing clown-like masks. Although this is not a clearly occult image, the material has much in common with the accounts of ritual abuse survivors. In this writer's opinion it is much more strongly indicative of victimization, experience or involvement with actual ritual abuse than Giger's other works that focus on spells or typical occult aesthetic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Giger also describes his creative process as intuitive, stating that he often does not recognize the artwork until it is complete, and does not feel as if he was the one creating the piece:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "jk: Do you not like to tell people what your paintings mean?
           </p>
           <p>
            Giger: I don’t know what they mean. To me it is sometimes like when I’ve finished them, they were done by someone else. And some things in it, I can say at that time I was doing the painting, I was fascinated about that, or just during the work on the painting, somebody came with something and I just incorporated that into the painting, like a box or a key or whatever."
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           If this statement is true, then in this writer's opinion, it is highly suggestive that Giger was abused ritually. Whether he also became a perpetrator later in his life is not clear, but at minimum, he appears to have cognitively been able to choose specific symbols that we now know relate to child abuse.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is a horrible reality that for some, being a victim of this kind of abuse is intertwined with perpetration: in fact, from the absolute earliest ages, many ritual abuse victims are made to kill small animals and participate in torture, or believe that the torture of others is their fault, in order to indoctrinate such victims into a belief that they are evil and culpable for abuse perpetrated against them and others, whether they are or not. The following are examples from the X-Witness
           <a href="https://archive.is/oOwJf#selection-435.1366-435.1544">
            testimony of the Dutroux victims
           </a>
           . Extra trigger warning on the following three examples:
          </p>

            e.g. Three
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the despicable reality we face when we see someone like Podesta and his "alter-ego," Skippy. However, that does not absolve adult perpetrators in any way. It is simply something to keep in mind as we view people involved with these circles: victim and perpetrator are not always clearly defined, and this is absolutely intentional.

           <p>
            Most artists are lazy intellectually...and that is not a negative thing...thier work comes from the subconscious collective ...without them knowing ...the ones taking credit for their artwork is another example of their idiocy...since all they r doing is channeling...
           </p>
           <p>
            and giving them and their work importance is also intellectually lazy and a futile exercise...
           </p>
           <p>
            U cant understand the world from their works...since the very fact that they r channeling the collective subconscious makes their work abstract...to sell their work they need to make it look mysterious and esoteric...
           </p>
           <p>
            Their is nothing mysterious about satanism...it just means the illlusion...to be specific the debt illusion...
This is why u find bankers involved in funding and sponsoring  these artists...
It is the banksters and their work that r the real satanists ..and they invest in people and methods involved in cults that invest their time in diversionary tactics and mysteries to give their simple illusion an air of mystery..
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cia and mi6 are internatiinal banking fronts that have time and time again been caught driving these occlulting forums and their leaders..
Eg: wasson of jp morgan and the mushroom and lsd cult culture creation
The process church and finders cult
Nxium and the bronfmann banking family
James alefantis and comet ping pongs culture creation hosting bands with satanic themes..as a front for another child mkutra ing cult ...
There is a clip of him selling culture creatiin at some cosplay convention acting like a prat..
The frued family investing in ping pong restaurant chains..and alefantis connection to art museums used as fronts for money laundering via diplomatic pouches in thr form if shipping containers
           </p>
           <p>
            The banking system also sponsors most sports since it is another way to keep.the public.in a trance and idol worship..
           </p>
           <p>
            These are modern day culture creation religions with their rituals and idols..
.. 
That is the real satanism...and we r the satanists for falling for the debt illusion..
           </p>
           <p>
            As for baphomet the symbol of thr hermaphrodite goat ..it is but the anthromoporphic rendition of the city sewage system which connects the city and its structures to the sea ...that is the legal term known as GOAT
(Goat = gotti = god..= landlord .. They r lords of the land via the superimposition of the law of the sea on the land via the underworld sewage system...it is occulted via the art of pictographs known as letters and their spells..
Roman dog latin hiding as english

           </p>
           <p>
            Occult means hidden or concealed..
Satanism is an occult religion that rules all of us..and we worship it via our invented and programmed egos...programmed via a language of spells..and pictographs that we know as letters
           </p>

           <p>
            This is all there is to Satanism..and it gets its power via our acceptance of our ignorance of it...not some.tarot card or rituals...those r jsut symptoms of our acceptanc of our ign9rance of the bankers debt system

              previous entry on this
             </a>
             , which shows that Giger was explicitly using Pizza/Pasta in the context of sexual abuse and probably cannibalism of infants. Note: I didn't say he cannibalized infants. I am saying he seems to have known what those items meant decades before the existence of the internet much less Pizzagate. I also think he was probably a ritual abuse victim himself. So, please read that previous piece before dismissing this topic. It is because of his use of those food-items and his imagery around birth and other core ritual abuse experiences that I am writing about his occult ties, not simply because he painted pentagrams etc.

              My apologies.  It's been a long year.  The last Friday of 2018.

              The pizza code has existed for a long time, from what I can tell.  What I wonder is what other codes are we missing?  HRC &amp; Co. talk about "yoga" a lot (yuck).  It's certainly right in front of us.  Including in Giger's works.

               No worries, I understand burn-out, and have taken months-long breaks myself. I would bet there are a lot of code words/items out there in use, but whether we will ever get evidence of them or what they mean is another story, unfortunately.

             Occult Influences And Associations
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            HR Giger incorporated many occult symbols and themes across his painted works and sculptures, and admitted that at one point in his career he was interested in what he called witchcraft.
            <a href="http://archive.is/1GR2B#selection-457.0-499.8">
             A quote from Giger on the issue
            </a>
            reads as follows:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "
             <strong>
              At that point in time, I was very much interested in magic and witchcraft. Incidentally, I would like to stress that I have nothing at all to do with Satan and that I detest cruelty to animals. The Spell Temple series, created 25 years ago, contain symbols which certain fools use to try bring me into a relationship with black magic, an association I strongly decline.
             </strong>
             "
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Readers can make of that quote what they will: it is my personal opinion that though Giger used overt occult symbols, as he discussed openly on multiple occasions, the heart of his work is not so much to do with occult symbols, but a subconscious portrayal of trauma combined with in-jokes and nods to real practices or code words (as discussed in my previous post on Giger).

             Disclaimer

            : It is
            <em>
             extremely
            </em>
            difficult to analyze the significance of Giger's occult ties venturing into total speculation. This piece will endeavor to find a narrow balance between becoming overly-speculative and not giving enough weight to Giger's occult connections. Many of the symbols are either difficult to "translate," or lead us into the realm of "conspiracy theory" so deeply that it makes Pizzagate look like material for a college essay.

            It's not just the Baphomet image on the cover of Giger's  first Necronomicon that is a clear occult reference. In Lovecraft's universe, the word

            Although there is much more one could say about Lovecraft's life and work, it is too large in scope to continue in this article. I have instead tried to barely outline the direct overlap between Lovecraft's world-building and Giger's own "inner world."

            The extent of Crowley's influence on Western Esotericism cannot be summarized in this post, but we note that Giger dedicated the following work to Crowley, naming it after him. The image contains a hermaphrodite with a clown-like face or mask, who is making a "666" symbol in her hands. Another figure to the right of Crowley has their face replaced with the

            This small section on Crowley does little justice to his influence on Western occult circles, UK military intelligence, etc. However, as in the case of Lovecraft, I have tried to examine Crowley only in the sense of Giger's depiction of him/ inspiration drawn from him.

             that there is a close connection between Levi's Baphomet and the Tarot, and that Levi believed in an ancient form of pagan witchcraft:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Lévi's depiction of Baphomet is similar to that of The Devil in early Tarot. Lévi, working with correspondences different from those later used by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, "equated the Devil Tarot key with Mercury," giving "his figure Mercury's caduceus, rising like a phallus from his groin." Lévi believed that the alleged devil worship of the medieval Witches' Sabbath was a perpetuation of ancient pagan rites. A goat with a candle between its horns appears in medieval witchcraft records,[53] and other pieces of lore are cited in Dogme et Rituel."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Given Giger's admission of fascination with Levi, and Levi's association with Tarot, it seems hard to believe Giger's claim that he was essentially unfamiliar with the subject.

             Giger's Baphomet figure is positioned in the 'As above, so below' gesture, while impaling a white female figure suspended above his goat-head. Her position

             Such a concept is not ritually abusive or even negative, and is present philosophies like Taoism etc. However, the ritual abuse spin on it, as

             , places birth directly within death. This involves some of the worst abuses imaginable to mother and/or child, as documented in both Dutroux victim testimonies, and even pop culture, like the film 'Mother!' It is as much a perversion of duality, as it is a perversion of the Eucharist for Christians.

              <strong>
               Lévi's intention was to symbolize his concept of "the equilibrium of the opposites"
              </strong>
              that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light; on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a heretical tradition that should result in a perfect social order, a notion that can only be understood against Lévi's socialist background"

             <a href="http://archive.is/jBqQA#selection-979.0-979.123">
              According to Wikipedia,
             </a>
             the name Baphomet first appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 14th century.

             </a>
             that the Templar Order did indeed worship this figure, stating:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Yes, in our profound conviction, the Grand Masters of the Order of Templars worshipped the Baphomet, and caused it to be worshipped by their initiates; yes, there existed in the past, and there may be still in the present, assemblies which are presided over by this figure, seated on a throne and having a flaming torch between the horns. "
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Given that Giger was Swiss, that the Templar Order allegedly created Switzerland, and that Levi believed the Templars worshipped Baphomet, the context for Giger's fascination with the image is compelling in its occult meaning.

               <li>
                <p>
                 The founding of the embryonic Switzerland conforms exactly to the period when the Templars were being persecuted in France.

               <li>
                <p>
                 Switzerland is just to the east of France and would have been particularly easy for fleeing Templar brothers from the whole region of France to get to.

               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 In the history of the first Swiss Cantons there are tales of white coated knights mysteriously appearing and helping the locals to gain their independence against foreign domination.

               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 The Templars were big in banking, farming and engineering (of an early type). These same aspects can be seen as inimical to the commencement and gradual evolution of the separate states that would eventually be Switzerland.

                 Even the Swiss don’t really know the ins and outs of their earliest history (or suggest that they don’t.) They are famous for being secretive and we don’t have to tell interested readers that this is something they share absolutely with the Templars.

             <p>
              So, can we then trace the influence of the Templar Order in Switzerland, through to Giger's fascination with Levi's Baphomet? I think it is possible, but we cannot know for sure.
             </p>
             <p>
              Additional intrigue is added to this scenario when considering the (surprising to me) connection between Switzerland and Egypt, which one will find an
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=BGhCS564VS4">

               varying quality
              </a>
              , in a cursory search. Prior to researching Giger, I had no idea about the Swiss connection with Templars, possibly Egypt, or any other NWO-type issues, so this line of research is completely new to me. While such a connection may seem extremely unlikely,
              <a href="http://archive.li/wAdCU">
               some news reports
              </a>
              stipulate that half of all Swiss men are related to the Egyptian Pharoah, Tutankhamun, via a shared ancestor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Giger also included Egyptian motifs in his work. For example, in the following work created as a tribute to his close friend and fellow Swiss Artist,
              <a href="http://archive.li/X0Gdn">
               Friedrich Kuhn
              </a>
              :
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/74N6LLh.jpg">
               The work includes depicts  Egyptian pyramids,
              </a>
              and the entire scene rests on a layer of rotting or diseased infants seen in Giger's 'Landscapes.'
             </p>
             <p>
              Another example of overt Egyptian symbology can be seen in Giger's work titled
              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/nHTzZVv.jpg">
               "Hieroglyphics."
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              As
              <a href="http://archive.is/C073v">
               previously noted by others,
              </a>
              this specific piece evokes Egyptian symbolism in
              <em>
               more than just name.
              </em>
              The arching figure in the painting is based on the
              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/oIotV2p.jpg">
               Egyptian sky goddess, Nut/Nuit.
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              One does not have to stretch the imagination far in order to also recognize the Masonic symbol of the triangle topped by a radiating all-seeing-"eye" in Giger's version of this image.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition to the above-mentioned piece, Giger's work in general has the appearance of flat, almost two-dimensional, forward-facing displays, as if the viewer is looking at a carving on a wall, much as Egyptian art is painted and carved into the sides of temples and tombs. For example:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/5Qe5jEB.jpg">
               Egyptian hieroglyphs
              </a>

              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/L7oDKGd.png">
               An example of Giger's very 2-D work
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Another occult influence for Giger appears to have been Timothy Leary, whose face Giger included in
              <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923232829/https://art.vniz.net/giger/Giger-Illuminatus_I.jpg?HF">
               Illuminatus I
              </a>
              , seen below. The image continues Giger's use of Egyptian symbolism, including a pyramid, the Eye of Horus, an Ankh at the bottom of the image, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/5Ax38NZ.jpg">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The apple on top of the pyramid is interesting, in that the
              <a href="http://archive.li/y6OhW">
               Adamic apple was the fruit of the tree of knowledge
              </a>
              , hence, ultimate - if illicit or forbidden knowledge - and therefore "Illumination"is placed at the top of the pyramid.  The placement of the safety pin piercing the female's mouth seems to connote the "safety" of a violently enforced code of silence at the base of the pyramid.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another piece,

              Now you may be objecting to the appraisal of Leary as an

               occult influence,

             <p>
              By including what appear to be likenesses of Leary, Lovecraft and others in a painting titled "Illuminatus," Giger expresses an awareness of Leary's occult connections in addition to his work in the psychedelic realm. This communicates that at minimum Giger was running in similar circles.

               "Sergius Golowin wrote numerous books and articles, primarily about folklore and esotericism. For his work in folklore and exploring the counterculture, he was awarded the prize of the Schweizerische Schillerstiftung in 1974."
              </p>
              <p>
               "Golowin was a contemporary of many notable people and events. He provided assistance to Timothy Leary while Leary was in Swiss exile. Golowin was a friend of Friedrich Dürrenmatt, and was portrayed by H. R. Giger... Golowin was an acquaintance of Martin "Tino" Schippert, founder of the Swiss Hells Angels."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              In this light, Giger's portrayal of Golowin with Leary makes complete sense, and the former's interest in esotericism makes his inclusion in a work titled 'Illuminatus' self-explanatory.

             <p>
              Clearly, Giger's work very carefully incorporates and draws from real and fictional (Lovecraftian) occult material. The inclusion of this subject matter is not in question: the question comes when we try to determine meaning from Giger's occult references and ties. In order to do so, we need to look at  not only Giger's symbols, but also important events from Giger's life. For that reason, in the next segment in this series we turn to the death of Giger's first muse and long-time partner, Li Tobler.

               On the Swiss connection, it is my belief that when the Hyksos were kicked out of Egypt, they were later exiled to Hyrcania. Then into Khazaria. The expulsion from there by the Rus/ others. They then traveled back to Caanan only to find the Pheonicians cousins as vassals to Assyria. They still had boats though, and eventually wound up in Spain and France. Kicked out of France (for the usual child sacrifice), they founded Switzerland in the 12 century. This would explain the Egyptian occultism through to the present day, and the real reason for the crusades. The two snakes entwined are representing the creation myth and can be a dragon or lizard in some countries. they are circling the sun in most ancient religions. The Hyksos were snake worshipers, and even after expulsion influenced Egypt by intermarriage to the original Egyptians. This culminated in direct descendant Amenhotep's aten worship, and dereliction of the old temples. He and his priests got kicked out and fled to Caanan as well. He was what we call Moses.

                Very interesting theory. However I wonder if the Hyksos explain the genetic connection between Swiss men and Tutankhamun? I am not familiar with the timing of his family's reign[s] in terms of Hyksos invasion/repulsion timelines. Definitely something to ponder!

                 I forget where I read it, and the search engine is dumbing down history to almost pre-literature Europe all of the sudden, but the Hyksos getting kicked out did not extinguish the bloodline left in the Egyptian royalty, and they might not have even noticed it. Amenhotep IV's grandmother was a Hyksos. Little king Tut was his son by the lesser wife Kiya(not Nefertiti supposedly) Either way  the Hyksos blood would be maintained after El Moses exile in the wilderness of Caanan. He was never a slave of the Egyptians either. He was even allowed to come back to Egypt to beg from relatives periodically before getting kicked out again. Well, he was also most likely testing the waters for his return to power by his popularity (in his own mind.)
