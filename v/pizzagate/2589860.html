<p><strong><em>1.)  Annie E. Casey Foundation: connections to the Clintons, concrete, and more</em></strong></p>
<p>I got a shock when I looked up the Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF).</p>
<p>It was started by the founder of <strong>shipping company United Parcel Service,</strong> James E. Casey.  
</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of UPS employees and leadership are surely innocent, yet we all have a feeling babies and children are sometimes shipped in boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AECF and the Clinton Foundation:</strong></p>
<p>AECF has <a href="http://archive.is/HcYXp">many partnerships with the CF.</a>  These include a <a href="http://archive.is/qDOcy">ready mix concrete</a> truck driving <a href="http://archive.is/cKmYe#selection-1265.93-1269.154">program</a> and a <a href="http://archive.is/VxhvR#selection-765.1-773.26">co-partnership with Soros’ Open Society Foundations.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Further:</strong></p>
<p>AECF <a href="http://archive.is/wDbW8#selection-829.159-829.255">donated to JP\'s Center for American Progress,</a> which is funded by Soros.</p>
<p>The fact that they are entrusted to provide the world with the “Kids Count Data Book” smells like CIA to me, not sure why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AECF is one of the <strong>dominant organizations in child welfare issues</strong> in the U.S…..famed for its publication of U.S. child welfare data….KIDS COUNT Data Book – the most widely used reference on the subject….The AECF has had a <strong>long connection with foster care services,</strong> [previously] owning two such agencies.  <a href="http://archive.is/hDw16">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p><strong>Disconcerting UPS Advertising and more ! :</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What Can Brown Do For You?</em></strong></p>
<p>UPS\'s tagline used to be <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2002/02/04/daily35.html"><strong>What Can Brown Do For You?</strong></a> </p>
<p>Does “brown” have intentional double meanings, below?</p>
<p><strong>Tell-a-vision commercials:</strong></p>
<p>“Brown” connecting to darker complexions in this UPS commercial:</p>

<p>Pizza is a <strong>pie….</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPS press release - strange wording:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;At UPS, <strong>brown is more than a color – it\'s a tangible asset</strong>….&quot;   What?</p>

<p><strong>Shipping services are not a “tangible asset,”</strong> in accounting terms!  Those have physical forms.  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tangibleasset.asp">Investopedia</a></p>
<p>Right in our faces?  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The founder of UPS started another charity, The UPS Foundation,</strong> <a href="http://archive.is/pwU9X#selection-479.0-479.26"><strong>also involved with the CF.</strong></a></p>
<p>Are there <strong>sick hidden meanings here?:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kek.gg/i/3dxWXH.jpg">We believe our differences make us stronger.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully they mean diversity.  But it struck me as creepy.  Speculation:  What differences??  Age?  Occult belief that pedophilia and SR murder of young people makes them stronger?  Economic level?  Others living in poverty makes them stronger?  And/or ethnic differences?  White powers-that-be make believe they are made stronger by ingesting the blood of other races?  
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>By the way:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Smithsonian Magazine: “A Brief History of Children Sent Through the Mail”</strong></p>
<p>When the US Postal Service began shipping large parcels, children were sent by mail, although not in boxes according to the official account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, on June 14, 1913, several newspapers….all ran stories stating the postmaster had officially decreed that children could no longer be sent through the mail.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while this announcement seems to have stemmed the trickle of tots traveling via post, Lynch says the story wasn’t entirely accurate….“There’s an account of May Pierstorff being mailed under the chicken rate, but actually chicks weren’t allowed until 1918.”</p>

           Hopefully they mean diversity.  But it struck me as creepy.  Speculation:  What differences??  Age?  Occult belief that pedophilia and SR murder of young people makes them stronger?  Economic level?  Others living in poverty makes them stronger?  And/or ethnic differences?  White powers-that-be make believe they are made stronger by ingesting the blood of other races?

            Smithsonian Magazine: “A Brief History of Children Sent Through the Mail”
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           When the US Postal Service began shipping large parcels, children were sent by mail, although not in boxes according to the official account.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Finally, on June 14, 1913, several newspapers….all ran stories stating the postmaster had officially decreed that children could no longer be sent through the mail.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           This is strange:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            But while this announcement seems to have stemmed the trickle of tots traveling via post, Lynch says the story wasn’t entirely accurate….“There’s an account of May Pierstorff being mailed under the chicken rate, but actually chicks weren’t allowed until 1918.”

            Talking about logistics..
Why isnt therr updates on research that should be done on connecticut avenue..which is a concentrated hub of logistics from procurement ..shipping company connections of JA anx besta pizza
...prostitution ...at comet pizza
...kill rooms ....snuff movies...at pegasus and comet ping pong..
That whole street should have an owls eye permenantly attached to it...
This forum was started based on that ...yet conspicuously it fails to address research that will fill JA and Killton crowd with fear and terror...
Maybe VoatisCia can comment ..

            This is very solid stuff.  It could indicate that local law enforcement is complicit, leading all the way to the granting entities into the Federal agency which manages the program.

            The overwhelming majority of UPS employees and leadership are surely innocent, yet we all have a feeling babies and children are sometimes shipped in boxes.

           <p>
            Well yes, they probably are but they either have it blocked off in another area so no one sees anything or people are just too darn frightened to snitch.  This is the problem,  the stuff they do is so scary you just know people are scared out of their minds.

             More like they have certain people in place in facilities. Doubt the control all of UPS, but management and key employees are likely theirs.

             I know many people who have worked for UPS who I know are not aware that children are being shipped via UPS. Maybe there is a special crew used only for that purpose.

              Oh, I believe that to be true.  They have their own people, for this is a very dangerous prospect, also if they are seen, they know they will have to dispose of that person.  They cannot afford to be discovered.  By now, they are awfully good at it.

             I agree, people are too afraid to tell.  And yes, boxes blocked off in another area.  And your comment made me think of this:  CIA black ops operatives working there, whose memories of some things at work are "blocked off" into another part of their mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the CIA and the FBI might have many people working there who do remember what (potentially) goes on, both black hats and white hats, who knows

              CIA does not have white hats. How could they? Think about it. FBI has some. The ones tasked with solving crimes not done by the cabal. But they are lower level. The FBI is trash overall however. They quashed the Finders cult investigations, covered for the state and agencies during 9/11 and murder people just like the CIA. Look into Jonathan Luna. They also are involved in False flags like 1st world trade center bombing, Oklahoma city bombing to name a few.

              There are Black CIA sites in all Large Cities.  They are pulling off all kinds of really vile and sick things there.  Homan Square in Chicago is one.  Who knows?  Maybe they get UPS deliveries there too.  Or from Amazon.  Also Fed EX and I remember reading that Google has Storage Container Barges and that one was going to dock at a shut down Army Base.  There is a lot of this going on all over the place.  They have been at this and organizing it for years.  All kinds of Foundations and Organizations.  Everyone of their friends has one.
