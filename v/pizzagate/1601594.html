It turns out I had said to something to him YEARS AGO about having doubts about the validity of the Camp Winna Rainbow and the Seva foundation\'s good intentions for children. All these years he held it against me silently. Because he feels protective of his/their/the &quot;culture&quot; at camp winnarainbowand like he knows Seva is doing good work restoring eyesight in women. Or people. Alot of tie dye hippies send thier kids to Wavy every year for the sake of tie dye and juggling. They get the broken family inner city kids for free. But who gets lucky them or the kids? Thats what im wondering.
 ....My friend getting nasty about the phrase pizzagate in the same breath as defending Seva and the Rex foundation, brought back my memory of why I had doubts at all. Ok I\'ll try to be brief...I was in the midst of being sued for custody of my child, 7 year old girl by her father who had at that time recently come out as &quot;transgender&quot; woman, a total surprise to me at the time. He was taking me to court on the regular and I was losing for some odd reason (Marin family court most corrupt in the world) anyways...perhaps cause he had the gaypower mojo and lots of money working for him/her. It was pretty weird. In anycase he/She wanted to take our girl to camp winnarainbow. I thought she was too young because he/she was actually working there as a job for Wavy Gravy and wouldn\'t be with our daughter most of the time. I was against it, and I knew he/She had to be pretty fucking deviant to have fooled me already as much as he had.  I felt super creeped out about it. so I went online. My first search off google probaby or maybe ask jeeves was : &quot;camp winnarainbow sucks&quot; because that\'s  how i used to check if there were  complaints listed about a company. Well the results were some bad reviews but also lots of sex stuff. Kid porn stuff like boys getting ducked and shit. It freaked me out. It was gay video stuff. I wish I took a screen shot of all the sex video stuff that said camp winnatainbow. I was just tripping when I found that stuff. I flashed back to the 1980s I had been in a car on a long trip listening to kpfa and Wavy Gravy was on the radio talking about Camp winnarainbow for adults, which happens right after the kid camp, but he was talking about it as if it were a great big orgy. I was laughing at the time, being a care free non judgemental small forrest creature that I am, but was remembering in horror when looking at all these porn video ads with camp winnarainbow name....i made copies of those pages by print out and gave them to the court  to justify my concerns and questions about Wavy Gravy and him having anything to do with children. I was very worried. After I showed those print outs to the court, my kids dad was fired from winnarainbow but they are all still friends. Wavy and his wife jahanra who used to be Bonnie somebody an actress from twilight zone. Perfect right?. They wrote a letter to me or to the court and me, i dont fucking remember, trying to bad mouth me,  they threatened to come after me legally. I can probably find the letter, but I thought, hmmm though doth protest too much, cause I really hadn\'t done anything but ask questions. But specifically I asked what are all these porn sites that seem related to camp winnarainbow? After that I got back on line searching out their funding or whatever. I\'m really not a trained researcher, but I was interested...Seva came up, the Aravind clinic in India...doing good things...for sex workers...It got so weird searching Seva, cause it seemed like the sex worker transgender thing was an agenda, it seemed like sex work counseling was an agenda, and women and girls in poverty too, and the eye clinic. (Organ harvesting had crossed my mind)  When I tried to talk about it. People shut me down like the afore mentioned exfriend. That was 2009, later 2011, searching just under my kid\'s  dad\'s girls name I found a porn site that actually belonged to him/her. He/She was selling porn off the internet, I showed it to deputies who made a report and had  investigators investigate especially because they looked like kids in the videos. The report is number 1258 thats all they ever told me after that.The report is confidential and I can\'t get my hands on it, and it\'s not illegal to sell porn. So the family court judge bev woods didn\'t give a shit if he is a fucking porn peddling he/she- who\'s got the money? That\'s all Beverley Woods cares about. Anyway just to say... here\'s this tranny porn sales guy, he\'s not smart enough to come up with any thing like a website, or any of that shit on his own, and he rolls with these people. They are connected. Culturally.</p>
<p>But now my memory is jarred...AIm sorry and its embarrassing to go this personal but..here I am having had my own child taken completely from me as eventually he/She won in court and he has FULL custody of my daughter and they\'ve (he/She and the smackn illegal court) got themselves a bogus restraining order against me as well for showing up at school to pick up my daughter on the wrong day of the court order. They called me a stalker! Though the police sergeant has written a one page report of the day I came to pick up my kid on rhe wrong day, and that I\'m not a stalker. The court writes it\'s own constitution every day. The tranny with the transgender agenda has admitted to wanting to make me pregnant to get the baby. He/she was helped along and supported in court the whole time and was supported in sweeping my custody thru there (all if it) by Wavy Gravy and wife Jahanra. Who would do That? What else are they capable of for their agenda?
 The last time I checked it seems all gone off the internet. Everything. Huge doubts remain about the goodness of Wavy Gravy and Camp Winnarainbow and Seva. Their letter to me and behaviour in representing for a sick man who only wanted to strip a mother of her daughter, only makes them more suspicious to me. What do you think?</p>
<p>PS I said &quot;exfriend&quot; because in order to protect his hippie culture this person also had an argument which left me speechless. I have nothing more to say to this person, unless I start screaming. He said pictures of children are/is not abusing children and that sex with children is not as bad as the real violence going on in the world. I dont know why he felt so strongly to talk like that, uncharacteristicly, perhapz because he had a toothache. Still. Not cool. Not even one photo.</p>',

             Hi I have my case file and last time i looked they had taken it soon themselves to copy off what they wanted into blue paper, and it's a lot. So those copies of screen shots i made to show tge court may be in there, they also mixed the family court file into the child support case file as that worked better for them. Thanks for responding I'm still learning how to even check messages here. But yeah, it was weird so, I'm glad it's surfacing.

            I am so sorry to hear of your nightmare in the family courts. I have volumes to speak on the subject in the Massachusetts courts myself. Its enough to actually drive you to the crazy that many parents wrongly use to gain illegal custody of our children isn't it? I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy let me tell you. I have so much to speak on this subject but for fear of sounding like a conspiracy nutter I have suffered in silence. My not being first to the phone as I called it meant losing custody of my now near 18 year old son. This ordeal started when he was 4. I spent tens of thousands of dollars and years fighting in the courts to get NOWHERE. its maddening and again I am so sorry you have experienced this. I think this is what makes me resolved to do WHATEVER I CAN FOR THESE KIDS...I wish I could have done more in my own situation but I will do whatever I can now. Child exploitation is PANDEMIC and cannot be ignored another day. Thank you for everyone here and all that you do!!

            Sister, hi. I'm very sorry to hear about your struggles with family court and the current biased uber liberal babylonian sex cult, bohemian grove phariseeic talmudic worshippers of the 'god' baal, lucifer, satan, nephilim.

            Many of us were swayed by the sex drugs and rock and roll of the grateful dead, kesey and the pranksters, and good ol' Hugh Nanton Romney, aka Wavy Gravy, who claim to have met Einstein at 5. The name Romney and meeting the most prominent mind in jewish science does not bode well already for Mr gravy.

            As you  might be able to tell Mrs. nameof, I am hoping to gain a few more details about what you are experiencing so that I can continue in the same vein as the prolific researcher bless his soul Dave McGowan.

            I suspect this is a front for human trafficking on some level. Seva deals with poor women and children.  I have seen other eye clinics tied in with Clinton Global Initiative in other poor third world countries.  For some reason CF/CGI love to work with the eye clinics.  Moonies are tied into these type of places as well.  Also, note in the right hand side bar the name Mouhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank.  He is in to microfunding loans.  So let's think about this.  People need their eye fixed or their child's eye fixed.  They take out a loan, which CGI and Yunus know they cannot repay so they put them into prostitution to repay the loan or give up the child as payment stating the child will have a better life with an education, housing, etc.  Think Whitewater with the Clintons.

             This page is Seva but doesn't really seem like it till the bottom.  They are in all the worst human trafficking places raising money 22million, to stop thehuman trafficking so they say. And eye clinic and hiv prevention too. This is supposed to be a good thing.

             Yes. Thinking about it for a minute is all what it takes. Because it is weird. The children's clown camp / adult clown camp...let alone an eye clinic in India specializing in helping girls in prostitution...gee. I felt like no one believed me to say the least.  thanks for writing back.

             I don't have links I'm just saying I did search in 2009 and found a lot of links about the work Seva was doing in India with the eye clinic and  sex workers getting help, in counseling and other programs and that it was women and girls... I was researching the camp winnarainbow. Seva benefits from the money from the camp... I think.

            Many of the accts that frequented pizza kids type vids, the really strange ones, had, through their like and post history, connections to camps. I'll have to search again to get exact names, but one was in Maine the other in Wisconsin. There was also talk of another camp on here about in Sonoma County (all I can remember since this is has been supernovae of info is that it was near something called goat rock, not the one at the beach.

             Ohhhhh shit.... I worked for a very Hollywood connected camp in Maine. I dunno why it just hit me, but we had a lot of famous kids rolling through that camp. I treated all of them like the normies they really are... And for the most part, everything seemed on the up and up. Occassional counselor debauchery, never involving kids though.
