            When people try to debunk Q, they point to Q saying Podesta/Hillary would be indicted. I have literally never seen anoyone offer the following as an explanation: Maybe he really is an insider and had bad intel about that.

             Hillary &amp; Podesta as well as McCain have already been indited. You don't think Obama really had "jury duty" do you? Podesta's agreement for turning themselves in was NO MSM coverage. I'm sure the others made the same deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we all know until the MSM actively covers a topic it doesn't exist in the minds of too many sheep. Can't tell you how many times I've had to tell the uninformed even on GLP that Hillary and McCain are not wearing unfashionable boots due to medical injuries. Those elderly Americans who've actually had their claimed medical problems have had a field day ridiculing these liars online.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like the man who claims to be "Juan Campos," and to be supposedly struggling with a cane for a broken leg after being shot, someone needs to give these faux actors realistic lessons in how to fake a medical condition when in public. Then again all of the frauds have given the rest of us enlightened ones endless amusement due to their ridiculous antics.

             You have absolutely no sympathy to someone who was physically, emotionally and sexually severely abused and obviously was acting out? Many starving people in the world have had to make terrible choices in order to survive. Most of those who've endured horrific abuse for years are too mentally messed up to hold a full-time job in the "real world."  It's worse if they started out in life with serious mental and physical health issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             My fav saying, "I will never criticize a man until I've walked a mile in his shoes."   Then again there are those in the world who are so emotionally screwed up that all they can ever do is to degrade others in a vain attempt to make themselves appear superior in their own delusional minds. Those are the "human beings" that are truly mentally ill. I really pity them. I pray for them to get healed.

             Barr was born in Salt Lake City, to a working-class Jewish family. She is the oldest of four children born to Helen (née Davis), a bookkeeper and cashier, and Jerome Hershel "Jerry" Barr, who[6] worked as a salesman.[7] Her father's family were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary and Lithuania, respectively.[6] Her paternal grandfather changed his surname from "Borisofsky" to "Barr" upon entering the United States.[7]

             Are you not aware that the prosecutor who seriously risked his life to prosecute one of the worst pedos, Jeffrey Epstein, was also of Jewish decent? That the woman who volunteered endless hours of her time to write a highly regarded and well-received book detailing the horrendous crimes of Eptein and his many backers was also Jewish?  No it wasn't ever published.
            </p>
            <p>
             This super skilled, altruistic Jewish author got endless praise from those major companies who had published other of her works. However they confessed higher ups didn't want to deal with death threats from TPTB including obviously the Clinton's. Even Vanity Fair who agreed to publish a book excerpt wanted "editing control." Meaning the resulting story would have been a total farce, and actually extremely complimentary to Epstein and his associates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why aren't you condemning the entire gay and bisexual community? There are far, far more non-hets in the world of entertainment than Jews. Also there are way, way more White people among the power players than in any other industry. So WHY aren't you saying the sickening pedos are all White? Just as ridiculous.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes I'm making a very big deal about this issue. Every time in the past when extreme pedo behavior has been brought up it's been sidelined to a "Jewish problem: or a "gay problem." Then the REAL tragedy is ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
             MSM will never risk major lawsuits unless the pedo scourge in the US and in the world is re-branded. TPTB in the world are NOT all of Jewish ancestry, anymore than they are all gay. Look at the very long lists I provided in the other thread. Guarantee you that the Medici's and Royal Families of the world are not of Jewish ancestry. Nor are any of the Popes. Nor are the Saudi's.

            <p>
             The info you provided there, was taken directly from
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr">
              the wikipedia entry for Roseanne Barr
             </a>
             ; I have to ask, why would you link some obscure site, instead of the wikipedia page which has the same info and possibly even more?

             How many thousands of international followers do you currently have? Of those, do the vast majority re-tweet what you state to many, many others who otherwise would be completely unaware? Even if they do it intending to dis Roseann Barr, it still spreads the word to many clueless "flyovers."  TPTB know Barr can easily get herself on the cover of Star and other low-level tabloids if she so chooses. Well maybe not the entire cover but enough to jump start the conversation.

              Killing the common man only silences one small voice in the sea of many. There is strength in numbers and being big enough to know how small we are. When someonr become famous and influential then may he beware.

            I love how she always speaks her mind. Some of the people on 4chan don't realize that Roseanne really talks likes this. Her and James Woods are great red pillers.

             Roseann Barr HATES Soros. She asked to follow me when I revealed numerous countries who almost equate Soros with the anti-Christ as he tried to wreck their economies. Russia and Putin included. Therefore Roseann would aggressively support anyone who in some way wanted to take Soros down or his rat lines.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition many align Roseann with the entire Jewish community not fully realizing there are drastic divisions. Most like Roseann seriously condemn anyone promoting the NWO, Satanism, the newly discovered by the "flyovers" of the previously under the radar antics of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cannot exaggerate to what degree even college graduates and professionals of all religions are completely clueless about anything not in the MSM. They're too focused on their demanding careers and raising a healthy family to understand even the meaning of the "NWO' and the possible implications for the world. Learning more about widespread child trafficking for snuff films and sales of body parts would be way too depressing for them to handle. Like the chance of war with NK or WW III it's long been an extreme fear that would only make Westerners feel even more powerless.

            I can see why.
           </p>
           <p>
            An 8chan anon pointed out the connection between harvey weinstein, pizzagate, and gamergate.
           </p>
           <p>
            It fucking blew my mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Randal Kleiser  who is a director, and Brock Pierce who is a production designer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock Pierce was arrested a while back with child porn, machetes, and guns. He escaped to spain, and founded IGE
           </p>
           <p>
            IGE is Internet gaming entertainment.
           </p>
           <p>
            IGE focused on trading online currencies in mmorpgs. Take a moment to understand this. An escaped pedo helped create an online currency trading platform that delt with online mmorpg currency. This is dangerous for several reasons: it gives them a convenient way to hunt and groom kids, and it gives them a means to launder money for child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the pizza and gamergate connection. The weinstein connection is a little shaky. These guys worked on flight of the navigator. The ship had boy lover symbols for the stairs, and was about kidnapping a boy in an alien space ship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gets worse, there may be a cia connection as well. I am still digging sources on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not sure if q was a larp, or if it was an misinformation attempt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fucking joke is on tpb either way: threads everywhere are being pumped with information and leaks. If it was misinformation, too much dox got out, if it is a real leak, well there is more salt for that wound.

             William Usher. One Angry gamer.  He's not a good guy. He was involved in Gamer Gate- (Self admitted disinfo) He Inserted his self Into pizzgate by getting the only interview with Dave flintstone...
            </h2>
            <p>
             Flintstones vanished after interview.... That interview was a joke- Nearly everytime William Usher opened his mouth- It was to spew disinfo- Or To discredit Mcsorley...
             <strong>
              Because of that interview- DAVE FLINTSTONE WAS LISTED AS DEBUNKED ON the WIKI-
 He's not debunked. He's still the biggest fucking aspect that no one's talking about.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             William Usher Also threatned me- Admittedly after I threatned him...
            </p>
            <p>
             And by
             <em>
              "threaten"
             </em>
             I mean; I said
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "I'm going to make it clear that you're as much of a problem as Dave Stone AKa FLINTSTONE is.... If you don't change your an entire article- Change it so its at least fucking accurate."  {Sic}
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He said No. And then Threatened to expose our conversation... To which I Said.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              " I Fucking dare you to, Retard" [Sic]
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And that's about the Jist of it.  I will be exposing William Usher With Dave Flintstone in the future. There's such much involving those two..
            </p>
            <p>
             Just thought I'd toss this in here since you mentioned GamerGate- Something I know almost nothing about- Other than WIlliam Usher AKA ONE ANGRY GAMERz INVOLVEMENT IN"

              I always wondered about this disinfo. Why did they have to push so hard? Why? It could have been written off as a consumer dispute, but they did not take this course of action.
             </p>
             <p>
              That made me look closer at gamergate. Originally i assumed it was fraud and tax evasion, which there was. But now as more and more stuff comes out, it appears that there was a lot more to it.

             I thought some of the DEN founders and lower-level assistants and/or contacts (see "Open Secret") quickly escaped to South America. Wouldn't be surprised if they "island hopped" in an attempt to go undercover. Of course they'd have access to the same financial backing that enabled DEN to be so profitable. We never found out about their secret filming of live porno which you must know by now obviously occurred.

             Most borderline legal operations have a hidden and extremely profitable sideline or two or three. Just as the real $$$ behind rap and hip-hop was national and international drug trafficking, laundering overseas mob and weapons profits, and promoting the existence of hot looking performers for foreign concerts with fringe benefits to the high level buyers. Just exactly how do you think the music industry and films are going to be financed if the rat lines and etc dry up? Investors and ad buyers offering tie-in promotions have always expected "interest payments" in advance to seal the deals.

               That's because there have been so many, many rumors of a future unsettled financial market and thus gold and stock prices and all of the repercussions. Yes there were those that were suspicious of Trump's economic policies.
              </p>
              <p>
               DNC took advantage of the situation and tried to destroy Trump by claiming HE was the one who "impulsively acted like a 3-year old, and was very  likely to push the button activating nuclear weapons and WW III."  There were increased MSM articles on the Liberal elite and their "bug out" plans, buying not just vacation homes in New Zealand but private jets and permanent living quarters in top luxury yachts. (links provided if requested)
              </p>
              <p>
               Ironically this led to a financial windfall for everyone pushing any kind of doomsday survival alternatives especially for the top 1%. Sellers of top luxury underground bunkers?
              </p>
              <p>
               Daily I received emails of how the stock market was going to crash, major banks would default, and the RE market plunge. The only alternative to total devastation according "to the experts" was to follow their lead and heavily invest in bitcoin and its competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously the above is all a crock and Pres Trump has actually improved the economy overall. Perhaps that's one of the reasons the Deep State is pushing for direct US involvement in a major war, and not just a proxy war, anywhere. Still here stories in the MSM about the return of the draft where women, including those who are married with children but are under 35 are not exempt.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again ironic as it was Hillary with Soros's heavy influence due to being a top financial backer that sought war with Russia. Putin has put a "death sentence" on the billionaire for trying to wreck Russia's economy. Hillary supporters had long advocated an Equal Opportunity draft for both sexes. Some say that's why open immigration was encouraged as most American teens are way, way too out-of-shape to qualify for the military. They'd have to be sidelined to non-combat positions.

                President Trump has been doing wonderfully with regards to diplomacy with difficult countries like China. I'm proud of him! The draft with women is definitely a leftist plot to further damage our children. You want to draft dads AND moms, now? Why? I smell a rat. Nevermind the fact that women have no business in combat, any man will tell you. 😰

                I was listening to Infowars since around August 2016, so I know all about the increased descriptions of all the "fleeing elites" and "economic doomsday" (which they knew was going to happen under Hillary, but they wanted to blame Trump for it), so no need for any links there.

              IGE focused on trading online currencies in mmorpgs. Take a moment to understand this. An escaped pedo helped create an online currency trading platform that delt with online mmorpg currency. This is dangerous for several reasons: it gives them a convenient way to hunt and groom kids, and it gives them a means to launder money for child porn.

              Thomas Wictor thinks this is "voluntary," that she has a show coming out and the studio told her to stop making waves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or maybe this incident that gets us talking about her is part of the promotion. Who knows? I think it's more likely that she was told to STFU.
