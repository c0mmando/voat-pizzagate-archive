            How 'bout this.  Two seconds after you mention this, you are jumped all over.  Versus, any evidence what so ever of why this is a fallacy?  Huh?  This is obviously something connected to 'spiritual' something or other.  Obviously connected to something the elites so desparately desire.  Something they obviously want to hush while simutaneously promote in symbolism.  Which makes me thing something is there, there.

            Found this, which just proves the pineal gland has hormones.  They experimented with it on animal to animal and found they could make them grow up faster.  Which we all know, they do this to make calves grow faster.  We all want hormone free food, well at least most do.  They think that little girls mature younger now, due to the hormones in milk.  Girls would get periods at first around 15 yrs.  Now some are in grade school.  So we are all eating hormones in our food.  I remember an Absolutely Fabulous episode where Edwina's mother gets her estrogen, she and her friends take them, and then they are partying like young girls and flirting with their man friend, lol.  I dunno.  If one were to take a whole packette of birth control, would they get some kind of buzz or just be horribly sick?

            tyfdt, thank you for editing. I am removing the edit flair, and replacing it with our "Possible Disinfo" flair. Neon Revolt has jumped the shark here and dived into the pineal gland narrative that has been regularly flogged by suspicious accounts on this board since the Podesta emails first leaked. You will notice that everything he presents is hearsay. The penguin pineal gland email is the only piece of objective evidence presented, and there is no attempt to investigate other possible scientific uses for these, who ordered them or why -- a glaring absence. There is also no linked support for his many claims about Skull and Bones, gold as "mana" and other wild claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could remove this under Rule 2 (lack of empirical support), but instead will flair and leave up because I think it's important for folks to know that Neon Revolt is pushing a shill narrative. A SearchVoat.co search of key words like "pineal" "adrenochrome" and "kuru" will show the hundreds of deleted disinfo submissions scores of suspicious alts have spammed this board with over the past year and a half. Our suspicion is that they are attempting to bury a real bio-hack (probably related to longevity) that they wish to discredit.

             See, I don't think drinking blood is going to do a whole lot for anyone.  Our stomach acid would just eat it up.  But think about human growth hormones, people do use that to lose weight, they don't feel as hungry, they feel a bit 'younger' I mean more energy.  This pineal gland, it houses some powerful hormones so even though I don't have a link to anyone discussing taking it, it makes a lot more sense than this blood thing.  Hormones are powerful, they use those in birth control pills, for women going through menopause, women trying to get pregnant and those treatments are orally administered.
            </p>
            <p>
             The penguin thing, those creatures live in a land of extended sun times and dark times, the web tells us that their pineal glands are extra developed due to the longer exposure to sun.  I posted evidence that black people are less likely to have calcified pineal glands, there genetic make up, with more melatonin, more sun exposure, makes their pineal glands stronger/healthier than caucasions.

             I've thought and thought on why would they want Haitian children?  I was thinking organ transplants.  King whatever needs a liver.  But that seems logistically unproductive since transplants have to be certain donor types, very specific so taking a whole slew of kids doesn't really make sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I'm wondering why were those particular kiddos so valuable?  Why did they go through all that trouble to take them in particular.  If this pineal 'spiritual intense drug experience' gland has any credence at all, then it all makes sense.  Why they wanted this race of children.  Being so close to that horrible island.  Where the elites go to do horrible things.  In that horrible temple.  To do satanic acts.

             Q said when we find out what happened in Haiti, no black person would ever vote democrat again.  Hillary and Bill went to Haiti on their honeymoon and attended a voodoo whatever.
            </p>

             It all kind of 'fits'.  The tunnel pictures where it appeared they were harvesting 'something'.  Wasn't it in the head?

              If you had bothered to research this even slightly so as to provide the links our rules require, you would know that this statement is not accurate. The only hormone produced in the pineal gland is melatonin. And there are far more concentrated sources of melatonin available at Costco than you can get from a snacking on fresh toddler pineals.

              Different hormones, produced by different organs -- and all of the examples you mention are possible only with highly concentrated manufactured pharmaceuticals, NOT chomping on ovaries or pituitary glands, for the same reason you surmise the "blood drinking" theory is unlikely.

            Racial differences have been noted in the rate of pineal calcification as seen in plain skull radiographs. In Caucasians, calcified pineal is visualized in about 50% of adult skull radiographs after the age of 40 years (Wurtman et al, 1964); other scholars argue that Caucasians, in general, may have rates of pineal gland calcification as high as ­60-80% (King, 2001). Murphy (1968) reported a radiological pineal calcification rate of 2% from Uganda, while Daramola and Olowu (1972) in Lagos, Nigeria found a rate of 5%. Adeloye and Felson (1974) found that calcified pineal was twice as common in White Americans as in Blacks in the same city, strengthening a suspicion that there may be a true racial difference with respect to this apparatus. In India a frequency of 13.6% was found (Pande et al, 1984). Calcified pineal gland is a common finding in plain skull radiographs and its value in identifying the midline is still complementary to modern neuroradiological imaging.

            Pineal Gland is key to the whole puzzle
TLDR: Elite are consuming live pineal glands from children, to experience the ultimate “high”. When we talk about adrenochrome from children’s blood, we are only partially right. The adrenochrome is in wide use among elites, but is only half of the secret, as the live pineal glands have remained an important part of spiritual human history. Eating the dead flesh, or better yet, live flesh of the pineal gland causes activation of the pineal gland (aka, reptile eye), allowing the user to see, and experience a connection to the universe not achievable otherwise.
