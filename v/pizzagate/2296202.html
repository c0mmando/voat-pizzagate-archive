<p>Just wanted to remind everybody we are fighting the good fight against nearly insurmountable odds. Yet here we are. - I don\'t do shit really. I\'m a cheerlurker. - But you know, while we should never get cocky, - feels like we\'ve had a hell of a lot of winning lately. - I saw a link to this BBC article from earlier in the year, started scrolling through the comments. LOL there are some real fucking gems in there. - Sure feels like we\'ve got a lot of allies out there. - The appearance of Q, ... the major happenings lately? - First time it\'s felt like Christmas in a long time to me. - Never give up. Never see any faces here, - but ya feel things. - You guys all keep it up. Whatever it is you do, do it well, and keep doin it. I don\'t wanna live in a world where irreparably damaging children - future adults, our own species, - is the norm. Fuck these pedos, these sick misguided and deluded sycophants, -  fight em with everything you got. Can\'t think of another mammalian species that ...that puts up with this shit the way we do... have we been just totally conditioned into an inevitable extinction? - I don\'t think so... (Imagine Tyler Durden takes it from here for a few bars). Ever since this shit opened up, ever since I\'ve been lurking around here, listening, looking, watching, - I think the real illusion, is that there are more of them than there are of us. That their &quot;normal&quot; is normal. That their &quot;right&quot; is right. - No way. - The facade is crumbling, and everybody in here is partly responsible for it. - Except the shill fucks that joined 10 hours ago and start talking shit about situations involving people they\'ve never even heard of.  HAHA - Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everybody. - Thanks for giving me a place to be.</p>',

           <p>
            It started with her watching The Crown on Netflix and learning the scandals of the royal family over the years. I started telling her about Amazon and all the things that I had learned early on in my own PG research. If you're wondering (since it is such an easy and relatable way to tell someone about corruption/creepiness) the post is

            Over the weekend, saw some family friends and although they have not really seen what is going on, they did say a cousin of ours is completely "woke" to what is going on.  What is so "weird" is that he worked in construction the last eight or so years. Guess what he found odd?  That they were working on old Walmart buildings that had been mothballed.  He'd ask who was getting this space ready to move into-  no one knew.  Then, he started doing research. Heard about the Weiner laptop last year right before election-knew the things he saw people posting went back to the weird Walmart set-ups.  Knew that if she had won, guns would be confiscated, people who resisted her would go to camps(old Walmart buildings).  Many still think that we are crazy and are making stuff up just for kicks.  Nope, something really was going on.  So, we do need to keep our eyes on what is going on in Chicago-with Nato troops and trucks there and all their globalist rhetoric spouting from there.  Since when do we need  outside forces to clean up a crime-ridden city?  So, know that people have confirmed things going on.  And, we need to watch what is happening in Chicago.  (And, also, our cousin said, if you think the tunnels that you hear about is just made up conspiracy theory stuff, you are wrong.  If you think its weird and doesn't look right, you are right. Something is up with those tunnels.)

             Definitely, seems as though there really has been a plan to overturn things in in the US. Hell, of all the rumors Id heard the Walmart rumor actually seems plausible! I mean the family behind the company itself is evidence enough, the other details could still be ignored. They definitely had a plan to roll a bunch of people up and throw em in there. Haven’t heard too much directly from BO. A lot of the happenings lately suggest that he may be in some pretty deep shit. I hope that fucker gets nailed to the wall for everything he’s done. Trump’s claim that he isnt really even a US citizen may yet have real teeth. Perhaps that’s the info that will”have 99% of the public rioting in the streets” - We can only hope.

"Are WalMart's satanist Waltons involved in the trafficking of children?"

             "Starting about the late 1970s, the Rockefeller banks, such as the First National of Chicago, now to confuse people re-named Bank One, began loaning billions and billions of dollars to mainland China. The promise was that Red China would pay back with gold from their western provinces. BUT, China did not allow in any inspectors to determiine if there is that much gold there to be used to re-pay the loans. Instead, China has been allowed to pay back with “China White” flooding into the U.S. All the while the pressfakers keep falsely saying that most of the dope is coming from Colombia."

            <p>
             "In the 1980s, the CIA was shipping through the southern states, guns to Central America, and return trips of dope. Some originating in Colombia and a few other places. It was centered around a small community in western Arkansas, Mena, and the Mena Airport. The Riadys bought the tiny First National Bank of Mena reportedly as a laundry vehicle to the Chicago markets. [Visit our extensive website stories about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.] With the aid of the Rockefellers and through the Riadys, reportedly billions of dope dollars traveled this route."

              Yes, trying to do this under the radar.  Watch Obama's library in Chicago, too.  None of his papers, records, any other "real" stuff about him, but, playgrounds and bouncy houses?  Just weird.
