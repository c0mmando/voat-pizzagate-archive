            , for the sake of real SRA survivors, can you add a line at the beginning of this submission noting that your headline is inaccurate? Farmer is not an "SRA victim", much as she'd like everyone to think so. I'm giving this the "Accuracy in Question" flair in the meantime.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the skies are Farmer’s attorneys, including Sigrid McCawley and Edwards, who are painted as cherubs. Edwards touches a floating paintbrush, since he encouraged her to pursue art again. Because, she says, he was an advocate when Epstein’s exploitation of children didn’t provoke national outrage. “It was very unpopular to care about us and he cared anyway,” she said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article also says Maxwell is in a bubble, not an ouroboros, and the guy in the middle with peacock feathers is Wexner.

            Sorry, but Maria Farmer is no SRA victim. She worked for Epstein when she was an adult, and then after working for him about a year or so, got assaulted by him and Maxwell. She says they also abused her younger sister.

            "ENHEIM" is probably "Guggenheim" with the first part of the word behind the paintbrushes on the table.

            I counted four owls. Two on the right, two on the left over by Trump.

            I noticed peacocks were an important theme. The central image is a guy's head with a peacock tail behind it -- the NBC logo, perhaps?

            I'm giving this the NSFW flair, since it's a pretty nasty depiction of victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Farmer aligning herself with Epstein victims when she catered to his pedovore taste in art recommending those paintings of kids? This looks like profiteering to me.

             This petition
            </a>
            calls for Eileen Guggenheim to be removed as the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the New York Academy of Art. Epstein was on the Board of Trustees for seven years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maria Farmer had sold a painting to a German buyer for $12,000. Guggenheim told her she had to sell it to Epstein for $6,000, saying “‘You will be selling to them. They are great benefactors of the academy and you are going to make them happy. Do you understand?'” Epstein had told Maria that “if I sold him one of my paintings for half price he would help me with my career.” Farmer ultimately relented. and agreed to the reduced fee of $6,000 and “embarrassingly” informed the German collector that she was mistaken and the painting had already sold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guggenheim then took Maria to Epstein's ranch with some other students, where Epstein and Maxwell handed out prosthetic breasts and told the students to put them on.   Epstein offered to provide Farmer studio space to work on a series of paintings for the set of the film As Good As It Gets. He arranged for her to travel to the Ohio mansion of his associate, Leslie Wexner, and his wife Abigail. While there, Epstein and Maxwell sexually assaulted her. The next morning she called Eileen Guggenheim and told her what happened. “I was sobbing and said Epstein and Maxwell are sick people and I think I could have been raped,” Farmer said. In response, Guggenheim allegedly “blamed me and mocked me.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Guggenheim had Maria do a painting of her daughter and paid her only $3,000, when Maria's paintings were getting about $20000 each. She used Maria is an unpaid babysitter and a housecleaner, and got Maria to clean her sister's apartments  on the Upper East Side and on Central Park South.

             I thought this petition was great, until Kirby Sommers added claims about NBC exect Steve Burke to it, which are unsubstiated, based on a hoax.
            </p>
            <p>
             She changed the text after many, many people had already signed it, and they don't even know what they are supporting now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kirby Sommers (not her real name, btw.) and fishy ex-cop Mark Dougan tried to convince everybody that they had evidence of Burke raping a child.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then it turned out the footage didn't show a man raping a child, but two adult actors in a Spanish porn clip (the woman is clearly of age, and has a couple of tattoos).
            </p>
            <p>
             As of today, Kirby insists that this is footage from an Epstein blackmail video, and labels everyone who disagrees 'a troll' and a 'bad actor'. This is nuts. Especially since the pman and the woman in the video are of age, and are speaking Spanish, and because the video has been on the clearnet for ten years or so.
            </p>
            <p>
             She even outed someone as a survivor, who told her in confidence that he is an abuse victim.

              It’s worth noting that the video she ran with claiming to be Steve Burke via alleged Epstein files was screen captured from online porn. Instead of retracting, Kirby doubled down, blocking all who questioned her false narrative"

            <p>
             TL;DR - please do not sign this petition as long as the false claims about the porn video are on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please stay away from Kirby Sommers, she has done great harm to survivors and the citizen investigator community.

               I read yesterday evening that Farmer has reached out to Kirby Sommers, and asked her to remove the Steve Burke paragraph from the petition. Not sure whether Sommers will comply, though.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maria Farmer and Virginia Roberts-Giuffre need to severe ties to Kirby Sommers in order to stay credible. Sommers has caused so much damage already.

            You won’t be able to recognize any victims because this painting was not done by an actual SRA victim.

           <p>
            It was done by a former artist in residence for the Wexner’s and Epstein. She was imprisoned, sexually harassed, starved and was threatened with death, but she did not take part in any child sacrifice ceremonies.

              Maria Farmer was hired at age 25 as an 'art consultant' by Epstein, and also worked as his receptionist in his NYC mansion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then, when she was 26 and wanted to leave, to work on a project, they persuaded her to move to Ohio, to Leslie and Abigail Wexner's mansion, and become their 'artist in residence'.
             </p>
             <p>
              She was hardly ever allowed to go out, there were snipers in the bushes, and after three months, Epstein and Maxwell came over, and sexually assaulted her.

                I think it is not as simple as that. She painted underage girls in underwear and highs stockings and gave the paintings to Epstein when she applied for the job.
               </p>
               <p>
                She recommended a painter to him, and Epstein bought one of his paintings - little girls in bikinis.
               </p>
               <p>
                She saw cp art on the walls of Epstein's Florida mansion, but  continued working for him. And as a receptionist, she witnessed the daily stream of girls from age 12 into his house.
               </p>
               <p>
                She only reported him when she and her sister got attacked by Epstein themselves, not before.
               </p>
               <p>
                I still think she has been very brave nevertheless, but parts of her story don't add up.

                 She was probably thinking about her future income. She may have felt discomfort about Epstein's penchant for little girl art but stayed silent because of not wanting to bite the hand that fed her. Perhaps when it affected her personally and  she was attacked, she decided to speak out. I don't know what was in her mind but I suppose I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.  In the world of the uber-rich you come across some pretty weird shit.   In any event, I feel sorry for her now that she has cancer.

                  Yes, exactly. But I don't know whether she really felt discomfort, since she even produced this kind of art herself.

                  Now she lashes out at everybody who dares to question her narrative.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  She is still brave for going to the authorities, and I also feel sorry for her because of her illness.

                  But sometimes things are not as black and white as people want us to believe they are.
