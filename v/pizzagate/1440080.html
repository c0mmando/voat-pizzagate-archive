           I saw the post where it was discussed about things off topic being posted, and people reposting old material. I figure I'm doing some of it. This investigation into pizzagate has many topics. I will name some. My suggestion is to create subverses- of each area of research and post them at the side so that people will post similar things together and search more easily.

            I think we need to also focus on how to present this information to people outside our generation. If all these little details and facts were being run on the MSM, nobody would be doubting this at all.
           </p>

            I told my mother that it was important to be aware of this and to do research. She replied to me to stop wasting her time with "fake news". Made me want to throw up. This shit is right in front of our eyes. This shouldn't be a hard battle, the physical implications and evidences are all there, hundreds of times over. We have to find how to bridge the gap in people minds that just doesn't want to believe this, and believes they can rely on the MSM to tell them what is real or not.

             And I will add this: -- There is such corruption that -- they won't take it easy if they are caught up in this. George Soros is known for sinking whole countries with his currency manipulations. He is known to fund mercenaries to start civil wars in countries. People die and come up missing who can testify about these things. This monster is huge. Perhaps we can shine the light of truth bright enough on those things we know are factual -- and bring about changes in our world that will eliminate the problems, if not the people who commit them.

             I think that there are some things that msm can cover that are just plain facts. The Podesta brothers' art collections, for instance. BUT BUT BUT -- when this whole thing starts to really break out -- when the implications of those outright facts lands on EVIDENCE of crimes -- it will be hard to control. It will be sort of like turning on a car, and finding it suddenly speeding out of control. The rumors will get mixed up with the facts, and it will be hard to assimilate all of it. This is an ugly thing we are investigating, and we need facts to have it mean anything. -- I think someone will do a breakout story soon enough. It sells papers, and many newspapers are struggling to survive.

            I'd recommend storing verifiable facts on a wiki like infogalactic. An off-forum library has the advantage of being clique agnostic, we can pool facts with any other social media platform...
