<p>RACINE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TRICA HANSON DISMISSES 13 CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CONVICTED CHILD ABUSER FROM RACINE!!! RESIDENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EQUALLY SHOCKED AND DISMAYED!</p>
<p>Newly elected Racine District Attorney Tricia Hanson has shockingly dismissed 13 counts in total, including four counts of battery by prisoner, four counts of disorderly conduct, and two counts of criminal damage to property which allegedly took place on Dec. 22, 2016 against Racine resident Luis C. Granados Jr.</p>
<p>In a shocking statement made by Hanson to the Racine Journal Times, she had this to say, “Luis was and remains, I believe, a very difficult inmate. He has a lot of antisocial behaviors. He was very difficult to manage at the jail. And, at the point in time when those cases got dismissed, he was actually going back and forth from the prison system” Hanson said.</p>
<p>Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling told the Journal Times Tuesday that he was “appalled” to learn the charges against Granados were dismissed, stating that jail staff are used to dealing with violent inmates.</p>
<p>In July of 2016, Kelly Gallaher-Dimler, of Racine, filed complaints Wednesday with the Office of Special Counsel’s Hatch Act Unit in Washington. The Hatch Act, passed in 1939, limits the political actions of federal employees and employees of local agencies that accept federal money, such as police departments. Hanson said she thought she had removed all of the relevant posts, but overlooked a few on her Instagram page.“It was an inadvertent error,” Hanson said. “I took everything else down, I just didn’t know they were still there.&quot; Penalties for violating the Hatch Act can include loss of federal funding and employment.</p>
<p>And even more troubling issues for DA Hanson when the recent sentencing for a Racine man Tarance L. Bryant, convicted of killing 43-year-old Lakethia Richardson in a hit-and-run crash in the winter of 2014 was postponed following a mix-up regarding terms of the defendant’s plea agreement. The 34-year-old Bryant had been slated to be sentenced on those charges during a hearing but the process was stopped in its tracks when Racine County Deputy District Attorney Tricia Hanson mistakenly offered a prosecution’s recommendation for how much prison time Bryant should be given.</p>
<p>“This is entirely my fault,” Hanson said.</p>

            There is only one news outlet that is controlled by the corporations that keep it barely afloat. It is owned by a corrupt organization in the Quad Cities along the ratline from Chicago and Racine over to Iowa. They are all involved and complicit. There is a heavy level of propaganda and censorship, and the people are generally afraid to speak out because they know the area is run by corrupt elite, the mafia and secret societies. Every politician in Racine is compromised and the few who speak up have their lives ruined. The latest three examples were Ed Diehl, Keith Fair, and Eric Marcus.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have all been caught and one case federal RICO case was about to expose much more until it was railroaded through collusion, fraud, perjury, extortion, embezzlement, blackmail, bribery and other crimes to force a settlement which the plaintiffs are disputing they never agreed to, and the criminal RICO investigation was escalated to the top levels at the FBI and DOJ where Comey, McCabe,  Kadzik and Lynch obstructed the investigations once they found out what corporations, politicians and foundations were involved, including the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no justice in Wisconsin. The DA was a corrupt alcoholic (see other posts about his own scandal and cover up), the city and county attorneys are corrupt (one just retired to hide his involvement), the local judges are all corrupt and involved (see the mysterious death of Judge Dennis Barry), the local authorities are incompetent and paid off with bribes, military and surveillance toys, and increased budgets, and most judges in the state are part of the Marquette Mafia and secret societies including the state Attorney General. They are all freemasons and part of other groups such as Knights of Pythias and Knights of Malta.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot wait for slow justice. The only answer is to force real change by telling the world the truth about Racine, Wisconsin and how it is a model and main root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             This is very important and very connected to the bigger picture. Also look at incarceration rates for black males, infant mortality rates, human trafficking rates, a deep history of the KKK in Racine, and rigged insider deals with private shell companies formed with corrupt politicians to gain huge contracts for the prison industry and educational institutions. One such company is Kranz Inc which is tied to Bill Clinton and Les Aspin among many other major players involved.

             There is much more to this. They are deeply involved with the bigger picture involving Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias and Council of 13 through their business associations including Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, McCain Foundation, Dow, DuPont, Bayer, Monsanto, Cargill, ConAgra and many others in the circle of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
            </p>

             Look at the international locations. They are in every major trafficking hub - Haiti, Pakistan, Bulgaria, Belgium, Norway, Kazakhstan, Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the net worth is not even close to accurate. Combined they are over 30 billion on record, but in reality it is much, much more due to a lot of hidden wealth, patents, partnerships and other assets (such as art - see how they were involved in the beginning of the Art in Embassies program).
            </p>
            <p>
             The world needs to know the real truth about Racine, Wisconsin and how it is a main Root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             Every single one of them you listed, and many more, are involved in the circle of corruption that controls Racine. If they do not play along, they are removed from power. Many are in the freemasons and other secret societies, and several you listed such as Robin Vos and Van Wanggard are involved in rigged insider deals to give contracts to shell companies involving local industries including the prisons and educational system.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DA finally had to resign due to public outcry about his drunk hit and run scandal that all others listed above and some other players were directly involved in covering up. The city attorney also resigned because of that, and many others who got too sloppy have since resigned including the corrupt criminal mayor and his cousin the city administrator. The last mayor who was friends with the current mayor and those listed above was arrested on pedo crimes only after it could not be swept under the rug, the last police chief had to resign after being declared untrustworthy by the court system for false testimony, the county executive had to resign but was rewarded with positions on the local chamber and with a promotion to a top spot at SC Johnson, several city council members had to resign when their racist and corrupt emails started to appear in the RICO discovery, and the last city administrator also resigned after sexual assault allegations and then tried to commit suicide after moving to Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The entire area is controlled by a few major employers, corrupt churches, secret societies and the mafia.

               They are do as they are told. All real estate transactions in the area are inside deals with kickbacks for friends and associates. Many empty buildings are controlled by the city and corrupt real estate and development groups, and many properties are behind on taxes, but they are very selective about who they go after for property taxes. Many officials engaged in criminal corruption owe back taxes and are blackmailed into going along with the agenda to avoid having to pay their taxes.

             Shine the light on Racine and we will expose the real truth to the world about who controls us and what their real agenda is. Sustainability is not about sustainability for us, it is about sustainability for them. Agenda 2030 is one main part of the bigger plan, and it goes beyond that.
            </p>
            <p>
             What Ronald Bernard said is all true, and it links back to Pilgrims Society, Black Nobility, Kabbalah, and the Council of 13. Racine, Wisconsin is a weak link to the entire system, and they are afraid of it being exposed. Do not underestimate them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine, Wisconsin is a main "root" to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Once the world knows about Racine, we can move to the next stage, and it isn't "no one goes to jail". The people need to rise up before it is too late and before they control us all through AI. This is a race between the Truth and AI, and a war between Good and Evil.

               Artificial Intelligence. Right now the people control the numbers by the billions, however once AI takes form, there is an infinite number of bots that can control, censor, attack and drown out any unwanted truths. Bots, drones, robots and surveillance will keep the masses in check, with no one able to question the infinite knowledge of a supreme AI being.
