            I don't see much benefit into memes and such for me personally, that is because they cause me to be confused about what the intention is: is the creator politically motivated? Is it bias? Propaganda?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is about 99% theory and allegations, which makes it very difficult to determine the facts and to see the full extent of the scandal (for someone like me). I think there should be alternative spins on pizzagate: catchy memes to go viral, blogs where people discuss their observations, and a place where all confirmed facts are summarized and updated (so a wiki which I would personally see rather and I think would benefit a lot of people who don't want to spend so much time researching).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, yes, memes can spread awareness, but the mainstream will immediately be thinking of it as nothing more than just a meme when it seems the only available attempts to summarize the pizza gate are unprofessional bits of information on different independent sources, where as the "trusted/professional/credible" sources, the establishment and mainstream media would also shun people looking into the credibility of the real pizzagate disclosure movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been times in which social media were flooded before with political/outrageous news and memes, and it didn't really change anything because there was a lack of real momentum, in what I think is the result of a lack of factual presentation. The counter reaction is the birth of the term "fake news", which is now ironically abused to discredit pizzagate. So, we should have both: a place for people who want to understand how real pizzagate is without the research, plus the memes to spread the word and gain momentum.
           </p>
           <p>
            These things should namely not be a source of doubt. Everybody should agree on pizzagate and the facts that are already known. No person should agree with what is proven that happens.  The damage of a people who are ignorant of hugely corrupt scandals is that they will remain in denial and might even side against the movement for truth. The Germans were unaware of extermination camps, just like the Americans and the world are mainly unaware of organized child sex slavery for the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be interesting to see the outcome compared to an ignorant people as opposed to an informed people, mainly for the effect of immediate justice, so I hope that people start to join in the resistance, which might need some degree of organization. Before this we must use the tools to inform everyone, and in my opinion that requires facts.  At least we have the tools. Use them.

             I can get behind most of that. I do think memes are also important, though. The fact is, Wikileaks revealed how politically corrupted the MSM is. The MSM launched a massive unified cointell campaign against PizzaGate. I honestly don't believe we have the power to ever push past it. They are trying to frame it as a bunch of American "white nationalists", who are uneducated and saw a few "fake news" articles (possibly from an all-powerful Russia propaganda effort). I think we need to start reaching other demographics who simply don't want to know anything about PizzaGate. A whole bunch of back doors, basically. I'm going to aim for hipster art scene because that's where I am. I think if people just start doing it using unpizza related hashtags, we can get more of an osmosis thing going on.

              this is very personal in my opinion memes make the things seem less credible. however it sparks curiosity, and everyone who is curious enough to do some fact checking should have some kind of central place to fall back on and tell others "See I'm not crazy, Look for yourself." That's why the little knowledge I have write articles to the wiki, which unfortnately needs more people with a journalistic level of investment. If we want the movement to grow there must be a professoinal, surface level representation.

                I'm going to make an appeal right now for contributions. People are probably stoked to share their results of the investigation. Importantly, memes tend to get forgotten over time, the just linger around for a while and that's it. I will forget about 99% about the current state Pizzagate investigatoin is now in, unless it is all stored in a place I can always look it up.
               </p>
               <p>
                By all means, this would work the best if there were memes as well scattered among the general public, but the wiki is still far from being representative. We'll get there
