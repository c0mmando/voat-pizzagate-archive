<p>PUBLIC SCHOOL BRAINWASHING</p>
<p>One of my children told me that the his elementary school had President\'s Day trivia this year in which one of the questions was about HILLARY CLINTON (implying that they wanted students to think of her as a President of the U.S. or at least revere her as such) and when he mentioned to his friends that that was wrong to have a question about her related to President\'s Day, everyone around him started talking about how much better she is than Trump. (He couldn\'t remember what the question was.)</p>
<p>My son\'s junior high school is pushing the <strong>fake news agenda</strong>, making him read <strong>factcheck.org</strong>, a project of the Annenburg Foundation... </p>

<p>COLLEGE</p>
<p>Here is an actual &quot;Fake News&quot; Assignment handed out to college students by a college professor - yes people, this is the way our public schools of higher education are passing propaganda onto the students with the main goal being to brainwash millenials. </p>
<p>Fake News Versus Real News</p>
<p>At this point in the semester, we\'re starting to think about source material for our essays. Indeed, for your next two essays you will integrate source material. But before we get into the nuts and bolts of documenting sources, we need to start with the basics: like separating fact from fiction.</p>
<p>When students first begin researching a topic for an essay, they invariably start by &quot;googling&quot; the topic on the Web and then searching the results for information. But how do you know the information you\'re getting is accurate?  Well, you can begin by narrowing your focus to academic sources. (More on that in a later module). But in this instance, when the World Wide Web is your playground, how do you determine what\'s fake and what\'s real?</p>
<p>Frankly, fake news is a problem today, and without sounding hyperbolic, many academics, politicians, and business leaders believe it\'s a legitimate threat to democracy. The problem becomes particularly acute when those in power begin citing sources that are inaccurate or just deliberately false. So what\'s a citizen to do? Well, the responsibility falls to you to ferret out falsehoods. You can choose to be an informed citizen or a stooge.</p>
<p>To that end, the three articles below will help you put fake news into context. The first illustrates where some fake news originates. (Hint: the reporter\'s findings might surprise you). The second article provides some tools for self-checking your news sources, and the last article delves into the topic of why certain people are duped by fake news stories.</p>
<p>After reading the articles, you will write a 300-word discussion post.</p>
<p>Here are the articles:</p>
<p>We Tracked Down a Fake-News Creator in the Suburbs.  Here\'s What We found.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs">http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs</a> (Links to an external site.)</p>
<p>Fake or Real? How to Self-Check the News and Get the Facts</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/05/503581220/fake-or-real-how-to-self-check-the-news-and-get-the-facts">http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/12/05/503581220/fake-or-real-how-to-self-check-the-news-and-get-the-facts</a> (Links to an external site.)</p>
<p>Is Education Tied to Conspiracy Theory Beliefs?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/12/05/504388777/educations-tie-to-conspiracy-theory-belief">http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/12/05/504388777/educations-tie-to-conspiracy-theory-belief</a> (Links to an external site.)</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will write an initial 200-word discussion post; the post can be in response to one of the questions below, two of the questions, or all three. You will then write a 100-word post in response to one of your classmates.  (That\'s 300 words total).</p>
<p>I don\'t have to remind you that civility matters in your responses. In today\'s contentious political environment, fake news carries with it some passionate political views. Be mindful and respectful.</p>
<p>1.) In the first article, the reporter tracked down a fake news writer. What surprised you, if anything, about the business of fake news? The article offers suggestions to curtail the spread of fake news, such as limiting access to advertising dollars. Do you think that\'s a good idea?  Why or why not?  In general, how might we limit the proliferation of fake news?</p>
<p>2.) From where do you get your news?  How do you know the news you\'re getting is accurate?  The second article outlines steps anybody can take to ferret out fake news. What other suggestions do you have for unmasking fake news? </p>
<p>3.) The third article delves into the psychology of human behavior as it relates to conspiracy theories. Specifically, the article poses a question in its title: &quot;Is Education Tied to Conspiracy Theory Belief?&quot; Did the author answer this question to your satisfaction? What do you think? Is education tied to conspiracy theory belief?</p>',

           For this assignment, you will write an initial 200-word discussion post; the post can be in response to one of the questions below, two of the questions, or all three. You will then write a 100-word post in response to one of your classmates.  (That's 300 words total).
          </p>
          <p>
           I don't have to remind you that civility matters in your responses. In today's contentious political environment, fake news carries with it some passionate political views. Be mindful and respectful.
          </p>
          <p>
           1.) In the first article, the reporter tracked down a fake news writer. What surprised you, if anything, about the business of fake news? The article offers suggestions to curtail the spread of fake news, such as limiting access to advertising dollars. Do you think that's a good idea?  Why or why not?  In general, how might we limit the proliferation of fake news?
          </p>
          <p>
           2.) From where do you get your news?  How do you know the news you're getting is accurate?  The second article outlines steps anybody can take to ferret out fake news. What other suggestions do you have for unmasking fake news?
          </p>
          <p>
           3.) The third article delves into the psychology of human behavior as it relates to conspiracy theories. Specifically, the article poses a question in its title: "Is Education Tied to Conspiracy Theory Belief?" Did the author answer this question to your satisfaction? What do you think? Is education tied to conspiracy theory belief?

            I think people who talk Fake News need to consider the unintended consequences of their propaganda. After getting this assignment my husband has been red pilling all day. I can hear him in the other room watching YouTube all freaking day about Pizzagate. Not what you wanted huh professor.

             I adjunct as a rhetoric instructor, and it's appalling the blanket statements being thrown around and blatant bigotry coming from my "liberal" colleagues (I actually identify as liberal). Credible sources are important, but bypassing critical thinking skills in favor of agreeing with the parrots of CNN and the shill components of WaPo and NYT, esp after MSM exposed itself over and over as paid off corp puppets, while actively promoting censorship is, frankly, scary shit. The funny thing is they're all reading 1984 now since apparently it only just recently became relevant again. We live in a country whose gov literally spies on them, whose citizens literally pay taxes to to support propaganda programs, a country largely responsible for the shit show that is the middle east while its candidate's campaign promise is to "reduce chaos", a country that claims to be a champion of human rights yet has the largest incarcerated population while giving fines out to banks that openly launder money for drug cartels, etc. etc, and 1984 only became relevant once Trump got into office? Are you fucking kidding me? Really, though, a large of chunk of the "educated" pop of academia misunderstand memorization as critical thinking skills. They'd be lost without their bubble sheets.

            My question for this professor is why he thinks allowing free speech is a "threat to democracy." That sounds like a line pulled out of a Hillary Clinton speech or a John Podesta interview.

             Might be news to our students, but America has no such limitation on speech. Thank God for the first amendment.

            Pertinent info for all parents.  Pay attention to what your children are being taught about all of this.  These people seem to want to harm children anyway they can.
