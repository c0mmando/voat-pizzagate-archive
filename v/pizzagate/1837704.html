            There''S always a little hope left, even if a rationale aspproach tells you, that there are zero chances.
Doing the right thing is the right thing, no matter if the chances are zero to succeed.

            It is all laid out in Coudenhove-Kalergi's book Practical Idealism. Published in 1924 and financed by Warburg and Rockefeller, Kalergi lays out the plan to commit genocide against Europe and the White race by mass immigration of Black and Asian men to Europe.
Kalergi envisions that the "Jewish masterrace" will rule over the multicultural resulting rootless mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            To support this task he strongly suggested the "sexualization of the masses". While the plebs would practice free love the "elite" will practice free marriage and that way the masses will lose their protecting unit, the family, while the elites will preserve them.
Kalergi is the founder of the Pan-European-movement, the official ideological foundation of the EU.
           </p>
           <p>
            They do not hide their plans, they communicate about them. And they know, that the stupid masses will not care about it. They are only interested in leisure, sports, fashion, not in educating themselfes and learning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sexualization of the kids fits in the old Marxist agenda to destroy families - because families are the cells, where traditional values are inherited. Destroying the family means cutting off the roots of the tree, which is necessary to create their envisioned "new human".
           </p>
           <p>
            It becomes clearer and clearer, that the phase of the nation states, a result of overcoming feudalism, was just a brief interruption. 
We are heading quickly into a new age of feudalism. The global elite, the money masters have succeeded. The nations are toast.

            Yes, yes and yes.  It's horrible the way they sexualise tweens.  Girls especially are growing up to believe that all they have to offer are their bodies, and that their minds and hearts are worthless.

            Her older sister (Maddie Ziegler) received some controversy over Pedophilia overtones when she was in Sia's Elastic Heart video:

            Considering the Masonic/Illuminati imagery in that video, you have to wonder if something nefarious is going with both of them.  Could their parents involved as well?

             Her mother seemed like a nut job drunk on the show.  She was very vulgar and verbally abusive, as were all the other moms.  Abby Lee Miller the dance studio owner where she got her start is about to go to jail for tax evasion.  Lovely crowd.

            I know that many kids of that age are very attracted to pop-culture. I was myself from a very early age! 
But at that time, most popstars were not soo sexualized  -  or their "sex appeal" was more hidden, so that I did not notice at all.
            <br/>
            And as a  kid and  young teen I did not like singers, who were "too sexy".  It was confusing and intimidating me. 
I preferred the more "innocent"  looking stars  -   and I think that is absolutely normal and how it should be at that age.
Guess I would not have liked to see girls of my age dancing like that. 
I remember us kids laughing a bit ashamed and thinking "It's stupid", when seeing singers shaking their asses or female singers looking like hookers ( I was a keen watcher of music tv- shows!). 
So, I wonder, who is the  main target audience of 12 years olds dancing like that?  Guess not the parents (if they are normal, loving parents). 
So, Grown-up pedos, who like watching these things? Or who are working everywhere in the media industry, so that they think it's just normal? Or are "they" (the illuminati)  trying to manipulate the kids at a very early age, that they learn, that its's something to aspire? And that it's normal and "beautiful" to be like that? I think we know that "sexuality" is a very good tool to manipulate human beings.

            Those fuckers have been pushing this shit for 20 yrs. When I was a teen Tiffany and Debbie Gibson were the teen queens. Very sweet and innocent. Then the pushed Brittany Spears acting whorish. Now they want to go younger with sexualizing them.

              All of the girls were teens. There was a stark difference in how they acted from 80's -90's. Madona was an adult at the time. I knew she was a whore straight away.

             Yes, Selling coffee, health bars, deodorant, and sexualizing cereal, mattresses, cars, and God I am so very sick of ED ads.  Brats dolls and slutty clothes for Barbie.  It does not end.  Our best bet is to tweet out at bazaar crazy t-shirts as we have before and let Stores and Designers know it is not acceptable.  It sometimes works.  We must fight back and stop buying them.

            Of course, not only is it wrong, its intentional.... that's the real issue here is people are doing this on purpose and pumping it out there to make money. Disgusting.... I can't even watch TV or movies anymore they have no problems slipping in sexual relationships between children or sexualizing a child in general... ridiculous

             Yes Yes Yes and Yes Again!  I so agree.  The clothes make the look like little tarts.  Purple and black and now sheer nightgowns with matching sheer robes?  Those use to be reserved for a Honeymoon back in the day.  Now I see them on line and at the stores.  What happened to cute cotton pjs and gowns for kids?  And the trashy looking girls you see on t-shirts. They have big black eyes and look like mini vampire girls.  My friend has a hard time finding clothes for her 6 grand children. Oy Vey!

            It's sick. That's what the whole trend is for kids now it's sad. It's so oversexualized. Yes the parents are definitely to blame when they are that young I mean come on who's paying for the dancing classes and taking them there. A lot of these moms flaunt their kids all over social media too making pages for them it's so sad. Shows on tv like dance moms and the pageants for kiddies should be outlawed. Only moronic mothers and pedofiles watch it. Seriously. I can't stomach five minutes of it it's just heartbreaking and sad. Another lost generation of empty souls. I wish the parents could understand...

            Oh boy! I'm so happy that you post d this thread and even that you titled it with what you did, i.e. "Anyone tired of all these sexualized teens!?" I'll tell you why. It's because the other day I ran across the most blatant "advertisement" for Kendall Jenner. I took a screen shot but I can't figure out how to post it on Voat/Pizzagate. Now I know the purpose of using "archive," etc.... learning as I go, I suppose. I know I can share it to "pics" on Voat but how to get it on Pizzagate?? Thanks!! :-)

               Where did you get the idea I thought it was conservatives?  I said it goes beyond political ideology. The only way we are going to get rid of the perverts in power is for the 99% of us who are getting screwed and manipulated by them to come together and to start appreciating our similarities instead of fighting over petty differences.  So thank you for your comment but I won't insult you back as we are on the same side after all.

             No. Just like pedo's hide behind Christianity, teaching, coaching, LEO/authority jobs, etc.; they can hide behind arts and entertainment.

               You're all missing the big picture. The Jew pricks have been trying to take America away from Freedom Blessed Americans since 1933 and this is just one of many hundreds of ways that they use to distract and keep us divided and fuel the hate every way possible. You would be absolutely shocked if you knew even half of it. If Hillary had won I'm pretty sure their plan (Jews and libs. and to a lesser part conservatives and Jews...oh did I mention JEWS?) would have advanced their plan to the point of no return. Sure there are a lot of sicko's in this Country but Jews have a long term plan for the new world order and the lynchpin is America. They're almost there.
