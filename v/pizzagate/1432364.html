           It is important to recognize that if we can spearhead a movement that leads to the resignation of spez, it will provide a tremendous amount of exposure to #PIZZAGATE, as well as raise awareness of "shadow" manipulation and censorship across social media platforms. This is especially timely in light of Facebook's recent agreement with the Chinese government.
