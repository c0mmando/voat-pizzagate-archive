  'formattedContent' => '<p>In the video below is of a lady named Mary whose daughter got sucked into a sex trafficking ring at the age of 17. She was almost raped to death but luckily survived the attack. She states her daughter was later kidnapped in 2014 and the ransom made was for her to stop her investigation into \'them\'. Mary mentions that through a friend her daughter met man named &quot;Curtis&quot;, who was the mechanic of Nancy Pelosi. And while Mary never made claims she had any connections proving Pelosi\'s involvement, she did state that Curtis, the mechanic for some reason was &quot;untouchable&quot;. She mentions a case Curtis was involved in that he didn\'t even get recolonized for that involved the murder of a 13 year girl named Rachel Ellis. The article she mentions doesn\'t mention him by name just by &quot;a friend&quot;, who happened to be the owner, and driver of a truck used to picked up Ellis and drove her to the residence of the Lombardi brothers, which was also the scene of the crime. She then continues to talk about how corrupt law enforcement, CPS, and other agencies are all connected and protect each other. </p>
<p>Mary also mentions Gary Lieberstein, the then DA of Napa who recently retired, and how he was no help to her investigation. The interviewer mentions that Lieberstein faced allegations of child kidnapping and &quot;going easy on child molesters&quot;. I\'m still looking for solid proof on that; however one thing i did find curious was when Lieberstein was running for his 5th term as DA he campaigned that his main focus was to \'expand the mental health court and work on legislation that facilitates early detection and intervention of mental illnesses among young people.\' “I am more aware than ever that we must work together to examine how we treat those in our community less fortunate than ourselves who suffer from diseases of the brain,” Lieberstein said in an email. One thing that is not talked about is that his top donor during his campaign was Sharin and Garen Staglin who run a &quot;non profit&quot; named International Mental Health Research Organization. There is also an interesting article of testing they funded in 2015 regarding &quot;Altered resting perfusion and functional connectivity of default mode network in youth with autism spectrum disorder&quot;. Just follow the money. </p>
<p>Mary goes way back and talks about the kidnapping and murder of Doreen Heskett from 1963, which til this day is still unsolved. The odd thing about that case is that her body was eventually discovered on the family ranch of then lead investigator and DA  Phillip Bucky Stewart, discovered by his father Earl Stewart. Rumors from those in the area was that the \'Stewart Dairy Farm\' was linked to &quot;dark deeds&quot;, and was often used as police cottages. The &quot;prime suspect&quot; in the Heskett case, since connections to Bucky Stewart were being ignored was a \'known\' pedophile Claude Ray Jr, they couldn\'t tie him to the murder of Heskett; however the following year he was arrested for the murders of his own daughters, Renay and Jeanette. Jeanette\'s body was never discovered but Claude Ray Jr was still sentenced to life in prison where he committed suicide in 1983. A twist to this story is another person came forward and made a video, of how &quot;Bucky&quot; molested him and that he believed killed Heskett too. He turned up dead after a freak bike accident just last month pursuing justice, and we know it wasn\'t Bucky because hes been dead since the 80\'s. So if foul play was involved then someone is protecting the dead and his secrets which I\'m sure implicate more than just him. Newman also claimed that the Napa police were behind the Zodiac killings in the 60\'s.</p>
<p>From the story of Mary\'s personal experience I\'d like to know who Curtis the mechanic is who has ties to Nancy Pelosi. I\'d also like to know if any names on the SIP plan does in fact point to corrupt ties within the Government in regards to sex trafficking, which includes kids. From the stories mentioned, I am very curious about this farm, where it was mentioned to have ties to &quot;dark deeds&quot;, and having secret rooms, and most importantly belonging to the family of then the lead investigator, and who would later become DA, for the rape and murder of a 5 year old girl that is still unsolved to this day. Another reason I\'m suspicious of this farm because like we learned with Comet Pizza and other business tied to these scumbags they get free publicity, as the farm has gotten over the years and not one ever mentioned the fact the body of 5 year old Doreen Heskett was found on their property. I never found the footage of when the farm appeared on Good morning America in 2004. As usual more questions than answers, and I feel Napa county has a lot of answers and would like your opinion and/or findings of the matter. </p>

            You're right, it's impossible. I trust your judgement completely on this matter. Silsby deserves to be put in prison then murdered and to burn in hell forever, and to have her corpse raped by every person on Earth.

            Indeed. The investigation might have started out with false premises, if it turns out that Comet Ping Pong/James Alefantis are not involved, but the stuff thats been found since the start is alot more damning.

            I do believe that JA is involved with some shady stuff, and hes not someone i would let watch after my kids, but liking art etc that some might consider sick is not a crime. There's plenty of circumstantial evidence though, that people should be asking for investigations into them.

            This first video mentions a "curtis" involved with the napa ring. Not sure how I found this but there is a curtis family with some crazy stuff going on. This is tied in somehow with a suit against the Napa Police. Haven't gone through it all yet.

             This is quite the find. The only thing is there is no mention of a "mechanic"; however that could have been a code word since that is the way they operate. While, I believe the links you found may be part of another scandal between Napa officials, with clear disputes over the Stearn's estate that link law enforcement and Gary Lieberstein, I'm not sure this is in direct relation to this particular topic. The main reason for this conclusion is based on Mary's testimony "Curtis" lived close to the 711 where they picked up Rachel Ellis ("Sierra Avenue 7-Eleven convenience store" 1925 Sierra Ave ) which isn't too far from where Ellis was killed on the 2200 block of dry creek rd, in Napa. 554 Monroe is a good 4.5 miles south of both the Lombardi residence and the 7-11 mentioned in the below article.

             But I think we should look further into it to see if there are any links to our research here being that the name mentioned Richard Eldridge was a police informant, and that video from 1995 of the D.A.R.E truck at their residence for a long period of time organizing "neighborhood watches" at a residence linked to drugs is a bit suspicious to say the least. Good find none the less, and keep digging, the truth wants to be found.

            Animal agriculture and the rape and torture of animals is a clue to human abuse. Think of Picton pig farm... I'm vegan for a reason.
Consider JAs creepy pig head pictures.

            Yup, Comet was just the catalyst to start the investigation but their tentacles reach all throughout the government.   I have to hope that Trump and the gang are working hard behind the scenes, they must be as the attacks on him and his people are getting harsher!

            So you guys are now classifying
            <em>
             any and all
            </em>
            underaged rape victims as "victims of Pizzagate"? Even if they have
            <em>
             nothing to do with the Pizza codes, the Podestas, Alefantis, Comet, etc.?
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a really sad way to eventually stumble upon totally unrelated sex crimes and then proclaim "See? We were right
            <em>
             the whole time
            </em>
            !" Oh, and you continue to demonize
            <em>
             Comet Ping Pong
            </em>
            even though you
            <em>
             never exposed a single crime
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            This is ridiculous. This girl wasn't a
            <em>
             victim of Pizzagate
            </em>
            . Honestly, those of you who seem to legitimately want to help combat human trafficking by sharing news stories about it are just riding on the coattails of the fame of a
            <em>
             very poorly constructed
            </em>
            conspiracy theory.

             Here is a link to an interview with a College English Professor who lives in Napa.  He has researched and written 3 books about the "zodiac killer" which led him into the realm of political and law enforcement corruption there in Napa. Toward the end of the interview he says that this has led him into his latest project of researching ORGANIZED CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING through these same networks which he has traced back as far as the 1870s. He says these networks directly lead to WASHINGTON DC, and the investigations currently referred to as "pizzagate."  He further says the same family names and same organizations pop up over and over in his current investigation.  No one has said at any time that all child sex trafficking ties directly to Podesta, or Alefantis, or any particular location.  Are you suggesting that every investigation must start with all the facts and specific details resolved?  Otherwise it must be only "ridiculous" and "sad."  If you are sincere, look into the evidence and post rational analyses.  If you are approaching a topic as serious as this with anything less, you will wear the tags you post, "ridiculous" and "sad."

              </p>
              <p>
               Unfortunately there is a connection. It's through a lawyer who worked with the Haitian orphanage that Laura Silsby got the children from. She lied and said they were orphans, they weren't.
              </p>
              <p>
               That lawyer or his father helped CPP get permission to stay open late. You can find the story, it's been researched heavily here.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously the connection doesn't prove anything. In fact I think James Alefantis is 100% innocent as is the lawyer in question.
              </p>
              <p>
               But yeah, there is a connection.

                Fair enough. I suppose I should have said
                <em>
                 meaningfully linked
                </em>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                This is just my personal assessment, but Silsby seems more like a huge idiot with good intentions. Her case doesn't seem to fit the bill if you're looking for highly organized sex trafficking.

               I know but did you see his instagram page? Or the videos? Sure there is no absolute concrete evidence, but I the suggestive evidence is very blatant. For example alefantis profile picture is of a statue that is known to represent pedophilia.

             The girl was a victim of Pedogate, Pizzagate is what the media named it in hopes of discrediting it yet brought more light to it, and no matter how you look it, there is one huge network of pedophiles that walk among the normal that have too much power and protection. And that is what we're trying to expose, Comet pizza, Alefantis, Podesta etc, are all just pawns in this grand pedophile scheme.

               The point is the link to Pelosi, upper echelon of the DNC. I don't know much background on her, except she's connected with a dubious pizza place, and has a lot more $$$ than her senate salary, from where?

               Except, we're not looking for aliens, that is an entire other section you can visit if you'd like. And just because you associate pedophiles with a topic some may feel is fictitious, doesn't mean people will buy into your comparison and think the same of pedophiles. This isn't facebook.

              Oddly that is the true definition of a troll, and coincidentally, a democrat. When facts are provided, they shield themselves from it by reaching into their inner safe spaces and mock others who oppose their brainwashed beliefs. You'll quickly find out that this is not facebook, and we're not easily triggered. Great minds are part of this community and if you believe it to be a hoax, then bring forward evidence, or that F word you probably don't know about, FACTS proving it.

            If it is BS why the hell are you here? If it's BS no one is being hurt and there is no evidence so you should not care. Are you at 9/11 truther sites arguing with them calling it BS?
           </p>

            The answer is we just want a thorough investigation of all the evidence and facts, not taking some internet champion for truth's word for it.

                So how much are you getting paid by Podesta to sit on here and discredit/mock people?  It's 2:30 on a Monday and I doubt you have an actual job if you can reply to every single post about you here today.    Are you an Uber driver waiting for a fare?
