<blockquote>
<p>By praising clerics and laity who advance these heresies, or by naming  them  to  influential  posts,  or  by  protecting  clerics of  this  kind  from  punishment  or  demotion when they have committed gravely immoral and criminal acts, he assists them to spread their heretical beliefs.  By  choosing  heretical  prelates  for  the  most  important  posts  in  the  Roman  Curia,  he  manifests an  intention  to  impose  these  heresies  upon  the  whole  Church.  By  protecting  clerics  who  are  guilty  of immoral  and  criminal  sexual  acts  even  when  this  protection  causes  grave  scandal  to  the  Church  and threatens  to  lead  to  calamitous  action  by  the  civil  authorities,  he manifests  disbelief  in  Catholic teaching on sexual morality, and shows that support of heretical and criminal clerics is more important to  him  than  the  well-being  of  the  Church.  
</p>
<p>The following is a list of actions that indicate belief in the heresies above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardinal Domenico Calcagno:</strong> Cardinal  Calcagno  was  known  to  have  protected  Nello  Giraudo,  a  priest  whohadabused  asame-sex minor,before Pope Francis\'s election. Pope Francis retained him in office as president of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See until he reached retirement age in 2017. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio:</strong> Cardinal  Coccopalmerio  publicly  stated  in  2014  that  Catholic  leaders  must  emphasise  the positive elements  in  homosexual relationships, and  that  in  certain circumstances  it would be wrong  to deny  communion  to  persons  living  in  adulterous  relationships  or  to  require  them  to  dissolve  their relationship.  He  has  shown  other  indications  of  approval  of  homosexual  activity.  Pope  Francis  has appointed  him to  a  number  of  important posts  including  a working group tasked with speeding up  the process for assessing the nullity of marriage, and to the board of review within the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith that reviews appeals from clergy  found guilty  of sexual abuse of minors.** </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardinal Godfried Danneels:</strong> Cardinal  Danneels  was  requested  in  1997  and  1998  to take  action  on  the  catechism  textbook Roeach, which was used in Belgium under his authority. This textbook corrupted minors with a sexual education contrary to Catholic principles, teaching them to seek whatever sexual lust theylike, solitary, heterosexual, or homosexual. It presented standard propaganda claims used for legitimizing the sexual abuse  of  pre-pubescent  children.  He  defended  the  textbook  and  refused  to  have  it  altered  or  removed, even  when  Belgian  parents  objected  that  it  encouraged  pedophilia.He  acted  to  protect  the  pedophile Bishop Roger Vangheluwe after  it became  known that Vangheluwe sexually abused  his  own  nephew, beginning  when  the  nephew  was fiveyearsold.  When  the  nephew,  then  an  adult,  asked  Danneels  to take some action against Vangheluwe, Danneels refused, told the nephew to keep quiet about the abuse, and  told  the  nephew  that  he  should  acknowledge  his  own  guilt.  All  these  actions  were  public knowledge  in  2010.  Cardinal  Danneels  stood  at  the  side  of  Pope  Francis  on  the  balcony  of  St.Peter\'s when the Pope made his first public appearance after his election. Pope Francis named him as a special delegate to the 2015 Synod on the Family. At his death in 2019, Pope Francis praised him as a \'zealous pastor\' who \'served the Church with dedication\'. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardinal Jozef de Kesel:</strong> In 2014  Cardinal  de  Kesel,  then  bishop  of  Bruges,  appointed  Father  Tom  Flamez  as  a  pastor after he had been convicted of sexual abuse. He did not remove Fr. Antoon Stragier from ministry until 2015, although Stragier’s crimes were known to the diocese in 2004. Pope Francis chose Bishop de Kesel as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels in November 2015 and named him a Cardinal in November 2016.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick:</strong> According to numerous credible accusers, former Cardinal McCarrick pressured seminarians to engage in homosexual relations with him. These charges were known to the Holy See as early as 2002. Between  2005  and  2007,  the  Diocese  of  Metuchen  and  the  Archdiocese  of  Newark  paid  financial settlements to two priests who had accused McCarrick of abuse. Pope Francis was personally informed of  this  behaviour  in  2013,  and  was  told  that  Pope  Benedict  had  placed  restrictions  upon  him.  Pope Francis brought McCarrick out of retirement and used him for many important tasks, including trips as a  representative  of  the  Holy  See  to  Israel,  Armenia,  China,  Iran  and  Cuba.  He  accompanied  Pope Francis  on  his  trips  to  Israel  and  Cuba.  When  Archbishop  Carlos  Maria  Viganòasserted  in  August 2018 that Pope Francis had known from 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator, the pope refused to answer  this  claim.  In  February  2019,  the  former  cardinal  was  returned  to  the  lay  state.Despite  the example of the former cardinal’s behavior, the subject  of the  homosexual abuse  of adults, and  in particular of seminarians, was excluded from discussion at the summit on sexual abuse that took place in Rome in the same month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cardinal Donald Wuerl:</strong> Cardinal  Wuerl  allowed  Fr.  George  Zirwas  to  continue  in  ministry  after  learning  that  he  had committed  numerous  crimes  of  sexual  abuse.  Wuerl  resigned  as  Archbishop  of  Washington  after  his actions  in  this  and  other  cases  of  sexual  abuse  were  criticised  by  a  Pennsylvania  grand  jury  report. When Wuerl resigned as a result of these failures, Pope Francis praised him for his nobility, kept him in charge of the Archdiocese of Washington as apostolic administrator, and retained  him as a member  of the Congregation for Bishops...</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The list is several pages long. In addition, the letter offers condemnation of Francis\' use of heretical, pagan and Satanic imagery, and his failure to speak out against child sacrifice:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pope  Francis  has  failed  to  speak  a  word  in  support  of  popular  campaigns  to  preserve  Catholic countries  from  abortion  and  homosexuality,  for  example,  before  the  referendum  to  introduce  abortion into Ireland in May 2018. </li>
<li>On  June  9,  2014,  Pope  Francis  received  the  leaders  of  the  militantly  pro-homosexual  Tupac Amaru organization from Argentina at the Vatican, and blessed their coca leaves for use in their pagan religious rituals, which involve recognition of the coca plant as sacred.</li>
<li>At the opening mass of the Synod on Youth in 2018, Pope Francis carried a staff in the form of a ‘stang’, an object used in satanic rituals. </li>
<li>During the Synod on Youth in 2018, Pope Francis wore a distorted rainbow-coloured cross, the rainbow being a popularly promoted symbol of the homosexual movement.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After presenting all this evidence against Francis, the letter urges Catholic bishops to declare him a Heretic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If - which God forbid! - Pope Francis does not bear the fruit of true repentance in response to these admonitions, we request that you carry out your duty of office  to  declare  that  he  has  committed  the  canonical  delict  of  heresy  and  that  he  must  suffer  the canonical consequences of this crime. These  actions  do  not  need  to  be  taken  by  all  the  bishops  of  the  Catholic  Church,  or  even  by  a majority of them. A substantial and representative part of the faithful bishops of the Church would have the power to take these actions.  
</p>
<p>Given the open, comprehensive and devastating nature of the heresy of Pope Francis, willingness publicly to admonish Pope Francis for heresy appears now to be a necessary condition for being a faithful bishop of the Catholic Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They then outline the canonical requirements for dealing with heresy, which include these key points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It is agreed that no pope can uphold heresy when teaching in a way that satisfies the conditions for  an  infallible  magisterial  statement.  This  restriction  does  not  mean  that  a  pope  cannot  be  guilty  of heresy, since popes can and do make many public statements that are not infallible; many popes indeed never issue an infallible definition.</li>
<li>It  is  agreed  that ecclesiastical  authorities  have  a  responsibility  to  act  to  remedy  the  evil  of  a heretical  pope.  Most  theologians  hold  that  the  bishops  of  the  Church  are  the  authorities  that  have  an absolute duty to act in concert to remedy this evil.</li>
<li>It  is  agreed  that  a pope  who  is  guilty  of  heresy  and  remains  obstinate  in  his  heretical  views cannot continue as pope.</li>
<li>The Church\'s determining that  a  pope  is  a  heretic,  and  the  announcement  of  his  heresy  by  the  bishops  of  the  Church,  is  what makes the pope\'s heresy a juridical fact, a fact from which his loss of office ensues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Over a year ago <a href="https://8ch.net/qresearch/res/883975.html#884799">in April 2018, QAnon put the Pope in a &quot;kill box&quot; and revealed &quot;The [Pope] will be having a terrible May</a>. Those who backed him will be pushed into the LIGHT. Dark to LIGHT. TRUTH.&quot; Looks like that is turning out to be correct.</p>',

           <p>
            Given the open, comprehensive and devastating nature of the heresy of Pope Francis, willingness publicly to admonish Pope Francis for heresy appears now to be a necessary condition for being a faithful bishop of the Catholic Church.

             The Church's determining that  a  pope  is  a  heretic,  and  the  announcement  of  his  heresy  by  the  bishops  of  the  Church,  is  what makes the pope's heresy a juridical fact, a fact from which his loss of office ensues.

             That would be something, wouldn't it. I think a lot of these Bishops hold diplomatic status, unfortunately. Shitty corrupt men have been using that ploy to dodge justice ever since diplomatic immunity was invented.

            On a side note , the guy who wrote the dogma regarding the infallibility of the Pope in the 19th century wa-s involved in the sexual abuse of young nuns - they were abused by older nuns, and he participated in the abuse.

               By "the text that formally defined infallibility in 1870" I assume you mean
               <em>
                Pastor Aeturnus
               </em>
               . One guy did not write that, however. It was produced by the First Vatican Council, the twentieth official gathering of all the bishops of the Church.
              </p>
              <p>
               Infallibility was part of Church doctrine long before 1870. It stems directly from multiple Scriptures, but was discussed by Christian writers from the First Century, on -- even before the canon of Scripture was agreed upon by the bishops in councils of the late Fourth Century (Pope Athanasius was the first to cite all 27 New Testament books we recognize today in
               <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2809.htm">
                a single document in 327
               </a>
               . Discernment of the canon of Scripture in fact depended upon what later became known as the doctrine of infallibility.)

              <p>
               Wikipedia has
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_infallibility">
                a pretty good summary of the history
               </a>
               :
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                On the basis of Mark 3:16, 9:2, Luke 24:34 and 1 Corinthians 15:5, the Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Peter as holding first place among the apostles. It speaks of Peter as the rock on which, because of Peter's faith, Christ said in Matthew 16:18 he would build his Church, which he declared would be victorious over the powers of death. In Luke 22:32, Jesus gave Peter the mission to keep his faith after every lapse and to strengthen his brothers in it. The Catechism of the Catholic Church sees the power of the keys that Jesus promised to Peter alone in Matthew 16:19 as signifying authority to govern the house of God, that is, the Church, an authority that Jesus after his resurrection confirmed for Peter by instructing him in John 21:15–17 to feed Christ's sheep.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               (Note that the Catechism doesn't establish any dogma or doctrine -- it merely collects it all in one place, like an encyclopedia, explains where each teaching comes from, why, and how it connects to the "seamless garment" of the whole.)

                Thanks for the info. I will try to find the name in other book reviews. Yes, the predators were women, but the priest I have been thinking of participated (they forced young nuns to have sex with the main female predator and him).

             Not really. There is no one more pissed off about Church corruption than orthodox Catholics who are well-formed in Scripture, and the writings of the Saints and Doctors of the Church. This was the third formal condemnation of the Pope. Canonically, three are required before bishops can take the action they are requesting. This "Pope" is going down, along with the evil deviants who put him in power. Their crimes have created the means to pry them out of power.

               It will only take a few exposing the crimes of these men the way this letter does to turn the Faithful against them. Once it's clear Francis is unrepentant, this will become inevitable. The mainstream secular and Catholic media have been attacking those who have attempted to do so prior to now, but their attempts to control the narrative will fail, thanks to places like Church Militant, and social media.

                Yes - but what do you think will happen - could this bring a schisma of the Church, since a considerable number of bishops and cardinals will back Francis.

                 Depends what you mean by schism. There is already a schism between faithful Catholics and those teaching heresy...that's what heresy
                 <em>
                  is
                 </em>
                 . Any bishop or cardinal who upholds heresy automatically severs himself from the Church. What the theologians are requesting is formal acknowledgement of a fact that already exists, as demonstrated by the twenty pages of evidence they have cited in the letter.

                   From what I've been reading today, it appears that historically, major times of heresy result in the convening of an ecumenical council, which includes lay experts as well as clergy, and can speak with the full authority of the Church to declare his teachings anathema. That is probably what would happen. During the Third and Fourth centuries (after the Church became the official religion of the Roman Empire), the politically popular Arian heresy infected almost the entire worldwide Church. The majority of bishops spread its false teachings and those who stood up against it were persecuted by both secular and religious authorities. But, because Trinitarian doctrine was sound and in accord with both Scripture and the traditional teachings of the Church, those who stood fast eventually prevailed.

            Within 3 generations of Jewish globalism they have already managed to destroy Catholicism. I will never be going back to a catholic church and I encourage all of you to find a good Christian Church in your area. One that doesn't support faggot kid fuckers.

            I think Francis is going to be the one to finally put to rest the concept of papal infallibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if he's decried as a false pope, he's going to be a black mark on catholicism for years. Their very own mark of cain.

             Absolutely. Three were required (in accordance with Scripture) to enable the canonical process against the Pope to proceed.

              What canonical process against the pope?  The letter doesn't call for any.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they actually wanted a canonical process against the pope to proceed, why did they fail so spectacularly to actually list anything that would meet the canonical definition of heresy?  Vestiments and appointments won't do it.  The other issues don't meet the obstinacy required for heresy because Francis (and the rest of the Church) are saying and Amoris laetitia flows from or is congruent with Church teaching.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they genuinely believe appointments  are canonical crimes, why are they only going after Francis? One of their charges goes back to 1998. Why did they not go after John Paul II or Benedict for promoting the same men?  Some of their arguments seem to be an argument with Vatican II.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder what would have made of this Pope John II receiving two radical and pro abortion italian politicans.
