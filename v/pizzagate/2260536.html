            I have a deeper appreciation for superstar athletes.  They're talented, rich and powerful yet aren't raping dozens of women and children.  You'd think they'd be as susceptible to the influences of power and Fame.  Maybe because their lives are much more in the public?  I personally had never heard of Harvey Weinstein until October.

            I'm totally appalled by the comments. All the criticism is laid on him for speaking out. Must be brethren of Anthony Newly's and of the same mind to speak so harshly and condemn someone for objecting to his father being a pedophile. Pedos are the lowest of the low and I'm not surprised at the outrage directed at someone who witnessed it first-hand instead of the perpetrator of such deranged crimes.

             Joan Collins herself may be a part to all this, she was a Hollywood prostitute by 17 maybe earlier, . She started the original Heidi Fliess Hollywood Hooker ring. Was offered 400 million dollars for her services as a Madam from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. She was almost sold to him almost thirty years ago by her third husband. Starting out her career as a high class prostitute in Hollywood

              With all due respect to hookers, hookers and prostitutes aren't anywhere nearly as wretched as pedophiles. I don't know the circumstances of why she was a prostitute, but not at all prostitutes would be willing to turn their backs on children being raped. So it's a good point, but since her own son says she had a breakdown when finding out, I'll believe him. He would never have continued the close relationship if she had been in Newly's camp cheering him on in pursuing "innocence" and ruining it.

              Exactly. Children have a right to tell their story, and growing up with a father who's a pedophile, deserves to be told.

            Sad to hear that these two beautiful children grew up in such an atmosphere.
But it further confirms that INCEST is the most common of crimes ...
notably by father, grandfather, uncle, brother, male cousin - and male friends
of the family.
           </p>
           <p>
            And can be generational in families.

             Did you just call cousin sex a crime? It's only a crime in a few places, and the reason it was ever unlawful was because wealthy families would marry their cousin to keep the money in the family, securing their own future lineage.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government didn't like this, so they made it illegal to do so. It's one of the earliest forms of wealth distribution.

              You think that INCEST is "sex" ..... ????

             <p>
              No -- INCEST is sexual abuse of a child -- pedophilia ---

             <p>
              Granted, we do have cases where "allegedly" as the children grow older and 
the arrangement continues on, there are claims that there has been "consent."

               The first half of your comment makes no sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               The second half, with the link to the article, uses interesting wording. It doubles from 3% to 6% but only if related on the father's side. To put that in perspective, that's the same risk level as a birth defect appearing in a child born to a woman between 18-23, which is actually a normal age to give birth at.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you had bother with digging through the study itself, which has resources available at
               <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2961132-0/references">

               </a>
               , you would have noticed that they had a problem replicating the results in white british women, though there was small increases in that study group. They don't believe that smoking and drinking played a major role in the results, but did not spend any resources to verify. Even in the summary of the study itself, it mentions that education and knowledge of prenatal care could lower the numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did you read the article, or just type "cousin birth defects" into Google and link to the one with the headline you wanted?

                Haven't actually read the specific link -- there are probably 50 search pages 
on the subject for you to choose from --  but "in-breeding" is always in question ....
AND that's the point.

               <p>
                But, let's get to your point .... you're pushing the idea of first cousin sex as harmless ...
either morally or in regard to heredity?

                 I didn't say it was harmless, I was saying your calling it a crime was ludicrous. Then I responded to your comment that then took a weird turn and said that incest is strictly with children. Then I responded to you linking a study you didn't read.

                <p>
                 Looking at information objectively isn't the same as pushing an agenda. Your reaction to then try and find a character fault in my up-bringing or region of residence is evidence that you aren't concerned with the content being up for analysis, but instead to confirm your already established notion.

                  Adults having SEX with children is a CRIME ....

                  INCEST is in the main adult males having SEX with children ...
as made clear in my post.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Granted -- ADULTS who are related may have sex -- which portends poorly
for any offspring.  And it would depend on the child being over 16 as to whether
or not it's a crime.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think there have always been jokes about marriage in the South between
14 year olds ... can't speak to that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you want to speak to that ... go to it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Meanwhile, my discussion is INCEST based on adult males having sex with children ...
infants, toddlers, young children.

                 It's also how many poor white families generate little welfare mouths. After all the girls have swelled up Pa puts a bunch of trailers for their inbred spawn out behind the old home place and "Hud farms"
