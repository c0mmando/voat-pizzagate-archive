<p>Hundreds were arrested in Iowa immigration raid (May 12, 2008). Postville, Iowa - A raid by federal immigration officials at the nation\'s largest kosher meatpacking plant may have resulted in as many as 700 arrests, immigration officials said Monday. Agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered the Agriprocessors Inc. complex in northeast Iowa Monday morning to execute a criminal search warrant for evidence relating to aggravated identity theft, fraudulent use of Social Security numbers and other crimes. </p>
<p><strong>Sexual favors were allegedly expected from some Postville workers. Reports that there was an expectation of sexual favors at Agriprocessors Inc. <strong>are beginning to emerge from workers at the Postville meat processing plant, and advocates for immigrants in Postville today are trying to collect and validate the stories. Sister Mary McCauley said workers have said that &quot;</strong>there was sexual abuse</strong>, and  that there\'s propositioning.&quot; <strong>Many of the workers were children</strong>.</p>
<p>Federal agents raided Agriprocessors Inc., a kosher meat-processing plant, on Monday in the largest single-site immigration bust in U.S. history. Arrest warrants were issued for 697 people who work at the plant. Federal agents detained 389 in Waterloo, charged 306 with various fraud-related charges, and released 62. Twenty-one remain in custody pending immigration hearings. Since the raid, stories of how employees were mistreated has emerged, including verbal abuse by supervisors. Last November, the federal search warrant released after the raid said, Immigrant and Customs Enforcement agents interviewed a former Agriprocessors supervisor who said some employees were running a methamphetamine lab in the plant and were bringing weapons to work. Another source alleged worker abuse, officials said in the warrant. In one case, a supervisor covered the eyes of an employee with duct tape and struck him with a meat hook. </p>

            I vaguely remember this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I keep wondering what they do with all the bodies. We've seen at least a few instances of farms being likely locations for their collecting, raping, and slaughtering of women and children. There was the "pig farmer" in B.C., and references to "the Farm" in the Podesta emails. Plus, Podesta's own "farm." Farms tend to be isolated and screams probably go unheard. If certain farms are collection centers for trafficking, it would be SO easy to include the bodies among the slaughtered cows, etc. in vehicles destined for a processing plant. With slaves working at the plant there's minimal risk that the true nature of the activities would be revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Organized networks-- it's how they've survived and thrived for so long.
           </p>

            Nice work.

              I still believe that what will shock the normies into Reality is seeing footage of children being held hostage for CP and SAR, and images of how their bodies are being disposed of. Sharing that info, if and when it's documented, will be very, very challenging to do from a practical and legal standpoint.

                Thank you. Currently, I'm reading Elisa E.'s two-book memoir "Our Life Beyond MKULTRA" about her life as a victim of MKULTRA, SRA, and other horrors. My frustration is that every time I post something on these topics-- crickets. Post a pic of a puppy and the world shows up to ooh and ahhhh. So frustrating. Too bad for them I'm stubborn and will not be giving up.

            The meat packing industry employs Illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America because these are the only folks willing to do such awful work. Was this issue addressed in the sources you reviewed. Such victims would never, ever come forward and the perps know that.

             Thank you for mentioning how maligned those workers are and why would anyone do such work because it is always for extremely low pay and horrible conditions.  These people are hard up and are being used by companies and our govt. Our govt. looks the other way aw well because they are payed under the table by the companies. Yes, they are abused and used in many horrible ways.  We would not want to do this work.  Many look down on these people but they should get better pay and humane treatment.  Those plants are dirty and filthy as well.

              The rate at which slaughter takes place is so swift that many animals are alive during butchering. Apparently there is documentation that workers suffer PTSD as a result of their jobs. And then to be subjected to sexual abuse by crew bosses and others....America is becoming more cruel as well as more perverse.

               It is disgusting.  People do not realize what is going on, and I am coming to believe that as long as they have their meat, they do not want to hear.  They just cover their eyes and ears.

                No question about it. Here's an eye opener-- do a small, informal survey. Ask a number of people, especially children where meat comes from. You know what you're going to hear a lot for an answer? Walmart. Yep. There's a growing disconnect between reality and convenience, not just when it comes to how food is processed in America but what's happening behind the scenes as Pizzagate researchers know all too well.

                 We have tried to give up meat now for at least 3 to 4 days a week.  Sometimes even more.  People think we are crazy ad how can we survive.  I have at some point not eaten meat for a whole week.  I feel lighter and cleaner.  Sometimes nowadays when I go to events I see these younger people eating piles of pork and guzzling down beer, it makes me sick.  Especially after what I have read on here.  Someday when they find out , I wonder how they will react. I truly feel they are putting something in our food and possibly meat.  Yuck.

                  They're definitely lacing our food, beverages, even the air we breathe. I try to limit the meat I consume to wild game that I harvest myself. I also grow non-GMO vegetables and spices. Unfortunately, I can't eliminate all of their toxins from my system, but I can try.

              it is increasingly obvious that anything can be posted here--even the same story a dozen times--but they can't seem to stand the light of truth shone on a certain group of (((people))).

               I know one of those people.  He worked in a meat packing plant and was born here, but was afraid because his parents were not documented.  They also worked in that plant for 25 years.  The father died in a horrible accident there, he does not go into detail, for it is painful.  He now has a decent job but worked there for about 5 years while going to school.  He now makes enough to support his Mother. He is one of the nicest people and would give you the shirt off his back.  His Mother too.  They came here because the town they lived in was nearly cleared out do to people moving to the north for promise of work.  Lying companies that made wonderful offers that were never met.  I am so sick of these immigrants being maligned when it is the fault of the Corporations and our Govt. and THEIR Govt. for not taking care of the people. Sorry, I will get off my soap box now.

                 They will suffer for what they are doing to his children.  That is what Jesus said.  If they harm even a hair on their heads they will suffer.  I hope they are suffering beyond what we can imagine.  They do what they do, and we think they enjoy it, but I wonder.  Inside, do some wish they could stop, but they are caught in a web of no return.  I hope the suffer day and night. May they all burn in hell.

                   I've long suspected that the real reason the elites want to live so long, and will drink children's blood and eat their organs, is because they are so terrified of what will happen to them after they leave this existence.

                    Could be. It could also be that they think that this is "all there is" and they have no idea what eternal torment awaits them. People with NDE's have seen it and tried to warn people but the elites are certainly not looking at that.
