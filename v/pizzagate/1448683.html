<p>Guess who founded Georgetown University? The Jesuits.</p>
<p><em>Georgetown University is a private research university in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in the United States.</em></p>

<p>*In a twist of irony, LUCIFER’s neighbors are Catholic Jesuits at the Vatican’s observatory on Mount Graham. The neighboring Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, or VATT, is manned by Jesuit astronomers.&quot;</p>
<p>The Vatican observatory’s website even features a video titled, “NASA and the Vatican’s infrared telescope called Lucifer.”*</p>
<p>Lucifer was more or less subtly inaugurated as God (Vatican insiders refer to this influence as the &quot;superforce&quot;):</p>

<p><em>Most frighteningly for [Pope] John Paul [II], he had come up against the irremovable presence of a malign strength in his own Vatican and in certain bishops’ chanceries. It was what knowledgeable Churchmen called the ‘superforce.’ Rumors, always difficult to verify, tied its installation to the beginning of Pope Paul VI’s reign in 1963. Indeed Paul had alluded somberly to ‘the smoke of Satan which has entered the Sanctuary’. . . an oblique reference to an enthronement ceremony by Satanists in the Vatican. Besides, the incidence of Satanic pedophilia—rites and practices— was already documented among certain bishops and priests as widely dispersed as Turin, in Italy, and South Carolina, in the United States.

<p>Examine this sculpture (which supposedly depicts Jesus\' resurrection from the crater of a nuclear bomb). Do you notice that his head and hair really look like a <em>serpent</em> hiding in plain sight? Does this perchance suggest that the plan of the elite (or a faction thereof) is to achieve the New World Order via a nuclear holocaust followed by Hegelian synthesis? Food for thought.[/conspiracytheory]</p>
<p>I could go on for hours about Satanic and monetary connections to the Jesuit-coöpted Vatican (in its own right famous for covering child abuse up), but this will do for now. I urge you guys to look into it, you\'ll find so much dirt it\'s fucking unbelievable.</p>
<p>Note that I am not trying to proclaim that Catholics are evil or that every Catholic establishment figure is a covert Satanist. It is important to know that a lot of them are, though...</p>',

             Very interesting, I didn't know that. Thanks for contributing! Adding bits from his Wikipedia article:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              In 1976, he graduated from Rockhurst High School, a Jesuit all-boys preparatory school in Kansas City, Missouri.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              He entered Harvard Law School in 1979, interrupting his law studies after his first year to work in Honduras[12][13][a] for nine months from 1980 to 1981, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso.[9][16] While running a vocational center that taught carpentry and welding, he also helped increase the school's enrollment by recruiting local villagers.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Why do these people enjoy working with children so much? Bleh.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              The New York Times wrote that "in hyperpartisan Washington, he is often seen as a centrist" while also describing him as an "old-fashioned liberal...
             </em>
             <em>
              driven by Jesuit ideals
             </em>
             <em>
              ."...
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that I do not believe that the Jesuit-usurped Vatican is THE source par excellence of all this filth. Masonry, which was at war with the Jesuits (and possibly still is, despite superficial compliments and "reconciliation").
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill Cooper suggested that we are dealing with a faction war between people who agree on fundamental principles (keep the sheeple dumbed down, don't mention my child rape sacrifice rituals and I won't mention yours, NWO, et cetera) but disagree on the specifics of what the global government should actually be like.
            </p>
            <p>
             The factions involved, according to Cooper (who was murdered by cops outside his home, officially for having a gun, but probably in actuality for laying out major red pills), are the Jesuit Vatican, French/continental Masonry, British Masonry, and the Zionists. These groups obviously collude to some extent, but they also have considerable differences, I believe.

            I'd like to add that Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the actual Illuminati (as far as we know), was educated by Jesuits.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven at a Jesuit school.
            </em>
           </p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jesuit order was banned in 1773 by a papal bull issued by Pope Clement XIII. Dominus ac Redemptor Noster:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             ...having further considered that the said Company of Jesus can no longer produce those abundant fruits...in the present case, we are determining upon the fate of a society classed among the mendicant orders, both by its institute and by its privileges; after a mature deliberation, we do, out of our certain knowledge, and the fulness of our apostolical power, suppress and abolish the said company: we deprive it of all activity whatever...And to this end a member of the regular clergy, recommendable for his prudence and sound morals, shall be chosen to preside over and govern the said houses; so that the name of the Company shall be, and is, for ever extinguished and suppressed. ...
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Not too long thereafter, though, Pope Pius VII restored the order universally (AD 1814), although it was banned for practising and promoting all manner of sin and attempting to usurp the legitimate governments of Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            It isn't immediately clear why he would do so. Blue pill history asserts that he "resolved" to do it during his captivity in France. Was he threatened? Very likely, I'd say.
