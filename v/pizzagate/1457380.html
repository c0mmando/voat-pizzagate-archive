            As a survivor, I can say the biggest problem currently faced is the celebrity worship in media, and the MSM controlling the narrative of the news.
           </p>
           <p>
            So many victims cannot come forward seeing their perpetrators being heralded as Gods and heros on TV, in the movies, in music, etc. MSM perpetuates a sort of idol worship over these people, offering them a blanket of protection. Same with politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            How the hell is someone supposed to come up against someone powerful like the Clintons and not end up dead or in a nuthouse? 
MSM goes into automatic firing squad mode on anyone and anything that does not follow their narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless we can overcome the MSM, the voice of truth will continue to be censored and silenced. Look at how Reddit has banned discussion of Pizzagate! Twitter does the same to user accounts discussing it! TV news won't even cover the story!
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it: a powerful billionaire like Donald Trump didn't conform to their wants, and they tried to utterly destroy him. What chance does the average person have in trying to come forward?
           </p>
           <p>
            Only solution I can see is more sites like this becoming popular. End the monopoly of Google who censors results and manipulates search results. FCC needs to grant television licenses to conservative media groups like Breitbart.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another problem is people are so dumbed down due to the media and our education system. They do not know basic facts about what is going on in this country. I feel this dumbing down of America and the West is intentional. Without an informed, educated populace, they can get away with literal murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Romans 16:20: The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.

             It seems like there's no way forward, but the internet empowers us. We are here standing with you investigating these crimes and opening the eyes of the people, through the power of the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know people have been looking into these things for decades. I think that the momentum that pizzagate has will be very hard to stop.

              Yes. It seems like the momentum is on our side. Internet is making things that were impossible now possible.

             Chelsea Manning is actually claiming that she has been subjected to psychological torture while in prison. Her statements are shocking and it and it sounds like the methods developed under this so-called "Monarch" project were used on her.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can find her dramatic statement in a legal document that was reported on by the NYT:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/04/us/document-chelsea-manning.html">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             tl;dr Manning was subjected to a very creepy "Mock rescue" scenario.

             /r/DID

            after searching for 'ritual abuse', 'paedo', 'sexual abuse', 'SRA' etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's eye opening to see them discussing their experiences that they've had anonymously and independently of investigators like us.
           </p>
           <p>
            They often talk around the pagan festival times, festivals when these rituals get played out. We should try to list these festival dates and correlate them with the movements of suspected participants.

             I keep thinking about this post bro. I wish now I could have switched my major to psychology years back :/. I believe in doing what's right and to see all those posts on those forums, it really hits you deep. Again, thanks for the post man, really was eye opening.

              is right - if you are a psychologist or social worker who is trained to talk with these people then perhaps.
             </p>
             <p>
              But us armchair investigators should not get involved. Remember these are the people we are fighting for! We don't want them getting overwhelmed with attention
