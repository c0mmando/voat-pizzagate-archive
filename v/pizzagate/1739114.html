            I ALWAYS post pics of my children on websites and use the words RAW AND UNCUT as well as YOU can see them for a limited time, sarcasm. If this is normal to you, then you need therapy.

            , see this? Isn't it interesting?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like I expect theists to believe in pizzagate and atheists not to. Not simply because theists believe dumb things and atheists are skeptical, but because atheists don't believe satanists are a real thing and are in disbelief about the extent people can take religious views seriously.

           <p>
            eagleshigh, how's your atheism, goy?

            how do you explain all the pictures with blatantly sexual innuendo and pizza-related imagery? The phrase "cheese pizza" is WELL KNOWN as a euphemism for child pornography or child prostitution. The urbandictionary entry predates the pizzagate scandal by years. These pictures were not "cherry picked" from CPP/Alefantis' instagram - they were literally all over it.
           </p>
           <p>
            also, you never answered my question about your educational/academic background and what exactly makes you think you have such superior "critical thinking" skills and that you know anything about "logic."

            I don't care what you think about OP's tone, that's fucking weird. I mean, I can't even understand why people put their kids and grandchildren on social media at all, much less be weird about it- I've even put it in my kid's parenting plan- NO PICS, NO VIDEO!!
           </p>
           <p>
            And I'm sick and tired of the excuse that these "folks" just have strange expressions. Hell, yeah, they do!
They talk like freaking creeps.

               Seeing as my family turned on me and tried to claim that it was weird I watch videos of little children after showing them the evidence and emails of the DNC of which most of them are supporters of. I think it's safe to say we are at war with consciousness itself.
