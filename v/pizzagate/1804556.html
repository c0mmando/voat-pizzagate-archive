            Every single Protocol has come true over the last 100 years they have all been put into effect into action so whoever wrote them was a genius an evil genius but brilliant. Zionists have been following them to the letter as a road map to world conquest. They control the news media the banks and the government and the military. Critics keep harping that "they are fake!" but they are all real. Doesn't matter who wrote them what matters is who has been following them and implementing them.

            One of the scariest sections of the Protocols details their plans to bring down Christianity.  Especially given what we know about the plans of the Freemasons (via Alta Vendita), Rosicrucians and B'nai Brith to infiltrate and bring down the Catholic Church.  Which they have very much succeeded, as much as I hate to admit it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Protocol XVII
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             The practice of advocacy produces men cold, cruel, persistent, unprincipled, who in all cases take up an impersonal, purely legal standpoint. They have the inveterate habit to refer everything to its value for the defense and not to the public welfare of its results. They do not usually decline to undertake any defense whatever, they strive for an acquittal at all costs, caviling over every petty crux of jurisprudence and thereby they demoralize justice. For this reason we shall set this profession into narrow frames which will keep it inside this sphere of executive public service. Advocates, equally with judges, will be deprived of the right of communication with litigant; they well receive business only from the court and will study it by notes of report and documents, defending their clients after they have been interrogated in court on facts that have appeared. They will receive an honorarium without regard to the quality of the defense. This will render them mere reporters on law-business in the interests of justice and as counterpoise to the proctor who will be the reporter in the interests of prosecution; this will shorten business before the courts. In this way will be established a practice of honest unprejudiced defense conducted not from personal interest but by conviction. This will also, by the way, remove the present practice of corrupt bargain between advocation to agree only to let that side win which pays most .....
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            WE SHALL DESTROY THE CLERGY
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              WE HAVE LONG PAST TAKEN CARE TO DISCREDIT THE PRIESTHOOD OF "GOYIM," and thereby to ruin their mission on earth which in these days might still be a great hindrance to us. Day by day its influence on the peoples of the world is falling lower. FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE HAS BEEN DECLARED EVERYWHERE, SO THAT NOW ONLY YEARS DIVIDE US FROM THE MOMENT OF THE COMPLETE WRECKING OF THAT CHRISTIAN RELIGION: as to other religions we shall have still less difficulty in dealing with them, but it would be premature to speak of this now. We shall act clericalism and clericals into such narrow frames as to make their influence move in retrogressive proportion to its former progress.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              When the time comes finally to destroy the papal court the finger of an invisible hand will point the nations towards this court. When, however, the nations fling themselves upon it, we shall come forward in the guise of its defenders as if to save excessive bloodshed. By this diversion we shall penetrate to its very bowels and be sure we shall never come out again until we have gnawed through the entire strength of this place.

            It's been known for about 100 years that the Protocol of the Elders of Zion was a forgery.   It's believed to be written a year or two before its publishing date of 1903 and has been known to be fake for decades before there was an MSM. The first Russian journalist who mentioned them, refused to publish them after he read them because he felt they were fake.  It was later determined this forgery plagiarized several different sources, including a good part of the work of Maurice Joly who was writing about Napoleon the III, not the Jews.

            There was actually a trial in Switzerland in the 1930s where they heard from experts including attendees of the First Zionist Conference in 1897.  The judge ruled them a forgery.
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally, the story was this was a document written at a secret meeting of Jews in 1897, but that meeting wasn't secret and many non Jews witnessed what when on there.  Then, the story changed and the meeting was moved to 1901 or 1902.

He was the protege of Adolph Cremieux (Isaac Moise Cremieux 1796-1880) the head of the lodge and a Minister in the Jewish-backed government of Leon Gambetta."

            On December 22, 1972, in Kiel Auditorium, the most dramatic event occurred when Gena Scott slid down a power cable and unmasked the Prophet, who that year was Monsanto Company executive vice president Tom K. Smith, according to the St. Louis Journalism Review.[9] But newspapers at the time refused to print his identity, although likely at least 100 people saw him. The papers claimed that the unmasking was too brief but it has been documented that their editorial policy led to suppression of customary journalistic reporting.[8]On December 22, 1972, in Kiel Auditorium, the most dramatic event occurred when Gena Scott slid down a power cable and unmasked the Prophet, who that year was Monsanto Company executive vice president Tom K.

Her place was vandalized numerous times.[8] (Lucy Ferriss explores these events in her memoir, Unveiling the Prophet. Her aunt Ann Chittenden Ferriss, was selected as the 1931 Queen of Love and Beauty). The unveiling of the Prophet was the most dramatic disruption in ACTION's long campaign (1965-1976) to encourage the many CEOs in the VP Organization to hire more minority workers at their businesses. While VP spokesmen said they took no notice of ACTION, its leader Percy Green had been laid off in 1964 and never was able to get another job for a St. Louis corporation.[8]

            It is worth reading for any serious researcher. There are many interesting things in there.

            This is one that always stood out to me..... "Protocol 9
13. You may say that the GOYIM will rise upon us, arms in hand, if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against this a manoeuvre of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail - the undergrounds, metropolitans, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organizations and archives."

             Is this referring to the underground tunnels of Washington DC, etc...? Doesn't this imply that as of the time the protocols were written, the tunnels didn't exist but their creation was being planned?

             When we at last definitely come into our kingdom by the aid of COUPS D'ETAT prepared everywhere for one and the same day, after definitely acknowledged  we shall make it our task to see that against us such things as plots shall no longer exist. With this purpose we shall slay without mercy all who take arms  to oppose our coming into our kingdom. Every kind of new institution of anything like a secret society will also be punished with death; THOSE OF THEM WHICH ARE NOW IN EXISTENCE, ARE KNOWN TO US, SERVE US AND HAVE SERVED US, we shall disband and send into exile to continents far removed from Europe. IN THIS WAY WE SHALL PROCEED WITH THOSE "GOY" MASONS WHO KNOW TOO MUCH; such of these as we may for some reason spare will be kept in constant fear of exile. We shall promulgate a law making all former members of secret societies liable to exile from Europe as the center of rule.

              Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves, to the founders of this affair. WE EXECUTE MASONS IN SUCH WISE THAT NONE SAVE THE BROTHERHOOD CAN EVER HAVE A SUSPICION OF IT, NOT EVEN THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES OF OUR DEATH SENTENCE, THEY ALL DIE WHEN REQUIRED AS IF FROM A NORMAL KIND OF ILLNESS ..... Knowing this, even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. By such methods we have plucked out of the midst of MASONRY the very root of protest against our disposition. While preaching liberalism to the GOY we at the same time keep our own people and our agents in a state of unquestioning submission.

             Some 'people' say that the protocols are 'fake', an 'anti-semitic canard. 
Whoever wrote it seems to be well versed in the Talmud.

              OF COURSE they say that!  :)    It's also hilarious that "You're an anti-semite" is the only retort they can come up with.  :)

               Exactly. I have read a lot of rabbinic literature over the years and I believe the PoZ were written by a rabbi. They espouse the teachings of the rabbis and the jewish prophecies.

            Been lurking for 5 months and i can't hold it back any longer.  Really need to understand how long this has been going on and how difficult it will be for governments to expose.

            From POZ:
Meantime, however, until we come into our kingdom, we shall act in the contrary way: we shall create and multiply free masonic lodges in all the countries of the world, absorb into them all who may become or who are prominent in public activity, for these lodges we shall find our principal intelligence office and means of influence. All these lodges we shall bring under one central administration, known to us alone and to all others absolutely unknown, which will be composed of our learned elders. The lodges will have their representatives who will serve to screen the above-mentioned administration of MASONRY and from whom will issue the watchword and program. In these lodges we shall tie together the knot which binds together all revolutionary and liberal elements. Their composition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret political plots will be known to us and fall under our guiding hands on the very day of their conception. AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THESE LODGES WILL BE ALMOST ALL THE AGENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL POLICE since their service is for us irreplaceable in the respect that the police is in a position not only to use its own particular measures with the insubordinate, but also to screen our activities and provide pretexts for discontents, ET CETERA.
