            I too want the search bar back and I think it's a shame that the '100 submission points buffering before downvoating' rule has been cancelled without notice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I almost feel like a little girl begging her heartless stepmother for her bike back or something. That little girl knows it's totally up to her 'handler' and deep down inside knows it's a waste of time, but she still begs for it back because she can't bring herself to stay silent and continues to harbour some small secret hope that she'll be able to bring about some sense of compassion out of her stepmother. There's another word for it too: pathetic LOL

              this place is operating at about half of what it was a month ago, but suddently, when pedogate interest has a chance to spike again, the anti-protest sticky appears, and the search is disabled.  At the very best, it is the absolutely worst management any site could possibly execute.  If they tried to work against the interests of pedogate, they would do exactly those moves.

               But the search has come off all subverses - I think.  It could be related to the dumping of
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               from the Google searches.  Peter Thiel does own voat after all!  But to take it off just to spike
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               seems a bit extreme.  Can you just ask them why they did it?  And ask for them to put it back.

                YingYangMom asked, several voaters asked.   It was supposed to be put back up 2 days ago now  after "testing" how much 'load" it caused the site.
               </p>
               <p>
                The whole thing is BS.   It was not taken off all subverses, most subverses didn't have it.  But this place always had it from the beginning and even when it had a lot of traffic, whcih it doesn't have now.  They probably want to install code to be able to track who searches what or cripple the searches in some way or some other nefarious bs.   It will be interesting to see if it appears again after the prostest they hope to crush on the 25th.

                  just monitor the stats on the right side of the page.  We used to have 3000 plus here regularly now it is good to get over 1500 and that is not that often, uusally less than 1000  of course it varies, but it is easy to see and also you can see the static front page, stuff doesn't move for hours and days.  Used to move a lot faster.

            yes, another coincidence!  : )  I'm glad to hear some feedback do you have some links on the guy that created it?  I'd really like to take a look.  btw i really liked this post of yours - opened my eyes a bit more about shills.  Worthwhile to cross post here, this is a possible Craigslist Ad For Shills

            May be coincidence, and imitation is the highest form of flattery, but I'm starting to wonder how many of you are posting more for the limelight than to actually help.

             I had been working on that post for a few hours, started it and then had to go and come back.  It actually is a coincidence.  I hardly see it as something that will earn any kind of limelight status.  Must be something to do with how people feel disenfranchised by losing the search bar without warning which was promised to return yesterday, so we all feel the need to help our fellow investigators out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also without the search bar, we obviously can't quickly look and find out if others are posting similarly, but honestly it did not occur to me to check because this submission was a bit unusual for me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you have any information about the search bar status?
