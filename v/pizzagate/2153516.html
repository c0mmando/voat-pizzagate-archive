            I am starting to think that the CIA,  when suspicion activates of their come to light, puts out a rumor of what they are doing.  The rumor is bad, but not nearly as bad as what they are really doing.  As an example, when Obama made a secret payment to the terrorist.  He said it was giving Iran back its own money.  The reason that was 'supposedly' uncovered for the payment was that it was ransom for Bergdahl.  Neither of those was good.  But I believe the real reason, was for the money to be funneled back into the Democrat coffers to get Hillary elected.  They would rather the payment be seen as a secret ransom than as a kickback to them.  That would have been really bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am just thinking that the CIA put  a rumor out that the planes were for spraying chemicals, when  a much worse, totally unacceptable purpose would be to traffick people, or dispose of bodies, etc.

            George has always know about pizzagate and has gathered all the evidence. He has pictures and videos of children being slaughtered for their organs after they were held as sex slaves for years. He has not spoken as much because this will cost him his life.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is already hunted by the FBI who falsely arrested him a few months ago after questioning why Imran Awan had diplomatic containers on Maris Menske. He was given info.from an intelligence oberative the containers carried DU= Depleted Uranium....George was falsely arrested in a trap but went to the judge andctold her what had happened and the FBI was lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            He then provided proof that there is a spy ring in congress who are also involved in selling, transporting uranium. Everyone called this a fake "Dirty bomb scare" Then George went court with stacks of evidence, the US confirmed Imran Awan was shipping weapons, DU and much worse in these containers. The judge throughout the case and stated he had been falsely arrested. He filed a 100 million dollar lawsuit against the FBI .....
           </p>
           <p>
            He has continued investigating. He also has evidence of the Afganistan opiate trade once again being flown into the US by CIA. Planes actually land in Chicago O'hare with fusil lodges full of heroin.
           </p>
           <p>
            He futher has proof poppy seeds are being transported to Pakistan from Afganistan where a large plant manufactures pain meds. They are cutting and forming fetaynol to be sold in the US on the streets that is there is why massive opiate deaths have occurred.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition Pakistan ISI Imran Awan and buddies deliver other pain meds that are sold to hospital and clinics watered down so they are almost like placebos. These are sold to Veterans hospitals and other legit hospitals so people in actual horrid pain are getting watered down pills and accusing patients of pill popping because they are in so much pain nothing works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unbeknownst to most doctors they are giving literal sugar pills to wounded soldiers and some who have been just operated on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pain clinics that popped up all over the Midwest and east coast are all owned and run by Awans and pretend doctors from Pakistan....giving out fetanol for as much money as possible then harvesting their organs when they are dead...think about Chicago that is what has happened. The drugs flown into O'hare massive violence rises, shootings, opiate overdose, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are locations in Chicago where you can turn a dead body in for $5000 dollars....
           </p>
           <p>
            Wonder why Obama never once addressed the massive deaths in Chicago for 8 years? Wonder why R.Emanuel (now mayor) never brought it up? Or HRC (whose hometown it is)?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is called #Awancontra  for those that don't know #IranContra was Vice Pres  George H.W, Bush running drugs for weapons and the drugs were delivered to his buddy Bill Clinton in Arkansas at the memo airport by the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you think Bill won the election then the presidency? His handlers arranged the whole thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imran Awan and friends were brought into this country and Yes they are ISI but if anyone believes he is not working for the CIA you should read up on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is real...George knew it. He has actual photos of children on farms with their bodies marked for what organs will be taken....I posted a while back Syrian children dead all on a farm and then a bag of "kidsshells" of emptied out children's remains stuffed in see through bags., I was called many names for it but it is true. GW had the original picture.,
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't agree with him on everything but he has massive evidence and several of us has known he was bidding his time grabbing evidence and waiting to spring it all....
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a quick summary.

             . I have been following George's installments since day 70(? I think) and your accounting of what he has reported is spot on. Hopefully, that will bring some people up to speed on what has been discovered thus far. It will probably also bring a lot of trolls out from under the bridge, unfortunately.

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Evergreen International Airlines was a cargo airline based in McMinnville, Oregon, United States. It operated contract freight services, offering charters and scheduled flights, as well as wet lease services. It operated services for the U.S. military and the United States Postal Service, as well as ad hoc charter flights. Its crew base was at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York.[2]
Evergreen also maintained a large aircraft maintenance and storage facility at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona that the company acquired from the CIA's Air America fleet.
            </p>
            <p>
             History.  The airline was established by Delford Smith (founder and owner) and began operations in 1960 as Evergreen Helicopters. It acquired the operating certificate of Johnson Flying Service and merged it with Intermountain Airlines from Pacific Corporation (a CIA front company) in 1975 to form Evergreen International Airlines. The holding company, Evergreen International Aviation, formed in 1979, wholly owns the airline.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             One of Evergreen's Boeing 747 airplanes (registered N473EV, which suffered an in-flight engine separation in 1993) starred in the 1990 action film Die Hard 2. Additionally, Evergreen Boeing 727's were featured in numerous films including Donnie Brasco with Al Pacino, and The Rookie with Clint Eastwood.
            </p>
            <p>
             On November 9, 2013, it was announced that Evergreen Airlines would close on November 30, 2013 due to financial troubles.[6][7] This information was initially denied by Evergreen, but shortly afterwards admitted to, [8] "Evergreen International Airlines flew its last flight Monday [December 2, 2013] Mike Hines, chairman of its parent company board, acknowledged..."[9]
            </p>
            <p>
             Evergreen also owned a museum and waterpark, called the Evergreen Wings and Waves Waterpark. This remains open, despite the company's bankruptcy. One of Evergreen's 747-100s is mounted on the roof of the waterpark, serving as the housing for the top of four of the waterpark's slides.
            </p>
            <p>
             On December 31, 2013, Evergreen International Airlines filled a Chapter 7 petition in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware. The bankruptcy filing lists seven entities as submitting the Chapter 7 petition: Evergreen Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprise, Evergreen Defense and Security Services, Evergreen International Airlines, Evergreen International Aviation, Evergreen Systems Logistics, Evergreen Trade, and Supertanker Services.[10]
