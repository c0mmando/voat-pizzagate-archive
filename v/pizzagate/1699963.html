<p>THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA
An international financing organization that… okay, let’s be real. Its only purpose is to “attract and disburse additional resources ($$$$) to prevent and treat HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria”.
 having raised $30 billion since 2002; not so good at the “disbursing” part. There have been numerous 
complaints of fund mismanagement and corruption. </p>

<p>As a highlight of the article, the UN Development Program (UNDP) which is responsible for managing and supervising a large chunk of their funds successfully claimed diplomatic immunity to prevent internal audits of programs carried out in more than two-dozen nations. This was after the Global Fund had already been caught misusing funds on multiple occasions, of course.</p>
<p>There are multiple Wikileaks documents that confirm the amount of fraudulent activity going on with this institution. Here is a cable describing a meeting set up by Global Fund members to intervene in a Mauritanian aid program that had somehow misplaced or misused millions of dollars (74% of its grant value). The Global Fund then blames the local committee and suspends all aid until the missing money is reimbursed. Note that the Mauritanians don’t accept responsibility, instead blaming the various members of the NGO community that The Global Fund was working with.

<p>This seems to be a common pattern. Lend money to a local government; money disappears; cut off aid unless money is reimbursed; dispatch a corruption report to anybody involved in the Global Fund; have grounds to 
claim that the Fund is hard on corruption and transparent about its dealings.
It should come as no surprise that Hillary finds a way to get involved with this. Here is an email chain where she is being looped in on an aggressive effort to choose some new leadership for the GF’s “reform”: [<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/29292">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/29292</a>]</p>
<p>Additionally, this email shows that Huma Abedin is also associated the Global Fund. Haven’t been following the Huma investigation as closely as I’d like, but hope this helps!

            It also important to note that CHAI Clinton Health Access Initiative leverages overpriced drugs in the US market (price fixing) to supply watered down cheap drugs to other countries, so basically us taxpayers and us drug customers are gouged and forced to pay for subsidized drugs for other countries.

             I think it's within reason that the Clinton's are a well established part of the Pizzagate/Pedogate puzzle.
I'm actually surprised that you have to ask such a question bro:)

              Just being relevant to Clinton isn't sufficient.  Going to need to hear a hypothetical connection to pizzagate itself.
