            This makes me sick. I cannot get over how many times I've seen pedos use the LGBQT community movements as a piggy back opportunity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd also like to point out the age of consent information mentioned in the tweets is incorrect. If I understand the laws of Japan correctly they are allowing children over 13 to engage in relationships if the kids consent to it and it is with another juvenile. The parents weigh in on the nature of the relationship to determine of it is "unethical" until the age of 18. I guess they recognize the reality of sexual exploration between children but also recognize that juveniles are not in a position to fully choose for themselves when in a relationship with an adult.

            I get what your saying for sure. They were posting yesterday. But if it's fake, good. Glad they won't be gathering. If it's real, they are FOOLS for thinking people will accept their "Love who you want to love" angle.

            It reminds me of all the Dumbass protests.  They clump a 100 "issues" into one march. One guy is saying whites are the problems of ALL and there should be a white genocide. And ya, the guy was white. Who breeds these morons?

            They are all over Twitter and FB. Some claim to be in in gay relationships, others married but they feel love is love. Seriously, they say this. And it's HATE and bigotry to deny someone who they love.

            Political Correctness at it's finest, soon SJW's will be fighting for pedophiles rights to have sex with children.  Pedophiles will adopt kids to groom them to be sexual partners, homosexuals pedophiles parents will take their straight adopted children and stick their noodles in their butts. Sexual degeneracy is getting out of control, makes me want to burn America to the ground and start all over.  Sexual deviancy will be the downfall of America, everybody wants to do what they want, rather than doing what is right.  What next bestiality, I mean come on we got to have some self restraint and discipline to control these urges. Who knows; maybe they'll legalize murder one day to accommodate killers.  It's as if evil is slowly taking over our society and we're are allowing it, because people have lost their God given moral compass.

             Yes to the second part.  Average Joes are as godless now as the founders.

             America was founded by satanists.  The U.S. is a fascist oligarchy; ergo the people are really powerless.  (They go to great lengths putting on "shows' for us in media to convince us otherwise.)

             People didn't just lose the compass, many of them gleefully threw it away for purposes of unlimited indulgence of self-gratification and urging others to do the same.

              A million times this. Understanding Crowley and his role in all of this is one of the baseline red pills that has to be consumed in order to make sense of it all. They want a society full of completely out of control degenerates who are morally okay with rape, pedophilia, and murder. That way the secret societies don't have to be secret anymore.

               Very well put! Okay, so I've restarted my response a few times it's so overwhelming on how to comment briefly without writing ending up writing volumes of info interspersed with serious rants lol. For now I'm just throwing this out there:

               "Secret Agent 666 - Aleister Crowley, British Intelligence And The Occult"
              </p>
              <p>
               ""The Great Beast" has been the subject of several biographies, some painting him as a misunderstood genius, others as a manipulative charlatan. None of them have looked seriously at his career as an agent of British Intelligence.   Using documents gleaned from British, American, French and Italian archives, Secret Agent 666 sensationally reveals that Crowley played a major role in the sinking of the Lusitania, a plot to overthrow the government of Spain, the thwarting of Irish and Indian nationalist conspiracies, and the 1941 flight of Rudolf Hess.
              </p>
              <p>
               Author Richard Spence argues that Crowley-in his own unconventional way-was a patriotic Englishman who endured years of public vilification in part to mask his role as a secret agent.   The verification of the Great Beast's participation in the twentieth century's most astounding government plots will likely blow the minds of history as well as occult aficionados. "
              </p>
              <p>
               And from Wikipedia the we read that Crowley rejected Christianity (however, it could be easily argues that he really never learned about it.) The overreaching theme of Crowley's life is wide travel, an unstable, perhaps borderline personality, obsession with sexuality, especially while exploring nearly occult practice one can imagine, yet adhering to none because it appears he a god complex. He experienced either hallucinations or demonic possession depending how one looks at it:
              </p>
              <p>
               "According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of Aiwass, the messenger of Horus, or Hoor-Paar-Kraat. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it Liber L vel Legis or The Book of the Law.[58] The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon, and that Crowley would serve as its prophet.
              </p>
              <p>
               It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, Thelema.[59] Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law. Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included (break here for emphasis):
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum,
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages."
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               <em>
                Yeah well those instructions really sucked /sacr So...
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               "According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.[60]"
               <em>
                He simultaneously rejected and followed his own inane law!
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               But recall: "Crowley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896.[22] Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed that this was the result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality.[23]"
               <em>
                If Aiwass' instructions didn't include having an orgy island then screw it!
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               Of note of the themes of British Intelligence and Sexual obsession:
              </p>
              <p>
               "In 1897, Crowley travelled to St Petersburg in Russia, later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there.[26] Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.[27]"
              </p>
              <p>
               1907-1909 Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco.[83] The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism.[84]
              </p>
              <p>
               "Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career.[95]" 1909-1911

             So what Clive is defending by including the term "Pedosexual" is an endorsement of child/infant rape and murder.  Or maybe he would draw the line at just endorsing pedophiles' right to prey on kids and steal their childhoods as a sacrifice on the altar of pedophile self-gratification. If I don't start hearing some serious push back from the LGBQT community to people like Clive, on these kinds of accounts, I swear to God it's the last time I defend or stand up for their rights.

              I know how you feel.  He is advocating the stealing of a Child's Soul.  Perverted Vermin.  I have stood behind the LGBTQ community for years and I am waiting for them to throw this group under the bus.  My patience is wearing thin.  Maybe we should be asking them to step forward.  Is there a famous gay person that we know would be brave enough to come forward?
