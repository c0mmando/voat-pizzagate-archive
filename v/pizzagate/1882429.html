            Why is that son laughing? It's so out of place. I know a guy who didn't get along with his brother at all. He would go on for hours about what pompous ass hole his brother was and that he never saw him anymore and really didn't have any desire to see him again. Then one Saturday his brother got killed. He'd been drunk and fallen off a roof at a party. My friend was distraught and in shock. He could barely speak and was holding back tears and that was for a brother who he hated with a passion. It took at least 6 months for my friend to get back to normal.........There is something wrong with the brother in this video. You wouldn't be laughing at a time like that.

             What gets me is that it just doesn't add up for him to be holding back laughter. Even if he hated Seth or even if Seth was actually safe and in protection and the bro knew it, still you would put on a game face, it's not hard to do especially in that situation. It just doesn't make sense. I personally don't think he was trying not to laugh, but something else unknown to us was going on.

            Here they are smiling again at the scene of the crime a few weeks later...even Seth Rich's girlfriend;

            "did you hear crisis actor #1, playing "pops" say "people and bullets aren't a good mix"...?!  That'd be like you making a joke about "needles and old dogs" (I've been there twice; once recently.)  NO ONE makes jokes about how someone they love DIED.  ("Twice in the back" was kind of a little too much info.  Why would you be so specific?  Anyone who wasn't a crisis actor would say: "He was murdered" or "He was shot".  Sounds like "pop's" script-writer was a "Guns Kill People" Clintonite/Obamite.  Here's an "interesting" pic of this lovely family at the site of their son's -- supposedly -- murder scene!

            First, WHY WOULD THEY GO THERE...?!?!  Do you want to go back to the vet's office and relive your best friend's last minutes?!  That's not "rational" or logical, or emotional, or ANYTHING natural/normal.  Their masters want these actors to MAKE FOX LOOK BAD.  Talk about fucked up priorities, eh?!?!  Notice their facial expressions.  The actress playing "GF" is trying to look sad.  Brother Giggles is stifling still more laughter (I'll have TWO of what he's on).  "Pop's" motivation for this scene appears to be "it's a beautiful day".  Mom is kind of smiling because she's passing the propaganda her masters told her to provide to the shill press.  You notice who's missing?  YES!  THE PANDA!  Sorry about your dog.  We're suffering over our dogs 100x more than these satanic slaves/shills are suffering over the murder of the "son".  THEY'RE AT THE FUCKING MURDER SCENE!!  I'M SURPRISED THEY AREN'T LICKING THE FUCKING SIDEWALK!  If the camera wasn't there...﻿"

            I have watched this several times and although it seems he is in fact mouthing what she is saying (just as the camera pans away), I now think that he is just nervous, or he is licking his lips after speaking and coincidentally is looks like he is mouthing her words.. if he was looking at her whilst doing it I could draw a larger parallel.
