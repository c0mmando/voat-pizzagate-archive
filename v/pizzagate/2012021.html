            There is a U-haul directly across from the "unused" national guard airfield near Philadelphia, the city is a major child trafficking hub being that it is directly in between Washington DC and New York.

            Monarch Brands' website says it is a manufacturer and wholesaler of high-quality linens and microfiber products:

             https://www.monarchbrands.com/

            But the website has a page called "The Secret Life of Containers" that says "Wholesale textiles are not our value proposition. We exist as a company because we are experts in navigating the global marketplace."

            "The Products Your Project Can't Live Without" and their electrical wiring formed to look like a human heart.  Is it just clever advertising of electrical items or something else?  Warrants further research, I'd say.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to the lawsuit, the girl's traffickers lured customers to the inn through internet advertisements, had men call a number to negotiate a cash price for sex, then had the men go to the motel's front desk, where an employee directed them to a room where the girl was staying at.
            </p>
            <p>
             A hotel clerk named "Abdul" was fully aware that the girl "and other underage children were compelled to perform sex for money," the suit says.
            </p>
            <p>
             The room where the girl was forced to be a prostitute "contained used condoms and condom wrappers and the room frequently smelled of marijuana," had "Do Not Disturb" signs on the door and frequently had men and other minors go in and out, the suit further contends.
            </p>
            <p>
             The girl, identified in the lawsuit only as M.B., "was visibly treated in an aggressive manner by traffickers" and "exhibited fear and anxiety" in the hotel, the suit says, adding she "dressed in a sexually explicit manner" while walking the hallways.

             It is on Norcom road. The Monarch company moved into the previous atkore building in 2016 (says on their site) Atkore moved down a building. So I don't think either are on gmaps, at least last time I checked.

              At a smaller airport there might be fewer security personnel and video cameras. Also, the smaller airport might have an FBO so private planes can get serviced between flights. I imagine child traffickers can transport a higher volume kids by chartering entire small planes as compared to getting a few seats here and there on commercial flights. If there is an FBO at that airport, and you know someone who works there, they would be aware of regulars and have probably seen some things.

               Yeah if Pgate is really orchestrated by the elites, using smaller airports makes WAY more sense. Especially if you have businesses near or around it to support your operation.
