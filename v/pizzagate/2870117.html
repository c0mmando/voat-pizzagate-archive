<p>*Ex-Michigan State University President Charged with Lying to Police During Larry Nassar Case, Rampant Sexual Abuse of Top U.S. Gymnasts *</p>
<p>Finally. From the article :</p>
<p>&quot;Former Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon has been charged with lying to police, the latest charges to come from a state investigation into the university following the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal. </p>
<p>Simon has been charged in Eaton County District Court on two felony and two misdemeanor counts of lying to a peace officer. An arraignment date has not yet been set, per a court administrator. </p>
<p>The warrant issued by the Attorney General\'s office states Simon told investigators she was unaware of any specific investigations into Nassar prior to 2016 &quot;when in fact she knew it was Larry Nassar who was the subject of the 2014 MSU Title IX investigation.&quot; </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Attorney General\'s office declined to comment further. </p>
<p>In a statement, MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant said the university is aware of the charges brought against Simon and said Simon is taking an immediate leave of absence, without pay, to focus on her legal situation.&quot; </p>
<p>Simon stepped down from the presidency in January amid controversy over the university\'s handling of Nassar, who was sentenced earlier this year on criminal sexual conduct and federal child pornography charges. </p>
<p>In a letter posted on MSU\'s website at the time of her resignation, Simon said the &quot;last year and a hialf has been very difficult for the victims of Larry Nassar, for the university community, and for me personally.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Her words are shameful, and she needs to be punished.</p>',

            Excellent news. For some reason I was transfixed with this trial- probably because I have loved US gymnastics since I was little- I watched nearly all of it. The testimonials from the girls were heartbreaking, especially the girl whose father killed himself after he learned that what his daughter had tried to tell him (and which he rebuked her for saying about family friend Nassar) was true. Then the scumbag cried not out of remorse but out of fear for his own life. I wonder if his fellow inmates are more or less merciful to him than he was to his trusting patients.
           </p>
           <p>
            I cannot say enough about this creep and all the people who covered up for him, even after some girls were brave enough to speak up:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Much focus has centered on the university's handling of the 2014 Title IX complaint filed by Amanda Thomashow, who said Nassar molesting her during a March 2014 appointment at the MSU Sports Medicine Clinic for a hip injury.
            </p>
            <p>
             The university ultimately cleared Nassar of any wrongdoing, issuing a report saying that Tomashow didn't understand the "nuanced difference" between sexual assault and medical treatment. Nassar was allowed to return to work by his boss, Dr. William Strampel.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

              Ever since I was a kid, I've enjoyed watching the US Gymnastics team compete in the Olympics. But no, I haven't heard of this. Am curious to know more about it, though. Was it specifically connected to gymnastics? Does it relate to the coaches?

               I remember many athletes would defect in the 70's and 80's. Some legitimate, some purposefully, perhaps as spies, or other. If alive, they are still here, even after, the wall fell down. History has proven Joe McCarthy right on the infiltration and subversion of our schools by communists, and now our own government. They still demonize him to this day, but he was a patriotic Senator. Bolsheviks did not die, they just went into hiding. Now they are not hiding, and are showing us that they have infiltrated high positions in all fields.
