<h1>Attorney general probes nonprofit associated with NXIVM</h1>
<p>AG seeks records of Ethical Science Foundation and doctor tied to group</p>
<p>The state attorney general\'s office is investigating a nonprofit foundation associated with the NXIVM corporation that allegedly sponsored brain-activity and other human behavioral studies without any apparent oversight, according to court records.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Ethical Science Foundation was formed in 2007 by Clare W. Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Co. business empire who has described herself as the operations director of NXIVM. Bronfman, who owns a horse farm in Delanson, is listed in public records as the trustee and donor of the Ethical Science Foundation.</p>
<p>XIVM\'s supporters have insisted it is a self-help group focused on business and personal improvement.* [PERSONAL ASIDE: AND I\'M A PINK RABBIT}***** NXIVM officials and associates have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and dispute any allegation that it is a cult.</p>
<p>Internal Revenue Service records indicate the Ethical Science Foundation acquired more than $145,000 worth of computers, medical equipment and brain-activity monitors several years ago. A 2015 IRS form filed by the nonprofit listed its &quot;charitable activities&quot; as &quot;Tourettes study — studying the effects of a specific and innovative method has [sic] on individuals with Tourettes syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.&quot; ... </p>
<p>&quot;ESF has funded the research of Dr. Brandon Porter, a physician who has conducted human subject research under the auspices of ESF without oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or human research committee in violation of Public Health Law,&quot; the attorney general\'s office wrote in support of its application for court intervention. In general, they added, &quot;The failure to comply with human subject protections required by law is a gross violation of public policy.&quot; .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make a long sordid story short, that nutso heiress founded a nonprofit in 2007 and financed Porter\'s \'\'experiments.\'\' While they told <s>victims </s>participants that they would help with Tourette\'s Syndrome, the video shown focused on brutality, rape, torture ... the usual stuff one sees when trying to regain mental health. The amazing thing is that NXIVM claimed the non-curable Tourette\'s had been cured! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>NXIVM issued a statement on its website last October defending its practices following reports about Porter\'s experiment and the secret women\'s group that took part in branding rituals. The corporate statement noted the company\'s interest in research, saying: &quot;NXIVM has documented an initial case study of ten individuals suffering from Tourette\'s syndrome, a neurological disease known to be incurable, who were able to radically reduce, and in some cases completely eradicate, their symptoms.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I did a dumpster dive and found the website:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ethicalsciencefoundation.org/">http://www.ethicalsciencefoundation.org/</a></p>

<p>And the Linked In page for Ethical Science Foundation: </p>

<p>Although it promises 4 employees, it must have been scrubbed because only Clare Bronfman\'s name appears if you click on that link. But what did catch my eye is the part about CLIFTON PARK, NY. I did a search for VOAT and CLIFTON PARK ... and it\'s here things get interesting. The search came up with this: </p>

<p>It\'s a <a href="https://voat.co/user/argosciv">@argosciv</a> posted entitled: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Root of Corruption - Bridge: NXIVM property/corporate distribution in Albany, NY &amp; abroad</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the first lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Article points of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaelen was the first child enrolled into NXIVM\'s &quot;Rainbow Cultural Garden&quot;, at age 3</li>
<li>It isn\'t clear where the child came from.</li>
<li>Barbara Bouchey revealed that the boy came to the NXIVM associates around March 2007, shortly after his birth..</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>GAELEN? Did they say, &quot;GAELEN&quot;? </p>
<p>It\'s here the German Shepherd attacks. I\'d run across that name when researching Maggie Nixon. I have a very wide circle of friends and not one is named Gaelen. So what are the chances that this name matches the name of someone in the Nixon extended family? It could be a coincidence, but is there something more? As stated above, I was all set to post on Gaelen or Galen or however you\'re spelling that name these days. Is this one of those trendy transsexual names that you don\'t have to change when you\'re fed your hormone blockers in your cereal at the age of 3? You be the judge. </p>
<p>When I did the initial dumpster dive re: Maggie Nixon, I decided to try her extended family. After all, if it was as big a rabbit hole as touted, then the rest of Agnes Nixon\'s children must play a part, no? So when I dd the search for Agnes Nixon\'s children, the name of Mary Nixon came up: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/x5yVihE">https://imgur.com/a/x5yVihE</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turned out that Mary\'s married name was Hiltbrand and the first place I saw it was in an article on a fundraiser for DISADVANTAGED KIDS and the FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. How unusual? &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/December-2009/Feels-Like-Home/">http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/December-2009/Feels-Like-Home/</a></p>
<p>December 2009. Almost 200 people gathered at the Berwyn home of Mary Nixon Hiltbrand and her husband, David, for an afternoon of art and awareness to benefit Eddie’s House, which helps aged-out young adults make the transition from foster care to independent living. Lou Tilley, Lisa Thomas-Laury, Gretchen Burke, Linda Swain, Diane McGraw and other guests mingled among paintings and sculptures from three Delaware Valley artists displayed in the Hiltbrand barn. Program founder Sharon McGinley named the nonprofit after Eddie Lewis, who suffered severe trauma in Philadelphia’s foster care system. Lewis and All My Children creator Agnes Nixon were special guests at the event, which raised $30,000 for the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, isn\'t that lovely? Momma Agnes was on hand. And unfortunately, Eddie seems to have died a year later: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.phillytrib.com/news/ex-foster-care-youth-find-home-at-eddie-s-house/article_173a033d-a3a3-5298-ae00-c66ebff7af57.html">http://www.phillytrib.com/news/ex-foster-care-youth-find-home-at-eddie-s-house/article_173a033d-a3a3-5298-ae00-c66ebff7af57.html</a></p>
<p>Philadelphian Sharon McGinley founded Eddie’s House, named after Eddie Lewis, one of the first 18-year-olds she met who had aged out of foster care. Lewis died in 2010 from kidney failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I\'m sure the founder of this org didn\'t know that Lewis was that sick ... or take advantage of it. First, you find someone who became a cause cause celebre through the abuse suffered. You target him because he\'s now sick. Use him as a draw for money/donors and then a year later he dies and leaves you with $$$$ to spend and no one to question where that money is going. But that would be a very jaded view, something I\'ve acquired over the last year. But let\'s go onward and not upward. The next thing I found was, more involvement IN TEEN\'S LIVES! My, oh, my! Mary, you are a philanthropic wonder!</p>

<h1>Main Line teens get a New Leaf to hang out</h1>
<p>For as long as she can recall, Mary Nixon Hiltbrand has wanted to create a gathering place for teens and young adults on the Main Line.  
</p>
<p>In the spring, when the former Smith &amp; Hawken store in Rosemont became available, she did.</p>
<p>&quot;It just clicked,&quot; Hiltbrand said of the project. &quot;The right people kept showing up at the right time.&quot;</p>
<p>Next month, after $175,000 worth of remodeling, the New Leaf Cafe will open on Montrose Avenue behind the Rosemont Square shopping center in Lower Merion Township.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it just clicked! You know how that happens! You get an idea and the next thing you know, people crawl out of the woodwork and throw $175,000 at you so you can remodel!!! Yeah, me, neither ... but it\'s all part of this extraordinary life and this woman that really does seem obsessed with helping out children. I\'m guessing it must have been one hell of an upbringing that brought the best out of her. Must have had an idyllic loving childhood, don\'t you think.</p>

<p>That meant digging up some of the Main Line’s secrets — including several in her own family. “I did recognize a few things,” says Nixon’s daughter Mary Hiltbrand, today an artist in Gladwyne. “I got sober, and when I got sober, a lot of the characters started getting sober. Erica went to rehab after I did.” “My brother had an illness that she gave to one of her characters,” adds Cathy Chicos, Nixon’s eldest daughter, who also lives in Gladwyne. “I’m sure there were others.”</p>

<p>So she was an alcoholic! Well, there you go! A freakin- ex-alcoholic is exactly who you want around your impressionable kids! </p>

            Philadelphian Sharon McGinley founded Eddie’s House, named after Eddie Lewis, one of the first 18-year-olds she met who had aged out of foster care. Lewis died in 2010 from kidney failure.

           Now I'm sure the founder of this org didn't know that Lewis was that sick ... or take advantage of it. First, you find someone who became a cause cause celebre through the abuse suffered. You target him because he's now sick. Use him as a draw for money/donors and then a year later he dies and leaves you with $$$$ to spend and no one to question where that money is going. But that would be a very jaded view, something I've acquired over the last year. But let's go onward and not upward. The next thing I found was, more involvement IN TEEN'S LIVES! My, oh, my! Mary, you are a philanthropic wonder!

            Main Line teens get a New Leaf to hang out
           </h1>
           <p>
            For as long as she can recall, Mary Nixon Hiltbrand has wanted to create a gathering place for teens and young adults on the Main Line.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the spring, when the former Smith &amp; Hawken store in Rosemont became available, she did.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It just clicked," Hiltbrand said of the project. "The right people kept showing up at the right time."
           </p>
           <p>
            Next month, after $175,000 worth of remodeling, the New Leaf Cafe will open on Montrose Avenue behind the Rosemont Square shopping center in Lower Merion Township.
           </p>

          <p>
           Yeah, it just clicked! You know how that happens! You get an idea and the next thing you know, people crawl out of the woodwork and throw $175,000 at you so you can remodel!!! Yeah, me, neither ... but it's all part of this extraordinary life and this woman that really does seem obsessed with helping out children. I'm guessing it must have been one hell of an upbringing that brought the best out of her. Must have had an idyllic loving childhood, don't you think.

            That meant digging up some of the Main Line’s secrets — including several in her own family. “I did recognize a few things,” says Nixon’s daughter Mary Hiltbrand, today an artist in Gladwyne. “I got sober, and when I got sober, a lot of the characters started getting sober. Erica went to rehab after I did.” “My brother had an illness that she gave to one of her characters,” adds Cathy Chicos, Nixon’s eldest daughter, who also lives in Gladwyne. “I’m sure there were others.”

            Oh hey, just noticed I got a shoutout in here, thanks for that - sorry I was a bit of a prick the other day, I do have my reasons, but, don't expect your forgiveness lol.

             GAELEN? Did they say, "GAELEN"?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's here the German Shepherd attacks. I'd run across that name when researching Maggie Nixon. I have a very wide circle of friends and not one is named Gaelen. So what are the chances that this name matches the name of someone in the Nixon extended family? It could be a coincidence, but is there something more? As stated above, I was all set to post on Gaelen or Galen or however you're spelling that name these days. Is this one of those trendy transsexual names that you don't have to change when you're fed your hormone blockers in your cereal at the age of 3? You be the judge.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I did the initial dumpster dive re: Maggie Nixon, I decided to try her extended family. After all, if it was as big a rabbit hole as touted, then the rest of Agnes Nixon's children must play a part, no? So when I dd the search for Agnes Nixon's children, the name of Mary Nixon came up:

            The one concept that everyone can agree on is that they thought Hillary was going to win. There are many LLC's with the Ethical term, but one that stuck out to me was J, Cricket. Really? Jiminy Crickets? That is a slang term for saying Jesus Christ without invoking the Lord's name. Reinvented by Disney.

            Wow, great research!  Just re-posting the comment I made on an earlier thread in case it has legs.  I hope someone else out there can verify it as it would be fantastic to finally link NXIVM, Clinton &amp; Rothschilds!

            - Natasha states that Allison Mack is giving up fantastic connecting information. Sorry I cannot verify it hence me not making a link about it. If anyone can link more regarding this would be appreciated.

             It would be super stupendous if everything ties together and the right people land in prison where they belong. I hope they also trace where NXIVM got Gaelen from. How does a little baby end up in a sex cult?

             While they told victims participants that they would help with Tourette's Syndrome, the video shown focused on brutality, rape, torture ... the usual stuff one sees when trying to regain mental health.

           <p>
            I don't think the women they tested suffered from Tourette Syndrome - it's a very rare neurological disease. IIRC, they used these 'tests' to qualify which of the women that Raniere wanted to be part of his harem reacted in a sensitive manner when they had to watch footage of beheadings, rape, and torture. Those who stayed calm were the 'chosen ones'.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the whole Tourette thing was only used to get federal money, and to cover up what they were really up to.

             If you mean did they actually think they were helping this syndrome, you're right. And if you're saying, they used Tourette's syndrome to legitimize the bogus shit they were doing, yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're saying the women didn't suffer from it, at least the one in the article did. Didn't it state she needed her psychiatrist to transfer authority? Yes:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The woman said that she had been required to have her psychiatrist write a letter acknowledging her care would be transferred to Porter.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So she was under medical care for the condition. You know, now that you brought this up, part of it sounds like what Scientology/Dianetics does. According Scientologists, their methodology cures everything. Course it begs the question of why there are so many fucked up Scientologist, but why use logic?

             so - how does this tie in, to nxvim, though?  it's not an impossibly uncommon name, and the spelling is different - i'm itching to find a connection between raniere and the nixon/guinan families - but this isn't enough.

            curious how that name pops into the Nixon family.

           <p>
            searching for info on the child lead me to these three things:
           </p>
           <p>
            an article from 'all over albany' which seems to have a personal connection to raniere and the area.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            a user at a forum from 2009-2014 or so following nxivm very closely:

           <p>
            and a weird post at an a collegiate a capella forum about raniere trying to infiltrate their community.

             The second Part of this will be devoted to Galen. And I'm really wondering about that area. Is it because it's personal to one of the members? Or because it's in NY? Did that make it safer for the cult to take roots? Cuomo does come out smelling like garbage. He's opening a probe into why the ''human experimenting'' didn't raise red flags, but then on the other hand, saying that it shouldn't have? And there was nothing wrong with the committees finding nothing wrong with showing these women either the video of violent rapes/murders/torture or the branding of women after they were forcibly held down?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, I have more on Cuomo ... couldn't not take a dumpster dive after he gets so prominently on the radar. deBlasio and Schumer might also be good to look into to see if any money was thrown their way. Of course, with all these sub-organizations not sure what to even search for. I suppose all of the above could have donated to their campaigns.

              Don't forget how Bleeping Dirty Schumer is.  He supposedly roomed with Wiener in their younger days.  That picture just makes me sick.  Also deBlasio reading the Secret Pizza book to little kids in school.  Blach!!!  Also deBlasio's wife is a former lesbian.   Not saying anything's wrong with her, just all of it packaged together is a Humdinger.

               I agree. There's something wrong with all of it. Including a lesbian that fell in love with ... that rumpled mess?

                  What do you think of all the hair on men now.? All the beards and not to mention the added Man Buns!!! Oh God I hate those Man Buns.  Possibly I have been thinking that many men are wearing those beards and facial hair now because of retaliation of the push to turn them more feminine.  Just a thought. Possibly even without knowing it.

                my documentation has him and his three closest (that i can find) associates in new york

                </em>
                for the last 30 years or so.  any arkansas presence is "temporary", imo.  home base was just always ny.  i have keeffe's mom in ny since 1980.
