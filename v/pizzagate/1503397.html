<p>A former CIA Contractor, John Lear, tells of a secret entrance to an underground government train system.  The secret entrance is in a US Navy Submarine located in San Diego.  
</p>
<p>While watching this particular part, it came to mind the man Sean Hannity has been talking about named Kristian Saucier. </p>

<p>The man had been convicted of something pertaining to mishandling classified information for taking pictures inside this place he worked.  He was sentenced to 1 year in a federal prison.</p>
<p>I also found this article which went into a little more detail and describes how Saucier used his broken laptop for target practice.  Sounds strange.

<p><a href="http://archive.is/ZidPk">http://archive.is/ZidPk</a>  News Article</p>
<p>The article says the submarine was named the Alexandria.  I looked it up to see where its home port is located.  Guess where?  San Diego, California.</p>

<p>I\'m not saying this soldier did anything wrong but I have to wonder if he wasn\'t trying to tell someone what he had seen or warn people about what was going on in our country.</p>
<p>Please spread the word about this because this could be a big clue on how they are transporting these children from coast to coast.</p>',
