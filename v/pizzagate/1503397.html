<p>The man had been convicted of something pertaining to mishandling classified information for taking pictures inside this place he worked.  He was sentenced to 1 year in a federal prison.</p>
<p>I also found this article which went into a little more detail and describes how Saucier used his broken laptop for target practice.  Sounds strange.
