            </a>
            , I'm sorry you found my "Downvoat Contest" post so profoundly offensive. It was a temporary post last night during two hours of Hentai spam carpet bombing, which legit users were then also posting about -- all of which I had to remove. As soon as I redirected their efforts in a more constructive direction, they stopped, allowing me to catch up on removals. I intended to remove the post at the end of the evening, but I forgot. It has been removed now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Frankly, your accursation that I was creating Hentai under alts, then removing it and banning myself for two hours straight so that I could...uh...what, exactly? Hide other posts I removed? I literally removed no other posts. Frankly, that theory is silly as hell. You are welcome to review my comment history; you will see that I go
            <em>
             FAR
            </em>
            OUT OF MY WAY to help users understand our submission guidelines and create posts that satisfy them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your extreme outrage at my post is a bit suspect. Methinks thou dost protest too much. Were you our carpet bomber advocating pedophilia?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Requiring posts to fulfill subverse submission guidelines is not considered censorship by Voat, according to the
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/help/faq">
              Voat User Agreement
             </a>
             :
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Can I submit links to any subverse I want?
            </p>
            <p>
             Each subverse has its own rules which are usually stated in the respective subverse's sidebar. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I would recommend you review the guidelines in our sidebar more carefully before getting all bent out of shape and screaming about censorship. Early on,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            members decided to focus the sub on RESEARCH posts backed by linked sources/evidence that would advance the investigation and be most likely to bring these scum to justice. The community decided to create sister-subverses for non-research topics. All posts relating to the moderation of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            are to be posted in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            -- which is clearly stated in Rule 4. So, it's no surprise this post of yours was removed. Likewise, all "meta concern" posts that aren't Research posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your claim about censorship about two posts referenced at the top of this post is operating under a false assumption: that MF allowed one but removed the other. MF probably did not even see the post from reasonedandinformed. Mods have different shifts and it's wrong to assume unfair treatment unless there is actual evidence of it. Also, that post discussed the connection to PG; the one that was removed did not; any connection was only implied.
