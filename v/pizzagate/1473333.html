            Political stunt...For christ's sake it was the second time she has dropped the suit. How the hell do you know he didn't just pay her off? The guy's a billionaire, he knows how to slick his wy through trouble, thats why we should hold him to the same standard we hold the rest of these people that we are investigating. Probably even a HIGHER standard, because he's going to be our next president...
           </p>
           <p>
            Given his closeness with Jeffery Epstein, it would be stupid not to look into Trump. Don't let your religious devotion to the political spectrum or your support for Trump get in the way of reason and logic. I'm willing to bet a majority of us on this forum reject the two party system, pedophilia is a non-partisan issue.

            Then U ask, why do the rich always get away with pedophilia? Cuz this is what rich is all about, its to be above the fucking law.

            The problem for ppl who suck trump cock is that he has 100's of criminal complaints through the years, you can apologize for one, you can't apologize for +25 years.

            Jeeze, whats with the hostility?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoing even the slightest chance this guy (who, mind you, is going to hold the highest office in the world in a few weeks), is hurting or could have hurt children and underage girls in the past, is criminally ignorant and selfish.  You're so vehemently opposed to this, why? I don't understand?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you aware that he has been sued by a girl who claims she raped him when he was 13? And I hate to be this guy, but not to mention, the dude is clearly an innappropriate douche, remember the "grab her by the pussy" comments and shit? What, do you think Trump is this extrordinary example of an upstanding gentleman who coud never be implicated in this stuff? Give me a fucking break dude, this is worth investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't understand how anybody coul;d advocate against including Trump in our independent investigation, ESPECIALLY on the Voat Pizzagate sub, which is dedicated specifically to this exact cause. Why are you here?

            Go back to 1990's and you will find many criminals complaints where Trump &amp; Epstein are on record by police reports where they sodomized young 12 year old girls and fought about who got to be first. Google it folks

             Responding to this with either a yes or a no can easily imply confirmation that Epstein participated in illegal behavior, thus incriminating him. It proves nothing about Trump, and I say that as someone who agrees that his ties to Epstein should also be scrutinized.

               All I said was the evidence you presented can be explained, not that Trump shouldn't be scrutinized just like everyone else in this mess.
If there was one thing I learned from 2016, in fact, it's that there are no sacred cows. None. Not even ones named Moloch.

              Trumps name appears in Epstein's little black book (where he kept names of fuckable 12 year old girls). Why is trump's name in this book? Why does Trump have such a close relationship with Epstein? These are all rational questions I think we should be allowed to ask.

              </p>
              <p>
               He's near 70 years old and before running against the Clinton Crime Syndicate, has NEVER been accused of a sexual offense in any degree. He has great, respectable children that don't abuse drugs and are self-sufficient. He has been Pro-America for over 30 years according to video recorded statements made by himself.

              EPSTEIN COULD HAVE SAID "NO, I never fucked children with Trump", but he said 5th ; The fact is in the 1990's there are many police complaints that TRUMP&amp;EPSTEIN sodomized children, the court knew this, this is why EPSTEIN(A LAWYER) please 5th as he didn't want to lie, that in fact his entire adult life him&amp;trump had been fucking children.

              Vice writes that “in 2010, Epstein pled the Fifth when asked by a lawyer representing one of Epstein's victims about his relationship with Trump:
             </p>
             <pre><code>Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?

A. What do you mean by "personal relationship," sir?

Q. Have you socialized with him?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Yes?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?

A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.”
