Everyday it seems more and more people are falling for this idiotic conspiracy theory. I spent (hopefully not wasted entirely) almost 4 hours researching this yesterday and was able to convincingly debunk every single aspect of it. Here are a 10 myths debunked with FACTS. I hope you will read on so we can finally put this theory to bed once and for all! </p>
<p>Claim nr. 1 - Laura Silsby is a convicted human trafficker pardoned by Hillary Clinton who is now working for Amber Alert.</p>
<p>FACT: There is a person working for Amber Alert who bears a slight resemblance to Laura Silsby. Except for one minor detail, her name is Laura GAYLER. Laura Silsby was in fact caught on the suspicion of human trafficking but released when it turned out the prosecution had no case against her. There is no connection between Hillary Clinton and Laura Silsby or Laura Gayler. </p>
<p>Claim nr. 2 – Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing have references to pedophilia in their music/videos</p>
<p>FACT: Artists are weird. They often like to do weird things and come up with stupid stuff to try to shock or offend people to get attention. While the jokes and references to pedophilia are somewhat odd this is nothing but conjecture. Lots of bands perform at the Comet Ping Pong and it is impossible for Alefantis to make sure none of the bands playing there ever make tasteless jokes.</p>
<p>Claim nr. 3 – Monica Petersen was “suicided“ investigating human trafficking in Haiti</p>
<p>FACT: Conspiracy theorists love to imagine everything is related to their precious conspiracy theory. When they found out a reporter died in Haiti they immediately tried to pin it on Clinton. The police have indicated that there was no foul play involved and there is simply no proof that this is somehow related.</p>
<p>Claim nr. 4 – James Alefantis posts “creepy“ pictures on his instagram</p>
<p>FACT: So the guy is a pervert? Is that illegal? Does that prove he is a satanist who eats babies? Some of these pictures are completely innocent unless you are trying to see something sinister. Like take for example the picture of his god-daughter in a shopping basket. Obviously that means he is referring to buying babies right? Right...</p>
<p>Claim nr. 5 – The parents of the girl in so many of these pictures have not come forward and exonerated James Alefantis.</p>
<p>FACT: Maybe they don‘t want to become targets of crazy conspiracy theorists on a witch hunt? “Oh so you‘re saying he‘s innocent! You must be a part of the conspiracy!“ I‘m sure they‘ve been through enough. Also, if they had a problem with Alefantis being around their daughter he would not be on so many of his public pictures in her company!</p>
<p>Claim nr. 6 – The Pegasus Museum, a James Alefantis property does not exist</p>
<p>FACT: Just because a museum is not “open to the public“ does not mean it does not exist. They have been doing construction that had to be delayed. This happens many times in business. Nothing to see here. </p>
<p>Claim nr.7 – Dyncorp is still getting government projects despite multiple scandals involving underage prostitution rings</p>
<p>FACT: This is actually one of the few claim that isn‘t completely without merit. Dyncorp has been involved in multiple sex scandals in Afganistan, Bosnia and Iraq. It turns out if you have a company that is involved in a lot of areas where there is war, sometimes bad apples do bad things.</p>
<p>Claim nr. 8 – Elpida, connected to the Clinton Foundation uses a logo recognized by the FBI as a symbol for pedophilia</p>
<p>FACT: While this may be true, sometimes things are true and sometimes they aren‘t. When things that are true mean that other things are true it is obviously incriminating. Other times however, things that are true don‘t necessarily mean that everything else is true. Just because you say one thing it does not mean that the second thing that follows makes the first thing right.</p>
<p>Claim nr.9 – Historically, investigations to pedophilia rings have been met with a clear pattern of cover-up and a trail of mysterious deaths.</p>
<p>FACT: Jimmy Savile was a creep. This much is true. But like I explained, just because there are cases of cover-ups in history it does not mean that this non-sensical theory is true. Just because there have been bank robberies does not mean that the person behind me in the bank is about to rob that bank. That is called being paranoid. </p>
<p>Claim nr. 10 – James Alefantis threatened a pizzagate investigator</p>
<p>FACT: At first I thought this was false, but it turns out he did actually threaten to murder a pizzagate investigator and his wife and family if he did not take down a video that the investigator made about the Pegasus Museum but you must understand. Mr. Alefantis is under a lot of stress right now. He might be concerned for the safety of family members of his own. When we perceive threat we often go on the offensive as a defence mechanism. </p>
<p>I hope we can now stop talking about allt his nonsense and start focusing on stuff that really matters. Like sports and watching TV! LOL. I‘m just kidding but still, this is getting out of hands people really should chill a little bit and just stay friendly and be nice to each other!</p>
<hr />
<p>So... It may be a little bit over the top stupid and I‘m sure most people must realize that it‘s trolling, especially if they read all the way to the end. I was just thinking many people won\'t and it would be hilarious if we‘d post this on reddit and see if the CTR idiots (or real idiots for that matter) bite and start blindly upvoting this to the top. We‘d help it along with upvotes of our own just to get this topic to the front page where we can obliterate every point in the comments. </p>

             This backfired... I wasn't trying to troll you... it was meant to troll reddit and bypass their filters. They will automatically downvote into oblivion or remove any positive mention of pizzagate on the sites bigger subreddits with the exception of the_donald and conspiracy. Notice how none of the mainstream hit pieces tackle these points. It is because they are weak points they know they can't argue without losing. The point of this would be then to use it as a sort of a trojan horse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nr. 1 - As people in this thread have proven, many will be TRIGGERED instantly by the rhetoric right of the bat, f.e. stating I spent "almost" 4 hours researching this is insulting to all of us who have been on the case from the beginning and even way before. This will lead to a healthy backlash from people who know the truth. For that purpose I am making the author of the article an incredibly easy target.
            </p>
            <p>
             So... again, is there anyone willing to discuss the merits of using such a tactic to spread awareness of these topics?

               Problem 1.... there will be lots of comments, surely not all of them will be deleted?
              </p>
              <p>
               Problem 2.... If there are many people who start looking into any of the false assertions I make then yes, new people investigating these issues helps the investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Problem 3.... I don't assume it, but yes, like many here shouted "fuck off shill" without reading to the end I assume some shills or people who generally dismiss conspiracy theories will automatically upvote it. I don't know this for sure but I imagine some will.
              </p>
              <p>
               Problem 4.... Well if it makes it to the front page and gets deleted people do notice. By that time a lot of people will have looked into it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think it's worth a shot but I might be wrong.

             Yes... I thought it was funny to add that for exactly that reason... I am trying to get people to facepalm... so any thoughts on whether or not this tactic would be an effective way to shed light on these issues on reddit. It's basically adapting a type of black propaganda while simultaneously bringing attention to anyone with a brain to these topics. And at some point in the comment this would be revealed as a troll job and hopefully some people realize that they were duped and hopefully be inclined to investigate further.

               Lol I never would have read to the end if I hadn't seen this comment. I don't think spreading this on reddit is a good idea though, because even if they are weak points, they're still going to solidify in peoples' minds that pizzagate is bullshit.
