            I saw a video of trump that   sounded like he knew the towers in 9/11 were going down.      I'm not sure about that, but  presidents aren't elected, they're appointed.   For this reason I think the elites have a purpose for appointing him and they've got something on him and they'll use it if he doesn't fall in line to some degree or other.

            What I would focus on is Trump's first meeting with Obama. Afterwards, Obama was chirpy and confident, Trump seemed sheepish and uncomfortable. It was clear that this time Obama was holding the 'trump card.'
           </p>
           <p>
            I think during their talk Obama told Trump that they had something on him. Ever since that meeting, Trump has been backing off on the Clintons and on Pizzagate. They have something on him, something Trump himself probably did not know until that interview with Obama.

I also worry a lot about his son in law Jared Kushner. He's as scummy as they come and I really hope he doesn't become the power behind the throne in Trump White house.

            This just in, he fired Michael Flynn Jr. from the transition team because of his tweets on pizzagate.

            Clear proof trump does him or his people to talk about this stuff. Looks pretty suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is victory for Snake Tapper and the media establishment who do not want pizzagate discussed and unfortunately trump is siding with thim. Very sad.

             At the very least Trump is the kind of man who wants to throw the punches.  If he is being strong armed that's a sad day for us all, but we have to hope he doesn't want publicity so high until he can address it as the actual President.

            No, Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago and has had nothing to do with him since.

            Don't expect anybody of consequence to speak about pizzagate unless there are real developments. At this point, it's 100% internet conjecture with no victims, no witnesses. It's only a bunch of questions. For him to speak on it would just fan the flames.

            Face it republicans who try to make this a partisan issue, the right is also implicit. Shocker. I know.
