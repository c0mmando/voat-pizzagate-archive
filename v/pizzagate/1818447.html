— Mike Cernovich  April 25, 2017</p>
<p>Cernovich is best known for promoting the “Pizzagate” conspiracy, which falsely claimed that former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman were involved in a child sex trafficking ring run out of a Washington pizza restaurant.</p>
<p>The writer also gained notoriety earlier this month for being the first to report that former President Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, requested that identities of members of President Trump’s transition team be unmasked from intelligence reports surveilling foreign targets.</p>
<p>Cernovich’s scoop gained him the praise of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president.</p>
<p>&quot;Congrats to Cernovich for breaking the Susan Rice story. In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he\'d win the Pulitzer, but not today!&quot; Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter on April 4.&quot;</p>

            he was high profile pizzagate alternative news reporter. about a month ago there was a shift in his position and he appeared to develop a close proximity to trump all of a sudden. i think he was approached and acquiesced to help the ' trump movement ' at what cost to the truth though is the question

              More than nothing. I just think the negative analysis of data source is essentially a waste of time unless you're actually trying to fine tune your understanding of the narrative to develop long term solutions/game plan. None of these wet blankets are doing that. Nobody is trying to determine what societal constructs need to coalesce in order to bring about the demise of these power abusers decades down the line. Well perhaps not nobody. But not these wet blankets lol

            I wonder if he'll come out of it saying pizzagate is fake news after all and he's glad that's cleared up.
            <br/>
            Or that he loves his job and misses it already, but it's time to retire.
            <br/>
            Or that he's been told to stop talking about pizzagate, but don't worry, it's being taken care of. Or...

            not SPECIFICALLY aimed at you, (smh) the two other commenters on the post spoke favourably of this weasel. The point I was trying to make is that this guy should not be trusted. He is obviously controlled opposition.

             Nothing wrong worth being hopeful but I wouldn't hold your breath. Personally I hold Cernovich in the same light as Jones.. As in a pretty dim light.

              Cernovich is worse than Alex Jones. He's actively helping underage sex traffickers like Alan Dershowitz (Jeffrey Epstein's attorney).

            I hear knees knocking in the establishment already! Pray Gods protection over Mike Cernovich and his family. He is an excellent man has a lot of courage, at least we know he will not sugarcoat the message he is taking to the White House if he stays consistent to how he reports! Lets continue to support this man.

             I hear ya!  He's intelligent and has the tenacity that Michael Hastings had and no one owns him...  So yeah, bulls-eye on his back, but TG not oblivious.

              Can you explain his motion to keep court records private that, if made public, would further our investigation?

              Genuinely curious.

(Did I just assume their gender?)
