</p>
<p>My gut feeling (and it\'s as strong as it can get) is there is a direct connection between Pizza Farms, many CSA farms throughout the country, and farm internship programs to criminal acts against children.  This would include any and all possibities - child trafficking, child abuse, pedophilia, and murder.</p>
<p>Before anybody tells me I am nuts and completely off-base, you must do some research, and trust me, it will not take long at all to reach the same conclusion.  
</p>
<p>During the past 6-7 years, pizza farms and CSA/farm to table farms have been exploding throughout the country.  It all started in the midwest, and Wisconsin was and still is the hub. Although there are plenty of farms who do not call themselves &quot;pizza&quot; farms, there\'s still a hell of a lot of pizza being made on them in huge pizza ovens.  One farm actually has workshops to learn how to make your very own pizza oven.</p>
<p>Being that farms for all intents and purposes  are somewhat remotely located, the crowds drawn to several of them is kind of mind boggling.  
</p>
<p>There are also a ton of farm internships offered to children and teenagers.  One place in particular, Chimney Tree Farm,  was investigated a few years ago for all kinds of child abuse.</p>
<p>What also stood out in my mind was the fact that the farm owners are young, I would say late 20\'s, early 30\'s.  As I said, there are so many of these places, and the housing, lodging, acreage is magnificent!  You cannor tell me that all of these millenials are that rich.  These places would cost a fortune to build and add that to the price of land, acres and acres of land????  No way in hell.  These operations are a front for other activities, and I do not know who is footing the bill, but somebody else is doing it with a definite motive as well as choosing the &quot;owners.&quot; Could it be the government of Wisconsn?  
</p>
<p>If 2,000,000 children (I think I read this right, correct me otherwise) have disappeared, maybe a lot of them never returned from their farm visit stays.</p>
<p>I provided one link to a farm in Ithaca, NY, Humble Hill.  Check out the language used at the bottom of the first page under &quot;Amenities.&quot;  WTF?  It looks like a mixture of Latin and what?  Also, note the tiny owl eyes ligo at the very bottom.

<p>I believe this submission applies to all pizzagate rules.  There is way too much info out there for me to back-up every single comment with a citing.  IMO, the entire subject warrants research and investigation. My goal is to bring it to Voaters\' attention</p>',

            The 'tiny owl" at the bottom is the Trip Advisor logo.  Obviously the place is a TA affilliate.
