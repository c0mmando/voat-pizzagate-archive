            Knowing how they work, meaning that they like to cover up their tracks... I'm thinking who, after Seth Rich was shot and killed, has been killed, suffered an accident or was badly hurt? David Brock. He was certainly close to all of them and he suffered a stroke that almost/could have killed him. Could it be, that he was supposed to be "suicided" for having botched the "Seth Rich job", but that this attempt also failed? Just a thought. Anyway, so I decided to search SEIU and David Brock. And this popped up:

             But in thinking about all of the deaths which occurred early last year which were intended
to do harm to Julian Assange and seemingly to protect the DNC from the truth about it -- 
it really seems to have been a rush to prevent any more information coming out about Hillary
or DNC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess we don't know if Seth Rich was continuing to send info to WikiLeaks, but they sure
seemed to want to make sure that he couldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the John Podesta email referring to death of Scalia he mentions "wet works" or "wet jobs."
            </p>
            <p>
             Not that Brock didn't seem to be very close to Hillary and certainly she was the one most threatened.

            It appears that tony and heather brought a guest. Sava and Kountoupes are listed as a couple.

            Ed moody is bringing his daughter? No one else mentioned kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are around 183 people listed. What retreat are they going to? It was at Martha's Vineyard.

            All kinds of Fuckery, there are so many things going on for so long, I think they know they are untouchable, they don't even bother to cover their tracks, they just backtrack if they need and cover it up.  We need to find one of their weak links and get them to spill. There are too many doors left unlocked, we just need to open the right one and this entire thing will come to an abrupt end.

              Yes, massive problems with the UN too. Remember John Ashe killed right before he was expected to testify against HRC, crushed in the throat by a barbell.

            Christ they have their tentacles everywhere... Have we confirmation this was the hospital he was brought to yet? I think police report just said 'local hospital'. Where was that anonymous doctor from on 4chan?

            That is some pretty sketchy stuff you found there.  Who knew an ER Dr. had a connection to the WH?  So now we have the possibility of an SEIU Union Member, ER Doctor. Police Officer, I say we have a lot of possibilities.
