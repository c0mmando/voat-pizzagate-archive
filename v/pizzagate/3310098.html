            Let me just add this.  Everything came out in the open for Paul his coworkers etc supported him.  In az in the police dept itâ€™s unacceptable to be gay let alone what he did. But he was not ostracized.   Criminal

              These A-- holes would never have gotten elected in the first place if our system were not rigged. Notice that in the 2016 dem. primaries...probably the most popular legislator in DC against the most despised.......who was too sick or drugged up to even campaign. ? Pretty obvious........also no well known other legislators publicly endorsed popular senator? Govt run by mafia.
