            Let me just add this.  Everything came out in the open for Paul his coworkers etc supported him.  In az in the police dept it’s unacceptable to be gay let alone what he did. But he was not ostracized.   Criminal

             Interesting how that kind of behavior (alleged child sexual abuse in Massachusetts and very young male boyfriends in Arizona) doesn't seem to faze his constituents.

              These A-- holes would never have gotten elected in the first place if our system were not rigged. Notice that in the 2016 dem. primaries...probably the most popular legislator in DC against the most despised.......who was too sick or drugged up to even campaign. ? Pretty obvious........also no well known other legislators publicly endorsed popular senator? Govt run by mafia.
