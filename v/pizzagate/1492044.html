<p>We\'ve known they are real for awhile, but good that the whitehouse gives up on the &quot;doctored/tampered&quot; false narrative.  Note no one has actually challenged the content of any particular email.</p>
<p>So they are real.</p>
<p>The Russians did it narrative is wearing similarly thin, with head intelligence agencies disagreeing with the CIA:  no evidence.</p>
<p>Further, we know from the Wikileaks that John Podesta\'s super secure password was, I kid you not, p@ssw0rd.  So it\'s safe to say everyone had the DNC emails - every single state spy agency, and every n00b script kiddie with Internet connectivity.</p>

            Yes, they are "fact checking" now.. using some algorithm and then sites such as snopes and wapo, etc.
