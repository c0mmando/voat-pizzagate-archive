Earlier in the evening, Ms. Sykes had met novelist Jay McInerney, but the encounter had left her in another quandary.</p>
<p>At issue was not whether Mr. McInerney was breathing, but rather whether he was working. Ms. Sykes had no idea what Mr. McInerney did for a living.</p>
<p>A friend told Ms. Sykes that Mr. McInerney had written Bright Lights, Big City , but the author had complicated the issue by, she said, introducing himself as a “pedophile.”</p>
<p>“And then he told a really bad joke,” Ms. Sykes recounted. “He said, ‘Well, you only look about 13.’ I was just really confused. I was like, ‘That’s not a very funny joke for a really clever guy.\'”</p>
<p>Mr. McInerney was sitting at a table with two blondes, both of whom looked of age and seemed very focused on him. One of the women was a model, Daniela Novak.</p>
<p>“I’m a very deep guy, but I like being [at] superficial parties like this,” Mr. McInerney told The Transom.

            Wow. Just wow. I've found Buck's crazy suspicious from the beginning, but it's par for the course for Mr. Alefantis. That guy has an overwhelming pattern in his entertainment/booking choices.
