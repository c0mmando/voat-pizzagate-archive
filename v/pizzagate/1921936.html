<blockquote>
<p>The religious organization has sold numerous Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO properties to the Kushner Cos., which Jared Kushner headed until he stepped aside to serve as senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Trump.</p>
<p>Kushner Cos. and its investment partners paid $340 million for the Watchtower\'s Brooklyn Heights headquarters complex at 25-30 Columbia Heights — which has an iconic red neon sign that says “Watchtower” on it.</p>
<p>In DUMBO, Kushner Cos. and its investment partners paid $345 million for 85 Jay St., a parking lot  with about 1 million square feet of development rights. And the company and its investment partners paid $375 million for a complex with former Bible-printing plants on Prospect, Adams, Sands and Pearl streets that it has turned into a techie-friendly office campus called DUMBO Heights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WOW! IN APRIL, 2017, THEY CLOSED OFF THE TUNNEL NETWORK AND POURED CONCRETE IN THEM!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Watchtower, which has sold off many of its Brooklyn Heights properties, is starting to shut down the tunnels that connect them. Last week, the Jehovah\'s Witnesses deactivated one of the tunnels that connect their big Brooklyn Heights residential buildings by filling it with concrete.</p>
<p>The Watchtower\'s pedestrian passageways form an underground network extending from 124 Columbia Heights, which overlooks the Promenade, to The Towers, a former hotel on the corner of Clark and Willow streets.</p>
<p>The Watchtower closed off part of this underground network on Monday, April 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Andrew Porter, who has lived in Brooklyn Heights since 1968, saw a truck outside 124 Columbia Heights pouring concrete into the tunnel “through a raised access hatch” that day, he told the Brooklyn Eagle.</p>
<p>The concrete-filled tunnel stretches between 124 Columbia Heights and 107 Columbia Heights, which is a gated 11-story residential property with a landscaped courtyard.</p>
<p>City Department of Transportation permits indicate that both a concrete truck and “cellular concrete” pumping equipment were needed for the tunnel deactivation.</p>
<p>Cellular concrete, which is also called Foamcrete, is a lightweight cement-based material with lots of gas bubbles in it.</p>
<p>According to the Transportation Department permits, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York was in charge of the job.</p>

            Totally read your reply. I was logged out for quite some time and realized just today that you replied actually.
           </p>
           <p>
            All i can really say is that I once thought similarly to you. I'd like to be clear before we dialogue that I only seek to converse. I'm not looking to sway or have you doubt your belief system. I do believe that when an open dialogue can take place, that is really the only time that the truth can be seen. I think that it applies to all open conversations about most anything in the world - not just Witnesses. Full respect to you for expressing yourself too - I think that in itself makes for the potential of a good conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to be up front with you as well and let you know that I am an apostate. Perhaps your reading that word makes you cringe, I really don't know, but it's the number one thing about the organization that bothered me a lot. The dictionary has a definition for the word 'apostate' and it's the one I go by. The word 'apostate' within "the truth" setting is much different though. My point here is that I just want to make it perfectly clear that I am in no way seeking to deceive you. I feel as though that would be wrong, and I have no intention to see you be anywhere you don't want to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not going to go on a long rant addressing all your points that you make. It's more a matter of time, than it is me trying to skirt anything that your talking about. With that said, if there is anything you need me to clarify on - just let me know and I can address it for you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've found myself that church pastors or priests can be much like elders. They are human, have different personalities - and we just don't mesh sometimes. To make a decision based on the example of one pastor, is much like someone having a bad experience with an elder and lumping the whole organization with him - I just don't think that would be a fair assessment. With that said, I'm not encouraging you to go to church either.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the things you have mentioned here, you made a note of mentioning the Christmas thing. That they admit that their teachings were wrong. Do you have any more examples of the organization being wrong and adjusting accordingly?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I'd like to ask if you are familiar with the Australia Royal Commission and get your perspective on that investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I recognize that the religion has changed, it's changed so very very much, it really has no resemblance to it's origins from before Russel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, are you familiar with Beth - Sarim?
           </p>

            The JW filed paperwork with the city in 2009 for this work.  Probably because it made it easier to sell off individual buildings.

            Well our hearts are certainly in the right place.  I am red pilling two women.  One is a scientist and one is a nurse.  I have sent them info on our Seth Rich posts and today I sent the Strongville Ohio info on the European Adoption Agency raided by the FBI.  When I talked to the nurse over the phone and said Planned Parenthood was linked to 2 women that took a women's baby

            , she was mortified.  The will read the whole post with my instructions.  The nurse has a sister in Ohio not far from there that has been packing up little packages for Children in Orphanages and an Agency and she will send her the info too.  We can only hope for she is very hard headed. This may just make her hair stand up straight. I am keeping my fingers crossed.

            Maybe they plan on hoping to get rid of us first and they believe the Devil Witch (who will still be alive) will help them defeat God.  They are mad enough to believe it.  The inbreeding and their crazy medical inventions will all have their toll.  They will all look like Gargoyles like Old Lady Rothschild.  JA alread is taking on the same look.

            Thank you.  How very informative, I will send this to my friend who was a nurse.  But what I am worried about is those that are using the blood of the young and using it to stay younger. They are taking the blood and transfusing it into the elite.  Very Troublesome Indeed.

            Wow.  I am enlightened.  I had no idea that they may end up being our saviors.  We may go to them for help in the near future with our info on the new blood transfusions in silicon valley. I believe that is where it is.

            Kushner purchased and filled in tunnels..so what?  Are you implying that Kushner was running a child trafficking ring?  Highly doubt that.  Are you implying that he rescued children by purchasing and shutting down this ratline?  I might buy that...

             I read it as JW poured the concrete before sale, but there is an article I read years ago about child abuse in tunnels and I believe this to be the location.

              I don't know about all that. All I know is that in NYC the larger buildings usually have tunnels that connect around. Rockefeller Center being a good example they have stores and shops inside them sometimes.

             JW's have Bean slimming down their business for quite some time now. Their printing presses haven't been as active since the Advent of digital with most of their Publications being dispensed through iPads nowadays. Additionally they have numerous lawsuits against them presently regarding their handling of cases regarding sexy al abuse within their congregations. They are an organization in turtle mode trying to weather the storm of questioned doctrine, and organizational inquiries through governmental scrutiny such as the Royal Australian Commission.

             I doubt the Jw's will ever fall under pizzagate scrutiny - but never say never I suppose.

              I suppose like any religion, most worshipers are just fine, but there are those that dabble in unsavory acts.  As well are their Leaders.

               I've found squirrel hunting in the front yard with my bow typically scares them off. At least the lone guy was afraid to get out. The ladies were not as intimidated by a woman in muck boots and shorts thinning out the bushy tailed thugs. My husband prefers answering the door in undies. All jokes aside, you gotta appreciate their diligence.
