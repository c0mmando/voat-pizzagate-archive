<p>The <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/1qcd.jpg">Efits</a> were supposed to be images of one man, but that story is dubious.  They are too different.  Also, it doesn\'t make sense that a private investigator would be able to find eyewitnesses that local police were unable to find.  The Efits are likely an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">&quot;parallel construction&quot;</a>.  That is, the investigator discovered the Podestas\' involvement through some other means, and wanted to conceal those means and/or avoid directly accusing the Podestas.  My guess would be that an inside source told the investigator the Podestas were behind the abduction, and the investigator then created the Efits, providing a fake story for their origin.  This was perhaps the best way to protect himself and his source from retaliation (murder), while still leaking a strong hint.  This seems likely, given other evidence implicating the Podestas.

<p>Known pedophile <a href="http://archive.is/LauM9">Clement Freud</a> has a villa 1/3 of a mile from where McCann was &quot;abducted,&quot; and the McCanns even <a href="http://archive.is/Q25Mo">visited with Freud</a> after the &quot;abduction.&quot;  There is at least one known connection between the Podestas and Clement Freud.  John Podesta\'s Chief of Staff was <a href="http://archive.is/bfcqE">Sara Latham</a>, who had worked for <a href="http://archive.is/QOGna">Freud Communications</a>, run by <a href="http://archive.is/F0hSA">Freud\'s son</a>.</p>
<p>John Podesta\'s emails are regular in frequency following May 4, 2007, whereas <a href="http://archive.is/ogoWc">there is a 5-month gap that begins Nov. 1st, 2006 and ends May 4, 2007</a>, <em>the very day after McCann\'s abduction</em>.  Were those emails deleted to hide something?  An assistant was <a href="https://archive.is/yU8NU">handling Podesta\'s email at the time of the abuduction</a>, indicating Podesta was on vacation.</p>
<p>The Efit images were <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2478087/Why-Madeleine-McCann-suspect-E-fits-kept-secret-5-years.html">suppressed for five years</a>.  Why? </p>
<p>Authorities in charge of the McCann case say they <a href="http://archive.is/KdupA">know who did it, but cannot arrest them due to international law</a>.  What kind of law would prevent authorities from requesting extradition?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">Diplomatic immunity</a>.  The authorities are telling us the people who did it are &quot;untouchable.&quot; This certainly fits the Podestas, who are strongly tied into the Deep State of the world\'s only superpower, as well as the internationally influential billionaire George Soros.  Any government that went after the Podestas would be inviting assassination or replacement through a CIA “dirty tricks” campaign.  This includes the U.S. Government, as it is apparent the Deep State is using every possible means to try to take down Donald Trump before he can drain the swamp.</p>',

            Not sure if this is anything but after the abduction, Gerry flew to Washington and met with the International Centre for missing and exploited children, of which Jeff Koons and Marina Abromovic are Board members. His airline tickets in the US were covered by Richard Branson.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Monday, July 23, Gerry McCann, the father of missing 4-year-old Madeleine McCann, came to Washington, D.C. in the quest to help find his daughter. Gerry received a tour of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, where he learned about some of the latest techniques in tracking missing kids.

            And in November 2007, Jeff Koons sells for $23 million dollars ''Hanging Heart'' the most expensive piece of art created by a living artist ever sold at auction.

            Something else I just found in the Wikileaks Stratfor emails. The embassy of Spain was a client of Stratfor (intel, global intel etc) and they did not receive any information from Stratfor for three weeks at the time of Maddies Abduction. Embassy asks if this is a mistake.

            The connection between Matthew Freud and John Podesta is Sara Latham , who worked for both of them. Matthew is Clements son. When the story broke , Matthew hired a top media gun from David Cameron’s team who was pushing the McCann story. Matthew Freud also did PR for the Weinstein company

            The Podestas rented Maddie for a couple hours but they accidentally killed her Fat Tony was too rough with her when he was fucking her. Now she's dead. They have to get rid of her body. Her father takes her puts her in the trunk of his rental car (the cadaver dogs later smelled traces of her in the trunk) and daddy drives her far away and buries her where she won't ever be found. Daddy and Mommy then go see Clement Freud and the Podestas to demand a large amount of money for their silence. That's what most likely happened. Everything else is just camouflage to hide what really happened and who was involved.

            Madeline McCann was not "abducted" as has been reported. She was created in a Petrie dish first and her mother carried the child through surrogacy or their is an even darker reality I won't get into.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was part of the breeding program the NAZI's have had in place since WW11.  Don't believe me consider GHWBush actual name was George Sherff before Operation Paperclip.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is part of a continued eugenics program. They create and prioritize children who have the outward sign of Coloboma (Incest Mark of cain) it is tied to a specific rare bloodtype found primarily in elites. Babies born with this type as a result of Pax genes that affect the Pineal Glan are chosen as elite. At birth they are put onto an international system known as C.A.R.I.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kate McCann was set up to push RFID technology as vital due to her child's abduction. The father was in Washington DC just prior to abduction.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a planned operation. Tony and John Podesta were staying at Clem's villa when Maddie went missing..Next Clement Frued invites them over to the villa to support them...give me a break...everyone in parliament knew hew was a vicious pedo for decades just like his grfather Sigmend Freud....
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe we will find out Madeline is either Soros child or a variety of other top Nazi's whose sperm was frozen with numerous Aires being populated around the world...

             I wanted to finish reading everyone's thoughts on here before I shared mine. Then I saw your comment about Colomboma. This is what I wanted to mention as well. I've always thought this is a vital clue. Also strange coincidence that the little girl in the Alefantis Instagram pics is called Caris and she also.has the same eye anomaly. SO DOES MADELINE. Whenever this info about Colomboma/C.A.R.I.S  was posted earlier in the year the shills came out in force (like I've never seen before)  It was a huge red flag for me. Here is a good reminder

              Yes!  I too have noticed the Caris child with Alefantis and the C.A.R.I.S. connection.  I also have believed Madeleine to be IVF of Kate and Soros. Soros has the Coloboma as well.  This is so very telling

            Where does conman Kevin Halligen fit in?  He was investigator who was hired by the McCanns and his company produced/supervised the e-fits
           </p>
           <p>
            He was later convicted of fraud when it was found out he was lying about his background and skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a documentary made him called The McCanns and the Conman.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A conman who set up a firm to search for Madeleine McCann has denied he funded a lavish lifestyle using cash donated by the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             Supporters of Kate and Gerry McCann handed over around £300,000 to Kevin Halligen's Washington-based company, but his contract was terminated early and he was later convicted of fraud in America on a separate matter.

             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            He was not only a fraud known to rip off his clients   (aka The McCanns and the people who donated to help them.)  He was quite close to A LOBBYIST WHO COMPETED WITH TONY PODESTA.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kevin Richard Halligen wasn’t the elite intelligence operative he claimed to be, but a charming and audacious con artist who lived a luxe lifestyle by fleecing others, including a number of lawyers, of millions, authorities say.
            </p>
            <p>
             After he had already duped high-level contacts on the other side of the Atlantic, Halligen was introduced to society in Washington, D.C., in 2005 by a lobbyist and adviser to a well-known law firm which later did legal work for Halligen, the Washington Post (reg. req.) recounts in a lengthy weekend article.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now the subject of a United States effort to extradite him from a London prison to face a felony fraud case, Halligen reportedly made millions through a network of intelligence community contacts he apparently tricked into believing that he had security expertise and connections that he lacked. In addition, courts in Virginia and the District of Columbia have found him liable for millions more that former partners say he defrauded them of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Halligen also, seemingly, married an attorney working for the U.S. Commerce Department at a lavish 2007 ceremony
             <strong>
              at which the Patton Boggs lobbyist was his best man.

             However, the wedding was conducted by an actor, after Halligen told his bride-to-be at the last minute that he couldn’t sign any legal documents, according to the newspaper. It isn’t clear that he informed her he was already married.
            </p>
            <p>
             A prominent lawyer who offered a toast at the wedding later won a Fairfax County judgment against Halligen for $5.7 million.

            So we have a fraud who is an insider to the world of Washington lobbyists.

            A possibility: If he was ripping off the McCann's, it stands to reason he might have faked actually doing the work.  Instead of getting a real sketch artist, he had the efits created from pictures and since he was lying about the Witness, he made two efits of different people, so the cops wouldn't find anyone and then he gave details like the age that didn't match the pictures.   And just as a special fuck you, he uses pictures of the competitors of a good friend.  Fuck them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another possiblity.  Lots of folks think the McCanns are guilty.   Perhaps they worked with a conman to manufacture a new witness.

            Recall an interview with Mad's. maternal grandmother that she had grown to dislike &amp; to distrust Gerry. Particularly that as a doctor he could not tolerate a child that was less than perfectly behaved at all times. Mad's was cranky especially at bedtime. Gerry McCann always thought that reflected poorly on him and his medical practice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we know how long poor Maddy lived after her abduction? Her unusual eye condition is rumored to be similar to that of Soros. Knowing that many British elite participate in swinging among their own circle, and Gerry strikes many as at least bisexual, perhaps Maddy is not his child by blood.

              Why because I label my speculation as speculation?              And confirmation bias and motivated reasoning basically affect everyone if you don't fight it.

              The facts are Haligen was known for ripping off his clients and not doing the work.  For example, he was paid $2 million dollars by a company to lobby on behalf of an executive who was being held hostage in a foreign country.   Instead, once he got the money, used it to buy a 6 bedroom house.  He was living an extravagant lifestyle because he was spending his fees on actual lobbying/investigations.    Dude faked his own wedding and hired an actor to play the guy pronouncing them man and wife.

              Motivated reasoning
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Motivated reasoning is an emotion-biased decision-making phenomenon studied in cognitive science and social psychology. This term describes the role of motivation in cognitive processes such as decision-making and attitude change in a number of paradigms, including:
             </p>
             <p>
              Cognitive dissonance reduction[1]
Beliefs about others on whom one's own outcomes depend[1]
Evaluation of evidence related to one's own outcomes[1]

                   Your claims of joking are part of your lies. Just like that death threat you sent to Jem when you referenced those two murders. Sounds like you're the one whos flailing LOLOLLOLOL.

                  <p>
                   What isn't a joke is that everybody here hates you and wishes ill fortune upon you. Shills aren't exactly human anyway. More like depraved degenerate brain dead apes only capable of spewing whatever garbage narrative The Ministry of Truth gives them,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You're that stupid that you assume a suspect's word of mouth at face value is the official truth.

                  <p>
                   Well then. If Pedosta is innocent, how come he despite having over a year to prove everyone wrong has done NOTHING to explain all the confirmed FBI pedophile code words (the recent NJ arrest actually uses the word cheese pizza in the craigslist ad as pedo slang) in those wikileaks emails, the bizzare sentence syntax that only makes sense if used in coded language, and all those art pieces depicting abused children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If he was innocent he would have nothing to hide. He would have been able to prove his innocence a long time ago if he had come clean from the very begginning. Fact is he has done nothing. Only the guilty have something to hide.

                    There are no confirmed FBI pedophile code words.   I would call that a lie, but I think you generally don't know the truth of this.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Please show me an actual list of pedophile code words and I will never post on this board again.    Will you stop posting here if you if you are wrong?

 it's been slang on 4 chan  for like a decade.

                      Cheese pizza is a phrase that never appears in the Podesta email.

                      You came up with a single example and you are wrong.  Podesta never used the phrase cheese pizza and there is no FBI  confirmed word list.

             None that I know of, but I don't think authorities are necessarily being perfectly honest.  "International law" may be a euphemism for "we can't act because we'd all be disappeared or commit suicide by two gunshots to the back of the head."  The Podestas are international lobbyists/powerbrokers, however, so maybe they have some form of diplomatic immunity, which may or may not be public knowledge.

              Tony and John Podesta are the point people for the Art in Embassies program that is used to ship art (and most likely other stuff is co-shipped) to other countries with no inspections by customs or police.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               These guys, in other words, had a program available to them that lets them ship whatever they want, anywhere they want, with no concern about customs or law enforcement, as long as it had cover from their political masters
              </strong>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about that.
             </p>
             <p>
              And guess who was the State Department person in charge of the program before 2016?
             </p>
             <p>
              Hillary Clinton, of course:

            The McCann abduction goes very high up into the Euro elite pedophile ranks. Former naval intelligence analyst &amp; investigative reporter Wayne Madsen has uncovered the fact that
            <strong>
             Portugal has become a center for elite pedophile activity
            </strong>
            , and the flurry of meddling in the McCann case by the highest levels of British government indicates that there was a lot of fear about what police would uncover.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, most people are not aware that the British Prime Minister's office, No. 10 Downing Street, went into crisis mode and immediately began working behind the scenes to micromanage the police investigation and media reporting:
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             Within the first few weeks of the investigation by British and Portuguese police of little Madeleine's disappearance, Number 10 dispatched Clarence Mitchell, a former BBC television news reporter/anchor and the head of Blair's Central Office of Information's (COI) Media Monitoring Unit to Portugal to act as the McCann's official spokesman. Mitchell's media watchdog job had been to ensure that the media only published and broadcast the official disinformation issued by Blair and other ministers in his government on a wide range of topics. Mitchell was sent off to Portugal to put forth only that information about Madeleine's disappearance that comported with Number 10's wishes.
            </em>
            "
           </p>
           <p>
            and even fewer people are aware that
            <strong>
             Clement Freud's son, Matthew Freud, was put in charge of media management in the affair
            </strong>

            I think people need to triangulate the links between Clement Freud, Tavistock and the DNC to understand how the kidnapping might fit in. Remember that it was a deliberate, multi-year media circus with The Freud's, and the Podesta/Alefantis ties to the London Rothschilds are undeniable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two thoughts:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             What if the efit rendering is an actual Podesta photo they turned into a police sketch?
            </li>
            <li>
             How does operation mockingbird (ie London/rothschild influence on American media) stand to benefit from an unsolveable case?
            </li>

            I agree with this theory. I've heard people say that it doesn't make sense because these images look TOO much like the Podesta's. I've always thought that whoever made these exits know who they are but being stopped from naming them. This is their way of naming them.

            ^ the OP provides several links about Podesta. The archive link under edit 2 is to a guardian article about Podesta's art, he gloats about building a windowless subterranean (kill)room under his house for the sake of visual art. His love of sadistic art is disturbing in of itself but he seems to use collecting art to cover many of his more sinister choices.

             They could very easily say where they were but they have not. There was an article in one of the Washington social papers where one of the Podestas (Heather maybe) talked about how they flew over to and all around Europe all the time just for weekend jaunts. I wonder if anyone has tried to get entry/exit data from Portugal's customs dept.

            I can't believe it .Matthew Freud 's first wife Caroline ended up marrying Richard Spencer,the brother of  Princess Diana. His second wife is the daughter of Rupert Murdoch and he hobnobs with David Cameron. That's just for starters. This would make a great Mini-Series.

             Matthew Freud is the confidant of some very important bods, who include Lord Jacob Rothschild, David Cameron, Tony Blair, Peter Mandleson, Rupert Murdoch.  Yoichi Shimatsu describes ex Freud Communication’s Sara Latham as the ‘Rothschild watchdog over Podesta, the Clintons and the Dem leadership - and she is also a mentor to Chelsea Clinton!

              Thank you. I love Yoichi.  These people always manage to stay connected and use each other over and over.  They are they only ones they can trust.  We have uncovered much, but many times there is a problem once we are almost at the bottom of the Rabbit Hole.  The plans and operations are so convoluted for a reason. Hardly anyone squeals or they are found dead.

            I hate acronyms, I work for a place that is obsessed with them and I never know wtf everybody's on about. Anyhow, I clicked over to the story to see what exactly an e-fit is and they didn't even give a definition for it in the article itself and I had to look further. So for everyone else who doesn't know,  E-fit is Electronic Facial Identification Technique is a computer-based method of producing facial composites of wanted criminals, based on eyewitness descriptions.

            You are forgetting that the Mc Cann visited Clement two months after and send him a weird email. This has all be researched in several posts/blogs.

             My guess would be that an inside source told the investigator the Podestas were behind the abduction, and the investigator then created the Efits, providing a fake story for their origin. This was perhaps the best way to protect himself and his source from retaliation (murder), while still leaking a strong hint. This seems likely, given other evidence implicating the Podestas.

            Always been my opinion. And still, the people responsible for putting out the pics may have paid dearly and been retaliated against in ways we don't know about.

            Didn't Clement Freud befriend the parent's after the disappearance? He invited them over for dinner. Smells fishy.

             Perfectly good reason for Freud wanting to get them into his home. Podesta's did as they do, brought her there with all her DNA and everything. Things got so hot they needed to "muddy the waters" on any leads ending up at their doorstep and in the door.

             Yes, he invited them for lunch I believe, and only a couple days after their daughter's kidnapping.  Rather strange, I agree.  I think it was very odd that they accepted as well.  I think it is a well known fact that Praia del Luz is a place visited by many pedos and many live there as well.  You would also think since Gerry had a computer, that they would have been able to research the place before they chose to holiday there with children. Yes Smells Very Fishy.

              Clement Freud had not yet been ‘outed’ as a paedophile.  His proclivities were only revealed  after his death.  It is hugely significant that this little girl’s disappearance evoked not only the most rapid and immediate but also, and more importantly, unprecedented  response and input  from some of the highest echelons of the political, social, journalistic and corporate elite, Including Blair, Brown, Milliband, Freud Communications (owned by Clement’s Son) who appointed ex political spin doctor, Clarence Mitchell as the McCann’s press spokesman and the involvement of many, many more.   I think Gerry McCann knew exactly what lay ahead in Praia de Luz. He’s already heard on film en route to their holiday complex grumpily stating that  he wasn’t there for a holiday.  His invitations to the Whitehouse in the ensuing months said it all for me.

               The McCanns also met with the Pope. I remember thinking at the time how very odd that was.

                Wow.  I had forgotten that.  I was floored at the time.  But now we know why.  bergoglio is a jesuit pervert himself and was guilty of allowing many babies to illegally be taken out of the country in Argentina.

               When I first came to voat there was something on the internet about how Gerry had CP on his computer and a police friend helped remove it from the computer.  I can no longer find it. Yes, the visit to the WH and other pretty obvious key factors are pretty convincing that the McCanns are involved. Still I believe that that there were pedophiles living there.  I believe that is one reason they went there. It mas been covered on here that a certain PM of the UK was also involved.

                Two; Tony Blair and later, Gordon Brown.  I too have seen something regarding the removal of CP on McCanns computer - I think it may have featured in the video series on the McCanns by Richard Hall (Rich Planet on YouTube).  He also nicely debunks the timings of the alleged ‘last’ photographs on Gerry McCann’s holiday camera.  There is much Gerry MCann can’t explain away imo.  Praia de Luz is a well known paedophile haunt.

                 This  article  so very much incriminates Gerry McCann,  It makes it so very obvious he is implicated.  The piece about the crying child at the end was heartbreaking.  The woman living above the MCanns really should be interviewed.  So possibly they went out and let some pervert have his way with their child.   Scums, both of them. She also had to know what he was doing.  There is no way she is not guilty as well.

                  Her first words on returning to the Tapas bar (and note, leaving her twins alone in the very apartment where her daughter has just been discovered missing!!):  “They’ve taken her”.  Who were “they”?

                   Possibly the people they had rented her out to while they wee partying with their friends.  The article you sent me that I mentioned, had one of their children crying for a whole hour while they were out.  So this is a pattern, leaving their children with someone.  With Gerry's CP on his computer we have to know that he is mixed up in some sexually abusive stuff.  Possibly they were only renting her out, but had no idea that they had intentions of stealing her for someone. At least maybe Kate did not know, but Gerry did. Someone very important that always got what he wanted.

                    There’s also somewhere a conversation with Gerry McCann and one of the Tapas group men where Gerry is asked “will she do this?” Whilst sticking a finger in his mouth and then circling a nipple with said finger.  Those adults took turns to “check” on those children - and many of their stories about that night are conflictive.  My opinion is that this was perhaps a kind of ‘mini pizzagate’ circle holiday and that other local paedo’s knew of this and paid visits to that holiday complex with a view (or an agreement - who knows) to partake in the activities of that little club.  It’s a theory I’ve nursed for some time.

                     I agree and maybe those two people named, where there that night and wanted to take someone home.  He or they could not leave her behind.  Gerry is a disgusting and vile pervert making such a sexual reference about any child, let alone his own.
