            I read everything on here, daily, but somehow I missed you!  Your story is compelling, but I see now that your Twitter was zapped.  Are you on Gab?  If not, please go there and post your handle so that we can keep reading your submissions.

            <p>
             a-I barely knew my father, so no I wasn't close with him at any point in my life and I don't fully understand the details of how he was a victim.  I was told he was sexually abused when he was younger like most victims, and it's my theory that he was a victim based on context of me being a victim and the codes in the cult chest that tie me to him, the early ones of me imply less me being a victim and more him being the target with me being kidnapped and murdered as a way to get to him.  That changed when I was about 9 and I moved away from him, they kept going after him but also created a new "show" out of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cult keep you from your father?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- yes, I never knew him but they had me move away from him when I was 9 and outside of meeting him a single time when I was 15 for a week (which they took many photos as codes which i found in the cult chest) I pretty much never heard from him again outside an occasional letter.
            </p>
            <p>
             You mentioned he was in prison. Did they falsely accuse him?
            </p>
            <p>
             a-No, he was never in prison.  That was a plan they had for him that I realized after putting together the photo codes in the cult chest.  Originally they were filming him and torturing him, as his kids it fell to us the same treatment (outside my one cultist sibling) so they were trying to MK ultra him into raping my non-cultist sister and throwing him into prison for it and then while in jail learn that his son (me) died do to him putting crocodiles into one of my family's ponds. Tho they got him drunk and manipulated him and also my sister into priming the "event" it didn't happen he didn't do it and my sister despite being primed to think it did chose to tell the truth which switched the child molestation charge to disorderly conduct (in the cult chest there was a child molestation charge crossed out in police papers and written in disorderly conduct and this was the event that caused us to move to Colorado)... however if it had gone as planned (based on the codes) then they were going to have me sit around outside the ponds of our family farm until a crocodiles killed me and then while he was in jail let him know it was his fault and film his reaction.  They enjoy watching someone break, getting that on camera as a testament to their power among other uses.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's what the photo codes said anyway which I no longer fully share due to my non cultist sister being heavily involved in the codes, they are so easy to read but I can't share them due to her being in them - even tho I white out the faces she freaks out each time I share photos she's not even in so I can't share them anymore.  While she is being manipulated into being hurt I still have the power to at least spare her that.  I do not want to hurt someone who has been hurt their entire lives.  She will learn the truth and then I can probably share the uncensored versions of the photo codes and people will understand the system much more clearly.  Because it's an easy language to read when you understand symbolism and have the photos they use in their original form in the correct order.  They explain exactly what they intend to do before it happens and having the benefit of it having happened I can using my experience explain what they tried to do versus what happened and then share more photo codes to show it going on all throughout my life over and over... as Q says "what is a pattern" and having  giant box of cult codes as I had in the cult chest it became crystal clear to me the methodology of the photo sets, both their purpose and also many key points of the language they use of symbolism.
            </p>
            <p>
             You second sister is she pretty far high up in the cult?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- I think so, she worked in D.C. for 6 months during Obama's last term and delivered illegal tapes which are part of why the good guys were trying to get me involved to FOIA myself (which I did and will do again when RR gets the boot)  - She also was seemingly involved in brownstoning operations (blackmailing people with videos) which she got experience in doing from the time she was a young child with a video feed at her disposal of her older and younger sibling which she could use to practice.  So many memories i have that only make sense now that i realize she was watching me and practicing using information she could only know through spying.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would she ever leave you think?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- I actually asked Q that on 8chan if she had flipped and I got a reply from a Q proxy (just a reply but the way it was phrased made it clear it was was not a random anon) - that said no.  I only asked because while I realized she had done many evil things I thought perhaps she was smart enough to realize her side lost and flip - but no she didn't and probably can't anymore but the details are far from clear to me now.
            </p>

             good questions, feel free to ask as many as you like : )

            </p>
            <p>
             a- the end result is to have a good life.  It's kind of like the film "They Live" which is just like the Matrix, a parody of sorts good people made attempting to explain what the world actually is - and in "They Live" the tagline is "They Live, We Sleep" - and indeed - the choice isn't the same as it is for us, we get the bad information from birth and we are herded as cattle throughout our lives to be their workhorses - they however get to live an easy life where they can get away with anything and do anything and be anything - they have the cheat code to endless happy days.  All it takes is the small cost (to them) of their soul.  And it's hardly a surprise they would accept a faith like satanism when they have done what they have done to get ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
             Makes no sense to hurt people especially your own children. Where is this going to get them?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- It makes no sense from our perspective because we aren't given a choice in the matter. From their perspectives it's a choice between having a good life by sacrificing one or two of their kids.  An easy life where the kid they don't sacrifice can grow up to be a wealthy and even famous person and the family tree lives on through them, it's a choice of a good life or a bad life.  And given the long reign the cult has had over our world it's not like any one of them could imagine that defying them would result in anything less than their ensured annihilation
            </p>
            <p>
             from the cult's perspective this system makes sure they are loyal, feeding ones own child to pedophiles and then killing them slowly over years.. it'd be hard to find a better test of loyalty than that.  And it instills a fear in them as their own crimes would be revealed if the cult were ever threatened.  It's actually a pretty logical system, and as they use their symbolism language and infest every organization around the world they can help each other "climb the vine" and reach the top of any organization, get out of any crime they commit, and win any contest they ever enter- while the normies of the populace are the workhorses that can't ever get ahead in the world because they don't speak the language.
            </p>
            <p>
             Control the whole population?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- they use what they learn from experimenting on people like me on the whole populace - that includes the chemicals, trying to make us all a bit stupider - make the sheep more herdable.  "What is a spell" the QMAP asks - and yea, through their control of information.  From birth to death we are fed incorrect information, propagandized it's been a steady effort that had nearly perfected the art of making us as weak and un-unified as possible

             this channel is pretty censored out of youtube's algorithms, and has some of the last techniques that were being used before the good guys turned the tide.

            Alan,  I first read your story on Voat great awakening and have been searching you from then on.  Got twitter to just follow you then you were shut down.  Got message from a guy and have been searching since.  I have been praying for you and everyone in the cult.  You are very smart and seem very nice person.  God has been watching you.  I have so many questions and don’t know where to start.  Dumb question...I buy Black O tobacco and weird picture but has an owl.  Looks weird not tobacco related.  Is it a cult related company you think?  Do you have other siblings besides your one sister that was second born?  What happened to first born?  I have been big Trump person since interview in 2011.  All the bashing never made sense.  Q answered a lot.  You are the final piece in my puzzle.  Slowly able to piece together.  My father talked about this in 70’s and 80’s.    You have much you give to us naive people.  Things don’t feel right but don’t know why?  I Know you are going to Rocky in this movie.    Please keep up your work.  I share you with everyone that will listen.  You are so knowledgeable and wise.  I can ask questions all day long.  But trying to figure out all these sites.  Voats barely get around and 8ch totally lost.  Thank you thank you thank you.   God Bless You!

             I buy Black O tobacco and weird picture but has an owl. Looks weird not tobacco related. Is it a cult related company you think?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- Q Research General #3507: They Own Everything Edition -  - Pretty much everything and whenever a good guy pops up like the Washington Post (during the Snowden leaks) - well, they just buy it with force using a Jeff Bezos a few months later and further strangle free speech - and the same goes with every level of production and goods.  It's not like they produce anything illegal I imagine in this Black O - the owl however could have during the early days of its company been a "tell" to make sure everyone knew it was cult owned at the top - thus to give it the better media coverage - versus perhaps what might have been a once diverse field in tobacco - to make it less so.  But as I don't smoke I know very little about the history of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you have other siblings besides your one sister that was second born?
            </p>
            <p>
             a- 3 siblings - My eldest sister is a victim my father was a victim (now deceased). middle sister, mother, step-mother, both grandmothers and one grandfather are cultists - I'm the youngest and also a victim, and almost all my living relatives back in Georgia are cultists.  - My family was a "show" so there are more victims per square inch than most cult families.  I believe most cult families only have between 1-2 cult children per family unit with any additional children being sacrifices (few are made into shows but the sacrifices are still used as sex toys and driven to suicide in early adulthood)
            </p>
            <p>
             What happened to first born?
            </p>
            <p>
             She is the main reason I don't talk about a lot of my past because she's a victim as well and despite the good guys best efforts and my best efforts she refuses to realize it.  So while I have a lot to say about her and the way the cult tortures female victims versus what they did to me - I have to stop myself because the bad guys read what I write and they have in every instance I have mentioned her even when I only speak of her using code names.... well the bad guys still tipp her off that I'm doing it and frame it in a way that drives her crazier which leads her to try and take legal action against me and also scream at me in a variety of ways I don't enjoy being screamed at.... So I just have to refuse to talk about that stuff, and so I won't.  She'll understand it when she sees the tapes... and hopefully she can handle it.  There's a lot of awakenings that might be difficult - the reality of seeing it on film will be a shock to the system like nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
             thank you for the questions... it's been a strange week and I'm not sure how active I'll be in the near future until it all breaks.

             no twitter, tho there is an interesting thing about that -

            <p>
             so it might get uncensored soon.... or not, it's not like they censored me because I was promoting poltics - I was talking about the cult. and on that note I will create a gab account soon - once I do it kind of commits me to posting daily as I did on Twitter so I don't want to do it halfheartedly..... I'm still thinking of what the name should be.... and also  just waiting for a "muse" so to speak, something I really want to say which will be my first post - cause when I do it I want it to grow quickly - I can't just do some half assed decoding like I sometimes did on the twitter (usually only when I had spent hours looking for something to post about and found only things I wasn't quite sure were codes)  anyway, when I create one and have something really worth talking about I'll do a decode on QRV and maybe pizzagate if it ends up involving that stuff - anyway, thanks for the thanks and it motivates me to get moving on it : )

              Hi, thank you for your friendly and detailed answer!
             </p>
             <p>
              If you open a GAB account, I will check daily! Your view of things is unusual and helps many to see the hidden communication. 
I had to smile when I read about the muse - my ex-husband is an actor and director and always called me his muse. ;)
             </p>
             <p>
              I already said that I found the decoding of the Drudge articles combined with all the symbolism totally interesting! Maybe you can pick out some suitable media that you regularly decode? Maybe in connection with some well-known personalities who belong to the cult in some kind of long-term media study?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure your unusual intellect and your will to make the world a better place will help you!
             </p>
             <p>
              All the best, Billy! :)

             feel free to elaborate or just blanket accuse someone of a distorted world view - it's a free internet after all - well outside of twitter but then that's why I'm here.  : )   tho as a response I guess it'd best be said that I think everyone is a little crazy, but the truly crazy ones are the ones that think they are sane.

               I had no idea, I guess I was wrong on that point, well it was a minor point anyway.  I only had 2 St. James's and those are the prominent two that I see on the map the one with the pizza boat and the one with the cinema.  So if there's another one I guess it just wasnt' important enough.  Some kind of arbitrary James haha

            Alan, thank you for sharing your stories and interpretations with us.  I am most grateful.  From your Twitter posts and posts here, you are doing remarkably well for a person who has undergone such horrific treatment.  May you continue to heal!
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you please point me to where you lay out your case that the Bushes are good guys?  I concluded back in ‘08 that GWB was a slave of the big banks and Wall Street.  But, I am willing to reexamine my thoughts based on your work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks!

             It's a long story and it came largely about because I agreed with you but noticed the shills pushing hard anti-Bush - that got me thinking about why I didn't like them - anyway here are my old History digs

             of those abba 4 and especially 6 and 7 have it in a historical context with facts that take it all the way to the executive orders presidents signed - additionally you might want to look at my twitter digs
             <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=bush%20from%3Awatkins_2&amp;src=typd">
              https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=bush%20from%3Awatkins_2&amp;src=typd
             </a>
             and there's a lot more - I can back and forth with you on Twitter if you like about it - honestly it's not that hard to convince people when I break down the MSM attacks on the guy - pretty much every single celeb that attacks Trump today attacked Bush then - like Micheal Moore is probably the easiest to just parallel it - but there's a much more complicated reason why people hate Bush and it gets to the heart of why Q is a thing as it involves the military versus the cult and the cult basically thought all they had to win forever was make sure Jeb Bush didn't win, and do it by permanently etching in everyone's hearts how evil the family is - that was the cults plan - and the good guys plan essentially used that plan against them by putting all our eggs in the Trump basket but to explain it will take a while so I'll stop here - it's not that important that people get straightened out on this in the short term - the DECLAS will make it crystal clear who is good and evil in this giant game of chess

            Is there any way to contact this guy to do an AMA or any kind of post on Voat?
           </p>
           <p>
            This whole thing is scary but fascinating. I've been watching some YT vids with some guy decoding Trump's twatter posts using Gematria. My normie husband says the Gematria thing is bullshit, but I'm just starting to find out about the codes used to communicate between Satanists or whatever you call them. I don't know much of anything about Gematria, so I can't say definitively that it's real or fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy Alan sounds like an authoratative resource on cults and secret signals. I have had a freaky weird life but my guardian angels (and my self-taught common sense) always seemed to keep me from getting sucked into weird cults and crime and other horrors. I ended up a normal, traditional housewife in a swank suburb, but my life could easily have gone oh so wrong. I've seen enough to know there is a complete alternate universe of criminal activity that exists concurrently in the same space as normie life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hate twatter, and I see one link, but can any of you post links to other sites with Alan or other satanic / pizza decoders? I hate to get involved in this because it scares the fuck out of me, but I would really like to know more. I'm sure others would be interested as well, so pointing us in the right direction would help bigly.

             pity, I would DM with you on twitter and answer questions back and forth if you would try it.  I do that for a lot of people as I decode stuff daily and much else - SerialBrain is pretty brilliant at decoding but sadly he no longer has Reddit to post to -
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/SerialBrain2">
              https://voat.co/user/SerialBrain2
             </a>
             so he set up on VOAT - try him if you like

              Thank you so much Alan. I will consider giving twitter a try. I don't know yet what I would ask you. I assume you are the OP and it seems as though the Gematria decoding is real. Wow. I really appreciate your work. It takes guts and a rock-solid compass to come out into the open with this. Thank you again.

               np, learning some of what I have about my past rocked me pretty hard but over time it's become clear what I need to become - as you say "rock-solid" basically that - I met so many other victims and so I have to be strong not just for myself but many others that will come out after me- I'm up to that challenge of setting a good example for others to follow.

             note the reference in the QMAP - also it's a code for cult family members that are not in the cult but are instead experimented on and raped in their sleep (anal probe) it's one of those things the bad guys have a code for so they can talk about the horrific things they do to people out in the open - it's tied to the entire history of the concept of "ET" - here's another tweet thread where I decode it

             - and there are many others - but to answer your question I am just a cult victim but the code you are referring to would indeed be applied to me

               You raise an interesting idea about special abilities - and the direct answer to your question about telepathy is no - however they broke my mind many times over and to survive I did have to adapt and grow in some ways, that was not their goal of course, they were trying to make me a school shooter actually for most of my life - but they failed and I do think surviving so much and being forced in extreme circumstances to act has given me some "special abilities" my pain tolerance is infinite for example - and well there are a few other things but not like super powers haha -  they also did inject me with aluminum which according to my research and the good guys giving me hints appears to have lead to the MMR vaccine and the explosion of Autism in the world, I am certainly autistic and some people consider that a super power -

            Hi Alan (or Bill)
I can't get your story out of my head.  Here are some of my questions (if you are still checking comments on this post.)
1.  Did you get a timeline on when your tapes will be made public and you will get your day in court?
2.  As far as you know, who attended the regular movie nights at Epstein's Island when the film that was secretly recorded of you was screened?  Did your family attend?  Were you ever told that Epstein's island is actually the location of DUMB--ie with many more hidden facilities underground than can be seen in the aerial photos?  If so, were you told whether the underground facilities have since been destroyed?
            <br/>
            3.  How high up in the cult was your family?
4.  Are you able to do a video interview?
Thanks if you can answer.

             Always happy to get more questions : ) - I don't get nearly as many as I'd like.
            </p>
            <p>
             1.A-I wasn't given a timeline however there have been some clues
             <a href="https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1045786798801055744">
              https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1045786798801055744
             </a>
             regarding the timeline being parallel to Judge K getting into the Supreme Court - as my case may end up being a Brown V Education kind of thing - a way to make sweeping change using my filmed life as an example of not getting the "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness" promise that all American's are guaranteed to, because yea, my entire life was controlled in a test tube environment, so that's my current presumption and fits with all the codes the good guys have sent me as well as the QMAP as it stands now.  I would guess the tapes will be made public via the court case so first we have to secure the supreme court in Justice K and then invoke a legal process which will culminate in the needed case which will then through judgement will change things in our country, perhaps MK Ultra related things limited or vast in scope - it's hard to guess.
            </p>
            <p>
             2.
Q"Who attended" A- family would probably not attend, my mother was deaf in one ear due to using an ear piece to spy - she was just a nut and bolt of the cult not purveyor of the films.  My elder (not eldest) sister moved up quite a waze so she probably did, attending the sacrifice days - where myself and many other victims were each given death traps and they would bet on who would survive/die - I would presume on the sacrifice days the entire top echelon of the cult would attend, it's religious thing - killing kids and adults, and members of the military while praying and then raping children themselves - I make presumptions on some of this, I never attended anything - I'm just a victim, but I can read the codes well enough to make  assertions and educated guesses.    - There is a cinema noted on Epstein island - I believe that's where they would watch the highlight reels and live footage of special sacrifices (like the day I was to drown)  the drowning day is particularly notable because years later they would set me up into thinking I would get great footage of something they were doing weekly - basically they told me they were doing these weekly bets involving a man who was blindfolded fighting people who weren't - I thought that sounded cool and asked them to film it and I'd upload it - I bought them a camera for it - and they returned it to me with not the requested footage but instead two guys swimming in a pool happily - it was a joke about how they thought I would die (and were watching live) the river footage but instead of seeing a surefire death they just watched a kid having fun in a dangerous river (i never dove in where they asked me to which would have killed me).  - It's a joke I only got after realizing the truth about things - a complicated joke but one I'm confident of due to the very strange circumstances of each part of the story.  A deliberate attempt to reference a past failure for people watching me as an adult for a joke to the despots watching the next attempt on my life - a way to tie my entire sacrificial life in a bow.

             2.5 " Q-Were you ever told that Epstein's island is actually the location of DUMB--ie with many more hidden facilities underground than can be seen in the aerial photos? If so, were you told whether the underground facilities have since been destroyed?"  A:no I was never told this, but the QMAP mentions the underground stuff and says they destroyed the tunnels but they were so stupid they brought their cell phones into the tunnels thus our side was already able to map it all out cause we were tracking them.
            </p>
            <p>
             3.Q How high up in the cult was your family? 
A- I think they were mid-tier in relation of things back in my grandmother's time - both my grandmother's and one of my grandfather is/was cult - however they tried to take over my good grandfather's farms by wedding him with my cultist grandmother - that worked and they had a kid and the first born was the sacrifice cause that's how the cult does things when they take over a family - they sacrifice first born and induct 2nd born into the cult - when the first born dies 2nd born takes everything - which is where the cultist parent focused their attention/love - while the non cultist parent would be prone to create a bond with 1st born - that's my understanding of it - and anyway my father had a kid himself in myself and my two siblings - so again 1st born gets sacrificed and so does 3rd born - 2nd born gets in and my mother and cult sister tortures - so to answer your question I think due to my grandfather divorcing my grandmother my cult family is much lower tier than it otherwise would be - but my uncle who was to take over the farm is pretty mid-tier but it's due to him taking over a giant set of farm lands in Georgia - so it was my non cultist grandfather that owned all that stuff - so it's not like the cult gives him much of what his value was - he is merely taking over something that the cult wanted by being inducted.  Hopefully that answered your question, it's not like I know the intricacies - I do know I was an important sacrifice to the cult, they orchestrated not just my home life as a show but the entire neighborhood I was in (there were other victims there also filmed tho) - as well as school life, planting people around me, and eventually my work life - so considering how much money/power that takes is mind boggling and is a testament to my family have plenty of importance but I'm not sure how that translates into being high up - tho my sister as said was working under Obama in 2016 and delivered my tapes to the admin then
            </p>
            <p>
             4.Q Are you able to do a video interview? Thanks if you can answer.
A- Yes, nobody has asked to do one.  In enough time I'm sure the good guys will give me a megaphone and that'll be that, certainly my story would be a good one for it.  But I'm not a journalist and my autism means everything I say/do is stream of consciousness - I need someone to ask me questions and keep me on task - that's why I can't do it myself - tho I did try actually back in late April I started making daily videos on YouTube which prompted the good guys to send me a code about it being a good thing to do, and doing that seemed to have triggered the bad guys into being more active against me hence right after that my family confronted me, took my computer, shut down the YouTube/twitter - and then I ended up being forced into hiding - so it does seem like it'd be a good idea I just get stuck in my daily twitter answer and decoding routine - certainly if someone asked me to and they were serious I'd do it.

              Thanks for your detailed answer.  Also I've read through everything you've posted including everything on twitter, and will keep following you.  It's hard to get my head around how this cult works, and your information is very helpful.  I hope you'll keep "putting yourself out there" because your story is amazing and important.  Thanks again and I wish you all the best.

            Hi AlanAnon! 
I have a strange question, one you may not be able to necessarily answer but I'd like your thoughts anyway. 
Regarding the other victims you met at the facility to talk to, were they drugged by good guys beforehand? Do you think any of them would remember you explaining your story, or would it maybe be more like a vague dream? 
Wishing you lots of love, light, and good vibes. WRWY AlanAnon. Thank you for everything.

             drugged?   I think I was the only one there that wasn't on medications.  The bad guys tried to get me on drugs as a kid every day but I saw what it did to my father so I never succumbed to it, (turns out he was a victim too, tho I barely knew him, the only thing I knew is I didn't want to end up like he was)
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure the other victims I met remember me quite well, it's not everyday someone tells you your whole life was a torture experiment - and most of them accepted it right away because of how strange their pasts were, put in new context of it being a torture show for rich despots - well, suddenly a lifetime of horrible and strange experiences made sense to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also helped them accept it due to how (in some cases) the oddity of how they came to be there, some were just arrested and told a family member had pressed charges against them and they were never aware of it before then or of anything that family member had against them.  - Basically it was just an excuse to get them to talk to me and so it made a surprising amount of sense in context.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now some of them were in much worse psychological shape than I was, but it wasn't that they were stupid, just traumatized in one way or another,  so while they had moments where they would be out of it, when they were with it, they communicated and understood them just fine.
            </p>
            <p>
             thank you for the question, honestly I spend most of the day just hoping more people will take an interest in it, I'd answer questions all day long if I got enough to warrant it.

             I think we're just at the beginning of this road. It's so aggravating when you realize the sheer size of this problem. When the light comes on, it's a roller coaster. It takes strength and focus to learn about this and handle the issue without emotions. It takes practice to be able to read an article, to be able to talk about this, never mind researching the subject. It is taxing for a normal human being, but we must keep at it, otherwise it won't go away. We must toughen up.

            Hi welcome and thank you for sharing your story :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            The use of colours is mentioned a lot in the book Where Angels Fear by Laurie Matthew. It is a collection of survivors accounts of SRA. For example white would indicate sacrifice. Grey one who had betrayed the group. Other colours would be used to indicate hierarchy within the group and could vary from group to group. I would recommend all here read this book unless you feel it may trigger unwanted memories.

            Regarding Kidz Kare...I followed this story on Above Top Secret however the thread is in a protected forum only viewable to long term members so I cant link to it. That was where I first discovered that shipping companies were linked to child trafficking as kidz kare were hiring huge containers to ship trinket toys yet the weights in their invoices did not make sense if it were just trinket toys they were shipping. Lots of weird things connected to it, maybe I'll make a thread here about it. What else did you know about kidz kare?

             I only know what I can decode from using the wayback machine looking for KidZ - and it's not just KidZ Kare - but ending it in a Z seems to be a code that ties together a lot of child services that are codes for pedophiles.  I know very little, it was decoding the QMAP "what else is on the table" with Anderson Cooper (answer = highlighter) which combined with my understanding of yellow being reward led me to realize how they could use a nursery and a highlighter to run a child sex ring without anyone knowing (cause the kids would be sedated)  -

             thanks for the advice on the book, I'll keep it in mind : ) I've solved quite a few colors as the good guys have been sending me clues now and then and occasionally flat-out telling me if I don't get it after a while.

             The pink one is the only one I'm not 100% sure of as I've built quit a library of the rest - white/black I think are more universal colors they can use to represent things concepts rather than a fixed meaning like those above

             thank you, I'm available all week long on my twitter to educate, I'd love to get more questions and help as best I can with my experience - I've been pretty censored on twitter and only get about 1 question a day if even that - here I've gotten a much bigger response and that makes me happy : )

              Ive been reading your twitter but dont tweet very much. I was wondering if you could go a bit more in depth on the symbolism of Epstein island. Why the wiggly lines in various shapes? Red and white, and blue and white? Also, do you know about the princes of the four cardinal directions? From what ive read its a heirarchy of people representing diff manifestations of satan. Im very curious about symbolism.  Why do they use Nat Geo to communicate? Any other publications they use? Sorry so many questions. Also, those weird badly animated youtube videos...those are so wacky. How do the cultists know which weird video to watch?

               this is where I talk about stripes, and if I hadn't agreed to not show certain family members pictures I'd show you red/white gold/white stripes as well - basically those two stripe combinations are cultist ones - blue/white however means holy - for a child to wear them it is symbolism of "holes" as in they rape - and that includes Obama when he was younger - many horrible people started off as just victims - but at some point they must be held accountable for their actions - in any case it also means closed eye uniformly for the cult - anytime they use horizontal stripes in clothing it means "this person is in a cult family but are unaware of it" - all color combinations mean that as it's a tool the cult uses to relay the important information that "this one isn't one of us" - of course they can be later inducted in - most do so at age 6 - but in any case red/white as far as symbolism goes means bloodlines - they are in various shapes likely because of how the cult takes over bloodlines - often by seducing the rich heir of a non cult family - and then when children are born inducting the 2nd born into the cult, sacrificing the father and 1st born - effectively taking over the bloodline - and that's one of the ways they take over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know about the cardinal directions - I do know some many of them are satanists and that's how many of them justify what they do to themselves.  - As for Nat Geo? That's just the one i'm best at decoding - just about all major publications are cult - the nice thing about Nat Geo is that it's written for all cultists including really old and not smart ones - it makes it easy for me to pick up on the codes because they can't be complex given the target audience isn't bright people.  I could decode other magazines it would just be harder to.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for those badly animated YouTube videos - they are just a young cultist who is writing for cultists who again aren't that smart - which makes them good to learn the language as he is in many of them just blatantly talking about cult stuff and joking about how normal people watching it won't get it.  One video talks about why everything is so stupid and then he goes off on a tangent about there being trees everywhere - which is how the cult identifies what they are - a forest of plants - and another video he talks about climbing a vine - which is how cultists climb other plants to get higher in the world - it's the secret to how cultists get successful so quick, they are all in a secret club but they don't know each other - they only all know a secret language of symbols they identify in each other and help each other - they move up in an organization (including YouTube) and plants along the way as if it were a vine that they climb - help them move up while keeping all regular people from ascending based on legit merit.
              </p>
              <p>
               And that's also how cultists know to watch, cultists don't get a memo to say "go watch this guy" no, they just recognize the symbols and go "oh this guy is one of us, PROMOTE" and they all promote the ones and those ones promote them as they all move up together leaving us out of the loop wondering what it is we can do?  which is another point made in his videos - that it's simple and easy when you know what to do - we the non cultists don't know what to do, they do - they are taught it from practically birth
              </p>
              <p>
               and please do ask more questions, it's the highlight of my day to answer them.  I never can get enough

            Thanks for helping us to understand how this all works, and I wish you hadn't been put through such hell.  I noticed your mention of vaccines as agents of psycholoical manipulation.  Does this somehow tie into the massive expansion of the vaccine schedule over the last couple of decades?  Are they poisoning the public with toxic vaccines?

may produce such side effects as encephalitis. Both of these problems are |due to the inherent difficulty of controlling live viruses in vivo[once they are placed in a live person]."

              Thank you.  This is horrifying.  Opens up a whole can of worms regarding SIDS deaths, doesn't it?  I've also watched a couple videos from Dr. Russel Blaylock.  The picture is suddenly getting very clear.

             is where I talked a bit about it.  The good guys gave me a few clues about studies they did around the time I was 3 years old - tho I can mostly just remember bits of being in the hospital and being injected - and I believe the bad guys have been trying to make us stupid for a long time - and vaccines are just an extension of that, they tested it out using guinea pigs like me and their best solution was not one large dose but many small doses of aluminum hence we get the MMR vaccine - just a bunch of shots of neruotoxic aluminum right into you which ends up in the brain - it's what makes people autistic and it's why it exploded not that long after they tested it out on people like me.  It's why I can't read a book and get lost pretty much all the time.  I think they didn't intend autism they just wanted to make people stupider by 20% or so - just enough to keep the sheep following the shephards of their media.

             so yes... I believe they are poisoning the public with toxic vaccines.

(a) General rule
In the administration of this part and other pertinent laws under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, the Secretary shall—
(1) promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on December 22, 1987, and promote the refinement of such vaccines, and
(2) make or assure improvements in, and otherwise use the authorities of the Secretary with respect to, the licensing, manufacturing, processing, testing, labeling, warning, use instructions, distribution, storage, administration, field surveillance, adverse reaction reporting, and recall of reactogenic lots or batches, of vaccines, and research on vaccines, in order to reduce the risks of adverse reactions to vaccines.
(b) Task force
(1) The Secretary shall establish a task force on safer childhood vaccines which shall consist of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control.
(2) The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall serve as chairman of the task force.
(3) In consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, the task force shall prepare recommendations to the Secretary concerning implementation of the requirements of subsection (a).
(c) Report
Within 2 years after December 22, 1987, and periodically thereafter, the Secretary shall prepare and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate a report describing the actions taken pursuant to subsection (a) during the preceding 2-year period."

               yea, I agree, justice will be done so.  People will realize the horrible reality that they are seen as livestock, holes and organs at best.... and we act as sheep thanks to the siren song all around us from everyone we are taught to trust reinforcing the singular narrative of poisoning our children, both in body and mind as they rule over us.but we are resolute now and are nearing the end.

              Thanks, that is exactly what I was wondering.  I have heard but not looked too deeply into the theory that pineal-gland malfunction is related to autism.  I have also heard the cabal will ritualistically sacrifice kids and then consume their pineal glands.  Is that something you're familiar with?  Would it be too crazy to think one of the goals of the current vaccine schedule is to alter brain structure in a way that yields more potent pineal glands?  I know it's a stretch, but I can't help but wonder why they would want such a massive number of incapacitated individuals in society.  You'd think they'd want us dumb but still somewhat productive.  And I know autism is a "spectrum."  I'm speaking about cases where the individual cannot function independently.

               pineal glands - they want everybody to have small pineal glands. They do this with fluoride. They pump that into water, water bottles, tooth paste etc.

                Don't some pharmaceuticals also contain fluoride?  There must be a link from fluoride consumption to infertility, if it's an endocrine disruptor.  That plus heavy-metal toxicity could help explain autism rates and decline in fertility.

               I don't think they consume their pineal glands, they create wars and steal body parts as old rich people need new livers/hearts/lungs/blood - that's 100% true - it's organ harvesting - but the bad guys make it silly by conjuring up the imagery of costumed deviants bathing in blood - but the cult to my understanding doesn't do anything like that.  They speak in codes and keep all their deviancy out in the open - the only exception is after a ritualistic kill they sometimes eat cake in the shape of a person while in costume for spirit cooking - that's as I've mentioned after they kill one of their family members and drink their bloodline - but even when they are celebrating that - it's all on the surface just a creepy Halloween party.

             I was in Georgia from age 0-11 so that includes the years they were pumping me with aluminum - here

             this is where I mention the  study the good guys mentioned as I was born 05/13/82 - so do the math and I was the perfect age for alpha wave testing in this study. - I know only what the good guys have sent me and they have implied a lot about that time I spent in the hospital during the first 5 years of my life - from age 12 to this year I was in Colorado - and they would still do tests like spinning me in a giant net for long periods of time - and other things off and on during elementry school - in junior high they didn't do any tests but just psychological abuse (which they did in elementry as well, but I suspect after I turned 13ish they no longer were after the data from the aluminum injections)  -
            </p>
            <p>
             I know little about the CDC - the mention of Georgia is surprising to me because as said, that's where I was - I was born btw in Hahira, Georgia - 2 weeks early as they say - (because if I had born 2 weeks later I would have been born in June - the 6th month which would mean I'd have gotten into the cult - they did that joke with most of the victims at the facility - as I asked them and they'd go "I was born X weeks/months early - and it'd always line up with "I should have been born in the 6th month" - cause that's the joke for the cameras - a stupid joke but one they carried through multiple of our shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             addictions as well - as said they tried desperatley to get me into drugs daily from a young age - but my father (who I only recently learned was also a victim) had a lifelong battle with alcohol that gave me an iron will to never take ANY medication/drug/tobacco/alcohol - this might be part of why they want me to tell my story first as I made a few good choices like that.

              You were born in Hahira? That's a very small town- less than 3000 in 2014. It's right off of I 75- a major corridor to Florida. It also happens to be a few miles from Dobbins Air Force Base. Very interesting! Did you grow up in town, or out in the country?
Aluminum is highly toxic, just like mercury. In 1987, vaccines had mercury in them. According to a 1999 CDC report, 25 micrograms of mercury (the amount in the HepB vaccine) injected into newborns was enough to cause a seven-fold increased risk of autism.
How did you find out what they injected you with?  Were you told it was a vaccine?

               0-1 was in Hahira and spent in a home with a red carpet where all sorts of sick stuff I believe happened

               - 1-5 was spent in another place in Valdosta which is where my first memories are from and include stuff like the bathroom molestation and near rape -  I remember my preschool had a big tinman icon thing on it but I can't remember the name of it - I only remember the girl who hit me in the head with a steel chair which I still have a dent in my head from - well long story -
              </p>
              <p>
               and yea, airforce base - lots of pictures of that in the cult chest - I don't think it was called Dobbins tho, if you said the right name I'd recognize it - tho the pictures might be from the one my mother stayed at when she was younger cause she would talk about that some times.
              </p>
              <p>
               I grew up in a town, early years it was mixed with going to my grandfathers farm a number of times - most of my memories from back then are abuse related, I can't really remember much aside from it.  I remember the house we moved into when I was 6ish was my great grandmothers and it had liquer hidden everywhere which my father had a lifelong battle with - I think it was to tempt him - I also remember playing hocky with myself with the roaches, I remember there were roaches everywhere - just like there were flies everywhere in the Alan house a few years later - well, I guess that was fun for them to watch - all the places had satelite dishes which I now realize was broadcasting our lives to somewhere, either directly to Epstien on special days when I (and the other sacrifices) were meant to die - or just going to a place to edit for highlight reels.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have no idea what they injected me with, I presume based on the good guys sending me that link to the study about the attention that my disability of autism comes from what they were doing back then - perhaps I was a beta test for the widespread MMR vaccine which is banned in Japan
               <a href="https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1041234268079308805">
                https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1041234268079308805
               </a>
               - for good reason- anyway I can't say for sure its' just my guess based on my memories, the study they linked me to, my disability, the timetable of when alpha waves appear in a child minds versus the study date, and the QMAP which talks about it a bit - yea I think it just makes sense but I'll find out when the good guys finally stop talking to me in code and start doing it directly.

                Thanks for the info. Rechecked, it is MOODY Air Force Base. 17 miles away. After parents complained about the mercury (thimerosal) in the vaccines, they replaced it in some vaccines with aluminum. The flu vaccine has mercury in it. You may be able to request one without it. So sorry about your tragic childhood. You are amazingly resilient! God is using you to expose the inner workings that outsiders can't. Bless You! Did your mother send you to school? How were you educated?

                 oh Moody... yes that's definitely the name on the back of those photos in the cult chest - I have no idea what happened there but it's part of things
                </p>
                <p>
                 did my mother send me to school?  my sisters and I went to an Open Bible studies thing but I was under 5 so while I found photos that said I went I do not really remember it - I also found photos of my mother and her father going to a Salem church (subtle right?) -
                </p>
                <p>
                 as for the rest of the education - well they didn't just film me at home they filmed me at school and all the teachers were in on it - in retrospect it's obvious as they would have me stand in specific places while they tormented me, It never occurred to me that was a thing because of camera angles - but well, a lot of things make more sense now.  and tho I did go to school I wasn't taught anything - I taught myself how to read and everything else - I can't remember a single thing they ever even tried to teach me at any point - but then I wasn't there to learn things I was there for filmed amusement of the despots watching.

                  I find it amazing that you had such a tortured childhood, yet you were able to educate yourself. Amazing! Where did you get the books/knowhow? I don't think the internet was up and running when you were young.

                   I'm pretty autistic and that helps learning some things - I can't even tie my shoes and I get lost if I walk more than 10 feet - my brain is VERY uneven - I can do something at a genius level and some things I can not do at all and will never be able to do.  I learned how to read from playing role playing games, I learned 99% of what I know about history by autistically shoving info into my brain in the last year - I've always dreamed of saving the world and I love puzzles - Q was a facinating puzzle and when I realized the shills were pushing against him I decided to try and "solve Q" and that led me into history digs - as the first thing he asked us to do was focus on State Secrets - so I began there - I dug into Thomas Jefferson Versus Aaron Burr through the James Wilkinson letter - which is where State Secrets begins - and that led me untangling knot after knot in history - it became an obsession - and that's how I know history.  - I've never read a book in my life tho - despite having written 6 of them.... that's a long story in itself but I get lost both spatially and also if I read for too long - I lose my place - what I am good at is connecting things and correlating data and also my brain because of how it resets makes me constantly question things -it's a good tool to have when shills are pushing us in so many directions - all I did at first was pay close attention to what the shills were pushing and then rather than ascribe to group think I purposefully pushed towards it.

                     well as said I can't tie my shoes so I wear velcro and I can't read books or do a lot of normal people things - but on the other hand I can do somethings pretty well and I find that's a common trait of autistic people - "was I ever diagnoses" - no actually not as a kid - they injected me when I was young and spun me in a net when I was a kid and other tests - but they always told me I was stupid, not disabled.   I believed it and kept trying to make myself smarter to no avail - that was part of their psych manipulations - I only realized I was autistic about 7 years ago about, and I did so by looking up online people who were autistic and when they talked about how different it was for them it was the first time anyone ever put into words for me what my life experience was in relative measure to other people's - it "clicked" and actually more than that because most of what the autistic people would say I would be like "that's me, but actually I'm about about twice as autistic as this person it seems"

                      Check out this book:
"In How to End the Autism Epidemic, Generation Rescue’s co-founder J.B. Handley offers a compelling, science-based explanation of what’s causing the autism epidemic, the lies that enable its perpetuation, and the steps we must take as parents and as a society in order to end it.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      While many parents have heard the rhetoric that vaccines are safe and effective and that the science is settled about the relationship between vaccines and autism, few realize that in the 1960s, American children received three vaccines compared to the thirty-eight they receive today. Or that when parents are told that the odds of an adverse reaction are “one in a million,” the odds are actually one in fifty. Or that in the 1980s, the rate of autism was one in ten thousand children. Today it’s one in thirty-six."

                       certainly sounds right.  I think I linked to you before my tweet thread which included how Japan had banned the MMR shot - and that's the one that seems to be the primary culprit in the giant surge of autism - and since banning it kids got way more healthy... I really wonder how the world was tricked into making the MMR mandatory in the 80's given based on my understanding every bit of research done (and there was very little) on injecting kids with aluminum said it was a terrible idea - but they just said - oh it's a vaccine, and somehow got the whole world to play along.  it's rather scary how the media control takes us for rides like that.

              Thank you for sharing your story. It’s almost more than my mind can wrap around. If I hadn’t already been exposed to some of it (beginning with the Podesta emails) I don’t know that I would be able to believe the depravity of people involved in this evil.

            Thanks for coming to Voat!  I hadn't seen your story before and it is really interesting.  Of course it is tragic and horrifying, but we at pizzagate are used to it.  And your story gives evidence that the mkultra people are being rescued and/or dealt with, which offers hope!
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you talk more how you received or discovered the cult chest?  And what types of contents were in it -- not a list of each picture, but for example were there videos, printed materials, etc?  Also, how and when did the military contact you in person and how you were convinced to go to the facility for victims?
           </p>
           <p>
            As I've been learning about pizzagate and mkultra, it's made me reinterpret so much fiction that I've watched or read over the years.  Your story had me reliving a young adult novel I read as a child.  William Sleator's 1974 House of Stairs describes a research project where kids are abducted, put into an mc-escher like sensory deprivation chamber, and half starved.  They are fed properly when they do terrible things to each other, as the purpose of the experiment was to turn them into monsters.  The kids separated into two camps, those who became monsters and those who held out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could never understand the point of that depressing book, and now I learn that it was based on real experiments.  It's unnerving to learn that one of my favorite childhood authors must have been part of a twisted satanic cult.  I'm afraid to learn how widespread this cult is and how many people are involved.

             is actually when I moved back into the cult house where most of the filming took place. the "Alan" House - my name isn't Alan, the good guys called me Alan and they did so to clue me into the fact that Alan was a code for me - my father's name was Jack Allen - and then the MK Ultra stuff was done at the Allan institute - anyway it's just a phonetic code of LN
            </p>
            <p>
             to continue - as that tweet's image (click look top) says it was late 2015 when they moved me  - before that they had me moved around and that's a long story in itself - but once I got back into the Alan house I lived with another victim and also my cultist mother - she had lots of cult stuff everywhere including a chest of old photos going from recent days all the way back to stuff like the Japanese internment camps - just family photos - and so the photo albums had some oddities (many of which I can't share cause I promised another family victim I wouldn't) but they basically when looked at sequentially they told various stories... like of them intending on murdering me by feeding me to dogs when I was 3 (I ran away) crocodiles when I was 7ish (long story and something else went wrong to make it not happen) - drowning me, and crashing and a few others.... and also photos of people getting into the cult - much of which required understanding cult codes (like the ones I decode for folks) to properly read - and I had been learning those from the start of Q so basically I recognized first that some of the photos predated traumatic events they referenced - like when I broke both my arms in a bike accident as my brakes locked up - and one code led into another memory into another photo into another code until I got a rudimentary understanding of cult coding.
            </p>
            <p>
             The videos are not something i have ever had access to, I know they exist and will be made public but it's not the kind of thing they would leave laying around even in a cult chest - they are locked up in places like Epstien island and only brought out for cult parties or in the hands of the powerful who enjoy child sex/snuff films - the photos without understanding my past and basic cult coding would just look like regular photos. - context is everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for how the military contacted me.. ok this requires some explanation - so basically my mother is a cultist who worked with people all my life to torture, rape, indoctrinate, and kill me - but the military can't just pluck people like me up - for one thing we have handlers - in my case it was my best friend of 20 years the Owl James - (like St James island, many people in my life have names corresponding to geography there) - so they basically needed to work with what the cult was doing - and so they flipped my cultist mother and that's the only reason I had access to the cult chest in the first place (she never said open it, she just left it in the room I was staying in) - and over time the good guys would call me - (which I didn't pick up until april of this year) - it was in April that I opened the cult chest for the first time and then after seeing the first few codes I started looking at everything differently - and noticed that i had been getting weekly calls that had names like De-Be-Que - which as I was into Q I had created a website called Database of Q Db-q.com (it's all broken links and obsolete tho now) so wtf was that about? so I started internet searching the numbers they were calling me with - and it linked up to search results of my past - things like studies done when I was a kid - and one of them actually spelled out in a sentence (10 search results in a row ) that I would create a lawsuit with other victims and be awarded with lots of cash soon....  -
            </p>
            <p>
             anyway, they got me to set up my twitter - my original one RealAlanAB - and it started to explode in followers - I uploaded family photos and told my story and then the cult freaked out and threatened my mother causing her to re-flip and confront me, take the computer shut down the twitter and then take me to a hotel - at the hotel a police officer came and took me to a facility which took me to a psych ward  where I got checked out - and then I was taken to a facility to meet other filmed victims and explain to then why many of them had been abducted and brought to a facility (it was to talk to me so I could tell them what I knew) - the good guys communicated with me during that two week span through the newspaper of all things - giving me coded articles each day -and they also had people there... -ok this is  looong story... I've mostly told it

             so let me just stop mid telling it have you read this if you are curious and then ask again cause holy crap is the true story of what happened long and confusing... if you don't understand any point let me know cause I had to condense so many events into just a few sentences - my rescue took months so there's a lot of things that happened.

               ok, I just spent well over an hour trying to explain why I think that so at the very least I hope you read this giant set of tweets.. haha and no, I didn't ever meet Epstien or go there - my belief is centered in my decoding of my past, history, and a lot of contextual clues.

              Yes, I did read your posting on acchat40 before I responded.  That is how I knew to ask about your cult chest and your residence at the facility.  I read in your post about your disabilities and difficulty writing.  I see what you're talking about, and your writing has a "stream-of-consciousness" style that one poster her said she coulnd't follow.  But I was able to follow it, and I found it fascinating and informative.
             </p>
             <p>
              For what it's worth, I think you should add your response to me here into that post.  (The parts that aren't repeated.)  I'm really happy to hear about your lawsuit.  It sounds like they are putting you in a class action suit.  It might be worthwhile to explore suing the individuals directly as well, by yourself?  I suppose that could come later.
             </p>
             <p>
              A few observations:
             </p>
             <p>
              It sounds like your mother may not have "re-flipped", but maybe she became afraid for her safety and attempted damage control.  That's very interesting how they let you discover it for yourself with the photographs, and with the hints.  When a person realizes they have been betrayed and defrauded, it is a traumatic experience.  Letting you realize it slowly is probably a way to preserve your stability.
             </p>
             <p>
              And when you tell your story to the other victims, it will help them to understand their own victimization when they are ready.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have read a bit about how children are traumatized and programmed with hypnotism and multiple personalities.  I wonder if some of your "disabilities" are related to that.  For example, you could have a separate personality that is programmed to take over as you are committing suicide.  It would force you to go blank and stop.  So, perhaps they were experimenting on whether they could override your programming, or maybe they were torturing you by making you suicidal while not letting you do it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The time that you attempted suicide, it sounds like someone intervened.  White stuff in your cuts doesn't sound like its from your body, but maybe like a medical foam which can be inserted to stop up bleeding.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you were asleep for 12-20 hours, you may have actually been sleeping.  Or perhaps you were in a trance or a different persona and your memories of that time were wiped or blocked.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if your story were fiction, it would be quite a read!  Wow!  I'll just ask a few questions I'm curious about.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many followers did you have on realalanab?  Which months was it active approximately?
             </p>
             <p>
              Can you fill the timeline?  Just with the approximate month/year, don't need the day:
             </p>
             <p>
              You move to Alan House - November 2015
Q starts posting - November 2016
You discover Q - ???
You discover the cult chest - ??
You figure it out and communicate with Q - ?
Start RealAlanB - ?
You and your mother delete Twitter and the computer and flee to hotel - ?
              <br/>
              For how many days were you at the hotel before the police came?
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason I ask about it, is that much of your writing is out of order and I think it will help people understand your story better.
             </p>
             <p>
              Finally, have your government contacts given you restrictions on what type of information you can't disclose?  Besides your location and peoples' identities.

              <p>
               so yea, I was there at the very start, I remember talking to one of the two spreadsheet anon's and talking about history digs - I set up a fan site myself db-q.com and well, don't bother going to that, it's outdated now and the links are a mess - they also deleted my banking list I made (since the cult kept deleting early in On Q the rothchild bank list ) so I went through and dated them all and gave wars alongside - but they deleted that one so I went and made it again : ) -

               It was there from November 2015 but I didn't look through it and photograph it until that April where everything in my life kind of exploded - I may have glanced inside it before then but didn't "get it" until April of 2018

               You figure it out/communicate with Q -
              </p>
              <p>
               they were trying to get in contact with me via phone from the start of Q - and I just didn't realize it - the very very first bullet point of Q communication would be someone I learned later was a Q - who stickied my first ABBA post -  have to use the wayback machine now to get to my history reddit digs but feel free to look at the bottom of that post to see other history digs I did - but this was part of it - oh can't link to it.... this place doesn't link to reddit Great Awakening....)   - and after he would sticky these they would basically slowly guide my history digs until I noticed enough of the cult symbolism that I could recognize what was in the cult chest as well as connect it with my past. -  Q doesn't directly communicate - that's in the QMAP - but indirect communication is ok - hence all the phone codes and other crazy stuff they do to nudge me in the right direction.  Can I even call that communication? sort of... and the 8ch stuff certainly is - the titles they direct at me.

               - proof : )  was the last day my twitter feed was up - and then it was the last week of May when I started my new one using a phone I bought the day I got out of the facility-yea all the facility stuff happened in-between those two dates. - also note in that post if you scroll up and see the abba drudge thing note that was april 28th which was days after I started doing youtube videos (also taken down and I haven't done any sense) that might have been what triggered the bad guys more than even my twitter feed)- which is why Drudge sent me a little code (ABBA was the name of my reddit digs  - see above answer)
              </p>
              <p>
               For how many days were you at the hotel before the police came?

               About three hours, I took my phone out and put on the Mark Levin show and before it was done a cop was knocking on my door, politely asking me to go with her, I asked why and they said that I needed to talk to some people.... and I asked if I had a choice and she said no and she was really vague about everything... but I get why now in retrospect.  They had the next two weeks planned just for me so that I could talk to victims - essentially the cult overreacting to my twitter feed was likely always part of "the plan" and the counter action to that was putting me in with other victims - it's quite brilliant and I enjoyed my time there acting like a spy getting codes in the news papers  - here's one of them

               ah May 24th that's probably the day I set up my current account.  There's two others - I think I tweeted about them but I don't see them in the search feed, - if the codes aren't clear I can break them down further for folks, basically it's about my transition from in danger at my mother's home where I was trying to "hit a ball" i.e. tell my story and educate folks - to being protected in a cage where they set up the balls for me to hit (give me victims to talk to) - basically counter acting the cult by making it easier for me ;) tho there are many other codes in there.

               The reason I ask about it, is that much of your writing is out of order and I think it will help people understand your story better. - 
I agree, I wish more people would do this because I have trouble editing my story - I am fine to tell it but it's just so dang big and my autism gets in the way of telling it as I'll go off on tangents and often detour myself on long conversation topics that have little to do - I'll never finish my story with the way I talk. it's just a disability thing.

               Have your government contacts given you restrictions on what type of information you can't disclose? Besides your location and peoples' identities. -

               no, they communicate with me indirectly so they avoid having to put rules in the first place.  They send me messages using search results on my phone, and by moving books/magazines around in places I go to form messages, and in the Qresearch titles and if I have a question I can ask it in 8ch and they will not respond to me but respond they will do things like give a review of an interview by James Comey -which happened when I gave a bullet point A.B.C.D.E. of things I wanted to Ask Q about - and they replied with a interview review going 1.2.3.4.5 with each one being about Comey but directed to me - as said, indirectly talking to me or another time on may 2nd at the motel - they first called me from sioux city bluffs (cult is bluffing you) - to let me know while I was in my mothers vehicle that they wouldn't harm me... and then I asked at 8ch using my phone at the motel and they responded to my asking wtf was going on by talk about Kanye West - and how a ton of people worldwide were helping him but he has powerful enemies and - well, I wish I could find that post - it was an image reply they gave to me and when I got out of the facility it was deleted in 8ch - but it was a cool reply.

              <p>
               no, they had me see one before and during the facility visit with other victims and they checked me out - I have had a few panic attacks sense then (which caused the good guys to worry about me, and I'm really sorry about that if you read this, I'm fine now)  - which led them to question if i was eating right haha, well I only had the one panic attack mainly because they connected my computer to a lot of other computers and I didn't know they had done that, (they were giving demonstrations on how the bad guys spy on computers) and so... I accidentally went to a compromised site while my computer was connected to theirs and that meant they all had to do make sure they weren't infected- it inconvenienced a lot of powerful influential people - I sort of traumatized myself when I realized through reading the codes all around the internet the good guys use that I had screwed something up...  the worst part is that I know acting the way I did only made it worse for them - but I just can't handle hurting people - and even just inconveniencing them as I accidentally did tore me up inside - but that was on the 26th of last month and i'll be more careful to avoid those sites... ok had to get that out of my system since they read what I write in places like this.

              </p>
              <p>
               basically reading the QBOARD around that time about D-Day plus Drudge codes + historical context

                My last comment had an error.  Pizzagate broke around November of 2016, not Q.  Anyway, your dates are right since you listed October 2017 for following Q.
               </p>
               <p>
                You said that your mother put the box in your room because Q told her to.  But it was in your room in 2015, before Trump's election or Q.  So maybe she put the photo album in there at a later date.

                 I actually think the good guys controlled Homeland Security and had done a lot of things even before the election and Q- the plan is really big - I think they were flipping cultists left and right (mostly in secret) and flipped my family before even Trump - in fact I'm darn sure of that because my cultist grandmother died about 3 years ago a week after my father died - both of heart attacks - I think the cult basically killed my dad was a victim through his mother who had victimized him his whole life - and then the good guys basically retaliated by killing her - this freaked out my cultist sister - I don't think it made her flip tho - I'm saying that there has been a secret war that goes way before Q - that's just the outward manifestation to the public of a military campaign to save our republic which has been going on for a long time.

“[We’re preparing] a class-action lawsuit to sue the Canadian government, maybe also the Quebec government and the Allan Memorial Institute. It would first have to be approved by the Quebec Superior Court, which could take four to six months,” Stein said."

               sounds about right to me.  When I finally answered the phone call in april after they had been contacting me for months it was about setting up something that I'm pretty sure was a class action lawsuit but it only amounted to giving them a verbal confirmation that I was willing to be involved... - they didn't say anything about it being in Quebec and since I was in Georgia/Colorado my entire life (up until going into hiding this year) I don't think I'd be involved in Canada - but I would imagine many victims are also from Canada and so maybe they'll go after Canadian branches and victims here will go after American branches of the cult tree

                Who contacted you? How did they know to contact you? Most of the Canadian victims were adults seeking help for mental illness. I don't think they were in a cult. They were taken advantage of by the MK-Ultra doctors (who might have been in the cult).  Stay safe!

                 and I suspect it is this philosophy which while incredibly useful in avoiding narrative stealing and people posing as speaking for Q - makes it tricky when dealing with saving victims like for example.

3,000+ saved by the raids in SA alone.
WW lanes shut down.
Bottom to TOP.

                <p>
                 So how do we reconcile the fact that they are saving victims yet don't communication outside of 8chan?  The answer is likely military operations and WW governments helping for the SA ones and in other parts of the world a similar thing -

Q
                </p>
                <p>
                 get it? basically the people doing Q are very few in number and they don't directly communicate, and they talk via "coincidences" like they would call me and I would plug the phone numbers into a search engine and coincidentally the results would spell out a message to me - or I would ask questions on 8chan and coincidentally someone would reply to me talking about something else that had the reply to my question...  so basically it's hard to call that conctacting - the most direct they ever got was a guy walking up to me on the street after the facility handing me a wad of cash.  - but that was a unique circumstance - they thought I didn't have any money on me and wanted to get me into a hotel - so there's a bit of nuance to the story of how I basically left my cultist family and then ended up in hiding somewhere very far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How did they know to contact me?

We know all.
TRUST.
Q
                </p>
                <p>
                 basically the good guys know the bad guys operations including the filmed victims like me, they worked their way up the ladder using my cultists family as a branch to climb "the vine" of the cult tree into the forest of 'em - so knowing about me just comes naturally from getting deep into the cult - in fact my sister worked for the E.P.A. in Washington D.C. under Obama in mid 2016 - so there's a lot of ties my family has to things -   So much I'm tempted to say to this but I need to keep my autism from making book sized replies - feel free to ask more - it's why I'm here : )

                   nope, she was there for exactly 6 months (cultists do things in 6's) and I believe she was delivering the cult videos through the E.P.A. to the D.O.E. which is where they were stockpiling the illegal material as it can't be FOIA -

                   here note the video I linked to with the codes in it.  - as for where she is now?  I have no idea, I have my suspicions and I know my handler is in jail anyway, she might be or she may be just another that will be soon - there's a lot of "if's" - but one thing to note is Q is always saying "you have more than you know" - this is connected to the arrests and executions of many worldwide... we have more than we think - and soon we will know what we have.

             ask me a question?  it said you were suspended?  Try asking me on the twitter (DM or just reply to anything) or if all else fails go to the pinned link on my twitter and ask there - I'll answer any question - it's what I'm here for so I hope you can ask what you want and my answer will be satisfactory. : )

            Sleeping children abuse was depicted in the TV series TRUE DETECTIVE, it was an obscure evangelical boarding school there so I guess that was based in real life situations.

            This is some fascinating stuff. It ties well with what I have read about "Targeted Individuals", grooming of school shooters. The code-speak seems the most fantastical part of it, untill you realize gangs have their own versions of the like as well as underground organizations, that is probably how it was born, I wonder how far back in history it goes.

             before the bad guys got my computer I had a huge history database I was autistically building that could trace it event to event back to the 1600's which I was able to do because that's when the Tokugawa clan began in Japan and created what amounted to a central bank there doing currency control and keeping them in the dark ages while places european countries secretley pillaged them - that was until the mid 1800's when the good people of America clued them into their owners and told them to get a freaking constitution : ) and so they adopted a philosophy of Natural Law - it's a long story that weaves throughout human civilization - the good guys have helped me piece together a truer history and soon everybody is going to know it : ) exciting times!  - I'm a victim but I'm also super into history!

              "As Ōgosho, Ieyasu also supervised diplomatic affairs with the Netherlands, Spain and England. Ieyasu chose to distance Japan from European influence starting in 1609, although the shogunate did still grant preferential trading rights to the Dutch East India Company and permitted them to maintain a "factory" for trading purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              From 1605 until his death, Ieyasu consulted frequently with English shipwright and pilot, William Adams,[20] Adams, fluent in Japanese, assisted the shogunate in negotiating trading relations, but was cited by members of the competing Jesuit and Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders as an obstacle to improved relations between Ieyasu and the Roman Catholic Church."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Significant attempts to curtail the influence of Christian missionaries in Japan date to 1587 during the shogunate of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, in 1614, Ieyasu was sufficiently concerned about Spanish territorial ambitions that he signed a Christian Expulsion Edict. The edict banned the practice of Christianity and led to the expulsion of all foreign missionaries. Although some smaller Dutch trading operations remained in Nagasaki, this edict dramatically curtailed foreign trade and marked the end of open Christian witness in Japan until the 1870s.[24] The immediate cause of the prohibition was the Okamoto Daihachi incident, a case of fraud involving Ieyasu's Catholic vavasor, but the shogunate was also concerned about a possible invasion by the Iberian colonial powers, which had previously occurred in the New World and the Philippines."

              Were the Dutch East India traders members of the Sephardi diaspora? They were enemies of Catholic Spain. Otherwise, why were they allowed to stay?

              "VOC Opperhoofden in Japan were the chief traders of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC in old-spelling Dutch, literally "United East Indian Company") in Japan during the period of the Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the Edo period."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In 1638, the harsh Sakoku ("closed door" policy) was ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate; and by 1641, the VOC had to transfer all of its mercantile operations to the small man-made island of Dejima in Nagasaki harbor. The island had been built for the Portuguese, but they had been forced to abandon it and all contacts with Japan. Only the Dutch were permitted to remain after all other Westerners had been excluded.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Dutch presence in Japan was closely monitored and controlled. For example, each year the VOC had to transfer the opperhoofd. Each opperhoofd was expected to travel to Edo to offer tribute to the shogun (Dutch missions to Edo). The VOC traders had to be careful not to import anything religious; and they were not allowed to bring any females, nor to bury their dead ashore. They were largely free to do as they pleased on the island; but they were explicitly ordered to work on Sunday.
             </p>
             <p>
              For nearly 200 years a series of VOC traders lived, worked and seemed to thrive in this confined location."

              "As a nephew of the King of Portugal, Antonio sought the Crown, supported by the New Christians as well as by a large section of the population. Philip II defeated him at Alcantara, so he fled to Holland and proceeded to Calais and then London where he resided with Dr Rodrigo Lopez, Queen Elizabeth's Jewish physician. At first the Queen of England and the States-General of the Netherlands, seeing in Antonio a means of diminishing the power of Philip, recognized him as King of Portugal. This gave protection to the Portuguese Marranos and encouraged them to increase their trade with the Indies, since the port of Lisbon was closed to the Dutch. Antonio sympathized with the Marranos, for his own mother was Iolanthe Gomez, a Jewess. The people of the Netherlands sympathized with them for, as Protestants, their common enemy was Philip II. This understanding led, from 1593, to the gradual migration of the Jews to Amsterdam where, in 1596, they were permitted to build a synagogue and practise their Judaism openly.
             </p>
             <p>
              These good tidings, through the usual mysterious channels, reached Spain and Portugal, and immigrants poured into Holland where they immediately discarded the uncomfortable cloak of Christianity which they had worn. "
             </p>
             <p>
              "When the Christian shipowners of Amsterdam founded the Dutch East India Company in 1602, they determined that no Jews should become high officials or directors of the Company. When they needed the Jews, however, they did not hesitate to employ them. Don Samuel Palache and his brother Joseph, amongst the founders of the Amsterdam community, rendered valuable service to the Dutch East India Company. Joseph Palache served as Admiral of a fleet fitted out by the Sultan of Barbary to assist the Netherlands by piracy upon Spanish shipping. Samuel Palache acted as Consul for the Sultan of Barbary in the Netherlands territories."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Only two Jews were registered amongst the original shareholders of the Company—Stephanus Cardoza, who took shares to the value of 1800 florins, and Elizabeth Pinto, who invested 3000 florins. However, as the influence and power of the Dutch East India Company grew, the Jews gradually bought up its shares, and by the end of the seventeenth century became the principal stockholders in Holland, controlling a quarter of its stock. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the relief and sustenance of the needy Jews of Amsterdam was obtained by a communal tax on the Jewish shareholders in the East India Company, which formed a principal source of income of the community in that period and for many years afterwards."

               yea I've tried to read the article a dozen times now.... this is something probably beyond my disability to do.  - I note a few things I can kind of connect - like 
"When, in 1580, Philip II of Spain became King of Portugal and closed the port of Lisbon to Holland" - perhaps this led to them setting up in Japan in 1600 through Tokugawa - would fit the parody I saw that involved a holland man alongside Townsend Harris as his interpreter - well I just connect things.... I'm not the kind of person that can read a book, my disability makes it literally impossible.  Long articles are hard but if I can connect enough things then they become doable,  if I still had my old computer I had a really facinating dig that I had just started into the east india company - but sadly the cult has that computer and I can't bring myself to re-build was was over 10,000 folders or so folders each with a date allowing me to peruse history at my lesiure... I had a masterpiece of true history that allowed someone like me to really understand it - and the cult just took my comptuer and now it's all gone... well I'm hoping the good guys give me that back - I would love to catalog these events and then make room in my history digs as that would give me the context to properly comprehend it - as it stands now I just see too much vagueness - and the article isn't helping much with a lot of data points being given not in a sterile way but with inflection like "Despite the cruelty of the edicts and bans, distance lent enchantment, stimulating emigration until," - I need data points not interpretation to understand - anyone can say what someone else was thinking but I want clean facts and it's just full of that - well, I just wanted to say I tried, really hard to read it.  and I might try again later or when and if I ever get my computer back

               well, you certainly do know a lot more of the details than I do, my disability makes me only good for the big data points - and over time I build up a database in my head of important events that naturall confirm each other - objectivity is a lost art.

                Here are 2 big data points that are always left out of history books:
               </p>
               <p>
                What is the history of the 100,000+ Sephardim (Mediterranean Jews who migrated to the Iberian peninsula during Roman times) after they refused to convert to Catholicism and were evicted from Spain (and later Portugal) in 1492? Naturally, these refugees would hate Catholic Spain and Portugal. At that time, Protestant England was competing with the Spanish. "Your enemy is my enemy" alliance.
               </p>
               <p>
                What is the history of the Dutch and English East India Companies? What investors had controlling interest?
               </p>
               <p>
                I have given some answers to these questions in my posts. Money is power. Follow the money. The true power is hidden.

                 I think there are hundreds of big data points left out and thousands of medium sized data points left out - and it's gotten worse as QMAP mentions - that if one picks up a history book of today versus 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago one will see a gradual shift from patriotism to anti-american rhetoric.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My biggest gripe about history is that it doesn't have the cult codes in it which when one understands the good vs evil dynamic of most of the founding fathers versus the outliers like Aaron Burr because easy to understand - why someone like Thomas Jefferson wasn't loved b the media yet Burr and Benedict Arnold were - and conversely why as time passed Arnold became maligned - flipped on a dime just as the media would do for Lincoln when it become convenient for them to pretend like they liked Lincoln -when really the media has always been on the side of the despots

                  "versus the outliers like Aaron Burr"  He opposed Alexander Hamilton's proposal for a second Central Bank.

                 <p>
                  Why do you consider him an outlier?  Why did the Federal Reserve put Andrew Jackson on a Federal Reserve Note? He was friends with and supported by the family of Septima Sexta Middleton Rutledge, daughter of Arthur Middleton, Signer of the Declaration of Independence. Jackson considered his crowning achievement as President to be THE DEFEAT OF THIS SAME BANK by not granting a renewed contract. He was the only President to PAY OFF THE ENTIRE U.S. DEBT!  He would have been no fan of HAMILTON! the Musical.

                   Hamilton the music is the same as Titanic in terms of accuracy - it exists I believe soley to implant in the minds of the american people "the facts" as in the cult facts of what they want us to think about these two men.  The actual facts of what happened in that duel between the two men is a curious story for the near future when State Secrets get revealed - I think they feared the DECLAS would happen back in 2001 with W Bush which is the actual origin of when it was written - (book was written in 2004) trying to put a statement out there to solidify a narrative - which had the DECLAS happened back then they probably would have turned it into a titanic esque monster of a film. But we are still waiting on that DECLAS -   take for example the poncho code

                   which was given both during the W Bush presidency and Trump's - well that's a long story and it takes me so dang long just to untie all the narrative loops people get wound up in on who is good and bad - so rather than do that again I'll just say it's a complicated story we will soon be learning that has a lot more spies in it on both sides than people have any idea about yet.

                   and so on - I think Jackson and Hamilton would have been great friends, they might have disagreed about banks but have you ever read Hamilton's words?  the man was brilliant, Mark Levin does a stunning reading in his book Rediscovering Americanism, I suggest it :  )  - and compare that to Aaron Burr- famous quotes "The rule of my life is to make business a pleasure, and pleasure my business." and "Never do today what you can put off till tomorrow. Delay may give clearer light as to what is best to be done." - that quote in particular is a calling card of a cultists who needs marching orders - and tracking down this guy's past with Benedict Arnold in Canada was one of my first major breakthroughs in digging into history - long story short the guy is the original nemesis of America - started the two biggest banks that still exists to this day! and so much more... but anyway, .... I could go on that forever - history will be revealed in the DECLAS - perhaps it's best to leave it at that for now.

              </p>
              <p>
               In advance of his voyage to the Far East, Commodore Perry read widely amongst available books about Tokugawa Japan. His research even included consultation with the increasingly well-known Japanologist Philipp Franz von Siebold, who had lived on the Dutch island of Dejima for eight years before retiring to Leiden in the Netherlands.

              </p>
              <p>
               Perry's expedition to Japan was preceded by several naval expeditions by American ships:

              <p>
               From 1797 to 1809, several American ships traded in Nagasaki under the Dutch flag, upon the request of the Dutch, who were not able to send their own ships because of their conflict against Britain during the Napoleonic Wars. Japan limited foreign trade to the Dutch and Chinese at that time, under the policy of sakoku."

               this one is one of those things the media gets us tied into knots about - rather than Perry who opened Japan it's better to look at what Townsend Harris did in educating the Japanese about things and tie in when he visited to wars they fought the people fought - and it's hard to know the full details but it's clear the cult had basically closed off Japan from 1600 till 1800's and was being kept from progress of technology through isolation - being taken advantage of not unlike southern African slaves of today... Perry I don't know much about but in forcing them to listen to America it certainly led to them expelling their rulers so he probably was a flipped cultist of some kind (and we also did a similar talk with Russia through buying Alaska 2 years after they got their first central bank also in the 1800's) we basically educated their brightest and best in as many countries as we could - in particular Japan, about the cult.  - Learning this they threw off their rulers and Britain was forced to become visiible to them for the first time and try and take them over in force using the shogun as their proxy doll or something like that.  I'm doing this from memory, I had a HUUUUGE  set of thousands of folders I built over months that connected the history and I can't even link you to the history digs I posted cause Great Awakening is gone.... so all I can do is give you it from memory... hopefully that is satisfactory - I'm positive we will learn more about this soon

                It all began with the original East India Company and the Virginia Company chartered under Elizabeth I. Robert Rich, aka Earl of Warwick, See  "Papers of Robert Rich, Earl of Warwick [manuscript] 1607-1624."

                Ask: When Ferdinand and Isabella evicted the unconverted Sephardim from Spain (later Portugal), where did the 100,000+ go? Answer: Holland, English American colonies, South America, Jamaica, and islands of the Caribbean. Some of the Dutch Sephardi refugees later settled in New Amsterdam (New York). James De Wolf was likely descended from these refugees.

                He was a contemporary of Nathan Mayer Rothschild,  the son who founded the banking dynasty in England. DeWolf gained fame and fortune during the war of 1812. His profits went into building a slave trade empire. Nathan Rothschild eventually reestablished his central bank in America:
               </p>
               <p>
                "Financed at virtually no interest by the Rothschild controlled Bank of England, Britain then provoked the war of 1812 to recolonize the United States and force them back into the slavery of the Bank of England, or to plunge the United States into so much debt they would be forced to accept a new private central bank. And the plan worked. Even though the War of 1812 was won by the United States, Congress was forced to grant a new charter for yet another private bank issuing the public currency as loans at interest, the Second Bank of the United States. Once again, private bankers were in control of the nation's money supply and cared not who made the laws or how many British and American soldiers had to die for it."

                 interesting, my history research led me to believe it was the death of a cultist that they were intending on making president (I no longer have my research) - I just remember my folders and I had a big dig on it but perhaps both things are true or I could be wrong - either way it's interesting to hear this new research, all my research was using data points starting with State Secrets and following cultists using the codes in their names as reference points - - well I'll look forward to learning the full truth soon. thank you for the data : )
                </p>
                <p>
                 oh tho clicking your link... "By Michael Rivero" - that's a code - 
Micheal = Mike = Microphone 
River = Water is code for Info
                 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=water%20from%3Awatkins_2&amp;src=typd">
                  https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=water%20from%3Awatkins_2&amp;src=typd
                 </a>
                 Rivero = o is code for eye 
basically they use their names as ways to let other cultists know who to promote - his name tells me just as AJ's water filters do

                 </a>
                 , just as the other gentleman who gave me a good cult info with the name of "Silverchord"
                 <a href="https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1043788825816793088">

                 and I explained to him that chances are that was a code for 6 music meant to put him to sleep - and they do this stuff all the time so that even those of us  smart enough to want to find the truth, the truth we find will only have an approximation of the truth with the most important parts manipulated in some way - that's how much they manipulate us!
                </p>
                <p>
                 but I digress my cult coding is imperfect so I could be wrong  that name tho is just a big red flag that this might be "anti cult info" that the cult pushes to get people not looking at the right leads - - either way I appreciate it : )

                  I research via bloodlines. It's the most reliable. Especially if they are one's ancestors. History is about relationships. The Morgan who reported Aaron Burr's plot to Thomas Jefferson, was the grandfather (or great) of the wife of John Jacob Astor lll's wife, who was a cousin of Alexander Hamilton's wife. J.J. Astor's wife had cervical cancer and so he set up the first dedicated clinic in New York City. Sadly, his wife died before it opened. The only treatments available were opium-based for pain and experimental radium treatments based on the work of Mme Curie. Astor had made a fortune in the China opium trade as well as real estate, and interestingly, a side product from Rockefeller's oil well digging was radium rock. The original "Astor Wing" is now upscale apartments, but early on, the cancer treatment center was moved to a new location and eventually became the Rockefeller run Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. John Jacob Astor's lll  only son was named Waldorf, after the German town of their ancestry. He built a hotel on family property and named it the Waldorf. Not to be outdone, his first cousin, also an Astor, built a hotel next door named the Astoria. Money won out when they decided it was better for business to combine them into one hotel, The Waldorf-Astoria. Waldorf, who had moved to England with his parents where they became landed gentry, married Nancy Langhorne. Lady (Nancy) Astor became the first woman to sit as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons. She and Waldorf were part of the "Cliveden Set" where they hosted influential leaders at their estate. She was against England going to war against Germany (WW2). Her sister, Irene, had married the famous cartoonist/artist/publisher Charles Dana Gibson. She was the model for his "Gibson Girl". Gibson was the great grandson of James DeWolf. James's nephew was George DeWolf. George's daughter,Theodora,married Christopher Colt,the brother of Samuel Colt, who invented the revolver. Jame's brother Captain John was the uncle of Herman Melville. He inspired the Captain D'Wolf character in MOBY DICK. James DeWolf's great niece married a descendant of Arthur Middleton, Signer of the Declaration of Independence. Arthur Middleton's ancestor is Thomas Myddelton, an original investor in the East India Company under Queen Elizabeth l. 
That's just the tip of the iceberg!

                   nice digging : ) - my digging led me to the conclusions that the cult basically seduced Astor with an attractive young woman who then lured him to the Titanic for him to die - she got off, he didn't and that's the story of the FED - she then raised what might have been his kid (how could we know given the circumstances?) and had a life long fiscal fight with Stor's actual heir Vincent for all the money... and as testament to that right after the Titanic Vincent  married Helen Dinsmore Huntington, on April 30, 1914.[7] At the ceremony, he was stricken with the mumps, a disease that made him sterile; - which is something the cult does to their enemies - this is what it means to cross the cult - not just murdered his father but rip out the family tree and planting a new one

                    Actually, John Jacob Astor IV (cousin to Waldorf) is the one who died on the Titanic. He had been secretly funding Nichola Tesla's energy research to the chagrin of J.P. Morgan. He also did not support the elite's plans for a "Federal Reserve." When he found out Tesla wanted to provide free wireless energy, Morgan withdrew his financial support, and some believe he had Tesla's lab burned down. "Jack" Astor divorced his wife and married a much younger woman. Morgan, who owned the Titanic (Starline) offered his socialite friend a cabin on the Titanic's maiden voyage for Astor and his new bride's returning honeymoon trip from Europe. His wife was already expecting. Iv'e read other info that said Astor left his inheritance to his children by his first wife by prior agreement, and the second wife got a house and some money for their son. Your account of a setup is plausible. The pregnant wife got a seat on the Titanic life boat, Jack Astor did not. The ship sank in 1912. The Federal Reserve Act was passed on Christmas Eve in 1913. Some say it was never properly ratified. I have read that President Trump's uncle had access to some of Tesla's papers obtained by the government after he died. I think this same uncle worked on a secret radar development program during WW2.  The English branch of the Astor's continues to this day as Titled Landowners.

                     yea, sounds about right.  It sounds like you are saying much of what I tried and perhaps failed to say properly due to my autism and lack of grammar skills : )

                 interesting, my history research led me to believe it was the death of a cultist that they were intending on making president (I no longer have my research) - I just remember my folders and I had a big dig on it but perhaps both things are true or I could be wrong - either way it's interesting to hear this new research, all my research was using data points starting with State Secrets and following cultists using the codes in their names as reference points - - well I'll look forward to learning the full truth soon.  thank you for the data : )
                </p>
                <p>
                 oh tho clicking your link... "By Michael Rivero" - that's a code - Micheal = Mike = Microphone Rivero = 6 Water = Info of the 6 - that's a big red flag that this might be "anti cult info" that the cult pushes to get people not looking at the right leads - or maybe it's not - my decoding is far from perfect - either way I appreciate it : )

            Please get in touch with Carolyn Limaco as she does videos decoding the symbolism, etc. She could use your help and vice versa. Sadly, Carolyn was also a victim of child sexual abuse. Thank you for coming here stay safe and stay well.

             the only reason most don't come forward is they aren't aware they are victims - the good guys had me meet with 20 to tell them - and it wasn't just those born into it but military victims who the cult decides to make "shows" of  - torture them for perhaps some terrorist they killed the bad guys like (or so I presume) - so there will be many more coming forward soon - and many fake victims dissapearing soon as well - Dark to LIGHT - end of redactions means the truth will prevail - DECLAS (6) is coming soon  - note DECLAS is misspelled in the QMAP with 6 letters as in declassification of the 6 - codes like that are a good way to start picking up on codes everywhere : )

            This picture of Caris James standing in a basket holding an orange has bothered me greatly... I don't know why exactly, it just sort of got stuck in my mind. I've read a couple of interpretations of it, what's your take? Thank you.

             I have always wondered if she may in fact be his child because of the polka dots on that dress and the orange she is holding. Her facial features favor him too. The dots on the dress are very similar to the dots on the coat of arms for The House Of Orange and she is holding an orange. People like Alefantis come from old monarchy bloodlines and they are VERY proud of their heritage. This is a picture associated with the dynasty of the House Of Orange. I'm not sure what the basket means but i'm sure it has a meaning.

              Do you have evidence of this?  He appears to have a Greek background, although "Alefantis" is not a Greek name.

               Alefantis- I thought that translated to "I like children" - which the symbolism thing they use is a way for the cult to find the guy who handles the pedophiles - the cult operates not by directly talking but by following the symbolism - it's how they don't get caught cause nobody knows who everybody else is - they just follow symbolism to get where they want to go and what they want to do - they climb the vines of plants in any field - other plants they recognize and that's how they move up in organizations - and plants who run the places who climbed the vine pick other plants to work for them - it's self perpetrating until the best jobs are all cult

              ah yes William of Orange... I had a giant set of folders digging into that history.  that and the A/B testing they do by making someone like Aaron Burr and Benedict Arnold AB-BA - making it so that no matter how one reads a roster they can pick out the plants - stuff like these are centuries old codes they still use today to let other cultists know - and to climb up in the world you have to climb the vine of plants of the cult into the "sunshine" - there's a lot to say about symbolism of plants and orange and letter codes - so much I get lost in thought trying to even decide where to start or stop talking about it

               Those circles under her eyes tear my heart out.  I too believe she is his daughter.  He didn't have to have sex with a woman to create that baby.  There are other ways now.  I believe he is one of a long line of Rothschilds and if you think about it they are a family cult.  They all are surely taking part in the horrible habits of raping children, SRA, etc.  This has been handed down and down and down which really is the description of a family cult.  If you try to leave yours, they will come after you and also your children.  I happen to know someone that was in a family cult and that is exactly what happened to her.  So JA is now repeating what has been done in the family for decades and even centuries.  Somehow they have kept this cult going and that is much easier when you have the wealth and connections they have.  These are my thoughts anyway.

                true, he didn't have to have sex with her but he calls her a MILF in one of his IG photos, so chances are they did.

             someone asked me about it and I decoded it along with some other stuff here - basically- shopping basket = buy -  the orange = end in cult code  - usually they "rent" kids that are asleep, but this one appears to be for sale.  Asking for a permanent owner - or possibly own then dispose as the owner/parent can no longer hold on to her for whatever reason, not a fun thing to decode but I'm just telling you my translation

            I have some questions, if you can answer them:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Is there any objective--what is the point--in raping and torturing children?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              You call them 'cultists'. By that do you mean Satanists?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Where your family tied to freemasonry?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              How much counselling have you had? Have you been diagnosed with DID (dissociative identify disorder) or any other mental illness?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              What exactly is their belief system?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I am concerned that you think POTUS is contacting/signalling to you.  Are you on any meds?

              I gave a whole list of reasons they do it - rape = blackmail and also recruitment for sickos - torture = experimentation data to further control the masses by perfecting psych controls.
             </li>
             <li>
              I call them cultists cause satanists just sounds sillier to me, yes many are satanists tho.
             </li>
             <li>
              my grandfather owned a ton of land in georgia and farms - the cult likes to own things - they sent a cultist to marry him and take everything from him - it worked but when he divorced her it basically put a curse on my father and me - but the 2nd born, my older sister still got in and was the one who basically did the early directorial stuff involving me including much of the early filmed torture and sex stuff.
             </li>
             <li>
              they had a couple talk with me at the facility where I met the other victims - they both said I was ok : )  I was suicidal for much of my life but unraveling what happened to me has helped me come to realize that most of my bad thoughts ( usually just self hate) are the result of a lifetime of psych manipulation and so I'm learning how to love myself.
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               I think many just do it because they grew up in it, they aren't inherently bad people they just got a golden ticket and few people have the conviction to throw that away to be a good person (especially since if they did they'd be destroyed by the cult.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               No I'm not on any meds... POTUS was not contacting me, not exactly... you can see my proof of what happened here -
               <a href="https://acchat40.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=164&amp;t=132667">
                https://acchat40.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=164&amp;t=132667
               </a>
               - it's a long story but basically when I realized I was a cult victim a lot of things went crazy in my life and I curled up into a ball and cried for days - in particular realizing that my only friend of 20 years was the worst one of all.... that he was my handler- that was REALLY hard to come to terms with - and after I stopped crying I told the only person online I knew (Who I later learned was a Q) that I didn't know who to talk to and didn't really feel like talking to anyone...
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             And so after this POTUS gave me a little nod in a tweet which I would NEVER have realized but the good guys nudged to me that it was a code to me and in QRESEARCH the titles (some bakers are Q) made it crystal clear that it was in fact a little nod to me - all it was was POTUS saying "Bill, Everyone is talking" and my legal name is Billy - it was our POTUS telling me not to be afraid to talk about my past - and then when I asked how, the QBOARD titles changed to the word Twitter - that was how I was meant to communicate - and so I started a twitter account and began my other account RealAlabAB - which led to my family tearing down my account and stealing my computer and then being taken to a facility with other filmed victims... long long story -
            </p>
            <p>
             but of course as the QMAP says no direct comms outside 8chan - so it's not like he would confirm it.  It's all in winks and nods.  This also means that titles in 8chan (as it is inside this platform) can be communication.  Some people treat  Q as tho he were a mythical creature who literally cannot talk as if they were bound by magic outside of 8chan... no, they are real people obviously, and they do have a life outside being Q. These kinds of statements by Q are an important precaution.  it means anyone claiming to be a Q or to speak for Q should be disregarded. GOOD! I don't do either of those things, I was only rescued and relay how they interact with me.  There are real people doing real things behind the scenes rescuing real people and locking up real people.

            If you are more interested in the cult color codes I go into them here

             https://twitter.com/watkins_2/status/1040503929216294912
            </a>
            as well as more on the sacrifice stuff -  You'd be surprised how versatile their color system is for conveying words without words.... like this for example

            - as it goes into more on the sleep codes mixed with color codes as well as connecting it to the QMAP

            God bless you &amp; tysm for sharing! I read through your site &amp; Twitter, but will reread; it's quite involved &amp; hard to decipher unless your mind is in that realm of thinking, imo.
One thing that's so common throughout abuse, mind control &amp;/or SRA is the double meaning &amp; coding involved. The colors, patterns, certain movies, &amp; play-on-words that victims are subjected to all share these odd characteristics. You're the first person I've heard mention the stripe theme. However, I view it similar to the Alice &amp; Wonderland checkerboard theme. You're not crazy &amp; you're not alone! I pray daily for victims like you that you find peace, joy, love &amp; freedom in knowing you're created in God's image.  He will sustain you &amp; never leave you!! ❤️

             Alice in Wonderland -  I am Alan - and each of those phonetically is LS= Alice - and LN = Alan - there's a lot of word codes the cult uses but basically there's a coding to the victims involving LS and LN - as a girl and boy victim - and that's why it's not just Alan but Allen (my father's middle name, was also a victim) and the Allan institute which is mentioned in the QMAP through

             as where they studied MK Ultra - there's a lot to say about all that, lots of codes to decipher and the color codes, animal codes, phonetic codes - all of it is to say without saying.  And the LS/LN codes are why it's not a word but a phonetic that they use to identify victims to other cultists.  It makes it harder to explain and thus more hidden - otherwise they'd just have 1 word that people would identify with victims -

              Colors also stand for certain drugs from what I hear.
The names of colors are also used as MK triggers to induce a fractured state. There is some kind of pattern or order to how they are stated out loud, and they are trigger words. I think referring to someone by one of those code words that you mention is a trigger. As is showing them a picture of whatever, the butterfly or bluebird, etc.

             @AlanAB

            . Thanks for sharing some of your story. We are a research subverse and require linked support for all major claims -- which gets a bit dicey for people who are victims and are giving personal testimony that they can't support with corroborating links people can look up themselves. The way we handle that is to give these types of posts an "Unverified" flair so that folks know they need to be aware they could be reading a LARP. Readers can decide for themselves if your material is worth investigating. The flair is not a judgement call by the mods. :-)

             I do have a small criticism of your policy in that most sources one could link to on the internet would be bad guy run so there's a lot of irony in linking to such things to provide credentials when they are in the opposite business.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can check my feed and the post for various proofs (and I have more) including the presidential tweet that was aimed at me, but if those aren't good enough then it won't be long before the DECLAS hits and the videos become public - I was given a code a few days ago that implied my videos were going to be the first to be made public so it won't be that long.
            </p>
            <p>
             In theory it is good practice as many "victims" are indeed larps, and as a result the real victims can't bust through the noise as the larps are the ones the cult promotes - hence further irony as they, unlike me, would be more likely to have links they can be bound to from plants in the cult controlled internet.... so well I guess I'm just saying you might want to rethink a policy that has a glaring logical flaw.

              Yes, you've mentioned that several times: do you have an approximate timeline as to when "your videos" will be released? Also, how &amp; why, if I may ask? I also respectfully ask why you think you've been helped, compared to others? There's many victims who have to claw &amp; fight throughout their entire lives to be vindicated in at least some small way. Is there something special about you &amp; your circumstances? Again, I'm not asking in a disrespectful or patronizing way; I'm just very curious as to why.

               up until April of this year I didn't even know I was a victim.  I'm just another cult sacrifice -not all victims get filmed their whole lives in a test tube - not many survive as many sacrifice days as I did, the good guys asked me to tell my story and so I have been.  Many more will be coming forward and I can't speak to any victim aside from myself, I do know some aren't actually victims - but planted people (be very cautious of believing everyone, including me, ask questions,) so that they can use their media apparatchiks to make sure if you know of a victim it's the ones they allow you to see - so for a real victim like me to break through the noise might be more unique than you think - we will find out when the declas happens and the fiction finally gets separated from the larps and disinfo
              </p>
              <p>
               as for why I think I've been helped?  Well I'm no longer at the cult house - I'm at a much nicer place in hiding - the good guys let me know they are around and leave me hints to help further my understanding of the cult - it's very nice and I like puzzles so they are doing the best they can to make me comfortable while letting me help in the best way I can - to put my autism to good use and my love of history as well..... - they also had me talk to other victims at a facility - none of which you've ever heard of - none of which (like me months prior) knew they were victims until I told them - they were brought to a facility just so I could talk to them and let them know they were filmed all their lives like me - well, it's a looong story, you'll know who we all are soon.  - I was given a message a few days ago that implied I would be the first to have my videos made public - so while I can't give you information on when they will be made public -apparently the first victim's videos of the filmed sacrifice anyone anywhere will ever see is mine.  (nervous laughter from me)

              I hear you. The reason we require links, is because we had a lot of early-on forum sliding with incredibly low-quality posts that were just people venting, giving their opinions, etc. and we're about gathering evidence, here. The flair is about reader awareness -- and to prevent folks outside of this sub, such as the MSM for example -- from using a LARP post as evidence we are a crazy, obsessed cult who will believe anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              Originally, we did not accept personal testimony at all on this board, and required it be posted in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              . But we came up with this compromise.

               that makes sense, and you'll get your linked articles in a quantity that'll boggle the mind soon anyway ;)

            This is really interesting stuff. Reminds me of a site I used to visit called The Vigilant Citizen. He writes articles explaining occult symbolism in pop culture.

             it's only recently that I've been able to even say things without getting shouted down.  My cult family physically terminated my twitter and stole my computer and now I'm in hiding in another state with a new account on twitter, and I bet that's a familiar story to many who wish to help explain what the cult is.  Just a simple little conversation that's so hard to have due to so much shout downs of the correct leads.  - anyway, thank you : )
            </p>
            <p>
             I took a look at VC and notice the hand eye pic - which I have pics of my family doing that as well it means "portal to heaven" - but with 6 letter words it's not "heaven" but 6 heaven or cult heaven.  - just like pics with stripes they take pictures of themselves making gestures to explain to people important information - stripes explain to other cultists "this kid is not one of us, feel free to torture them and come by on pizza night to rape"

              I really admire you for coming forward with this information. It must be so hard to do so, knowing that the whole fucking world, starting with your very own family, is against you.
             </p>
             <p>
              God bless you and thank you for what you do. I hope you will soon be celebrated as you should be : a true hero.

               I'm just another that was freed from being under the boot of the evil in our world, The heroes are going to be the ones who helped save the world by lifting that boot so that people could even see me.  - I do love the idea of being a hero and I do hope one day I can fit that description : )  I'll work towards it, thank you.

              I never heard of the stripe thing before you mentioned it, I'll be on the lookout now for it though. It sounds like you have a lot of stories to tell, I'm glad you're in a place where you can finally start talking without being shouted down.

               thanks, I expected my post to get down-voted right away, but I'm pleasantly surprised : )  I think we have turned a corner in rounding them up, our side must have busted some of their ratnests that did the online shilling.

               I was unaware I was a cult victim until April of this year - I had a terrible life as most cult victims did and was suicidal for most of it.  I never knew they were filming it and doing any of what they did.  It was only when I opened a family chest that had coded photos of my past, all telling stories of bad things that happened to me but taken months before the bad things (including many near deaths) - that everything finally clicked - then well.. then a lot of things happened but I'm OK now : )   And yes, I have tons more that I haven't said about my past due to how embarrassing and complicated it is - but my videos will be made public and everybody will know - and quite frankly I've reached a point where I'm excited to get it all out in the open so it can't come soon enough for me.

                I cannot begin to imagine what you and others like you have had to endure. As a parent I find it to give me the most hopeless feeling in the pit of my stomach to think about...I can't imagine doing such awful things to other people at all, much less to children. But beneath that is a rage and the certainty that we must expose this. The world HAS to know! Thank you for coming forward!
