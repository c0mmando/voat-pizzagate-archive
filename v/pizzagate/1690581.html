<p>The email I found is titled &quot;Adoption Case&quot;.  It was a forward of a long email chain from Stephen A. Vann to Kathleen H. Doherty.</p>
<p>Stephen A. Vann seems to have previously been a Consul General to the Us Embassy in Bucharest.  Michele Thoren Bond is also bigger member of the thread and she was the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs under the Obama Administration.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Thoren_Bond">Michele Thoren Bond - Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Anyways, the thread seems to be discussing a raid on an orphanage in Guatemala.  Its difficult to understand exactly whats going on in the thread but they seem to be discussing how the raid will be executed.  they discuss a particular family who will testify and go into protective custody of the Guatemalan Government.  They mention the safety of american citizens in Guatemala who are apparently living down there fostering children they will soon adopt.</p>
<p>From the email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The embassy should be in contact with the PGN to determine the type of raid (i.e. arrests etc) and 
when it will 
be 
taking place. Congressional offices are concerned about additional families that are 
in Guatemala now fostering the children they hope to adopt. I\'ve been told that many of these 
families (possibly 20-30) are staying in Antigua (I am not sure of the spelling but it sounded like 
that). If there is a raid and only the director of the orphanage is taken in to custody, the fear is that 
others connected i.e. &quot;henchmen&quot; may retaliate and this situation may put additional citizens in 
harms way. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name of the orphanage is &quot;Podesta&quot; and the director is Guillermo Bosque.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the email, it is specifically mentioned that the Orphanage in question is called &quot;Podesta&quot; and the director is Guillermo Bosque.  The name is strange but doing some digging on Guillermo Bosque, it appears there was a book written about missing children in Guatemala that alleges that he was involved with missing babies cases.</p>

<p>From the book:</p>

<p>Anyways, is it a coincidence that the Orphanage in question is named &quot;Podesta&quot;?  I may be way off on this but maybe there is more to this.</p>',

            I don't know if there's a connection or not but there was an email from Jennifer Argueta, who worked for the Clintons in the WH, to John Podesta regarding an adoption she and her husband were doing in Guatemala.  (The following info was originally posted by two different Ops on VOAT. )

            Dear Mary and John, Just a quite note to tell you Luis and I are headed to Guate for an undetermined amount of time. As I mentioned to Mary in the fall, we are in the process of doing a domestic adoption there.
Yes, I am the salmon swimming upstream, having obtained my permanent residency in Guate in February. But had to get the "green card" in order to proceed. We do not know yet who the little guy is, but he does exist somewhere, since he will be between 4 and 6 years old. We leave on June 6 and will keep you posted.** A big hug to you both, Jenny PS - I don't have John's gmail, so only send through Mary

            A million coincidences equals a conspiracy.  More coincidences, have you ever checked out the definition of PODESTA?:
           </p>
           <p>
            noun 
1. any of certain magistrates in Italy, as a chief magistrate in medieval towns and republics. 
2. a person appointed to serve as mayor of an Italian city during the Fascist regime.

            Nice find! Maybe I'm too sleepy right now to understand this, but in what type of circumstance could arresting a director of an adoption agency possibly put "additional citizens" in harms way?

            I found this &amp; it is a complaint &amp; has the name of the agency. "Worldwide adoption agency services" also mentions Podesta it's just misspelled.

             Hi, I believe it's related, But you're link:
             <a href="https://tinarandall.blogspot.com/2007_11_01_archive.html?m=1">
              http://tinarandall.blogspot.com/2007_11_01_archive.html?m=1

             opens up page w/ no blog entries.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, I was able to read the review from your imgur link:
             <a href="http://imgur.com/38LfnUt">
              http://imgur.com/38LfnUt

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             So you might want to delete the former web link.

            Podesta is a fairly common name in Romance-language countries, and the Podesta "South American" connection has arisen before.

             Ya it seems to good to be true.  Hopefully I can find something more about the others in the email.  Michele Bond must have worked closely with Podesta though.  And the emails just have a weird tone like they are worried about the raid for some reason...
