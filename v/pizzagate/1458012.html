<p>Namely, what would be the significance of that location through history. I wasn\'t getting very far searching the address so thought I\'d have a look at a map.</p>
<p>I found this map from 1913, which shows the general area: <a href="http://cdn.ghostsofdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/26224041/ca000117.jpg">http://cdn.ghostsofdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/26224041/ca000117.jpg</a></p>
<p>I then Photoshopped that map onto a screenshot from Google Maps, and noticed that there appears to be an underground stream that runs right underneath Buck\'s Fishing and Camping, past an old graveyard site: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/HnMhF">https://imgur.com/a/HnMhF</a></p>
<p>The stream is called Broad Branch, and parts of it have been restored, but not as far along as where Comet and Buck\'s are located, I guess because it\'s too built up. This would mean though that there should still be a tunnel underneath there, albeit a wet one, and according to my map, there could be an access point to it in the car park at the back of the buildings. <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141125-dc-daylighting-broad-branch-stream-restoration-science/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141125-dc-daylighting-broad-branch-stream-restoration-science/</a></p>
<p>Probably nothing, but I found it a fun exercise all the same! :)</p>
<p>As for there being an historical monument of note at the location of Comet, there doesn\'t appear to be anything there 100 years ago- boo.</p>',
