            FACT CHECKING MSM ARTICLE - Monica Peterson
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact Checking MSM articles and discovering they are bs, is easy. Lets stream line the proccess with flooding the view-point search market with normal people's fact-check articles.
           </p>
           <p>
            MSM article: washingtonpost.com - about Monica Peterson (claim to fact check 'people's viral memes' and 'fakenews-articles' is false about Monica Peterson death being unexplained, in haiti, investigating Clinton connections to Haiti-childtrafficking. Also claiming that her death was explained as a suicide and "‘Pizzagate’ rumors falsely link death of sex-worker advocate to nonexistent Clinton probe"
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            CLAIM:  FALSE
           </p>
           <p>
            Monica Petersen was in Haiti working for the Human Trafficking Center and also previously worked for the Colorado Human Trafficking Council’s Data &amp; Research Task Force.
           </p>
           <p>
            She died a few days ago under suspicious circumstances. Several close friends have made mentions on various FB posts that friends and family have no clear understanding of what happened to Monica except that she died on Sunday.
           </p>
           <p>
            An IRL friend of Monica said:
           </p>
           <p>
            "It seems that Monica was in Haiti investigating the Clintons possible ties to a pedophile ring. Monica family hasn't been able to get any straight answers about her death."

- "Contrary to reports in the media, the crowd sourced investigation labeled by some as "Pizzagate" did not begin with internet sleuths digging through the Wikileaks Podesta Files releases looking for pizza parlors and encoded language discussing human trafficking. It began with the shocking discovery that Hillary and Bill Clinton provided assistance to convicted child trafficker, Laura Silsby, resulting in a reduced sentence for child trafficking."

            Outro: Even if they all get arrested, we must still be there to remember and educate the public when they come to us with questions.
We have lost so many members to direct murder. The information is constantly scrubbed. We took on a war, some of us over ten, twenty years ago, and some of us with little or no support from family or friends. But we are still alive and kicking and making friends. We will make some friends alright, in real life even. Even the satanists trapped in here with us will learn to face the fear of trusting people to be kind unlike their abusive families did them. 
If we dont learn from the past, than we dun goofed.
In the immortal words of Bush Jr. 
“There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.”

            Pizzagate is a hard thing to prove to people if they aren't aware that kid fucking is relatively common for many sickos with power, money, and/or unmonitored access to children.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a vacuum, pizzagate seems totally unbelievable to the normies. They couldn't  fathom doing such things themselves, and because there aren't any bodies to point to with pizzagate, you have to show them other examples first, like the dutroux affair or the Franklin scandal or Jimmy savile or any number of other instances where kids were being sexually abused and little to nothing was done about it. Build a historical framework and then place pizzagate within that framework and suddenly it doesn't look as crazy.

            I found this medium article a pretty good start for pizzagate info.

            For me Alefantis's Instagram is pretty damning. His avatar, Antinous, shows his interest in pederasty. Overtly sexual imagery overlayed with pizza symbolism and codewords like chicken lover make him look incredibly sketchy, to say the least.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pedosta e-mail that's most suspicious to me, other than the handkerchief, would be the one where an associate of Pedosta's mentions he's dreaming about Pedosta's hotdog stand in Hawaii. Nobody fantasizes about hotdogs. Hawaii also has the cheesybay/Dave Flintstone connection(whose name was found in the Wikileaks emails, so we know he's connected to the clintons), and the island also had child sex abuse scandals connected to the Kamehameha schools iirc.

             The "handkerchief" comment could more consistently be a comment about a grease-stained napkin left after lunch. It's a huge stretch to assign pedophilia to a comment about leaving a dirty napkin around after lunch. Is it a surprise that Alefantis, a guy who owns a pizza place, talked about being a "chicken lover"? I mean, c'mon. If the guy had convictions of pedophilia, and he worked in the financial sector, then maybe that comment could mean something nefarious.

               It sounds like he's complaining about someone leaving a grease-stained napkin on his desk. As in "hey, you left your magical piece of trash here. That's gross."

               What's more reasonable: Podesta is having recorded conversation about child rape or he's talking about cleaning up the break room?

              The picture that was tagged chicken lover had nothing to do with pizza. That's an incredibly dumb explanation for the hashtag. Gotta come up with something better than that. Chicken lover is well established as code for kid fucker.   PIE used it in the 70's. Add that to his Antinous avatar and it's super obvious Alefantis is a pederast.

               That's exactly what I'm saying to the PG dipshits. If you are the one making accusations of child rape, YOU are tasked with having some evidence of that. Don't have it? Then what reason do you have to keep making those accusations?

               W.T.F. are you on about? Even if that's true, if it's "well established" then no one who knows that would say it on their personal IG or FB. This is strong evidence the whole PG rumor is pure fiction. I don't remember anyone mentioning code words for pedophilia when Jimmy Savile was exposed. He raped kids. His friends knew it. Probably some of them participated. Nowhere in that story or any legit pedophile story ever is there any mention of "chicken lover" or "cheese pizza" or that silly triangle. Those are inventions of the post-DNC hack. You think I'm making that up? Ok, find a reference to these things before 2016.

               No. It's not even slightly hinted at by anything I've read or seen or learned. A pizza parlor owner said "chicken lover"? Wow. BFD. Funny how that's almost a Pizza Hut "meat lovers" name, huh? Not for you and the rest of you fucking fools. To you goddamned idiots, that's what counts as evidence.

                Are you fucking kidding me? You're glowing. If you don't know that chicken lover is a proven code word then you should just shut the fuck up. That's week one pizzagate knowledge. That information was found out while this investigation was still on reddit, for fuck's sake.
               </p>
               <p>
                Normies don't know about it now and the vast majority of the people who knew about it before pizzagate happened were pedo faggots. Alefantis had no reason to fear using their coded language when he made that post.
               </p>
               <p>
                We never had access to savile's e-mails or social media so that's a false equivalency. His group likely used slang too, we just never got to see how savile communicated with his fellow pedo faggots.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chicken lover, cheese pizza, and the triangle within a triangle all predate  Pizzagate.  The fbi memo with the pedophile symbols was circulating the internet years before pizzagate was a thing.

                 That's EXACTLY my point: no one in the world ever associated pizza with pedophilia

                 </em>
                 the hacked emails. Did you read those emails? And you still bought this bullshit? A guy who owns a restaurant talked about being a "chicken lover"? Wow! Case cracker! Lookit you, you keyboard detective.

                <p>
                 Back in reality: if there's such an obvious child rape ring going on, why can't anyone get arrested and charged with these crimes? I have a guess: it's made up. Seriously, why won't federal prosecutors charge anyone for child rape or kidnapping or something related?

                 You still don't understand how propaganda works--or you're playing pretend. No one ever associated pizza with pedophilia before the hacked emails. Any evidence you think you uncovered was invented after 2015. You act like there are huge groups of pedophiles (Democrat, of course), who have to check your voter ID before you can fuck their slave kids. Pull your head out of your rectum for a few minutes and think about that conversation at the door:
                </p>
                <p>
                 PEDO 1: Hey, I'm here to fuck some kids.
                </p>
                <p>
                 DOORMAN: How did you vote?
                </p>
                <p>
                 PEDO 1: MAGA Proud! WWG1WGA
                </p>
                <p>
                 DOORMAN: Sorry, Democrats only. Get your own kids to fuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It strains credulity to believe this is anything other than you falling for someone else's agenda. Don't misunderstand me: there certainly are power groups of people who fuck kids. Hell, there are more sex slaves (and human slaves in general) now than in any other time in history. But to believe HRC runs it or Podesta is pimping out his coworker's kids.... smh. Will you please grow the fuck up and have an adult conversation?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Try this: where did you find "chicken lover" referring to a pedophile? Is it from before 2015?

            I usually ask rhetorical questions like, "Can you tell me what it means to play dominoes on pasta rather than pizza?" or, "Precisely what kind of entertainment could 3 prepubescent children provide for a man in his late 60s in a heated pool?" or, "What manner of person is it who would refer to a toddler as a 'hotard'?"

             For me, the most well-rounded, unbiased and concise summary of the whole scandal is: "Pizzagate: A Primer" -
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaJyNVtVzS4">

            <p>
             HOWEVER --
            </p>
            <p>
             This video, originally made by Marty Leeds, has since been banned, and the original channel now removed (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMp5G19yfq8FpM2RTMQTAgw">
              https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMp5G19yfq8FpM2RTMQTAgw
             </a>
             ) after the video itself gained enough attention to reach over 900,000 views, as I remember. It was one of martyleeds33's most popular submissions; he is a very intelligent and rationale YouTuber who had honest inquiries into conspiracy-related subjects and characters, along with specialising in mathematical lectures and mapping of biblical chapters:
             <a href="https://martyleeds33.com/">
              https://martyleeds33.com/
             </a>
             He would use this style in other topics, such as "The De-Occulting of John Podesta". He now uses his second/backup YouTube channel, and I included two links for his vid in case one copy gets censored.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was one of my first major introductions to the story, events and chronology of the Pizzagate conspiracy. I have never forgotten it, and I was comfortable enough with Marty's impartiality, how he handled the material, and how he delved into the original sources, to show the video publicly to my friends and family. All of whom have since become avidly interested in the phenomenon of elite conspiracy and corruption and often still follow and question me about it. They are very educated and open-minded to begin with, enough to have heard about the scandal before, and enough to hear out the whole story from any perspective. We paused numerous times to question things and understand the larger picture in general. At one point, my sister asked intently "Wait, wait is this real? Otto, do you believe this?" - it was great.
            </p>
            <p>
             In retrospect, I realize this video is not short, nor concise in its summary. It's not up-to-date, and even includes things I would omit, but it's still one of my favourites. There have since been many summary videos and compilations of this whole mess. Luckily this subvoat has supplied you with many sources on the sidebar "For Newcomers:"

              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1BiBnEUqKw
             </a>
             - "#PizzaGate: What We Know So Far"
and, as previously mentioned, Ben Swann's original CBS story:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A
             </a>
             - also shared via copy by another account, since the original was likewise taken down. I have not seen these and the their follow-ups very closely. That's about all I can offer for video. When I was showing other people, I'd often include a variety of sources and styles, to illustrate the type of subculture that was involved in cracking it, such as the QAnon community now. For this I played Ryan's research on the Killroom location:

             And the follow-up death threats covered by Titus Frost and the original uploader himself concerning the Pegasus Museum:

             It's uncertain how much of the entire corruption of the elite fall under this scandal of 'Pizzagate' i.e, Pedogate, Pedowood, and beyond: celebrity testimonies, whistleblowers, victim interrogations, criminal history, military, technology, medical, pharmaceutical, economical, politcal, etc. Essentially to "red-pill" is to educate someone on a whole culture, beginning over 100 years ago. There are so many ways and avenues to document this fiasco, it would take a doco-series of the best HBO or AMC licenses to do it justice, and it is only increasing by episode every month. All of these vids touch on a couple other industries and connections, but each do it differently.

             Anyway, when you've exhausted your video resources, check out the voat thread for each exhibit on the Pizzagate Evidence. Apart from that, there's innumerable articles to read, everyone here has shared something significant. As a disclaimer, I would admit to my utter frustration and hatred of the thousands of YouTubers who have exploited the cover-up to gain as much attention and money as they could. It is
             <strong>
              VERY
             </strong>
             hard to find a decent video, or account, or documentation, with any decent editing, civility, citation, enunciation, research, professionalism or the like to which is appropriate for convincing anyone of education. The vast majority of content creators have no sense of shame or judgement applied to either themselves or the subject. It is a complete horseshit of a mess, the internet doing what it does best, chasing a fad hosted by narcissistic old-timers and kids, ego-inflated, hypocritical, ignorant of technology, all too eager to show their balding, bearding, fat immature faces reading off the same copied, unoriginal source and spouting the same pitiful sentiment and platitudes over and over again for whole livestreams, amounting to nothing but the cluttering of as much of the search results as possible, and ever-increasing the divide between the temperamental community. All the while wasting everybody's time, manipulating hopeful minds and discouraging curious newcomers. These include the naysayers employed by journals and news agencies. Also I never liked David Seaman. Sorry, never had a chance to rant. Flame post over; my apologies
            </p>
            <p>
             Also I love FuckuSpez's attitude, eager to see what your resource might be. This guy's got good taste.

             I dont disagree with you entirely on this point,  but isn't "Pizza" one of the main elements to this theory of ours?  "Pizza"  is the repeatably used code work.  Comet "Pizza".

There are so many different aspects to the shadow government that have been sitting right in front of our oblivious fucking faces... All of which are dependent on one another- It's basically the same MO, regardless of their niche "service"
