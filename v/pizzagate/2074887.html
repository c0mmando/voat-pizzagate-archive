            The LEFT is doing nothing of the kind.
            <br/>
            NAMBLA does not represent Liberals.
Nor does anyone who suggests that assaulting a child in any way -- sexually
or otherwise -- is OK -- nor do they represent liberal thinking or values.
This is BS.

             This is "divide and conquer". Obviously the 'left' whoever that really is, (massive generalization), do not at all support the podesta/clinton corruption machine. But from the point of view of disrupting an investigation, if you can divide the 'right' and 'left' you can try to delay the cooperation. Look at the comment with the predictable russia-baiting. There are shills turning cheap tricks all over this website to divide and distract you,

              Don't let anyone tell you that right wing propaganda doesn't work -- it certainly does.
We can look simply at the propaganda of the Civil War fought by non-slave owning white males for the benefit of Elites/wealthy who did own slaves.  Our Founders saved and protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy and guaranteed the Civil War which further benefitted Elites by separating the population into two camps of hatred which continues to echo on today.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a liberal nation which has always been true -- but it's also always been ruled by Elites from Day #1 where our Founders put Elite Patriarchy in control and gave them immense influence over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
             </p>
             <p>
              This nation probably today exceeds more than 84% of us standing against our corrupt government's illegal wars of aggression and we are also anti-MIC.  Internationally the figures are even higher.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no LEFT in government -- they have all been forced out beginning with the McCarthy Era.
             </p>
             <p>
              Both parties are owned by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations and that's been true for decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of the "presidents" who have risen to power since the coup on JFK are complicit in either the deed or the cover up.  And that includes LBJ and Nixon and Ford and of course the Bush Family.
             </p>
             <p>
              Carter is a bit of a question mark, but over time I mistrust him even more.
Maybe they just paid him to act dumb?

              Exactly. There's one entity that has studied human behavior for decades. How to manipulate and control ALL people, world wide for decades through their fears, hate, greed, lust and vanity to use it against them and each other.

             NAMBLA has already been connected to Antifa. Antifa connected to Libs. Again, not saying this is Libs as a whole but Libs don't seem to speak out at all about either.  It's the organizations, like ACLU, that pretend to stand with Libs that are pulling these sick assholes in the mix.

              This is garbage.  NAMBLA speaks for themselves and NOT for anti-fascists.
             </p>
             <p>
              Certainly anyone involved in sexually abusing children or planning to do so is a fascist, an assaulter, a criminal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anti-fascists stand against domination of anyone by anyone else -- most especially children.
And against the violence used by fascists.

              There has been a questionable take-over of the ACLU, as has happened with most organizations,
from the Sierra Club to Earth Day now taken over by large corporations.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is simply "Elite/Royalty minded wealthy" hiding behind a corporate label, but using their wealth to buy, blackmail or otherwise own our elected officials.  And it's been going on since time began.
             </p>
             <p>
              Both parties have been taken over by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations.
They owned the DLC and recruited Bill Clinton and other Southerners (Al Gore) to use corporate money to take over the Dem Party.  Not that the Dem Party wasn't already corrupted by LBJ and his running of prostitution rings to blackmail members of Congress.
Murder was also key to LBJ's rise and he had his own private murderer in Malcolm Wallace.
See Madelaine Brown for one source of those murders and his management of the coup on JFK/
YouTube
See:  Bill Sole Estes Testimony before Congress on the murders LBJ was involved with.
Back with LINK shortly, I trust.

              We haven't had liberals in office since the McCarthy Era.

              Right wing only rises on violence and corruption.

              This is a liberal nation and the people speak every day, though they have been ignored by right wing government for decades now.

              Maybe not you, but right wing here continue to keep trying on this one.
Wherever we can see corruption and violence, or assault of children we know that the right wing is involved -- and likely being protected by corrupted government officials.
Think of really how little our history books even mention of CHILD LABOR which was an assault on children by wealthy Elites.  And they'd return to that system on a dime if a few regulations weren't still standing in their way.

               I was speaking more of a global scale not just US. The article I attached above  re: P.I.E. shows exactly what I'm talking about as to which organizations these Pedos hide behind, and it's usually Lib organizations that feel everyone needs a right to something. The Global .01% Elite manufacture hate groups and use them world wide &amp; spread it like cancer. Notice in these pics how much "Antifa" gets around

                 Pope 'led cover-up of child abuse by priests'
                </strong>
                by EWAN FLETCHER
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The Pope played a leading role in a systematic cover-up of child sex abuse by Roman Catholic priests, according to a shocking documentary to be screened by the BBC tonight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In 2001, while he was a cardinal, he issued a secret Vatican edict to Catholic bishops all over the world, instructing them to put the Church's interests ahead of child safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The document recommended that rather than reporting sexual abuse to the relevant legal authorities, bishops should encourage the victim, witnesses and perpetrator not to talk about it. And, to keep victims quiet, it threatened that if they repeat the allegations they would be excommunicated.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Panorama special, Sex Crimes And The Vatican, investigates the details of this little-known document for the first time. The programme also accuses the Catholic Church of knowingly harbouring paedophile clergymen. It reveals that priests accused of child abuse are generally not struck off or arrested but simply moved to another parish, often to reoffend. It gives examples of hush funds being used to silence the victims.&gt;

                Neither the RCC nor its officials/Pope nor priests are liberals -- they are male-supremacists and fascists.

                 FFS. How can so many people be so damn blind. For the 100th time, I am NOT saying ALL pedos are Libs. The AGENDAS are pushed through LIB causes by manufactured FAKE Lib organizations for a bigger purpose.  It's a small push for "equal rights" of bullshit to then push bigger, more sinister agendas (age of consent, screwing kids, Pedo is a mental disorder....).

                <p>
                 How many conservative groups are pushing this? None bcuz it wouldn't fly so they tag into Lib orgs. But yes Reps, Dems, -ALL involved. SJWS are just easier to manipulate.

criminal activities onto the left, and it remains a very serious problem for world leaders -- 
like Russia's leaders who always had to look at events like the JFK assassination and wonder 
if they would be blamed for it -- and same for Castro.

                  Actually, JFK, Khruschev and Castro were cooperating in moves towards peace.

                  And same with 9/11 as Russia was naturally concerned that there would be an attempt to blame them for it.

                     Understanding the purpose of psychological warfare, easy targets, corruption of the educational institution, degrading of moral values, creating a me, myself and I society...it's easy to see what is going on. Pitting people against the other for the rights of their own personal interests versus seeing the world as a whole (we are ONE) allows the top .01% to not only control the people, but push their own agendas- fear, hate, lust, greed, immorality, satanic rituals...

                     They are tied to our top elite schools, use humans as lab rats without consent just to beak them to study what they can do to the masses. One perfect example, Ted Kaczynski. But because of the courtesy of Harvard enrolling him, unwittingly at the young age of 16, then 17, in a horrible experiment, they completely screwed him up. And he was a genius.

                     And people call him nuts, but he knew things about the system that f'ed him up. His manefesto is telling and chilling.  Remember, he wrote this in the 1990s and today, he hit it right on to what is happening.

                      You understand that motivation and psychology and behavior has long been with us in all
of human history --

                     <p>
                      These are the men who want your land and will take it ...
and if you protest they will rape your daughter -- and if you still 
protest they will kill your son.

                      Whatever positive actions have been carried out by humankind -- whether public

                      Do you actually remember the Inquisition, or the religious bloodbath across European land..
or what the "invaders" did here to native people -- 112 million of them.  Or the long history of 
Africans enslaved here and another 100 years of Segregation in the South.
And that was quite some long time before ole Sigmund Freud made the outrageous suggestion in
the Oedipus Complex that it was infants, toddlers and young children who were the sexual aggressors 
against adult males in their families.
                      <br/>
                      Of course, Freud knew the truth of it when he betrayed his young patients/clients who had confided
in him their sexual abuse by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
It was Betty Friedan who untied women from Freud and dumped him in the garbage can.
And he should stay there if we have any intelligence at all on this planet.

                      And, they are not only tied to our schools and systems, they are in high office everywhere with the CIA
providing the tools.  These are the people who actually dropped Atomic weapons on citizens in Japan - 
civilians, women and children.  Who have destroyed Nature here and brought us Global Warming.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There are references to CIA-UK and CIA-Australia ....

                     <p>
                      Yes, it is obvious what Our Founders put in play -- and it was treason -- and there is only
one way to respond to it and that is by non-violent revolution. 
We all have to stop cooperating with the system of Elites and Capitalism and there are 
many ways to do that.

                      And most Americans understand it  . . . This is a liberal nation which stands against these illegal
wars of aggression, the MIC and the NSA and all secrecy in government.  Internationally, the 
numbers are even higher.  THEY all understand it.  The Q is what to do about it.

                       I agree with you except.....that's part of the problem. We talk about black slaves, never about all the past white slaves or the fact free blacks owned black slaves. (So one "group" can feel the anger and be used later). Hell blacks are slaves to black still in Africa, but MSM will never talk about that. We never talk about other genocides, far worse than the Halocaust or how many, powerful  "Jews" helped Nazis kill Jews. (The rise of anti-semitism. again, to protect a certain class for them to hide behind) History is distorted for agendas.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Native American Indians...the real victims for sure. As far as a Liberal Nation, I guess my feeling of the fabricated word of Liberal has been twisted and distorted so much that I hope we all rise as  something else, like, Freedom Fighters. A name not created for us, but by us. We're all enslaved to the system and always have been. But I do believe we are in agreement, just word things differently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And yes, Kaczynski was broke down, but I truly believe bcuz he was something like 168 I.Q., he was able to keep some wits about him when he wrote that manefesto and his bombs were deliberate to certain targeted individuals. Was it right, hell no, but I understood why.

                        Of course there is nothing that existed on this land that in any way compares with the level of violence, brutality, cruelty which existed in the Genocide against Native people here, or concerning Africans enslaved here for hundreds of years, including another 100 years of Segregation after the Emancipation taking us into the late 1960's.  And Elites still attempt in every way possible to recreate those times here.  And it was Vatican Papal Edicts which authorized the "enslavement or killing" of native people and Africans here.  In fact, the Vatican's concept of native people was that they were "pagans" and any non-Christians could be treated as less than human -- they could be fed to dogs.

                        You also seem to be confusing bondage with slavery ... some it more like being a valet, actually.

                        Clearly you are the victim of misdirection by the right wing and I'd recommend that you do your own research rather than trust those who have already deceived you.

                        True -- the right wing has lied about liberalism and always will.
Follow the violence and you will recognize the right wing and the deceivers and destroyers.

                        But this is a liberal nation and if you at all followed the Bernie Sanders campaign you see the overwhelming response of the nation to his recitation of liberal ideals and values.
                        <br/>
                        Certainly, had the DNC not stolen the nomination from Bernie for Hillary, Bernie would have won the election.
And there is no better word than "liberal" to describe freedom.
I'd avoid anything with "Fighters" in the title as any revolution has to be non-violent and there are many ways to do that.

                        We are all LABOR -- which is a universal force to unite humankind.
We do not need the permission of government nor corporations to unite as LABOR in our own interests.
We are wage slaves subject to the greed of Elites.

Just like these REAL Jews who protested soon after Trump was elected and Bibi came here to visit. Of course, MSM didn't cover this protest. It wasn't part of the agenda to get people to ask why on earth are Jews protesting. Are they also anti-semetic too? LMAO

                         well, I'd say it has a lot to do with these type of "Jews" -Warburgs. They were many others (even besides Soros) they PLANNED to get Jews exterminated or removed from Israel and worked WITH Nazis to accomplish their goal.

                         Again, we can agree to disagree. Im sick and tired of the uneducated hate groups that take what these "leaders &amp; history books" say for face value. Taking a line from Rush "All the world is a stage and we are merely players". Reality of oppression, slavery, genocide is real but very distorted. I simply have chosen to lift the veil. If others choose to live with eyes wide shut, it's their life to do so I guess.

                          Sanders may be someone's puppet, but Bernie has given very effective leadership to liberal causes 
and has united the nation in the understanding of those liberal values and issues such as ...
National Health Care for all, Student loan reform with elimination of internet rate and re-establishing 
usary laws, Social Security, free public education including at levels of colleges and universities.
                          <br/>
                          And I believe he is still capable of heading movements for those causes, including LABOR. 
It may be true that Bernie actually deeply fears Trump's fascism or it may be true that he has
been threatened by higher ups in the DP.  Only time will tell.

Many liberals came out to protest Netanyahu including Jews who are liberals.
It is likely that Netanyahu and the right wing in Israel were responsible for the 
assassination of Rabin.
However, the days when anyone would be challenged for being "anti-Semitic" because
they protest the policies of the right wing leadership of Israel have long been over.
In fact, most Americans understand that Israel is involved in Genocide vs Palestinians.

                           It is very likely that we are players -- only our spirits may be real and our bodies our costumes.
I've often thought that the concept of Reincarnation should be returned.  It had been taught by
all the major religions at one time, but became "inconvenient for Elites/wealthy."

You don't explain your link -- what are you suggesting it is and how does it relate to what you're suggesting?

                         <p>
                          And - The reality is you don't talk about "white slaves" or "free blacks who owned slaves" because nothing like that has happened here.  In fact, it is wholly the opposite.

                          Bernie may very well be a puppet, but he has been a very effective voice for and given leadership to liberal issues ... like National Health Care for All, like eliminating interest on student loans and returning to usary laws, like Social Security,
Public Education for all even at levels of colleges and universities, restoring regulations on Wall Street, controlling the pricing of Big Pharma and investigating their drugs/vaccines, etal.   If Bernie is to be of any future value to liberals and the issues he allegedly supports in heading movements for labor or health, he has to separate himself from the DP which is just as owned by Elites/wealthy/corporations as the GOP is owned by them.  Time will tell.  But as long as Bernie wants to lead liberal movements and unite the nation on these liberals issues, I have no problem with it.
We don't really know what may be holding Bernie to DP... whether it is the fear of Trump-fascism he speaks of, or whether he has been threatened.  Again, time will tell.

                          The numbers of voters no longer voting in America, imo, reflects the increasing understanding that our elections are rigged and long have been.  And, I think what the voters saw last Spring/Summer in the Bernie campaign will result in many more Americans not voting.

                           And I'm not on an anti-Jew kick. That's laughable. I'm anti Zionist

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          but, if you're anti-Zionist and not anti-Jew, then make that clear because there 
certainly is a difference.

                          Netanyahu and the right wing in Israel were responsible for the murder of Rabin
who was moving toward peace.
                          <br/>
                          MANY liberals (including Jews) protested his visit with Trump.
The days of being challenged on the internet as being anti-Semitic for protesting
Israel's genocide vs Palestinians are long over.
                          <br/>
                          Israel was US/CIA first foothold in the Middle East and more often it looks like 
US/CIA policy being carried out via Netanyahu and the right wing there.
And Israel has been well used by the US since its creation, while the liberal and
peace-loving Israelis have been buried.
AND, you seem to be confirming what I am saying to you above ... here ...

                          My feeling has always been that only the spirit is real and our bodies the costumes we wear ..
and there may be many lives which is why I often think we suffer for the concept of Reincarnation
having been overturned.  It was once taught by all the major religions, but that was ended as ...
"it became inconvenient for Elites/wealthy."

            This has happened before and never ended. They hide through "Love who you love" bullshit, trying to normalize screwing kids, dropping the age of consent and all the while, have dark websites with CP. if LBGTQZ(y h,l,j,k..whatever else letters) want any kind of credibility of being peaceful and truly for the good of people, they need to call out these PEDOS as much as we do.

             ONCE AGAIN, i am going to bat for my friends &amp; family. i am left (NOT conservative) but not Liberal. i have NEVER, EVER condoned or tried to normalize pedophilia. i have many friends in the gay community and NONE of them would ever condone this type of criminal behavior. they are too busy a. raising 10's of thousands of dollars for local charities, b. volunteering for local medical clinics - UNPAID, c. raising money for local fire departments, schools and businesses, d. having fun and showing up for friends &amp; family, e. rescuing abandoned &amp; abused animals and finding homes for them, and if no home can be found - they adopt them, f. running successful small businesses, g. maintaining a tight knit, open minded, kind, caring, funny and loving community that accepts people of all colors &amp; stripes, regardless of their orientation, sexual identity or race, h. being continually active in the community at large through plays, parades, fund raisers and parties, i. being true friends who have your back and always greet you with a big hug and kiss.
            </p>
            <p>
             THESE ARE NOT PEDOPHILES. THIS IS FALLACY!
            </p>
            <p>
             so PLEASE stop spreading lies and hate based on the actions of a few individuals who aren't any of the people that i know. i have a LONG LIST of REPUBLICAN PEDOPHILES &amp; i can post that if you'd like to take a looky, but it's quite long so i will bid you farewell here.

              Not sure how, ONCE AGAIN, you do NOT get what is happening. The Pedos HIDE BEHIND the LBGTQ community. I am not spreading hate nor lies it is the truth that EVERYONE needs to wake up to. The Lib/Dems/SJWs is the perfect set up for them to fall behind.
             </p>
             <p>
              Right now in he US, they are pushing laws to drop the age of consent, not though Reps but behind Libs. I think everyone researching PG knows the actual pedos are not of one religion, race or political background. Nor did I say (and have said BEFORE) this is not a "gay" issue. It's is a PEDO issue.

               well fine then, but because i know and have known many many on the "left" side of things, i feel compelled to defend them. i am, however, aware of the corruption of both parties, the left in particular. it's just hard when you hang out with these people and KNOW that none of them get up to these cretinous behaviors. it really is an issue that goes beyond both parties. that's why i don't just turn away from peeps of conservative or libertarian persuasions, because i refuse to take the deep state bait!
