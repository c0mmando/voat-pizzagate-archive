            Note to OP, I'm half Irish and know a bit of Irish-American history including what was at the time basically a low intensity genocide that went on against the Irish in the 19th Century:
            <a href="http://www.irishcentral.com/news/8000-irish-died-while-building-the-new-basin-canal-in-new-orleans-231020191-237786681">
             http://www.irishcentral.com/news/8000-irish-died-while-building-the-new-basin-canal-in-new-orleans-231020191-237786681
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just a note of caution because the Left loves to turn any argument that the Irish were in many cases treated worse than slaves into proof of white supremacy. It's not at all but just be aware of what could be coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Irish are not only NOT white supremacists they probably made the difference in securing a Northern victory when the Union Army's chips were down. Some Irish immigrants landing in New York City were walked right from the ships they arrived in onto troop transports headed to basic training in DC, all made possible by their newly minted citizenship papers.

            And to any Deep State lurkers if you cowards don't surrender soon it'll be the legions of pissed off Irishmen recently shat out the bottom of the Middle Class who will probably be the first to form militias if it ever comes to it. The rest will following in short order. The Irish can at times be inflicted with profound anger the likes of which I don't think you can imagine. Just a little word of advice. If you're doubting whether or not a few militias might break into the Beltway from all sides and kill any Deep Stater twice.......well you can figure out the rest.

            Only Jews could afford to underwrite the incredibly-expensive voyages of the slave ships.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most slaves in the antebellum (pre-Civil War) Southern United States were owned by Jews.  (Most plantations were owned by Jews and crypto Jews.)  The average white person could not afford to own slaves; they were a very expensive asset.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same held true in other countries as well.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "According to an interview given by
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Orthodox Rabbi Lody van de Kamp to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency newspaper
             </strong>
            </strong>
            on December 26, 2013: “
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Money was earned by Jewish communities in South America, partly through slavery, and went to Holland, where Jewish bankers handled it.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ...In one area of what used to be Dutch Guyana,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              40 Jewish-owned plantations were home to a total population of at least 5,000 slaves
             </strong>
             ,
            </strong>
            ” he says. “
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Known as the Jodensavanne, or Jewish Savannah, the area had a Jewish community of several hundred before its destruction in a slave uprising in 1832. Nearly all of them immigrated to Holland, bringing their accumulated wealth with them
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              They came with ships carrying African blacks to be sold as slaves. The traffic in slaves was a royal monopoly, and the Jews were often appointed as agents for the Crown in their sale. They were the largest ship chandlers in the entire Caribbean region, where the shipping business was mainly a Jewish enterprise. The ships were not only owned by Jews, but were manned by Jewish crews and sailed under the command of Jewish captains.

             That's bull shit. Only? Young antisemitic grasshopper, the Slave Trade was invented by the British who wanted to make money on their ships return voyage to America in the Cotton-Rum trade. It turns out Cotton-Slaves-Rum is about a third again more profitable.
:-)
            </p>
            <p>
             Were there "Jews!(tm)" involved in that trade? Yes
            </p>
            <p>
             Were there a fuckton more filthy rich British Aristocrats involved in that trade? ..............Yes
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides you being demoted to "horsefucker" again I've got a little advice for you. Whenever someone uses words like "only" that's a sign they're being dishonest.

                  At this juncture, the point is obvious:  You have NO rebuttal.  The history of your Jewish ancestors is RIFE with slavery, torture, murder, pedophilia, homosexuality, blood-draining, bestiality, cannibalism, and EVERY kind of indecent act under the sun.  All SANCTIONED by the "religion" of Judaism.

                  Still covered by your Kol Nidre?  Yeah, we know about THAT too.  That's why Jews are such LIARS.  All SANCTIONED by your evil "religion."

                   Oh my God, I am one of the whitest most Northern European-Americans you could ever set your eyes on. The Jews never made it up to Norway, Scotland and Ireland. It was too cold, too dank, and too boring for any

                    Semitic peoples, Jewish or Muslim.

                   Plus there's way too much dairy in the cuisine of Northern Europe. A Semitic people would be constantly double over in pain from Lactose Intolerance to survive long up there.
