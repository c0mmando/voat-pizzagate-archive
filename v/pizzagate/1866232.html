<p><strong>Walter Haskell Pincus</strong></p>
<p>Walter and Ann live right next door to Tamera and David.  Walter worked as a long-time  national security journalist for The Washington Post until the end of 2015. He graduated from Yale. 
According to Wikipedia, Pincus spied on American students abroad for the Central Intelligence Agency after his discharge from the Army.</p>

<p>Pincus was accused of posting “fake news” in 2013.  <a href="https://archive.is/MS0SQ">https://archive.is/MS0SQ</a>
He has reported on a lot of political scandals as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pincus has close personal links to the Clintons. His wife, Ann, is a native of Little Rock and, for a time, his son, Ward, was a reporter for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. He claims an “association with Arkansans over the past 30 years,” and says that through these connections, he and his wife befriended the late Vincent Foster. They were among the “family friends” who gathered at Foster’s home on July 20, 1993 after he was found shot to death in Ft. Marcy Park. Pincus was the first to suggest that Foster had cracked under the pressure of his job as Deputy White House Counsel. None of his co-workers had seen any sign of depression, and President Clinton had said, “we will never know” why he killed himself. Six days after his death, a forged note suggesting he was depressed was allegedly found in his brief case. It had been searched previously.</p>

<p>Walter also participated in a documentary in 2011 with Bill Clinton (Fulbright).</p>
<p>He has married twice, but no relation to Mark Pincus has been found.  
</p>
<p><strong>Ann Witsell Terry Pincus</strong> </p>
<p>Ann Pincus is a native of Little Rock, Arkansas. She married Walter in 1965 (second marriage).   According to this article, <a href="https://archive.is/VLF1I">https://archive.is/VLF1I</a>, Ann Pincus was the person who contacted Vince Foster’s law firm partner (George/Joan Campbell) and gave them the news about Foster’s death.
Her dinner party must have been with some very important people. </p>
<p>Ann is a lifelong friend of Joan Campbell, the wife of George E Campbell. George is a partner in the Rose Law Firm.  Vince Foster was also a partner at Rose Law Firm.</p>
<p>Rose Law Firm’s first female partner was Hillary Rodham Clinton. Vince Foster helped get her hired. Rose Law Firm is the 3rd oldest law firm in the US, and the oldest company of any kind in Arkansas.  
</p>
<p>Digest that a minute.  These folks have been around since the inception of the State of Arkansas! And practically since the inception of “law firms” being in business.

<p><strong>Cornelia Battle Terry Pincus</strong> married John Ross Kessinger III in 2008. He is a high school teacher and track coach at Park School of Baltimore.  She used to be a director of Hampstead Hill Charter School in Baltimore. </p>

<p>GAYER WASHINGTON by Carol Joynt</p>
<p>Washington is the nation’s capital but it may be America’s gay capital, too. When I make this reference I’m not saying Washington is the Provincetown of world governments. Actually, it’s more like the Disney Corporation, because there are lots of gays, much diversity, and to be gay here is not to be an outsider, but an insider with rights and power. Sure, there are rent boys walking the streets and cruising the clubs, but it’s the other components of gay world that make Washington equal parts relevant and notorious. And last week, at the high and low ends, Washington became gayer. </p>

<p>May 1999 White House Dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was one of the largest official dinners of the Clinton administration, and the guest list and receiving line seemed endless. There were a few famous faces--actor Sidney Poitier, who is the ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas, philanthropist David Rockefeller, accompanied by his granddaughter Miranda Kaiser, Democratic fund-raiser Patricia Duff and beau Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.)--but most of the seats were taken by politicians and business types such as former vice president and ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, Clinton mentor/defender Dale Bumpers and Toys R Us head Robert Nakasone.</p>

So powerful that Hillary Clinton attended their wedding in Sept 2001</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the ceremony at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, in a display of proud defiance, guest Hillary Clinton spontaneously decided to lead all the wedding guests on a walk down 5th Avenue to the reception. While Clinton’s actions did not please her frantic security detail, it made a powerful statement to all the guests and to New York City.</p>

<p><strong>Ward Pincus</strong>
Ward is the child from Walter’s second marriage to Ann. Ward actually did a news piece in Little Rock Arkansas on Jerry Parks’s death. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Secret Life of Bill Clinton 1997 Ambrose Evans-Pritchard &quot;……..It was another three months before news of the murder of Jerry Luther Parks reached me in Washington. The U.S. national media were largely unaware of the story, which surprised me because Parks had been in charge of security at the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters in Little Rock. (4) …….. On my next trip to the state I decided to drop by at the archives of The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette to see if they had covered the death. There were two routine homicide stories by reporter Ward Pincus, mostly focusing on disputes that Parks had had with a former partner. ……… I contacted the writer..............son of Walter Pincus, the intelligence correspondent for the Washington Post and a friend of Vincent Foster. …….. What his son told me was astounding. When he spoke to Jane Parks the day after the death, she said that her husband had been involved with Vince Foster and she seemed to think there was a political dimension to the murder. She was distraught, almost hysterical. Ward Pincus did not know what to make of it, so he consulted his editors at The Democrat-Gazette. Should he go out to visit the widow and try to find out what on earth she was talking about? No, they said, don\'t\' bother. Soon afterward, Jane Parks withdrew into her shell and refused to give any interviews to the press. ……</p>

Actually, it’s more like the Disney Corporation, because there are lots of gays, much diversity, and to be gay here is not to be an outsider, but an insider with rights and power. Sure, there are rent boys walking the streets and cruising the clubs, but it’s the other components of gay world that make Washington equal parts relevant and notorious. And last week, at the high and low ends, Washington became gayer.

           May 1999 White House Dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            This was one of the largest official dinners of the Clinton administration, and the guest list and receiving line seemed endless. There were a few famous faces--actor Sidney Poitier, who is the ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas, philanthropist David Rockefeller, accompanied by his granddaughter Miranda Kaiser, Democratic fund-raiser Patricia Duff and beau Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.)--but most of the seats were taken by politicians and business types such as former vice president and ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, Clinton mentor/defender Dale Bumpers and Toys R Us head Robert Nakasone.

So powerful that Hillary Clinton attended their wedding in Sept 2001
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            After the ceremony at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, in a display of proud defiance, guest Hillary Clinton spontaneously decided to lead all the wedding guests on a walk down 5th Avenue to the reception. While Clinton’s actions did not please her frantic security detail, it made a powerful statement to all the guests and to New York City.

           <p>
            The Secret Life of Bill Clinton 1997 Ambrose Evans-Pritchard "……..It was another three months before news of the murder of Jerry Luther Parks reached me in Washington. The U.S. national media were largely unaware of the story, which surprised me because Parks had been in charge of security at the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters in Little Rock. (4) …….. On my next trip to the state I decided to drop by at the archives of The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette to see if they had covered the death. There were two routine homicide stories by reporter Ward Pincus, mostly focusing on disputes that Parks had had with a former partner. ……… I contacted the writer..............son of Walter Pincus, the intelligence correspondent for the Washington Post and a friend of Vincent Foster. …….. What his son told me was astounding. When he spoke to Jane Parks the day after the death, she said that her husband had been involved with Vince Foster and she seemed to think there was a political dimension to the murder. She was distraught, almost hysterical. Ward Pincus did not know what to make of it, so he consulted his editors at The Democrat-Gazette. Should he go out to visit the widow and try to find out what on earth she was talking about? No, they said, don't' bother. Soon afterward, Jane Parks withdrew into her shell and refused to give any interviews to the press. ……

            Four Wikileaks lawyers write that instead of providing an objective portrayal of her subject matter, Poitras has re-framed her story to turn her Wikileaks documentary Risk into a film by Laura Poitras about Laura Poitras, a rather late coming-of-age story about the filmmaker discovering that there is sexism in her social and professional circles.
