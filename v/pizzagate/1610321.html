            something similar happened to me about a month ago. My first pizzagate post was a link on a youtube video (pizzagate the documentary) with my comment, I received two or three likes from my friends and a couple of days later I received a message from FB that it seemed that was not my post and someone else posted it for me. I replied that no, it's not spam, I posted it, and then they answered back that for my safety they will remove the post. And they did!

             actually this is what made me convinced that all this horrible stuff IS truly REAL. I'm not American, I write from an Eastern European country, I don't have that many FB friends or influence - why are they worried for my "safety"????

            Same here.  I shared Ben Swann's pizzagate video which was almost viewed 1,000,000 times and that entire post and the comments under it all disappears with no trace from my timeline.  Strange indeed.  Glad someone else mentioned it.

            Facebook is really starting to creep me out. I had started a new account, hoping to keep my real identity less traceable. I was using a VPN and Tor browser, and all was fine for about a week or two, but then they locked me out. They required me to send them two forms of PHOTO ID (photos of the ID or scans). I tried reasoning with them, but they claimed my account was sending out spam or clickbait (which it fucking wasn't). I've tried a few more times to set up new accounts, but I get blocked every damn time. It seems that if you're not traceable (either via your IP or a phone number on your account) then you can't use their service. Fucking bullshit. They allow fucking pedophiles to use their service, but not people who are doing nothing wrong but just want privacy.

            Fuck FB.  Deleted my acct after i caught them deleting my posts.  They can earn ad revenue off a sheep.  They are also no doubt using their platform to categorize people for fema camps.  Not for me!!

            To get around the Facebook censors you have to take a print screen of the info you want to share, post that only and hope people will be curious enough to Google for more info.
           </p>

            Otherwise they will delete you and/or just not show your post to anyone.
