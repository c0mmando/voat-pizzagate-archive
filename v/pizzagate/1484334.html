<p>Secondly, I have seen zero evidence of a Saudi connection to Besta Pizza, other than someone with an Arab name (Abdel Rahman Hammad) being listed as &quot;governor&quot; in business filing for the location. Remember that LegionWill was pushing this <strong>without providing SOURCES</strong>, and he was OUTED AS A SHILL and deleted his account.   
</p>
<p><strong>Also, the video posted on youtube by &quot;Random Rants of Ryan&quot; is disinformation</strong>.  If you put the video quality to where you can actually read what\'s on the screen, it is showing businesses owned by <strong>3 different people, none of which are Abdel Rahman Hammad</strong>.  They are 3 different people named &quot;Hammad Abdelrahman.&quot;  This is like confusing people named Michael Johnson for someone name John Michaelson.</p>
<p>NOTE:  I do believe there is a Saudi connection, but these disinformants are trying to send us on a wild goose chase and get us to promote fake evidence (and possibly slander an innocent man) so we discredit ourselves!  <strong>Be careful!

            Who are the black construction guys? What company? Right next store? Are they alive and safe? They sure would know about the construction in the pics that no one has found a permit, too?

            Who is the county politician that got into with Comet, some years back? I saw that Comet supporters, posted online, during that that will watch that politician like a hawk to see if he does any zoning violations and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clearly, comet and supporters know zoning laws, but felt they had impunity to permits.

              Saudis, I've noticed ALOT are friends with ones, going to events. Some drs, attorneys. Yet, from a ultra rich view; many do not have to work, even rich Corp types are less rich than them, and they also can have unrelated to the ring corporations; and just expected their ordered sex slave products as needed or payment/ donation exchanges. Many are rich, but many Saudis are ultra rich and expect ones to do work, dirty or not dirty and live in gluttony, as peruse constant pleasure.

            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring.   Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle)     YWCA  Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ )
            <br/>
            This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984
This is the sign I seen from the street

            Just joined to seek help, been investigating pizzagate a while Since 4chan and the old subreddit , I believe my PC has been hacked remotely and weird things have been happening. Now, last week I've been raided with a search warrant and they claim someone used my IP address back in summer to upload CP!! This is alarming and I have no idea what that means . But they return all my stuff expect my PC and external
Drive used for old torrents when I got music or movies . I'm completly innocent and need my story heard !

            Great work everyone. Keep fighting on all fronts. You are making a difference, so don't get discouraged. Some of us are researching, some raising public awareness, and some are keeping the morale high. I am doing what I can locally to check into suspicious activity at clubs and Ports. Everything matters.

            First, you should be showing the Linkd In page of the Andrew Kline with the DoJ.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you should also include all of the other business that Andrew Jon Kline is tied to, because it seems super relevant to this discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            This sticky is really misleading as to what the important connections are.

            Now, ask yourself which Andrew Kline this is:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2012/10/guts-and-the-dc-bar-the-case-of-andrew-j-klein.html">
             http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/2012/10/guts-and-the-dc-bar-the-case-of-andrew-j-klein.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly, this one is a dishonest prosecutor.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are most likely dealing with two not so honest Andrew J Kline's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, it is confusing the way this little conflict over the Kline's is being presented.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bottom line is that both should be looked into.

            Some questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             First of all, we already know that the Andrew Kline listed as "agent" on Besta Pizza is just an attorney who filed the paperwork, and we know that the Andrew Kline in the DOJ is a different Andrew Kline.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            How do we know that? What is the evidence Veritas law firm filed the paperwork?
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             it is showing businesses owned by 3 different people, none of which are Abdel Rahman Hammad. They are 3 different people named "Hammad Abdelrahman." This is like confusing people named Michael Johnson for someone name John Michaelson.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Not quite. It's been my experience that in other cultures that use more names than just First/Last, there's variance in which name is listed in what order. Moreover different systems may store names differently, some putting the last name first etc. I might show up as John Doe in one system and Doe, John in another.

             In fact after reading this mod's post history, I just see a lot of concern trolling. His first post was actually a lengthy shaming of the pizzagate community which is suspicious. Not quite willing to completely dismiss the DOJ Andrew Kline still being our Besta Pizza guy until actually proven otherwise.

              the day of the ban.  I reposted it because the author made very good points.  My point wasn't to "shame" anyone, but to warn people about disinformation being used as a weapon against us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look up "black propaganda." What you are seeing in my post history is me legitimately watching for possible disinformation and demanding sources and evidence for claims.  It's unfortunate that there are so few people on here exercising skepticism.  Disinformation is the NUMBER ONE tool shills will use to disrupt our efforts.

            Nowhere does it say that the first Kline works for the Department of Justice in that link.

            I have no beef with you except your comment about vigilante justice, which cannot be tolerated on this forum or left to stand unanswered, for the good the of real people spending their time investigating here.   Oh and your bad manners and foul language, but that can be overlooked.

            I've posted about twice already that this Abdel guy has like 7 aliases. I did a paid public search on him last week &amp; all of his various name spellings belong to the same guy.

            He's the same guy that has a company under his name called Universal Trade Inc. and the website for that is password protected.

            I once laughed out loud the 99th time Rand repeated her tired line "Who is John Galt" then burnt the book to keep the tedium from ruining someone else's reading time.  Usually wouldn't never burn a book but that was a happy exception.

            The record will show that vigilante justice is not supported by this forum or on voat, so you are on your own with your "citizen's arrest"  and your posse of one person.   BTW Ayn Rand couldn't write her way out of a wet paper bag and her philosophy is a sophomoric mind control trick which obviously must have worked on you.

            I ask respectfully that you immediately edit or delete this reply.  No suggestion of vigilante justice is tolerable on this forum, not even loose talk or analogies.  If something goes down at the Pajama Factory you don't want your JohnGalt322 handle associated with a call for vigilantism.  Thank you in advance.

             It's all been scrubbed see that's the pattern here, is the MODS ask that we prove something, then we provide the links and 24 hours later the site is scrubbed and the google is scrubbed.
            </p>
            <p>
             We of course did archive all, but the fact is providing the links to the mods on

            Been lurking in the shadows for a week now. Made an account and subscribed just to agree and say kudos to you all. However this ends up, it's been impressive to watch the collective effort of a select and committed group of strangers to stay one step ahead, question, call out, and keep people like myself up to speed. Going to be important to continue to consider all sides and possible perspectives. Keep it up.

            My take on that is they all have an interest in road cycling, hence the double entendre as peddles/peddlers and the say peddos to be edgy. Just my take, anyway.

             Well, the block was in fact purchased on the same day, and by the same company. CON NEB LiC, and a property management company based in Northern Virginia. He was claiming that he found evidence that CON NEB was a Saudi company. I haven't found any evidence as to what this company really is.
            </p>
            <p>
             CONNEB I LLC appears to be a company registered in Vienna, VA. The location is a single family home. I'd swing by and check out who it is, but that house was sold in October. The registered agent was a "Kevin McCarthy". This could be the actual agent, or the owner of the LLC acting as an agent. The business entity claims an alternate address at H.A Gill (the aforementioned property company) There are a few notable Kevin McCarthy's in the area. One is a US congressman from California. The other is a man who works investment brokerage for AFL-CIO (interesting). Another is a doctor with his own clinic in Bethesda, MD.
            </p>
            <p>
             It speaks more to the possibility that the block is owned by a single man who lets a property management team handle the day to day operations (for a fee, of course). Of course, there is the possibility that it could be someone managing property for a foreign entity.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as the block being sold for $0, that's how it appears in real estate databases. In the DC government property queries, the sales price appears as "unavailable". I talked to a family member who worked commercial real estate in DC - and she said that reports like that aren't that uncommon. It may be that they simply failed to report to the agencies what the actual sales price was, possibly a transfer of title from an older version of a company to a newer (perhaps a restructure), possibly the addition of the management company on the title, or one of a number of other things. Some possibilities are more suspicious than others.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should also add that selling an entire block is actually very common practice in DC.

             As far as I'm aware, no evidence (let alone proof) was ever provided.  It was promoted by LegionWill, who was outed as a shill and deleted his account.  Note that nobody has replied in this thread to provide evidence.

            Nr 1: Linkedin says Andrew J Kline record is gone
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewkline1">
             https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewkline1
            </a>
            (why?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Nr 2: Linkedin says that Andrew J Kline worked as partner at Kivitz &amp; Liptz from Oktober 1984 – 1992 (8 Jahre)
 but here I see that Kivitz &amp; Liptz started in 1996

           <p>
            So both records have errors, why?
When I'm wrong, please convince me, old images would help...

            Depends if you want to further discredit us and give the government more excuse to censor investigation.  You say they're pedos.  Who are the children victims?  Where are those children?  If you can't answer that, you don't have a case yet.  Keep researching and don't do anything stupid.

            youre absolutely right and by the looks of some of these comments we need somebody coming in and saying this now and then. Them deleting the accounts and business directory listing is not the only evidence i posted though. The videos go into a lot more detail about these new players and the pajama factory

             Just wanted to add:  On the 'My favorite pedo' Instagram post, the very next comment from Jeff Smith also references 'Penn State football' (Jerry Sandusky reference), and next post after that says 'Terror in the District' in French.  Ie - District of Columbia?
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT:  It also mentions PDX, which I believe is Portland Airport.   Portland, OR has been on my radar since the Politics and Prose (right next to Comet and owners are #50 on GQ list) info came out.   I made a post about this a loooonnngg time ago (when story first broke), and I believe there is a connection to Portland  -- and possibly Powells Books -- and this ring too.

            We are not police.  We are not vigilantes.  Capturing them isn't our job.  Besides, we still need better evidence before anybody can be convicted.

            Thanks for the intelligent research, great to see people not just diving on every lead and assuming as true.  The Saudi/Arab angle brings up an interesting point to me.  Do we have many people with an Arab background looking into this?   I only know a minimal amount about the languages over there, but do know the variations in english spelling account for a lot of paperwork misses when it comes to terror related stuff.  Mohammed alone can be spelled like 8 different ways and still be correct can't it?  Just something to be aware of I suppose

            i dont think so. Right now just keep gathering information. If we are right then they wont be able to debunk this. If they dont debunk this it will spread and spread. When this is common knowledge something will be done about it by those who are in a capacity to do something.

            I'm not convinced either way, but I will say that the shape of the nose and earlobes does have me leaning in the direction of them not being the same person. Obviously I don't say that with 100% certainty.

               No I believe 100% in pizza gate. I've seen plenty enough evidence to support it, and I think comet is involved. But I wanted to prove the point that you (((people who use these to throw off the investigation))) are either shills or just SJWs of the right, accusing anyone who brings up even the slightest little thing against you of being from a fucking synagogue and being a pedophile.

              With his pic being "broken" I think its a web browser problem because the pic is broken in chrome but shows up in firefox...

              I looked at the Cache and the if you search for "Department of Justice" on the cached page it shows up on the right column under another person.  So even tho it shows up in google search its not really in the Veritas linkedin Andrew Kline profile.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would say the Veritas Andrew J Kline is 99.9 percent NOT the DOJ Kline...

              Andrew J. Kline of Veritas posts in Foodservice Monthly;

             <p>
              That would be quite the psyop to hide the DOJ's identity.
             </p>
             <p>
              But still it doesnt rule out the posibliltty that the DOJ could still own Besta Pizza...tho highly unlikely;

                Ok, my bad. I was looking at a picture near the name and was wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, I think I figured it out. On your link, if you click "Read More".. it reveals additional infomation. At the top it says
                <em>
                 "Andrew_Veritas_448x473"
                </em>
                (an image description) - so there was a pic there with those dimensions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your pic:
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160225153033/http://theveritaslawfirm.com/our-team/#tab-id-1">
                 https://web.archive.org/web/20160225153033/http://theveritaslawfirm.com/our-team/#tab-id-1
                </a>
                Your pic - Read More:
                <a href="http://imgur.com/a/62vx5">
                 http://imgur.com/a/62vx5
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                Then, if you go to the OP link, and look at the dimensions of the photo. It says "448 x 473."
               </p>
               <p>
                So, maybe the first link didn't pick up the picture for some reason, but the dimensions on both are the same.

               I'd already seen the 2nd image (which didn't answer my question), but the first one, even though it is a little bit blurry I can read he was one of the ones who liked the image.  Thank you for the link.

           <p>
            Both of these Instagram accounts have since been deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The business listing for smith steel has been deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            This all happened within a day of discovery. Meaning Jeff smith is close enough with pajama factory management to immediately get his listing taken down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something is happening at the Pajama Factory.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: photo found where Jeff smith calls James alefantis the boss. Jeff smith works for himself so in exactly what capacity is alefantis the boss?

             Idk now if pajama factory is a lead; and wonder if related to industries that make prison and hospital/ institution garments. There is a power tyranny over ones clothed in demeaning and vulnerable uniform, and easier to keep inmates/ patients monitored and bulk cleaning. Lime or other chemicals to break down bodies, has not been accessed. ALOT of lime was used in the Jersey Island pedo case at the orphan school. Hydrogen peroxide, bleach, other chemicals?  How would an efficient infrastructure be created, outside corps/shells/private business fronts to handle the daily real time needs of child/ all ages, enslavement? Where are the supposed red shoes made? What is a way to demand the dc tunnels are searched, before possible cleanup? Has Podesta and others been in clean up evidence mode? Well, IF, guilty, surely they would.
            </p>
            <p>
             What would their back up plans and locations be? What warehouses or farms or underground bases? Or are kids brought into homes, looking like they are fostered or student exchange, or infants adopted?
            </p>
            <p>
             What people are fostering ALOT of kids for years in DC, VA, etc? What Fosters have had cps cases, yet got away with it, and /or a child died?
            </p>
            <p>
             More you know the various systems, can find how organized. As pedo or cannabis would be an addiction, what new area or way could ones order their child, if not using their past modes; due to this all going public?
            </p>
            <p>
             How many weeks has it been.that cps in DC has violated federal.law and not welfare checked each child and infant reported? Everyday, not investigate in a timely manner is a federal.violation by cps. What and who is causing cps to be so bold and federal violate, adding up daily violations?
            </p>
            <p>
             Who oversights cps and does that connect to Kline, or not?
            </p>
            <p>
             Clearly, when.ones call cos, the refusal to take reports and intimidate are being done, and those are all federal violations, also.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is law not adhered, too?

            Explain their varied bios and provide actual evidence of any claims you want to make. This investigation must be driven by evidence. If there is a theory, let's move for the evidence to support it and not be stuck on wild claims. EDIT: As to the pictures, really: Explain the teeth and other major facial feature differences in the nose and eyes. In the end, it does not matter. The point is that CTR is aggressively promoting the Saudi link, with hateful rhetoric as part of it, for a reason:

            If there was nothing to this, then it would already be Slander City and Defamation Alley with all the allegations being churned out during the past month. I know it's a longshot, but just maybe the Podestas know a lawyer or two who could wipe out the entire alt media that has dived into P-G? Maybe Hillary knows someone, too? Why opt for the censorship attack when you could easily use the bankruptcy attack, and make money at the same time as you silence your shit eating critics? Why aren't there lawsuits exploding all over the place? Bears repeating, it is one of the great questions surrounding this affair. But lining up false information to defame an innocent to bring down P-G credibility is an extremely likely ploy, so thanks for this important warning. I just wish the podestas would sue somebody.

            Your interpretation is benign. I think it goes beyond sending us to pursue dead-end leads or frame the owner...I think it is being done to literally frame our investigation.

              If you think this is something worth digging into go for it, the only 'permission' you need is your own conscience and the support of the community through participation.

             <p>
              Considering the discussion around this, a sticky is probably worth the effort if it helps people maximise the amount of information being shared, feel free to make it a sticky.

              I'll sticky it right now, since I'm not sure if you're online but next time if you think it's the best thing for this board right now, feel free to do so.

               Maybe for a day or two, as a warning to users about disinformation and the need to be skeptical of new claims.  The summary sticky is also pretty important.  I'll be glad to maintain somewhat of an active role, although I do have to balance with other responsibilities.  Soon I'll see if I can find a few more mod candidates to help out with watching for disinfo and posting violations.

                Mods set the framework for this sub, so in my view it is very important to have active moderators that can take this kind of defensive action to preserve legitimacy / credibility. I think this is where the old reddit pizzagate mods messed up. a hands off approach lets an active opponent create tons of accounts that can completely distort the sub. without a moderator exercising judgement, it literally will go to shit. Something that I and I believe others would appreciate is some kind of objective measurement related to each main lead. what are the supporting facts, what speaks against, so that rhetoric without substance cannot gain ground.

                  The attacks to de-rail, dilute and disinform the sub are persistent and getting more voting power as shill accounts begin to mature. dealing effectively with organized shill activity should be the focus of one mod. that is a domain owner you need. we can do without subject matter experts  longer than we can do without an effective counter-measure to the destructive activity going on. one idea is to penalize accounts that generate a lot of new posts but without adding value. of course you need to define transparently what you are doing and why, so everyone can buy into the logic or criticize its weak points. the fact is that shill activity can be profiled, and it should be addressed systematically to defang their growing power over this sub.   You guys are all heroes in my book, but you have a real challenge on your hands, and some kind of immune system needs to develop in this sub before the cancer takes over. only you guys can create this.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  other ideas ive had. create bots that comment on posts that trigger one or more shill behaviour criteria. there are ways to fight this that are transparent and respect the free speech principle.

              You might want to take a deeper look at this issue and check which side is really disinformation here. There has been an orchestrated campaign to shut down all discussion about Andrew J. Kline by making it appear that there is a consensus that Andrew J. Kline (Veritas) is not the same person as Andrew J. Kline (DOJ). I would like to see the idea discussed calmly, but when the opposition's preferred tactic is to shut down discussion on the pretext that everything has been debunked already, that's not possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              You see, I think the Andrew J. Kline from Washington D.C. in the first picture is the same person as Andrew J. Kline from Washington D.C. in the second picture. It's just that he's gotten older and gained weight. His twitter profile picture
              <a href="https://archive.fo/0sPda">
               https://archive.fo/0sPda
              </a>
              is from the interim period and shows a smile identical to the one in the second picture.

               The only tweet I had to remove from locked twitter was using Andrew Kline name.  I think he is linked to this.  Perhaps a USG blackmail operation.

               Negative, teeth are different, hair has a natural difference, etc. You're just wrong on this one. They're clearly different people. They also have clearly different biographies. Here's a challenge, call both of them, or email both of them. Then you'll get laughed at by both of them when you bring it up.

                The hair is exact same, just cut differently. The teeth are uneven, and with a 3D object it's only natural that it shows differently from a different angle, etc.

                 Maybe cousins or something, but they work for different law firms, went to different law schools, and had no idea they were going to be part of a pizzagate online research scandal.

                  But isn't it interesting that they both go by Andrew J. and look similar enough that we're even having this discussion? And the only law firm I see is Veritas.

                  The "other guy" was hired as faculty to the School of Public affairs, but the it doesn't actually say where he went to school. But trying to look even this deep is futile when the entire issue is dismissed out of hand.

                   I'm sure if you could find definitive proof of them being the same people then that would blow our minds and it would be game on. People were asserting it as fact and that, at this stage is not true. That's what this post is all about.

                    The two key words:
                    <strong>
                     In addition.
                    </strong>
                    I failed to notice that bit (a honest mistake), but it looks like the unified Andrew J. Kline has two degrees: A law degree from the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William and Mary and a Masters in Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government. A very accomplished person, clearly.

                     This isn't a unified Andrew.  Professor Kline has a  Masters from JFK School (at Harvard) and a JD from Pepperdine.  He doesn't have a degree from William and Mary.

                      Sorry (genuinely). I think I finally see it now, though I needed to use ctrl-f to find the text. I've been over-wired with the emotional pressure from this Pizzagate thing, having to write quick replies, and sleeping badly. I think it's getting to me, like my attention is pinpointed at one thing and something like browsing through a text properly is hard. Permanently tired too. I think I might delete these several posts, but I think I want you to see this first.
