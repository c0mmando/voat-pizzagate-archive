One of his non-profits spent around $160,000 to raise $12,000 at a Solstice event in Berkeley. Marina Abramovic, the spirit cooker attended. During a spirit cooking video, Alice Waters and Marina Abramovic even kiss on the mouth. Point being, they are close. I outlined that relationship a bit, in this article:</p>

<p>The photographers she works with are well known child pornographers. Even Bing will serve up their potentially illegal images if you search their names, like &quot;David Hamilton girls&quot;.

<p>John Podesta\'s email contained a description of three young girls (6 - 11) being brought to &quot;the farm&quot; for &quot;entertainment,&quot; where the last reply was &quot;I\'ve never had an affair before.&quot; The woman who provided the girls was also in Sid Blumenthal\'s leaked contact list. These are not her children, nor are the ones on her website:</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong (One of Alefantis\' restaraunts), East Hampton Babysitters, and Tamera Luzzatto\'s sites all were created in the same poor style. Kevin Reynolds, the &quot;infant masseuse&quot; pictured with Bill Clinton on his site had pictures of naked children on his site in the places that were not obviously linked to the front page. HTTrack was used to acquire the images. He also posted a picture of himself on Facebook, around the time, of himself masturbating into a lake. He also has a &quot;vacation concierge&quot; side gig, where he takes people on his boat to the Caribbean, referencing some haunts of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>Comet Ping Pong was particularly interesting, in that it had a login page with a bunch of encrypted files:</p>

<p>Alefantis\' Instagram is particularly unsettling. Drugs, money, babies. (The Clintons are also affiliated with John of God was selling babies and the NXIVM cult (on the board of CGI) members who are on trial for trafficking and abusing girls as young as 8.)</p>
<p>Alefantis asks &quot;Why does Daddy like BUTT?&quot; in this post where the hashtag &quot;carisjames&quot; may refer to Epstein\'s CARibbean ISland, Little St JAMES.</p>

<p>We even have a real life example of this happening before: THE LARGEST TRIAL IN US HISTORY WAS THE PIZZA CONNECTION TRIAL; where a series of pizza shops were being used by organized crime to launder money. CHEESE PIZZA has been used as a code for &quot;child pornography&quot; practically since the Internet was invented. CP.</p>

<p>Rachel Chandler was hanging around Clinton, Epstein and other famous people when she was underage. Her photography is worth looking into, considering it focuses on disadvantaged youth.</p>

           Alefantis' Instagram is particularly unsettling. Drugs, money, babies. (The Clintons are also affiliated with John of God was selling babies and the NXIVM cult (on the board of CGI) members who are on trial for trafficking and abusing girls as young as 8.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Alefantis asks "Why does Daddy like BUTT?" in this post where the hashtag "carisjames" may refer to Epstein's CARibbean ISland, Little St JAMES.

           Epstein was obviously allowed to operate as a pedophile by Mueller, in exchange for information, as can be seen in the FBI FOIA Vault.

           We even have a real life example of this happening before: THE LARGEST TRIAL IN US HISTORY WAS THE PIZZA CONNECTION TRIAL; where a series of pizza shops were being used by organized crime to launder money. CHEESE PIZZA has been used as a code for "child pornography" practically since the Internet was invented. CP.

           Rachel Chandler was hanging around Clinton, Epstein and other famous people when she was underage. Her photography is worth looking into, considering it focuses on disadvantaged youth.

             The blackmail happened in two stages and ended as a limited hangout with a settlement. I am definitely going to include that in the rewrite and I'll revisit the issue when I have a block of time to lay it out.

            <p>
             Short and skinny is the original blackmail happened and Brock paid. A second blackmail happened where financial crimes were introduced into the narrative, at which point David Brock had to enlist help.

               The question is what would David Brock pay $850k for without going to the police, the first time. He obviously had no problem going to them about tax evasion, the second time. Murder? Pedophilia? I posit that we already know the answers to some of these important questions. As it stands, even now, nobody cares about their money-laundering. They never have and they certainly didn't care about it 6 years ago.

             Thanks. Been meaning to write one up for a while. I consider Pizzagate to be fully proven, at this stage. The question is whether the world will accept it or not, because the normalcy bias is a lot to overcome. It is not circumstantial that this social group is involved in pedophilia and were able to evade accountability because of corruption within the US; it is a fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, I have a lot more details saved up, but I think it is easy enough to demonstrate in one post that Pizzagate is fact, not fiction. Blackmail. Convicted pedophiles. Suspected pedophiles. All sharing financial interactions, all traveling together, all raising money together, all involved in government or with government officials, all getting help from the mainstream media to avoid accountability. It is as plain as day to anyone who can be calm and avoid getting triggered long enough to read for 5 minutes.

            Laura Silsby was with the Baptist Church. Recently 700 victims have reported being sexually abused by the Southern Baptist Churches. Sexual abuse  in the Protestant Churches is just as prevelant,  it it just hidden. Governor Northam (infanticide doctor) is also a Baptist. In case you don’t see the connection—it is the churches that are into the sacrificing. All of them.

            The Silsby debacle is huge. This is unredemable to this person. Changed her name and works for Amber alert (?).

             I should fix that. Silsby married and now goes by the name Laura Gayler and went to work for Alertsense.

            Obviously, I left a few things out to stay under the 10,000 character limit, like Laura Silsby. A couple of things, some people might feel conclusionary, but I'd be interested to hear about that. I know the hashtag carisjames was a bit debated after an old post I made from a while ago was rbought back into the light. The child's name is Caris, but I don't think that exculdes it from being a reference to Little St James and or the genetic research company.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby was arrested for trafficking children, delivering them to a resort for them to stay in provided to them by the Catholic Church because their school hadn't been funded yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            A block away from this resort with pools and hot tubs, was the DREAM Center, an orphange funded by Clinton donors like Zalekis and the famous Mormon family, the Kimballs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby's first rescue attempt was by another human trafficker who was wanted by Interpol and was eventually arrested. He pretended to be a lawyer to try to get her out of jail.
           </p>
           <p>
            An orphanage he was associated with in Guatemala burned down with all the girls inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Clinton was next up to rescue her, at which point she changed her name and started working with Amber Alert.
           </p>
           <p>
            A similar case was Aya Hegazi, spelled differently in many sources, who was arrested with her husband and his accomplices for chaining children up and toruting them in Egypt. Clinton tried to have her freed many times, but the court testimony was too damning. A man, looking for his son, broke into their building and found the whole scene. He and others testified to what they saw, including cameras set up to video the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump eventually brought her home, but her husband and accomplices remain in jail in Egypt. I assume he got all the dirt from her, because she was in the Oval Office with him.
           </p>

            Either way, I'm interested in comments and fact checking and I keep a trail of my research at

             https://webofslime.com
            </a>
            (it is a very rough draft, right now) and I am interested in articles I may have missed or maybe I didn't think were important, at the time. I can be reached at
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="196d717c6e7c7b767f6a7570747c597e74787075377a7674" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

            . I don't ask for money, I don't use tracking or cookies; this is a hobby and I am a one man show. If I can acquire as many focused articles in this format, I will be able to build something akin to the Panama Papers searchable database that is graphically represented in an interactive way.

            I am attempting to get the site to update virtually in real time, like my twitter feed: twitter.com. I attempt to be first to the news relevant to this community's interests and related subjects because, ultimately, I too, am after the truth. The truth is the cure.

            PS: I know Voat hates imgur, but sli.mg went down and took some valuable info that I can never get back and I have a hard time trusting anything else. Also, it allows people to go to the individual images and comment. Additionally, the interface is such that I can one click save stuff via a plugin or paste to it straight from my clipboard. If anyone knows something similar or better, I'm into it, but I am really after what saves the most time.

             imgur is okay, in my opinion, Web, because derram automatically makes a catbox.moe archive of any imgur link in the body of a submission shortly after it's posted. By using imgur, you then get two copies of the image, not just the one you posted. :-)
