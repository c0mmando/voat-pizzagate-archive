In that screen shot, look to the top left the &quot;S!&quot; symbol. That needs to be clicked and select the option to &quot;block all scripts&quot;.     
</p>
<p>Second: the little green onion, there is an arrow next to it. Click it. You can &quot;request a new identity&quot; or new nodes. The FIRST node stays the same as a safety measure (it\'s harder to track you if it doesn\'t change, it\'s a tor setting). Requesting a new identity will log you out and close all the pages. The new nodes will just reset the nodes. DO NOT do this a lot, as the more you jump the easier it is to track you (don\'t argue me on this, go read the tor information where this has been discussed to death). You can also change your security settings here, I recommend HIGH.     
</p>
<p>Third, the really deep shit will not be linked on the hiddden wiki. The hidden wiki is like babys first day on tor. It has just general shit on there. There is an &quot;uncensored hidden wiki&quot; (and about 5 versions of that too) that has more shit the hidden wiki has edited out. Searching &quot;hard candy&quot; (code for CP) will yield a letter telling pedos to fuck off on hidden wiki. On the uncensored wiki it will (unless it has changed, I don\'t tor a ton anymore due to massive FBI stuff) show links to CP sites and give their status. The hidden wiki has a ton of other stuff to, but I\'m keeping it relevant. But EVEN THE HIDDEN WIKI HAS VERY LITTLE of whats out there.     
</p>
<p>Fourth, the FBI and similar organizations around the world control most of the common known CP sites and chat rooms (aol style chat rooms). They are literally honey pots. You can find a ton of examples in the news. Those sites are well known to contain CP and to be tracked (they control the exit node which means they can see the exit point that the data gets sent back to you, causing you to be tracked, basically). These sites are for the uninformed, the lazy, and the newbie, that will get caught.      
</p>
<p>fifth, if you are new to tor, take a second and slow down. If you are finding surface level CP links etc. It is almost guaranteed that they are already known about, tracked, and/or bullshit. There are special invite pages to illegal stuff that you\'ll never find, there are hidden chat rooms that you will find if you delve deep enough, HOWEVER     
</p>
<p>sixth, YOU RUN THE RISK OF GETTING IN TROUBLE FOR EVEN LOGGING INTO THESE SITES depending on where you live.     
</p>
<p>If you do not understand tor, you need to spend at least a night or two reading up on it and the security measures you need to take to stay as safe as possible. Remember TOR was a DOD project and it\'s not really that safe. It just muddies the legal waters of getting caught, well it USED to, most countries now work together and there isn\'t much of an issue. BE SAFE and remember to use your head. You will see shit there that is &quot;shocking&quot; to you (daisy vid is the most shocking to new users, I will not ever link to it), but on these sites those are things that have been around for 8+ years.     
</p>
<p>EDIT(as I think about stuff): Don\'t use RAR to unpack things IF you\'re dumb enough to DL stuff there. Something like peazip is much better. RAR is compromised when opening things from tor. Don\'t watch videos directly on tor if you don\'t want to be tracked. DL them (again, if you\'re dumb enough) and watch them with your internet disconnected. I\'m not talking about CP videos, I\'m talking about anything that could get you in trouble where you live. Then WIPE the video and the free drive space. Again, not to sound alarmist, this is if you are watching something that can get you in trouble where you live.</p>',

            Great post. Tor is difficult to grasp even for some of the most highly advanced users. Bottom line is this: If you're leaking ANY data whatsoever, it can and most likely will be used to track you. I recommend using a site like ipleak.net to see exactly what's being revealed about you. Learn what webRTC and DNS requests are. Turn off geolocation SYSTEMWIDE! Even if you disable it in your browser, you can still be tracked through your wirless card. I recommend mainlining directly to your router.
            <strong>
             USE A VPN!!!
            </strong>
            Tor alone will not keep you anonymous. There's a lot of back study  involved in this.

            From my experience, not any more than on the regular internet. I can 99.99999% guarantee that if you get hyper linked to some illegal site, no one will track you if you just nope out of the site. They mostly look for users DL things or posting things or making transactions. Not really worth the massive PITA to track a dude who had a bounce rate of 1sec (not even sure they can prosecute for that in most countries, but I'm no lawyer). Once you try it out, you will see it's literally nothing but a slow version of what your doing now (though the temptation to wander is high).

             Tails is better. But again, TOR is NOTHING but a proxy internet (in simple terms). It's not all illegal. it acts just like the internet you use every day (you even can browse regular sites with it). It's a way to get information with some anonymity and/or bypass government restrictions to the internet. There is tons of normal shit on tor (addresses usually look like asfdon234n245nojin089#$nm.tor ). It's not a place where you log in and they send you info. You use it just like the internet your using right now.

              Thanks again.  Since you are the only person I've discussed it with on here, couple things, if you've seen a supposed price guide that's going around twitter, from a pizza place, it's disgusting.  It sure looks like the same info that the supposed person posted on red and everyone figured he was a fraud.  (supposedly 2 guys had gotten into a pizza place and stole the hard drive and price list, etc.   So I don't know if true or not.     but seeing that damn price guide really freaked me out today when I saw it.  If you can't find it, I can look for the tweet.
             </p>

              So as for using Tails, or TOR, do I have to be worried, just lurking here on voat?  I haven't clicked on anything at all, and since I didn't know anything about a totally hidden TOR area, I for sure will be extra careful.  I'm also going to reread anything I can find on TOR.  I have always browsed using duckduckgo, but does that even help?  Thanks again!

               duck duck go just doesn't track you, but the sites you click on still do. Using TOR you don't have to be worried about lurking anywhere except illegal sites. And I may, or may not, have been.... privy to various illegal sites back in the day, I've never been arrested or even questioned. Because I didn't participate or DL things. So generally they are looking for real threats, not random browsers. But again, being on a normal webiste, there would be no reason to scrutinize you, unless you are already under investigation and they are compiling data. Totally hidden tor area is a BIT of a misnomer. Because tor sites are ridiculous like: asdokanfonroamfmna3oifokmfok mnm3mr m3m im.tor it would be very very very hard to find them. Some are protected as invite only also. But again these are rare and you have to be "in" with a community for a while. I could start a "voat invite only" site through .tor and almost no one would find it unless they had a direct link, then they would need access (like a code or user name and pass).

                Okay thank you!   I really appreciate gettng some clarification on it!  I'm always a little nervous to even comment on these boards, so usually just lurk, and stay safe.

                Back on red, I was mostly trying to follow where Assange could be, I wory about him.  Just a minute ago, I posted two links on the where's assange sub on here...   Originally I believed that Steve P.s video from Nov 1, that he was working for US.  but he was too good to be true.  And too many others explained he was lying.  Now today alex jones, who was promoting the guy's claims, now today, puts out two videos, about JA not being seen for a month.  probably because so many people were bugging him about it!  I just dont trust AJ at all.  you might want to check the comment I posted.  the best video debunking Steve is

                And that's interesting about the hidden tor areas.  It's sad that there's a whole area that these monsters have to do anything they want.  and the two things I cant stand are abusing kids and animals.

                 The most reasonable explanation is that he is in protective custody making a deal right now. Maybe forever. There is NO REASON to not give a proof of life. If he was dead, his team wouldn't be making excuses they would be making a martyr out of him. As anything this is speculation, but it's the most obvious conclusion. They can post his cat but not him? They can't give ANY proof of life, instead excuse it away with nonsense. He may even go BACK to the embassy after wards. They might need him to pretend nothing is happening. But I would wager he's alive and working with SOMEONE.

                  I totally agree he's probably alive.  I dont think the cat posts were recent.  I always thought his team might not KNOW where he is, or they could have been captured.  That is somewhat encouraging that the team would have wanted to make him a matyr, but I just feel like they don't know.  But I do find it awfully suspicious this Steve P guy saying that, AND for AJ NOW to acknowledge no one has heard from him!  My first thought was this Steve P/disinfo psy op group probably wants to get their hands on him, and they can't find him either, and now is so desperate to find him, that they're asking the public to help.  sort of a long shot.  To me, everything about Jones seems bogus.  Especially after watching that one video of RitchiefromBoston, debunking Steve P.  He nailed it.

                   Also, I always try to see both sides, and let's say the team knew JA was in protective custody.   They know he promised leaks every week for 10 weeks.  I would think they'd still want to leak them.  It sure looks like WL has been compromised, I think that's why I also feel his team might have been captured.  Did you see the video debunking his supposed live interview from a few weeks ago?  Where they show a closeup of how his shirt collar, and how they manipulated the video?

              Okay thanks!  I will get Tails.  I really appreciate it!  I had told a friend from over on red about this new sub, and mentioned Tor, and they didn't think it was good to use.  So I will let them know too.  I just want to be SAFE on here, I don't click on anything that could possibly be CP,  just want to be safe, and mainly don't want to be tracked!

               Also a note, be suspicious if a "normal" site blocks you because it detects you're on TOR (4chan does this). It's not 100%, but generally it means the site wants to track it's users and doesn't like the anonymity. I believe 4chan did it due to pedo dumps back in the day, but sites that have made that decision are not to be fully trusted and you should limit your non tor usage and the information you give when not on tor.

                okay thanks!  I haven't run across that yet, except one time, when I opened a new private window in Tor, to log onto twitter.  I saw it did bring up a different window first, being on Tor, and had read in the Tor instructions the warning about going to other sites thru Tor.  anyway, I backed out, and didn't log into Tor.  Anything fishy I've seen, I am being super cautious.  I actually don't like using Tor, so will definitely try the other one tomorrow.  thanks!

               You will FOR SURE know if you are clicking on CP in 99% of the cases. The CP is contained to forums that look just like voat, but they discuss and share CP or chat rooms that do the same. Couple of "send me bitcoins, I email you CP to your tor email" and sites that look like a shitty version of youtube that have CP on them.

            I've actually considered getting on to TOR but to be honest my computer intellect ends with microsoft. 
I recently saw this video
            <a href="https://youtu.be/BFuG4EX6NIM">
             https://youtu.be/BFuG4EX6NIM
            </a>
            and was wondering if this would be a smart way to go about it.

             It's basically the exact same as the internet you use right now, but slow. It can allow you browse .tor websites and normal websites. There is nothing complicated unless you are looking to stay anonymous from just about everyone, THEN you need to be more educated. That video was pretty gay, I skipped around. Seemed like correct info. Think of TOR like a cool version of firefox (it uses FF actually as the browser), that lets you see sites normal FF won't let you (.tor sites) and has a ton of built in proxies. But it's SUPER slow.

              Don't get me wrong i am well aware of what TOR is. (used it one time, maybe 2 yrs ago). the reason i linked that vid was mainly to ask if loading the mentioned OS onto a thumb drive would be smarter than just putting TOR on my PC. I've been delving pretty deep into certain things we dont even dare talk about on VOAT and am almost certain im being watched. (no i don't think im special, just very capable)

               Running from a USB is HIGHLY recommended for the security conscious. I also would recommend if you get into some deep secret clubs (that are legit) to change out memory sticks occasionally. Using linux is also a better idea than windows or mac. See here for a quick synopsis of the problems so you can research how best to overcome each:

            There is nothing (in most places) illegal about tor. Use it wherever. It's just like a more complex proxy system. There is lots of normal stuff there. There is even 4chan like sites that have the same rules against posting illegal stuff. You aren't tracked for just using TOR, you are possibly tracked for doing illegal things on tor just like on the regular internet. Go check it out, there's some cool communities, and you for sure get better anonymity, but if someone WANTED to track you it wouldn't be impossible (that's the common misconception). It's basically just a really slow version (though it's gotten better) of the internet, only with way more illegal shit hidden away. Also you would get a virus the same way you do on the regular internet.
