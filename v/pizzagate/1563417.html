<p>Here are a few starting points that seem suspicious given what we now know about the Clinton Foundation\'s ties to trafficking.</p>
<p>1) Ukraine is a known international hub for human trafficking.

<p>Important to note here that there is currently a civil war in Ukraine between insurgents that want to integrate Ukraine w/ Russia vs the established government which is trying to further ties of Ukraine and the EU. According to article 3 above, Hillary may have provided military aid to help the Ukraine government stamp out the Russian insurgency which would presumably free the government up to continue its integration with the EU. Open borders between the EU and Ukraine would presumably make it even easier for human trafficking out of Ukraine into the EU (which is already one of the biggest importer of trafficked Ukrainians).</p>',

            You my be interested in my topic on the subject.  I've been looking into Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk and his "art".  There is certainly some fishy stuff going on.
