<p>10-year-old girl was raped, tortured and beaten as she was sold for sex at two Big Apple motels while staff turned a blind eye to her obvious abuse, a bombshell $10 million lawsuit filed Tuesday claims.</p>
<p>The case, filed Tuesday, comes roughly two months after a similar suit claimed several hotel companies with locations in the Atlanta, Georgia, area ignored and sometimes even profited from sex trafficking.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in Brooklyn federal court and the first of its kind in New York, claims Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts and Choice Hotels Corporation were complicit in the girl’s abuse by operating franchises that chose “to ignore the open and obvious presence of sex trafficking on their properties.”</p>
<p>S.J. and the other girls would be kept at the Econo Lodge sometimes for three days at a time, with the rooms paid for in cash or by sexual favors for the staff, the suit claims. A bowl of condoms was displayed at the front desk of the motel, and used condoms were frequently strewn across the floor of the room after they left, according to the suit.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, who is now a woman in her 20s and was only identified by the initials “S.J.,” claims she was sold for sex as much as 15 to 20 times per day at a Howard Johnson in Jamaica, Queens, operated by Wyndham, and an Econo Lodge in the Bronx, operated by Choice Hotels, between 2006 and 2009, when she was between the ages of 10 and 13, the suit states.</p>

            Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts [From wiki : Wyndham_Hotels_and_Resorts]
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Wyndham Hotels and Resorts is an international hotel and resort chain based in the United States. It has locations in China, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador,[2] Turkey,[3] Germany,[4] the UK, the Caribbean, the UAE,  Indonesia and Margarita Island in Venezuela. On June 1, 2018, Wyndham Worldwide spun-off Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts as its own company, and Wyndham Worldwide was renamed Wyndham Destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
             The firm grew rapidly in the late 1990s, acquiring multiple portfolios of hotels and renaming them Wyndhams. In 1998, in an effort to build an upscale limited-service brand, the company acquired the Summerfield Hotel Corporation and renamed it Summerfield Suites by Wyndham. Wyndham Garden Hotels are smaller properties, usually full-service, that are located in suburban or airport locations. Later that year, the combined company introduced a short-lived luxury brand, Grand Bay Hotels &amp; Resorts, which would include 11 hotels that the company had acquired over the past few years and would turn Patriot into a multi-brand hotel operating and ownership organization. The company also included several European properties, including
             <strong>
              The Great Eastern Hotel in the City of London
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the company's rapid growth drained cash and the firm was unable to continue to grow on its own. In March, 1999, the group agreed to a $1 billion restructuring when a consortium of private equity firms, including Thomas H. Lee Partners and
             <strong>
              Apollo Real Estate Advisors
             </strong>
             , assumed control of the company. They renamed it Wyndham International.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            Great Eastern Hotel, London [from wiki: Great_Eastern_Hotel,_London]
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hyatt has owned the hotel since 2006, operating it under the Andaz brand.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Victorian building that houses the hotel is built on the site of England’s first hospital for the mentally ill, the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, which opened in 1247 and became known as ‘Bedlam’.
            </p>

             The hotel's clientele included business people who could avoid City traffic by staying near the railway station.[9] By 1908 the hotel was operating as the Liverpool Street Hotel and produced postcards advertising its proximity to the London Underground.

              The building is notable also for its inclusion of two Masonic Temples—an Egyptian temple in the basement and a Grecian temple on the first floor.[8] Caledonian Lodge No 134, an English lodge for Scottish Masons in London, met at the Great Eastern from 1920 to 1947.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This Greek Masonic Temple with Grade II listed marbles was built in 1912 by Charles Barry junior (son of Charles Barry, the architect who was responsible for the Houses of Parliament) and cost £50,000 at the time, which is the equivalent of £4 million today.
             </p>
             <p>
              When the hotel was sold for refurbishment it was so run-down the previous owners had never discovered the temple as it was boarded behind a fake wall! Many believe Jack the Ripper was a Mason and if so would have attended this temple as it is closest to his hunting ground. The Masons helped fund the Temples construction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Concealed by heavy, studded doors and accessed via a winding staircase &amp; a spacious mahogany-panelled anteroom, the Grecian-style Temple is perhaps Andaz Liverpool Street’s best-kept secret. The century-old room was considered one of the grandest Masonic temples of its time, as its marble columns and splendid zodiac ceiling testify. The impressive space is a popular backdrop for events such as fashion shows, product launches, wedding receptions and cabaret dinners – it does tend to stick in the memory – and the experienced Andaz team is always on hand with innovative ideas to help ensure that organisers make the most of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Temple was first Chaired by Grand Master Duke of Connaught (cousin to Queen Elizabeth). The space features rare marble set in three different types around the room offset by both Doric and ionic columns. A huge round zodiac sign exists on the ceiling and above the thrones is the Latin Avdi Veda Tace (Hear, See, Keep Counsel).
             </p>
             <p>
              HISTORY : In 1874, when the Great Eastern Railway Company opened Liverpool Street station, work on the hotel began immediately and the original building came to fruition several years later in 1884. As well as for the Masonic Temple, the Charles Barry junior designed the building.

            To me these cheap motels in Bronx/Jamaica suggest low-level, grassroots, black ‘entrepreneurs’.The sort of people who meet runaways at the bus station and become boyfriends. Although 10 is kind of young for runaways.

             Eight US attorneys were fired by President George W. Bush in December 2006 in order to protect convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff’s sex ring, busily pimping trafficked in children, homosexual and lesbian prostitutes to high government officials and elite media figures at the DC Hilton, Ritz Carlton and Sheraton hotels. For decades pedophilia has thrived in our infested swamp of a capital.

              The Washington Hilton was specifically used for sex with children because it has what the agent termed a “super secure section for VIPs that is out of public view and which reportedly employs no camera surveillance, an area able to hold around 6-10 vehicles so that no one could observe abducted, abused or drugged children flown in from other states who were coming to or leaving the hotel.” Hilton employees began to become suspicious of Abramoff’s operation, so children were moved to the Washington Ritz-Carlton according to other intelligence officials.

              Actually these sources suggest a lack of complicity, although it may be they were trying to conceal the operations from honest low-level employees.

            All of these hotels are complicit as sex trafficking is big business and a huge money maker for these hotel chains. Ever notice there are cheapo hotels in the middle of nowhere where no tourists would go in many towns and cities. Who is going to use them to make it profitable other than sex trafficking? Sadly, workers will often turn a blind eye with money dangling in their faces in exchange for their silence. Children and teenagers have no business being there alone or with adults who are not relatives or odd behaviour happening. People need to step up and do something, report it immediately and ask questions. Help stop this from happening.

            I am beginning to think some hotel chains are INTENTIONAL HAVENS for these illegal businesses. A friend who experienced SRA herself, was in the music industry, told me once she opened a door in the lower levels of what I think I remember was a Hilton in Nashville TN and found children who looked like they were being trafficked. She was very scared, allegedly gang stalked afterwards, and would not let me push for more information.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also remember conspiracy theorists around the Kenneka Jenkins story (girl who stumbled into a freezer and died) suggesting that the hotel was actually an organ harvesting operation. Upon reviewing the security footage, you can see multiple shady characters enter and walk around the hotel with children that do not appear to be theirs. This is around 2 am. One creep even arrives with a child, and leaves alone.  The employees were told to keep quiet, and the owner of the hotel seemed to know what was going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many stories are there like this ? It is not too far fetched to think that certain hotel chains cover-for and profit-from these crimes.
           </p>

             Crown Plaza in Rosemont. Run by the Cosa Nostra the Mafia whatever. Run by the mayor and the corrupt police chief who helped coverup Kenneka’s horrid death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brad Stephens is mayor and son of former mayor Donald S. It’s a well run and oiled machine.  With shopping and a casino that brings in buses of people it’s easy to snatch Victims. The kitchen in the hotel was still used imo. Yes kitchens are in the hotels many times in the lower floor. Out of sight. Perfect set up for organ harvesting. I looked into this around her death/disappearance. Chains are surely like a harvesting business. No?  The thought is sickening.

              Yeah I use to live in new York and seen a lot of possible human trafficking.  Just a whole lot of odd things
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the last things that happened before I moved was a young girl getting stabbed in a Muslim populated area and there was no news or anything I could find about what happened.  When I realized it was possibly covered up. I decided new York wasn't for me
             </p>
             <p>
              Also seen a few Freemason symbols on police cars.   Just throwing that out there
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe there is a clean up taking place soon
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep your eye on other people moving out of new York

            It's not their job. Not unusual to have a bowl of free condoms at the front desk - wtf do people think. I worked at a motel, prostitutes are good for business, they check out after 30mins, freeing up the room.

              You're assuming quite alot.
             </p>

              You're assuming they were either fucking or witnessed the fucking/torture/beating of younger ladies.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're assuming appearances. Many women mature early, compared to men. An adult doesn't need to produce ID for their accompanying minor relative, so there's little in the way of verifying their actual age and relation.

              Jane Doe is alive and well, so how was she actually harmed?

                Then don't go into law! When you're life is threatened by spurious and scurrilous accusations - maybe by an evil ex-wife telling the world you molested the kids - you'll be grateful for those who will take up legal arms on your behalf. Nothing like a flesheating kike lawyer to strike fear in the hearts of your enemies!
