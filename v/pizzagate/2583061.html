<p>&quot;New York Center For Children To Host Gala</p>
<p>What brings fashion mogul Kate Spade, Nancy Novogrod (Editor in Chief of Travel + Leisure Magazine), and Pilar Guzman (Editor In Chief of Conde Nast Traveler) and many more of New York’s top crowd together under one roof? Child abuse and The New York Center for Children.&quot; </p>

<hr />
<p>&quot;Founded in 1995 as the Child Advocacy Center of Manhattan, the New York Center for Children (NYCC) is a child-friendly Center, providing free, <strong>comprehensive evaluation and therapy services to victims of child abuse</strong> and their families. NYCC also offers <strong>professional training</strong> on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of child abuse.</p>
<p><strong>All of the programs and services at NYCC are completely free of charge.</strong> NYCC is a not-for-profit organization that relies on donations to cover the costs of operations. <strong>NYCC serves all families, including those without insurance.</strong></p>
<p>When children come to the Center, they are greeted by specially trained staff, colorful murals on the walls and a playroom filled with toys.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluation and treatment, the children at NYCC also benefit from tutoring, mentoring and extracurricular events.</p>
<p>NYCC serves children from all five boroughs of New York City.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorkcenterforchildren.org/">http://www.newyorkcenterforchildren.org/</a></p>
<hr />
<p>IMO, whenever services to desperate children and their families are offered for free, even to people who can afford them, scrutiny for potential abuse is required.  NYCC also trains people to provide these free services, so an even higher level of scrutiny is required.

<p>I can\'t help wondering whether Kate Spade stumbled onto something she wasn\'t supposed to know about in the course of her advocacy for abused children.</p>

              Well, I guess we could hope that he was just at another Ribbon Cutting and didn't bone up on the Charity.  But he just kept talking and talking and he sounds pretty involved.

            I wonder if she did see something that she shouldn't have seen. Her husband dressing up as a mouse 2 days after his wife's death was a bit odd to me. Maybe he just performs for the charity. If my wife just passed away, I would cancel everything and be with family.

              I had a look through his instagram. Seems pretty normal to me. That comment saying he raped your daughter is not there...has it been deleted just in these last few days? The person who made comment would have to delete it. Although I find this situation suspect I don't think his insta will tell us much. Already people are posting comments about him being a pedophile/child killer which is just bad taste imo when his wife has just died. We still don't know the truth and that just gives fuel to those who slate pizzagate.

                I see it now when accessing his insta from a browser. When I looked I used the app and you load the comments up and that comment isnt there so means hes blocked the person who commented. Pity cant see when the comment was made.

             When the cat's away, or dead, the mice will play. With this whole women empowerment movement, maybe he's trying to tell us that she made him feel like a mouse and that's his alter personality that he can now show everyone. Don't excuse what I'm surmising as an excuse for him. He should be with his daughter right now. So, where is she at? In my head, the jury's still out on whether or not she killed herself or someone "helped" her, but Andy does seem like a cuck according to the video I watched of them being interviewed together and women usually will not choose a method of suicide that's going to disfigure them. Considering her wealth and connections, she could've easily have gotten her hands on some pills. It's actually very difficult to hang yourself as she did. The mind wants the body to live and usually takes over to do all it can to prevent death. If she couldn't get the scarf off or loosened and she started calling for her husband and/or thrashing about making pounding noises, and he ran over to see what was going on and saw her killing herself and decided to just stand there and watch, well, he's guilty. Although, I can imagine this would be very difficult to prove in a court of law.

             Although, what if these people have access to scopolamine? Wouldn't it be a special kind of kick for them to command someone to kill themselves and watch them do as they're told?

              All she would have had to do is get up on her knees to stop being hanged.  A doorknob is only a few inches above a seated person's head, and that's what the scarf was attached to.  You're right.  It does not make sense that she committed suicide this way.

               I guess I'm picturing it differently. If I were serious about successfully killing myself via door knob hanging, I would ratchet my neck so close to the door knob that the more I struggled, the tighter it became.

               Like I said to lamplight, I don't think she killed herself. I just like to look at all possible angles and rule things out.

              Ouch! Kick, NO! What an awful thought. She had enough money to buy the best help out there. Although sometimes the "best" isn't the most expensive and heavily advertised counselor or physician. Something else must have gone on for this to happen to a mother of a 13 year old girl. I think she found out about something and was silenced but that's just my opinion.

               Look, I'm pretty sure she was murdered, but I always examine all angles and possibilities in order to rule out all available options before concluding what is obvious to us as truth seekers. It's just the responsible thing to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are people of all walks of life who won't seek help for one reason or another when they're depressed. In my honest opinion, at the very least I think she was murdered because Andy did want a divorce, but knew it was going to be ugly and didn't want certain things coming out in divorce court. Also, he wasn't going to be left with much in the settlement. Just look at her fashion line. It had her name on it, and the Francis Valentine collection was taken from HER side of the family's names. Where is he in all of this? His mark is on nothing, and she considered his designs to be rough draft and would take them and change them to her liking, so he really didn't have a leg to stand on unless he was the sole provider of all the financing for the company.
              </p>
              <p>
               In regards to PG and the occult, my mind is reeling with all sorts of possibilities. So, all we can do is watch the strangeness play out - and wonder who's next.

                I didn't know it was possible to virtually kick someone but I guess it is. No, I did not intend to kick you. Just the thought of someone making anyone take something to kill themselves is mind boggling.  Of course we are dealing with pure evil with the crowd we discuss here.

                 Yes, it's incredible to think of all the things these creatures have at their disposal, and I imagine they'll use anything to satisfy their agenda.
