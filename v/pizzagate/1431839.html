<p>>Pizzagate has been an evolving community research investigation on Reddit. The dedicated forum r/pizzagate was suddenly shut down yesterday, and any subsequent postings regarding the subject are being heavily censored.

<p>>If nothing else though, the citizen researchers digging into these networks desperately need the power of known voices and organizations to force the media to acknowledge these scandals. </p>
<p>>If you feel that pizzagate is a legitimate line of investigation, any mention made publicly would lend desperately needed authenticity to it. 
>Hopefully with enough exposure and evidence a proper law enforcement case will be opened on this scandal.</p>
<p>>I\'m no one. I don\'t have the time or skill to do research. Honestly I have simply followed the investigation and wished I could help. But then I realized what I can do, and that is to write letters like this one. I can ask for professional allies to take a look at the evidence and help with what appears to be a huge scandal that involves many, many children that need saving.</p>

I know there\'s not many nonprofits out there doing this kind of work combatting child porn and pedo stuff, but if a ton of us reach out to all of them *in our own words* we might win over some allies with resources and a platform to get the story out to the public.</p>

            In another thread here (after I sent the email/posted this of course) someone outlined how THORN is connected tangentially to this, working with the NCMEC by providing coding work. Oh well, perhaps the email will still land on blue-pill eyes and they get woke.
Still confident on OUR being a great organization though, it's comprised of ex special forces types.
