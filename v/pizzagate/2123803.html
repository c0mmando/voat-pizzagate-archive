            And the media ignored this. It's so hard to find decent media here in Norway. It seems like a lot of people are staying somewhat informed, but a lot of people aren't.

            I have to jump through hoops to find reporting on this stuff. They covered dark room, but they ignore all the other busts happening in the US. Which are fucking ridiculously huge and the numbers keep adding up.
