             Yep. The Saudi "royal" family has been in the pockets of the western bankers for decades and a lot of people say they they are crypto jews. This latest take down of so many princes is simply cutting them out of the money chain. The royal family were used as patsys to take over the middle eastern oil fields and a lot of other dirty work. Now that the resources of the middle east have been successfully stolen the saudi family is not as useful as it once was.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saudi Aramco is the biggest privately held oil company in the whole world. The western oligarchs want it listed on the new York Stock Exchange. Right now Aramco is still a private oil company but that probably won't last long. The western oligarchs are licking their chops to start carving it up for dinner.

            Not trying to black pill but this is ancient news. Its been on the web for ages. Its never been a secret. I am seeing a lot of old news like this being trotted out as if its some sort of big new revelation bomb shell but it ain't. Huma's history has been splattered all over the web for ages and everybody in D.C. has always known it too. Hell if I have known it I know damn well they did.

             Huma's mother is a Paki muzzie.

             Huma was born in the US, studied only in Saudi Arabia.  Comes back to the US and almost immediately ends up as Clinton protege.

            I am following the bread crumbs left by the QAnon on 4Chan and I am being guided to some pretty wild stuff. Huma is a big part of this too and I believe it ties back to 9/11. Please pardon me if this information has already been posted. This is from the article above:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              If I told you that Democratic Party lobbyist Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta chairs Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, is a registered foreign agent on the Saudi government’s payroll, you’d probably think I was a Trump-thumping, conspiratorial nutcase. But it’s true.
             </strong>
             &gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This might be why John and Tony were 'untouchable' for so long, protection from the Saudi pedo satanists somehow.
            <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/11/security-officers-warn-of-huma-abedins-tie-to-saudis/">
             Huma ties directly into this
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Loudon interviews former CIA operations officer Clare Lopez, who recounts how the Saudi government established the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, the IMMA, and put Huma Abedin’s father, Syed Zainul Abedin, in charge.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huma Abedin served for several years as an assistant editor for the institute’s journal, while her father was editor and her mother a co-editor.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Alongside Huma Abedin on the editorial board also was Abdullah Omar Naseef, the founder of the Rabita Trust, a financial institution founded prior to 9/11 for the explicit purpose of funding Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida
             </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Clinton campaign is attempting once again to sweep important questions under the rug about top aide Huma Abedin, her family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Saudi Arabia, and her role in the ballooning Clinton email scandal.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The New York Post ran a detailed investigative piece over the weekend about Ms. Abedin’s work at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs from 1995 through 2008, a Sharia law journal whose editor in chief was Abedin’s own mother.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not some accidental association. Ms. Abedin was, for many years, listed as an associate editor of the London-based publication and wrote for the journal while working as an intern in the Clinton White House in the mid-1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Her mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Huma Abedin is nothing short of a Muslim Brotherhood princess, born into an illustrious family of Brotherhood leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Her father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, was a professor in Saudi Arabia who founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, an institution established by the Government of Saudi Arabia with the support of the Muslim World League.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Muslim World League was “perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world,” according to former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy. Its then-General Secretary, Umar Nasif, founded the Rabita Trust, “which is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization under American law due to its support of al Qaeda,” he wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              New Abedin emails released to Judicial Watch this week show that Huma Abedin served as liaison between Clinton Foundation donors, including foreign governments, and the State Department.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             When foreign donors had difficult in getting appointments with Mrs. Clinton through normal State Department channels, Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band would email Huma Abedin, and poof! the doors would open as if by magic.

             This is been known for many, many years. Huma's background is all over the web. All a person has ever had to do is google "huma mother magazine" and see it all. Everybody in D.C. has known this for ages and anybody else that ever wanted to look.
