<p>Members of Portugal\'s media, civil service and professional elite were alleged to be regular abusers of the boys, some younger than 14.

<p>Carlos Cruz, TV presenter, 68 years old, who was once voted Portugal\'s most popular man, had paid for sex with a 14-year-old, the judges declared. He also abused at years in jail.</p>
<p>A doctor, Ferreira Diniz, was also sentenced to seven years and a former ambassador, Jorge Ritto, 74, to six years, and the former Casa Pia ombudsman, Manuel Abrantes, to five. They were found guilty of abusing several young boys.</p>
<p>The court found that boys had been regularly taken to a house in the eastern town of Elvas during the 1990s to meet the paedophile clients. Abuse had also taken place in Lisbon.</p>
