<p>Here is a LIST:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Brock Pierce, NOT David Brock, is the person connected to bitcoin.</strong>
David Brock founded Correct The Record and MediaMatters to support the Clinton Machine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock)</a>). Brock Pierce is a different person heavily involved in bitcoin, and is connected to Pizzagate in that he\'s a fundraiser for Clinton Foundation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Pierce)</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Madeleine McCann\'s police sketches are supposedly efits of the SAME SUSPECT, NOT 2 suspects.</strong>
Source of police sketches: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/british-detectives-efits-madeleine-mccann-suspect</a>.
I agree that both sketches shows a strong resemblance to both Tony &amp; John Podesta. But the mole on the forehead, of course, is quite damning indication (if not coincidence). They should definitely be investigated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kim Noble has NO DIRECT CONNECTION to Comet Ping Pong or Tony Podesta. Kim Noble\'s artwork depicting satanic ritual abuse resembles one of the posters for an event organized/presented by Sasha Lord at Comet Ping Pong.</strong>
The Comet Ping Pong poster that shows close resemblance to Kim Noble\'s artwork is: <a href="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg">https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/https://i.sli.mg/kHXqhi.jpg</a>.
<strong>Ria Pratt</strong> is one of the alternative personalities of Kim Noble herself, who has Dissociative Identity Disorder commonly found in Satanic Ritual Abuse (<a href="http://archive.is/c80Ul/d347cdb5d9e8fc636261236aa0d6f0f5aaff768d/scr.png">http://archive.is/c80Ul/d347cdb5d9e8fc636261236aa0d6f0f5aaff768d/scr.png)</a>).
The headless murals on Comet Ping Pong\'s walls were done by an artist called <strong>Arrington de Dionyso</strong> (<a href="http://archive.is/kP2so/ba2796ec22670470500e55b0ef6cf1b3945aa884/scr.png">http://archive.is/kP2so/ba2796ec22670470500e55b0ef6cf1b3945aa884/scr.png</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/UOnP9/b456b33b7d1986cb45c33ddb59d2fe91cc4a213b/scr.png">http://archive.is/UOnP9/b456b33b7d1986cb45c33ddb59d2fe91cc4a213b/scr.png)</a>). 
The pedo artworks of children shown in Tony Podesta\'s home were done by <strong>Biljana Djurdjevic</strong> (<a href="http://archive.is/E5Oxy/801df3e1622a8a4a1620f4145e0c33fc6758a821/scr.png">http://archive.is/E5Oxy/801df3e1622a8a4a1620f4145e0c33fc6758a821/scr.png</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/GrcCB/818dabeba2e4ba2fae69065c8c02868c1b535a62/scr.png">http://archive.is/GrcCB/818dabeba2e4ba2fae69065c8c02868c1b535a62/scr.png)</a>). </p>

<p><strong>There is NO CLEAR EVIDENCE that Andrew Kline, the registered agent (not owner) for Besta Pizza and attorney at Veritas law firm, is the same Andrew Kline who works for the DOJ.</strong>
There\'s been a lot of controversy about this. I am not sure which is correct. There are pictures of 2 different Klines (Andrew Kline @ Veritas: <a href="http://archive.is/2ji23/5aead2297cd2c055969d2d8bde39f895cddf2a4f/scr.png">http://archive.is/2ji23/5aead2297cd2c055969d2d8bde39f895cddf2a4f/scr.png</a>, and Andrew Kline @ DOJ: <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/2/005/086/2c4/17d362a.jpg">https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/2/005/086/2c4/17d362a.jpg)</a>), but there is also an argument saying the photo for Andrew Kline @ Veritas was recently uploaded as a cover-up. There is no clear evidence - will be great if we finally find a solid connection. <strong>Arun Rao</strong> from DOJ, on the other hand, is a more solid connection of this evil network (<a href="https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://imgur.com/PBd3K1C.jpg">https://img1.steemit.com/0x0/http://imgur.com/PBd3K1C.jpg)</a>). </p>

<p><strong>The infamous photo on IG of James Alefantis (jimmycomet), showing 3 men, one is wearing a sweatshirt saying &quot;J\' L\' Enfant&quot; (or J\'aime L\'enfants, meaning &quot;I love children&quot;). That creepy guy is NOT JAMES ALEFANTIS - he is the owner of L’Enfant Café &amp; Bar, which is named after Pierre L’Enfant, the French architect &amp; civil engineer best known for designing the layout of the streets of Washington, D.C. (called the L\'Enfant Plan!).</strong>

The same guy, owner of L’Enfant Café &amp; Bar: <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/02/18/boom-time-lenfant/">http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/02/18/boom-time-lenfant/</a>
However, given all other circumstancial evidence, this is still creepy. This does not dismiss all other damning photos in Alefantis\' IG. But just get it straight - the guy in the sweatshirt is NOT James Alefantis.</p>

            Really good effort - I would suggest removing all speculation just keep it short and to the points that are backed up with evidence

            Addressing issue number 2.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the guardian article, it says "Police have issued two efits that they
            <strong>
             <em>
              believe
             </em>
            </strong>
            are descriptions of the same man". I think that statement alone leaves room for the possibility of it being two different people.

             Did you even read through your own link? Nowhere does it say Andrew Kline owns the shop, it clearly says AGENT! A fucking legal representative. Surely you can't be that dumb?!? This is why people are getting frustrated with morons like yourself who have no comprehension on how things work and worse still dont want to learn.

             Who gives a fuck? Well I do. Every detail is important, especially in this kind of research. Who gives a fuck whether it's boring or not?

             For your link, not sure if there is a clear connection. Didn't choose to ignore anything. It just shows Andrew Kline is the registered agent of Besta Pizza through Uptown Pizza, LLC. Doesn't shed light on whether this Andrew Kline is the one from Veritas or DOJ.
