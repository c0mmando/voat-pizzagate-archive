            I made this account because I stumbled upon this website apparently by a Tim Silver. I myself have been looking into the Finders and the CIA connections and came across this. The website holds a lot of information about MK-ULTRA and the other operations done by the CIA. Everything from the Franklin Scandal to Project Mockingbird is on here with citations throughout the readily downloadable(or embedded) version of the book "Lifting The Veil".
           </p>

            Also, funfact - his last post was April 2016 talking about how he wasnt gonna keep up with posts there anymore because of "the shift" is coming and that you'd know what he meant when the time came.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly enough though, he directs to another website about a lot of different things but it doesnt look like he ever made it past the coding of the websites basic functons - they all lead to a blank page stating "content will be posted soon". Scratching my head wondering if he's okay?
