<h1 id="md-spanish-police-recover-julian-assange-surveillance-footage">Spanish police ‘recover Julian Assange surveillance footage’</h1>
<p><strong>Material that originated from Ecuadorian embassy was reportedly offered for sale</strong></p>
<p>WikiLeaks has said it has uncovered a surveillance operation against Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy and that images, documents and videos gathered have been offered for sale.</p>
<p>Spanish police were said to have mounted a sting operation against unnamed individuals in Madrid who offered the material for sale in what lawyers and colleagues of Assange said on Wednesday was an attempt at extortion.</p>
<p>Some of the material came from video cameras with a capacity to record audio and which had been installed last year, a press conference organised by WikiLeaks was told.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks said material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report had turned up in Spain, where a group was said to have threatened to start publishing unless they were paid €3m (£2.6m).</p>
<p>The Guardian reported last year that Ecuador had bankrolled a multimillion-dollar surveillance operation to protect and support Assange at the embassy, employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police.</p>
<p>Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said he had met four individuals, one of whom he was told was a ringleader and who had prior convictions. There was a possibility that at least one was not a Spanish national, he added. The matter is now in the hands of an investigating Spanish magistrate, according to the whistleblowing website.</p>
<p>Hrafnsson said the surveillance at the embassy – which had led to Assange living a “Truman Show existence” – was part of an escalation designed to result in Assange being extradited to the US.</p>
<p>“If you connect the dots it’s easy to draw that picture,” said Hrafnsson, who was appearing with the barrister Jennifer Robinson and Fidel Narváez, a former consul of Ecuador in London.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks said the surveillance had constituted a total invasion of privacy, which had included recordings of Assange’s meetings with his lawyers and doctor.</p>
<p>Robinson, a lawyer at Doughty Street Chambers who has long advised Assange, described the surveillance as a severe breach of lawyer-client privilege, which had undermined the ability of his legal team to properly defend their client.</p>
<p>Copies of photos, videos and documents recovered from the alleged extortionists were projected on to a screen at the press conference. There was no immediate comment from Ecuadorian authorities or Spanish police.</p>
<p>In March last year, Ecuador cut off Assange’s internet connection, saying he had breached an agreement not to issue messages that might interfere with other states. In a statement, the government said his behaviour on social media “put at risk the good relations [Ecuador] maintains with the United Kingdom, with the other states of the European Union, and with other nations”.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks believes Assange would be extradited to the US if he left the building and was arrested by the Metropolitan police on an outstanding warrant for failing to surrender to bail.</p>
<p>In his first year in office, Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, called Assange a “hacker”, an “inherited problem” and a “stone in the shoe”.</p>

<h1 id="md-if-assange-has-released-everything-why-this-attempt-at-extortion-and-why-arrest-him-now-remember-he-never-released-phase-iii">If Assange has released everything, why this attempt at extortion? And why arrest him, now? Remember: He never released Phase III</h1>
<p>Assange sparked the pizzagate investigation October 7, 2016 when Wikileaks began to release the Podesta emails <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/">an hour after the Trump Access Hollywood video was released</a>. Citizen investigators, appetites whetted by the DNC email leaks and hints of child trafficking from FBIAnon in July 2016, fell on the leaks like locusts. October 17, U.S. SoS <a href="https://archive.fo/LFVj8">John Kerry visited the Ecuadorian embassy and forced them to cut Assange\'s internet</a> but Wikileaks <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/wikileaks-podesta-emails-part-11-julian-assange-internet-cut/">kept publishing Podesta emails daily</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://mashable.com/2016/10/21/sites-across-internet-struggle-after-cyberattack/#YHh.GfidsOqr">Then the internet as a whole was shutdown across much of the U.S. October 21, 2016 by a DDoS attack against domain name registrar Dyn</a>. The Obama administration pointed at the time it was the Russians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This cyberattack comes at a time of heightened tension, with the US claiming it will retaliate against Russia after accusing the country of orchestrating hacks of the Democratic National Committee. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are aware of the attacks and investigating &quot;all possible causes,&quot; DHS told Mashable.&quot;</p>

<p>Pizzagate investigator <a href="https://voat.co/u/RebelSkum">@RebelSkum</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/0YgcM#selection-95.0-105.3">reported</a> the internet shutdown coincided with Reddit mod tampering with <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Wikileaks">r/Wikileaks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Theories abound as to why the attack took place, however the culprit(s) remain unknown. The attack did not seem to benefit Anonymous or Wikileaks much, and it could have just as likely been a multi-staged attack on those organizations to prevent the eventual creation of #Pizzagate.</p>
<p>The attack took place during the time the public was becoming aware of the Podesta situation. Thus the attackers could buy time for parties afraid of the contents of those emails, distract and frighten the public, and make an enemy out of organizations who would eventually investigate them.</p>
<p>Before and during this time there was also a great deal of suspicious Reddit mod activity, including the removal of many posts from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks">/r/WikiLeaks</a> [5] &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the time Assange was silenced, there was an onslaught of trolls attempting to convince people Wikileaks was a CIA-controlled honeypot. <a href="https://archive.fo/GOtpg">Here\'s a thread</a> implying Assange was extracted from the embassy and extradited to the U.S. on October 21, 2016. During the campaign, Hillary <a href="https://archive.fo/HLL0A#selection-561.0-561.593">worked hard</a> to paint Assange as a Putin operative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the second debate between the two presidential candidates, on 9 October 2016, Hillary Clinton accused Russian hackers for the leak of information to WikiLeaks, presumably working under the orders of Vladimir Putin: &quot;... But you know, let\'s talk about what\'s really going on. Because our intelligence community said the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking, on American accounts to influence our election ... And believe me, they\'re not doing it to get me elected. They\'re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, Assange began releasing the information in phases, but <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-30/wikileaks-warns-it-launching-phase-three-its-election-coverage">his internet was shut down before &quot;Phase III&quot; could be released</a>.  To this day, no one knows what &quot;Phase III&quot; contained, or why Wikileaks failed to release it.</p>
<p>Is this why Ecuador installed video cameras to record Assange 24/7?</p>
<p>The indictment against him was filed months ago...why wait until now to arrest him?</p>
<p>If Assange goes to trial, will it allow the defense to make Phase III documents part of the public record?</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with <a href="https://youtu.be/SSMSKGQFMy0?t=4109">Obama warning Berliners in his April 6 town hall speech to beware of fake videos that cause political upheaval</a>? At 1:08:29 he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It\'s going to get worse with AI. You\'re gonna start seeing... If you think Fake News is bad now, what you\'re gonna start seeing is the ability to duplicate people\'s speech and figures so that distinguishing what\'s true and what\'s not is going to become even more difficult.&quot;</p>

            Speculation aside, thank you for putting such an effort into looking into Assange's situation. Means a lot that you're able to take up that mantle while I'm feeling down.

            Wish I could help, but my mind has been mired in fog the past few days.

           </p>
           <p>
            Wiki leaks is just another movie ..like those videos on NWO and illuminati ..that gove out only so much truth to then toy with the incoming audience...
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the delites are being fooled...
           </p>
           <p>
            When universal jurisdiction is activated ....the delites wont have anywhere to hide..whether it be new zealand paraguay, antartica ...
           </p>
           <p>
            The mafia would be the first to burn...then the delites with no one to do their dirty work..wont have a leg to stand on
           </p>
           <p>
            Ignore Ass-ange ..hes just shoving it by ur ass-inch-by-inch
           </p>
           <p>
            Its better juat staring at the clock..
If u want to join in and turn US war machine into ur debtor and Roman slave....just take a dollar and reduce the debt at the US treasury...and then bit by bit it will sink in..the power given to u at berth..our birth certificates are the receipts for the claim we have against Roman accoutnants to do our bidding
We just run things ass backwards..
           </p>
           <p>
            We have the frredome to choose ..but we always are enticed to choose wrong..

            The first one links to an email from Hillary Clinton to Cheryl Mills with an all-caps subject line that reads: NEWS REPORT ON MISSING KIDS IN HAITI. Clinton says "As predicted." The original had several photos attached which were unavailable on Wikileaks. Q shares it and says:

              Here's the Justice Dept press release
             </a>
             about Assange's indictment. These are the people who are going after him:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and Nancy McNamara, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, made the announcement after the charges were unsealed. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Tracy Doherty-McCormick, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kellen S. Dwyer, Thomas W. Traxler and Gordon D. Kromberg, and Trial Attorneys Matthew R. Walczewski and Nicholas O. Hunter of the Justice Department’s National Security Division are prosecuting the case.
             </p>
             <p>
              The extradition will be handled by the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs.
             </p>
             <p>
              A copy of this press release is located on the website of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Related court documents and information are located on the website of the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia or on PACER by searching for Case No. 1:18-cr-111.

             The three prosecutors who signed the indictment (

Two days after Tesla's death, representatives of the Office of Alien Property went to his room at the New Yorker Hotel and seized all his possessions. Dr. John G.

I'm guessing he's already in the US or somewhere safe.  It will be interesting to see if he will appear in court.  I may have to make a little junket across town for a looksee...

             <a href="https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/anti-abortion-church-accused-of-child-trafficking/">
              this article
             </a>
             related to Silsby right around the time she was caught. From the article:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Idaho Baptist church is associated with many far-right causes including anti-abortion mobilizations. One of the church’s leaders, Randy Jackson, protested at the Salt Lake City Olympic Games, against the Red Cross and Planned Parenthood’s condom distribution. Jackson also traveled to Washington D.C. to protest the 2004 March For Women’s Lives.
             </p>

             Obviously, the church is what people are taught to trust the most. What if the implication is that some of these organizations are not against abortion because of the sanctity of life but because they can profit off it it via adoptions? We all know how much abuse takes place through the legal system via CPS. Why take all the risks of smuggling people across multiple borders when you could create a homegrown 'farm' system via adoption as opposed to abortions? Back when I was married we discovered my wife was incapable of having children so we tried to adopt. Fifteen thousand dollars later and we had nothing to show for it. Not even a hint of interest. Yet, you have people like these
             <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/03/29/moms-of-family-who-drove-off-cliff-have-dark-history-of-abuse/">
              two sickos
             </a>
             who were somehow able to adopt six children.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for the video faking stuff, I have no idea. It's obviously damage control for something that might surface. Maybe it is about the rumored frazzledrip video in some context after all.

              ?) THIS is the "chance" I told you Assange is giving Mueller to come out with it all before Assange does. The Hill's headline and the others now popping up just like it from the MSM, are Mueller's attempts to get ahead of the Assange's leak and look like he's actually doing his fucking job. Assange planned to release the 3rd, final part of his promised, pre-election "October surprise", in early Oct. 2016 as he/Wikileaks publicly committed to, but just before he could, NBC and the Clinton Campaign purposefully held and timed the release of the Billy Bush/Trump bus "grab 'em by the pussy" audio, which was also the week of the last publicly broadcasted, presidential debate. Assange then stated he'd delay the publishing of his final series of the surprise until 10/21/16. Then a week later, the Embassy and his HQ in Iceland, went dark and witnesses confirmed they believed he was take from the embassy by unmarked operatives.
             </p>
             <p>
              Assange posted the TMZ article link on twatter just a few days back, where TMZ reported on 10/12/16 that NBC purposefully held and timed the release of the Bush/Trump audio. Assange also tweeted a day or two ago, hinting around Hillary/Russian collusion, claiming her own election collusion "backfired" ON HER. He followed that up with another tweet, attaching a previously published DNC email, showing how the DNC/Clinton Campaign, planned to boost Trump thinking he'd secure them an easy win if he won the primaries.
             </p>
             <p>
              Assange has been telling you himself what's coming for almost a week so this shouldn't be news. What I've specifically tried to prep you with over the last few days, is how they're playing Mueller because Trump wants this to come from Mueller directly before Assange releases. It makes Mueller and ALL THE FUCKING ESTABLISHMENT TROLLS WHO PUSHED FOR A "SPECIAL" FUCKING "COUNSEL"...

             The second of thing I told y'all yesterday was WHERE this file set came from and a majority of the info it contains. I told you again, it won't include pizza and again, you'll never see her going down in an orange jumpsuit for pizza, BUT, it's coming from the WEINER/HUMA files and communications originally obtained by the NYPD as part of the active Weiner sexting investigation and was later handed to the FBI upon further review and FBI jurisdiction take over.
            </p>
            <p>
             For my biggest piece of info, you will see that Mueller AND Comey (as much as you want to hate them) have actually HELPED this all come to a head. The ONLY REASON Mueller let the clock run down so close on the Assange 10/21/17 deadline is because he's had to continue to string the corrupt establishment DNC/GOP trolls, along. This is why he won't release the private Comey "memos" like CNN is publicly demanding. Haha, the Comey memos were fabricated bullshit, created only so Comey could reference to them in his testimony. He couldn't stick his neck out on Lynch like he did without coming down on Trump like they expected him to, right?! He'd have SPOILED THE PLAN!

            If any of this is true, it seems to confirm my theory that the timing between Assange's arrest and the Mueller report being finished is not a coincidence.

             Not sure what the current state of our investigations into this is - didn't we come to the conclusion that the NYPD never had the Weiner laptop, but that it was handed over directly by his attorneys to the FBI?

              I don't recall that specific detail. Last I heard we discussed the search warrant for Weiner's devices, and the report of the detective that mentioned "Crime against children". We need to dig this up and clarify it. I never followed MegaAnon so I don't have a solid sense of whether they were reliable or not. Definitely worth looking back into.

             Interesting. This bit caught my attention though because the Comey memos came up again just a couple days ago:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              For my biggest piece of info, you will see that Mueller AND Comey (as much as you want to hate them) have actually HELPED this all come to a head. The ONLY REASON Mueller let the clock run down so close on the Assange 10/21/17 deadline is because he's had to continue to string the corrupt establishment DNC/GOP trolls, along. This is why he won't release the private Comey "memos" like CNN is publicly demanding. Haha, the Comey memos were fabricated bullshit, created only so Comey could reference to them in his testimony
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             It seems like there is a lot more to these

               It really does. It doesn't help that some of this stuff moves so slow that you don't even think about it again for 6 months or a year later. Feels like things are finally starting to come to a head now, though.

              With all the different attacks coming at him and his associates right now from different directions, it seems like he is at the epicenter of the struggle between the clowns and the whitehats at the moment.

              It strikes me that this would be a great way to generate hype and outrage among the regular folks prior to big revelations. I recall Assange doing quite a bit of stuff to generate buzz in the fall of 2016 leading up to both sets of email leaks, and again with Vault 7. One thing about Julian Assange...he tends to unite a lot of different factions and focus their discontent with corruption like a laser beam.

            I guess we'll know what's going on for sure if Phase III gets dumped in the next couple of weeks. I've been dying to know what is in it.

              It very well could be and I do hope that is the case. My point being that if Phase III gets dropped in the next little while it would be evidence that the relationship is not cooperative.

                I've never been a big fan of the 'clog the news cycle' theory because for it to function it implicitly relies upon the media being unbiased and we all know that they aren't. There really isn't any need to create an event to clog the cycle since they all collaborate anyway and things are happening all the time. They could all just pick a story at random to focus on in order to justify not covering something important. They just ignore or barely touch on the stories that are damaging to their interests.
               </p>
               <p>
                CNN and their fixation on the Malaysia Air crash several years ago springs to mind. They covered that story in insane detail long beyond the point anyone gave a shit about it. Seemed like it went on for 6 months or so. I never really paid much attention at the time but in hindsight they were probably attempting to avoid covering anything damning about Obama and his administration.

                  Yeah, I haven't seen any of that either. That's some 3rd rail shit and they are going to avoid that until they absolutely have to cover it. I'm trying not to speculate too much with the Assange stuff so I'm just waiting to see what develops on that front. It is really interesting that Sweden reignited the sexual assault claims today.

                   I know the feeling. Three years ago I had no clue about most of this stuff aside from a vague idea about the Clinton crime ring. I had no idea how deep and far back all this stuff goes. Hardest part is once you really start digging into it and get deep enough it's hard to explain to people who have no idea any of this is occurring.
