<p>The difference between the two is that while the participants in Pizzagate evade justice because they are profoundly powerful, Grooming Gang members are commoners but yet still evade justice for decades (one pimp in the Telford case was known to police in 1996 and died of natural causes in 2013 never having been arraigned) - WHY do these ‘commoners’ have criminal immunity?

<p>This investigative thread is to show that link by listing which Scandals have clear media mention of police inaction due to ‘A culture of political correctness’ or ‘Fears of racism’  being the two commonest ways of describing the political paralysis at work </p>

<p>Cultural Marxism is clearly and identifiably a factor in all the ‘big scandals’ like Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford etc - even leftist / Globalist media cannot deny that much though they would prefer to.

<p>I will now list each one of those 73, with a media link if I can find it (I will generally try to find larger / globalist media if I can unless that story is hopelessly vague, as they like to be) , but where I can only find a smaller source (and some are smaller towns in which only smaller regional media reported on it) , I’ll post it, dont shoot the messenger that it aint what Normies would call ‘authoritative’. I’ll also lean towards a more recent media story because as we know, the initial media exposure gives more girls and families the courage to come out (eg, while Rotherham stories tend to cite 1400 , that was the ‘conservative’ (BBC admitted so)  estimate in 2013 - additional past victims and new victims since are now regarded as at 2000 minimum). Also, I will find precedence of a news item that is ‘brave enough’ to identify the ethnicity/religion of the ringleaders</p>
<p>My further annotation will be as such:</p>
<p>V= number of victims C= number of convictions or S= number of suspects if I cant find convictions (I will ignore for now that most convictees are the pimps and not the much larger/harder to catch and prosecute client base) and, not to be too cute about it, but where Racism Allegations Perpetrated Exploitation is confirmed within the media, I will label it with RAPE.  
</p>
<p>Those with No Media Found in the list of 73 to verify I shall annotate as NMF -though note I have only searched ‘Location Grooming Gangs’ and not widened the search to ‘Location Child sexual abuse’ or ‘Location Islamic paedophile rings’ etc</p>
<p>I’ll also add / note - that the biggest chicken hasn’t come home to roost yet (has been too chicken to come home?);   LONDON</p>
<p>(addendum I : I’m also aware this is occurring in the Netherlands, too, which is currently beyond my expertise)</p>
<p>(addendum II : I will only provide one weblink for each community, though my annotation of victims/perps etc may be cross correlated with other links that if you doubt me you can bloody well search for yourself [appreciating that Google hides child trafficking - i use Duck Duck Go])</p>
<p>(addendum 3 : Its hard to confirm but there may be some issue of ‘overlap’ here eg,- the grooming gang for Oldham may or may not be wrapped into the Rochdale convictions. Having said that, this shallow analysis may also overlook multiple gang convictions in the same place - ie, Exampleville may have had some convictions in 2010, more in 2012, again in 2014 )</p>
<p>(addendum IV : there’s a few grooming gang catalogues on line, this one seemed reasonably methodical, <a href="http://www.pmclauth.com/sentenced/Grooming-Gang-Statistics/Gangs-Jailed?widget=BASIC&amp;start=101&amp;limit=100">http://www.pmclauth.com/sentenced/Grooming-Gang-Statistics/Gangs-Jailed?widget=BASIC&amp;start=101&amp;limit=100</a> )</p>
<p>(addendum V : The best adjective to describe the motivation of the perpetrators, I find, is ‘Creed’ . It is an Islamic Creed but not all Islam participates in this. Pakistan, being the Epicentre of Quranic literalism, relies on Quran 33.50 ‘do whatever you ant with captured women’ - but not all Islamic regions follow this on aggregate - African men participate, but interestingly (whatever their over-representation in other forms of criminality) Arabic Islamists are rather UNDER-represented here. Some white men participate (5% of convictees) but possibly as converts or otherwise as regular paedophiles who came to understand the safety / shielding offered to Pakistani pimps )</p>
<p>The individual locales will be listed in separate comments below</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>
<p>Of the 73 communities alleged as suffering grooming gangs, there were about as many ‘no details found’ as there were new unlisted communities - so these factors reasonably negate each other. A few were clearly or not so clearly sub-sets of the larger scandals 
But there were 38 stories / Communities of the list of 73 that had some mention of police inaction due to political correctness, racism fears, or ‘going back into historical crimes in light of recent findings/lessons’ </p>
<p>That’s a pretty clear correlation. And that’s without getting into how political correctness in the Judiciary and drafting Legislation etc gives a deference to migrants that now, clearly has totally backfired on the poor British community.</p>',

            This is not a comprehensive U.K. list.  This list comprises England only.  If we extrapolate on probabilities given the above statistics, it is likely that an equal potential exists within Scotland and Wales and Ireland.  Because of its recent feature in a U.K. broadsheet newspaper article people can be forgiven for concluding that Telford is a fairly new revelation in a series of previously reported similar grooming gang scandals.  In fact, the Telford investigation goes back over seven years but the article brought to light that the problem has prevailed for far longer than that and consists of far more victims and perpetrators than originally assumed.  This documentary was filmed in 2010 and worth a watch as a good overview of the problem and all it encompasses

           <p>
            By sheer chance I was up through the night on Sunday 18th March and because of weather difficulties my tv was randomly plotting into not often viewed channels.  It just so happened upon the ‘Parliament’ channel which was broadcasting a recording of the 13th March Home Affairs Select Committee ‘Policing for the Future’ featuring a panel of MP’s questioning representatives of the U.K. Police Authorities.  Because the topic being discussed when I landed was ‘Telford’ it caught caught my attention and I managed to record the last 51 minutes.  One of the Police panel representatives was Chief Constable Simon Bailey, currently the head of Operation Hydrant – the nationwide inquiry into historical child sexual abuse.  As a side note, we will remember CC Bailey as he who in 2017 caused some outrage when he publicly stated that reports of both current and historical paedophilia had now reached ‘saturation levels’ that now overwhelmed the police’s ability to realistically cope with, and thus advocated  ‘counselling and rehabilitation to lower level paedophile offenders’ so that officers could ‘concentrate on dealing with the most dangerous paedophiles with access to children’ and further, that paedophiles who view child pornography pose no immediate actual risk of danger or physical harm to children and as such should be risk assessed and given rehabilitation where appropriate
(!!?I know, right?)
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/28/child-sexual-abuse-claims-overwhelming-police-says-lead-officer">
             https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/28/child-sexual-abuse-claims-overwhelming-police-says-lead-officer
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            With regard to Telford, Chief Constable Simon Bailey (and all who spoke thereafter) struggled to articulate the issues surrounding the race and cultural aspects of this ever increasing problem, ever so tentatively referring to it as:  ‘this particular model of abuse’. This is what he had to say:
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘I think that Telford and the particular model of abuse that we are now reading about in a particular newspaper we have seen replicated on numerous occasions in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oldham, Bristol, Oxford.  It is but one type of child sexual exploitation it is the model that gets a disproportionate amount of media coverage....my concern around this is that we are not asking the really difficult questions that come up about this particular model of abuse; what culturally drives this? What culturally permits the type of abuse that we are seeing in that particular offending model’
           </p>
           <p>
            In my opinion this small portion in the preceding words of CC Bailey’s statement answers those latter questions already.  The remainder of the session continued in the same vein; with all speakers hop-skipping and tip-toe-ing around the obvious and so obviously working hard to avoid the addressing of it for what it actually is: a hugely disproportionate number of Pakistani men who are systematically grooming, abusing, abducting and pimping out vast numbers of young vulnerable white girls for sexual and financial gain WITH IMPUNITY from within the majority of working class areas of the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I viewed throughout their shaky and reluctant speech patterns, their ever so tentative descriptions; the absolute refusal to address the problem directly as it is.  THIS is precisely what has given rise to the license for this to have happened and for it continue unabated.  Political correctness is the scourge of the problem in the U.K. on many fronts, and represents a blatant obstacle and the biggest problem of all.
           </p>
           <p>
            No mention throughout this inquiry (that I saw) of the above mentioned 73 separate locations of incidence.  This is a pandemic.  And with our current government stripping away funding from police forces as well as the working class, poor and vulnerable in U.K. society as they are doing, one that will not be stopped anytime soon.

             My post really only went to the extent of VERIFYING that Political Correctness has a significant role, and it didnt even go into the many and varied ways why it as a social and LEGAL force so catastrophically sabotages the pursuit of Criminal Justice . The fact of the matter is, the penalty for being racist - even just the fleeting APPEARANCE of it, in our society today is so high and readily triggered that it destroys lives and careers in the flutter of a tongue. It is STRUCTURAL that the pursuit of social justice destroys the pursuit of Criminal Justice

               It aint just the scourge - its the end of Western civilisation. I subscribe to the black pill view that should ISIS Calipate have a continental European outbreak (&amp; I think that's no longer than 15 years away)  the Standing Army of that European Nation will , every chance, stand idle in political paralysis over the  'human rights' as tens of thousands of  'Good Muslims' pour into the target region from every corner of the EU.

            Fear of being called racist stops people reporting child sexual exploitation concerns, Labour frontbencher claims
           </p>
           <p>
            A fear of being called racist is stopping authorities from dealing with child abuse and sexual exploitation, a Labour frontbencher has claimed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sarah Champion, the shadow women and equalities minister, said that “people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her comments came after 18 people were convicted of or admitted offences in a series of trials related to child sexual exploitation in Newcastle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Newcastle joins a growing list of English towns and cities where sex rings have been exposed, including in Rotherham and Rochdale.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Champion, who is also the MP for Rotherham, said society needed to acknoweldge that in “all of the towns where these cases have gone on the majority of the perpetrators have been British Pakistani”.
           </p>
           <p>
            She said: “We have got now hundreds of men, Pakistani men, who have been convicted of this crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Why are we not commissioning research to see what is going on and how we need to change what is going on so that it never happens again?”
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms Champion said if such crimes were being committed by, for example, a motorbike gang “we would recognise that as an indicator and we would deal with it”.
           </p>
           <p>
            She accused the Government of failing to address the issue and when asked why she believed action is not being taken she said: “I genuinely think it is because of people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse.
