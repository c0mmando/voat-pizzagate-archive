<p>The disgraced movie mogul and convicted rapist was awarded a CBE — one of Britain\'s more prestigious honors — for services to the British film industry in 2004</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>Britain\'s Queen Elizabeth II has ordered that the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein be stripped of the prestigious CBE honor he received for services to the British film industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The Queen has directed that the appointment of Harvey Weinstein to be an Honorary Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 29 January 2004, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order,&quot; said a statement posted Friday in the London Gazette — an official outlet that reports on U.K. honors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removal of official U.K. honors is rare, but can take place where the holder has brought the honors system &quot;into disrepute,&quot; according to the U.K. government.</p>
<p>This can include when the holder &quot;has been found guilty by the courts of a criminal offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than three months.&quot;</p>
<p>Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison earlier this year after he was convicted in a New York court of third-degree rape of Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, as well as a count of criminal sexual act in the first degree against Mimi Haley, a former &quot;Project Runway&quot; production assistant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Flimsy but arguable pizzagate relation:</strong> Weinstein and sexual abuse in Hollywood (though no accusations of underage abuse, to my recollection, pertaining to Weinstein). Weinstein relation to Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein, with the latter being a known \'elite\' pedo. UK Royal Family obviously linked to Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is just a news article share. If rule requirements aren\'t met, I apologize.</p>',
