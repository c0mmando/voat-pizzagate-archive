            MediaMatters at its best. Goal: De-weaponize ""the [DC police] department was “‘told to stand down on this case.’”
           </p>
           <p>
            Paragraph 2: It's an "Unsubstantiated claim"
           </p>
           <p>
            Paragraph 4: It's a "False allegation"
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I wonder how Media Matters will spin this: "The liberal media has done nothing to investigate the Seth Rich murder, the DNC has offered $0 reward. Why don't they care?" - Mike Cernovich
           </p>
           <p>
            And this: "Seth Rich shot &amp; killed in the street. The FBI then travels to his home and confiscates his laptop despite the fact the DC Police were put in charge of the investigation."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Boy the top layer of management at the FBI sure are some great guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            "But why didn't the DC Police retrieve the laptop if they were in charge of the investigation?" little Billy asked inquisitively.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Why? Because fuck you that's why Billy. Now get lost kid. Scram." said the high functioning psychotic FBI agent as he climbed into his Porsche 911 Twin Turbo and sped away in a cloud of smoke coming thick, fast and hot off his Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires.

              Please realize I don't condone violence. I think the fastest way the Deep State comes down is through NON-violence. And I know Quentin Tarantino wrote half the quote himself. I'm thinking here of the other half that God wrote. And I know God said "Vengeance Is Mine". It's just when I think of the Andrew McCabe's conscious effort to throw cold water on anything related to the Clinton Foundation giving off smoke my mind does wander at times. I think of the Brownstone Operations and getting poor kids of every race hooked on Opiates. I think of organ harvesters. I ask if these men and women are guilty then they are evil and wicked and therefor Ezekiel 25:17 finds purchase. Only then do I try to visualize what exactly did God mean in Ezekiel 25:17. And the first thing that comes to mind is Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction.

               Ezekiel 25:17: And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

              So wrapping up the emotions in this human tragedy are running hot. They're so charged it makes me think about God a lot, pretty much all day every day. It's hard to find reason and meaning. The only thing that makes sense is the fact we are all sinners after all.

               The only way I can see the perps in this sordid tail making it through is for them to get right with God.

              Only God can forgive sins. And only God can provide you unconditional love at all times........no matter what.
