<p>John Podesta\'s friend and orthopedic hand doctor is on the board of \'TissueGene\', who along with their Korean affiliate, Kolon Life Sciences,  are companies that develop regenerative therapies using donor tissue.</p>
<p>Could it be that they get their supply of human tissue from the children they abduct?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>University of Virginia biomedical engineers and physicians have earned a role in a new, national initiative that will develop technologies for manufacturing human tissues and organs, with the goal of making them readily available to patients. A public-private effort, the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute brings together a consortium including UVA and nearly 100 other partners from industry, government, academia and the non-profit sector. The consortium will lead the Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Manufacturing USA Institute on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense. The federal government will provide approximately $80 million, and the partner organizations combined will contribute more than $200 million to support the development of tissue and organ manufacturing capabilities. </p>

<p>TissueGene, Inc. is a Maryland-based biopharmaceutical company focused on developing regenerative therapies for the treatment of various orthopedic disorders. Founded in 1999, the company’s core technology employs a form of cell therapy to deliver therapeutic proteins directly to localized areas of damaged tissue. The sustained expression of such proteins initiates rapid repair of injured tissue without the need for invasive surgical procedures. TissueGene is currently developing four product candidates, TG-C, TG-B, TG-D and TG-N for the regeneration of cartilage, bone, disc and nerve, respectively. The company\'s lead product candidate, TG-C, has been developed for treating osteoarthritis of the knee and is currently in Phase II trials in the US and in Phase III trials in Korea.</p>

<p>WHAT IS TG-C? (NOTICE THE WORD DONOR)</p>
<p>TG-C (Cartilage)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TG-C is an allogeneic (donor) cell therapy involving human chondrocytes (cartilage cells) that have been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic growth factor TGF-ß1 and has been developed to induce cartilage regeneration in patients with osteoarthritis. Chondrocytes, when stimulated by the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-ß1), have been shown to play a critical role in both the formation and maintenance of articular cartilage by regulating the homeostasis of the hyaline cartilage matrix.</p>

            This is a huge part of their plan. Once they start rolling out almost magic-level "cures" for all kinds of ailments, like cancer, diabetes, etc, they'll reveal that these cures were derived from human tissue. Then they can start getting people to look at things from the perspective of "A few have to die so that the masses can be healthy." This is how they normalize murder to the masses.

            Thank you for posting this and I've mentioned this prior (as well as many others) that we need to take a close look at Biotech/Geneome companies and who as ties to them. Not all of these research companies use discarded body parts from Planned Parenthood or those who willing donate to science.

            Many times, children are needed due to the size and healthy organs to hybrid with animals. Here's what I posted prior and if you search voat, there's more info others have posted. I swear I read somewhere about something in Wiki w/HRC and transporting of a cooler? (A way to transport organs is in coolers)
           </p>
           <p>
            Biotech-worldwide. Wonder how many of these are located where many kids go missing?

            Pig/human lung hybrid- transplant is BIG money business. Also, to harvest lungs like this, children lungs are what is needed. I like how this article seems to need to point out the kids died in an accident

            Dr. Robert Ashton's death really got to me.
I cannot base this on any evidence so please understand that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Felt like Dr. Ashton was a patsy.

            Do you have any evidence of wrongdoing against the companies you cite?   Because that NBC article you cite has nothing to do with these other companies.

            Months ago I read about  Hansjorg Wyss
           </p>
           <p>
            and his  Wyss Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Inter connections with the Podestas were found.
           </p>
           <p>
            This man is extremely wealthy and tries to keep a low profile.
           </p>
           <p>
            His daughter weaves in and out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somehow he got out  of manslaughter accusations
because 2 or 3 of the patients died. They were elderly and we're being tested on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit #1 ...now I see you mentioned Wyss  in your post..
           </p>
           <p>
            Wyss and the Sandlers And the Podestas  had pizza parties together.

             If you go to pizzagate.wiki and do a search
you will come upon some
one or more that spell their last name: WEISS
            </p>
            <p>
             A man by the name of Martin Weiss  a long time
talent manager  was arrested for he and company  raping children.
He represented child actors.  He represented children who appeared
on Nickelodeon and The Disney Channel.  He was 47 when he was arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was  arrested on December 01  2011.
            </p>
            <p>
             So do not confused WYSS.  With    WEISS.
