            It is my deep suspicion that JA has taken ownership of Caris with the blessings of her parents. Perhaps for money or other compensation. I have been trying to post this here all night but have a mod up my ass deleting my comments. It is very likely that he has been grooming her since infancy. This dad is the "chicken lover " and Butt lovers in JA's instagram.

            I completely agree with you. Cecile Richards is EVIL. Hillary Clinton is evil. Liberals love abortion so much, they will never let it go. We would have to expose this to shut down the abortionists... and I do believe this is going on. The prior investigation into planned parenthood was more than ample proof to me, but the media always ignores it and the government does virtually nothing about it.

            Child sacrifice to Moloch took place at the top of a Ziggurat (the tower of Babel - a pyramid shaped tower - thus the triangle references everywhere you look).  It's their religion to sacrifice babies and children. Satanists in particular believe raping children helps them consume the child's life force and opens a portal to another dimension where they can become gods. They eat the flesh and drink the blood to give themselves more magical powers. Or so they believe. Modern day efforts at finding the fountain of youth have focused on using fetal tissue, blood of the young, and more. The organ trafficking is a huge part of this whole scandal as well. Some day we will probably find out everything that has been going on in this scandal but for now we can only guess all the different reasons and base it on the Satanic writings, and the things that they show us in their tauntings which is what a lot of their "art" is about. First they do snuff films, take provocative pictures, make references to murder, etc. then they post it all online and when we ask them what the hell they are doing they gaslight us and say we are crazy. Amanda Kleinman says art is not evidence. But on the contrary, when your art is related to Monarch programming and pedophilia, it becomes evidence. They're very cocky.

            SO....  I posted about this a few weeks back and it was DELETED by mods for being UNRELATED TO PG ( I know, can you fucking believe that bullshit ? )
           </p>
           <p>
            Here it is &gt;&gt; Scott Cummings (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/scummings">
             @scummings
            </a>
            ) FIRST piece ever is the PEDO triangle...
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh gee... what does this look like???

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Description provided by Scummings: ' The TRIANGLE TRIVET was Base Modern's first design, and the inspiration for the forming of this company. Its form was inspired by the "impossible" or Penrose triangle as designed by Oscar Reutersvard in 1934. The Penrose triangle is a familiar object to us all due in large part to the work of M.C. Escher but also because of its use in populate culture. '
           </p>
           <p>
            M.C. Escher's Artwork:
            <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/illumformula1chap.shtml">
             http://educate-yourself.org/mc/illumformula1chap.shtml
            </a>
            'If the child has artistic brainwaves, then the programmer will use art work in programming. The art work of the European artist M.C. Escher is exceptionally well suited for programming purposes. Reversals, mirror images, illusion, and many other qualities appear in Escher’s art work which make all 76 or more of his major works excellent for programming. Example: Five children each given the same Alice In Wonderland script will each use the script differently during programming. The programmer takes the child’s own creativity and works with that unique creativity. The child must create the images himself if the programming is to hold. It won’t work if the images are someone else’s. The child organizes its internal world to suit his/her own experiences such as castles, boxes, rooms, and dollhouses. The PAS type testing will continue during the early years of the slave’s life to make sure the programming has not driven the child crazy or psycho. The child will move down the script decided for it for its whole life, based on these early tests.'

             About 50% of my posts get removed by the mods here as "unrelated" and when I call them out my accounts get deleted. I'm trying to remember which band it was where I found the photos of a party inside the tunnels - at the old Dupont food court maybe? Or maybe just one of the tunnels alone - I think it may have been through Heavy Breathing's page but I'm not sure.  I will have to look back through my files. It's extremely retarded to think when you find a connection here to a pedo symbol that it's not a pedo symbol but just some obscure artistic reference. There is a reason why the pedos might like some obscure reference to a triangle in the first place, those symbols are all linked back to the Egyptian pyramid, the symbol of child sacrifice (the tower of Babel - where they went to the top and sacrificed babies to Moloch) - they believe rape and child sacrifice will make them like Gods in a parallel universe and that it will open a portal to a new dimension - thus the spiral - symbol of a vortex. The butterfly is a Monarch mind control reference, thus the use of the hearts to form the butterfly or other butterfly look alike symbols. Watch, this comment is likely to get deleted.

              Especially when it comes from Scott Cummings website where he eludes to it's 'presence through populate ( typo? ) culture' and it's relationship to M.C. Escher's artwork that was used in the MK Ultra program. I also posted about his metal work at the Pegasus Museum and how he created what appears to be a torture chamber with viewing platforms. That post, also deleted.  Cummings is central figure, for sure, and everytime focus is put on him and Pegasus, mods move in.

            Weren't they also owners of a nursery called "Childroot"? Root is a term for hoodoo work, like voodoo in the black south. They do rootwork on you, for good or bad. Combined with a coffin business, it doesn't look good.

            Damn... now I kind of wish that wasnt a pedophile symbol and that these weren't very likely pedophiles. Because horrifying sexual connotation aside. That's a nice looking trivet.

               Well I don't know how you could possibly know what I know or don't know about pizzagate, since I never claimed to have published a conclusive portfolio of all that is pizzagate. If you have a specific fact you think I am wrong about please do share. Unlike perhaps you, some people on here don't have enough time to fully source the entirety of their mental experiences within each and every comment on voat.

            I haven't seen anything that I can trust that shows anything bad about this family. I trust the provenance of the Alefantis instagrams, and that's about it. He's hugging his daughter in one picture and we were supposed to think he was doing something horrible. Alefantis probably threw a bunch of beads and necklaces on them so that he could take the picture to amuse his pedo friends/followers. You really should demand better evidence before implicating this family.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the family might have had a falling out with Alefantis because they didn't appear in the later posts of Jimmy Comet. JA himself might be pushing a narrative against them for revenge against a former business partner and using these forums. Just saying it's possible.

             I understand the need to be very careful. The last thing anything about this investigation needs is to be discredited by any of our opinion gone wrong. I will tell you what has stuck with me about this tunnel in the rabbit hole.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a photo of Caris James at Comet Ping Pong &amp; Pizza. She is taped to a table. Very expertly taped to a table.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the revent interview of James Alefantis on Megyn Kelly, this photo was brought up as evidence of how crazy peoples accusations were. James Alefantis dismissed this as being just fine because he had her parents permission to post it. 'She is my God daughter' he even claimed.  He described the backstory. Caris and her sister were playing and her sister taped her down. This was explained on national tv in a very important interview meant to prove this mans innocence.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a problem in this. It is not possible under any conditions that Caris was taped down by a child. So why the elaborate lie? If the explanation was innocent, why not give it? People lose custody of their children over far less than this. Who would take such a chance with their child?

             Thats funny, I also have not seen this family come out and defend these accusations as disgusting and false. They have kept awfully quiet for parent's whose child has been linked to a child sex ring and photo is plastered all over the internet. If that was MY child and I knew it wasnt true I would probably kill every single one of you

             I agree with you. I have said a few times that this mom may be innocent. But considering his friend does work for the project with the pedo symbols and he made coffins and lived in a state that doesn't require embalming etc. it is adding up to a few suspicious things that I think people need to be made aware of. If others can find more info, good.
