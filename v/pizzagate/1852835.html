So, I took a closer look.</em></p>
<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/ChildMindDotOrg/status/861200301663150082">recent tweet</a> indicates their connection with the World Health Organisation via Dr. David Nabarro.</p>
<p>In Dr. Nabarro\'s article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effective treatment is essential, and access to it. The World Health Organization has set some useful standards for depression care, based on the best evidence of what works, with a training programme that helps health workers treat people who are depressed. Treatment usually involves either a therapy based on talking and listening, or <strong>antidepressant medication</strong>, or a combination of the two. It can be remarkably effective, and can be provided by non-specialist health-workers following a short course of training.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did notice that Bloom mentioned her <strong>Prozac</strong> as well as meditation in her video for <em>children\'s</em> mental health. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Well, Dr. David Nabarro has a rather distinguished and interesting pedigree.  He is one of three candidates running for Director-General of the World Health Organisation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nabarro">According to wikipedia</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is a medical doctor, international civil servant and diplomat; who currently serves as Special Adviser to the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General on the <strong>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Climate Change</strong>. He is also leading the UN\'s response to the <strong>cholera epidemic in Haiti</strong> and previously served as the Special Envoy on Ebola.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/12/world-health-organisation-who-briton-ebola-haiti-worlds-most-powerful-doctor">The Briton vying to become the world\'s most powerful doctor</a></p>
<p>Yet, here\'s another not so benign article which includes the doctor: <a href="http://12160.info/profiles/blogs/journalist-files-charges-2">Journalist Files Charges against WHO and UN for Bioterrorism and Intent to Commit Mass Murder</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifically, evidence is presented that the defendants, <strong>Barack Obama</strong>, President of the U.S, <strong>David Nabarro</strong>, UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, David de Rotschild, banker, David Rockefeller, banker, George Soros, banker, Werner Faymann, Chancellor of Austria, and Alois Stoger, Austrian Health Minister, among others, are part of this international corporate criminal syndicate which has developed, produced, stockpiled and employed biological weapons to eliminate the population of the U.S. and other countries for financial and political gain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems that Dr. Nabarro actually comes from a prominent Jewish family in London.  <strong>He is related to the late conservative politician Gerald Nabarro who some suspect of being a pedophile : <a href="http://freedomtalkradio.co.uk/freedom-talk-radio/list-of-exposed-and-allegedrumoured-vip-child-sex-abusers-in-the-uk/">List of exposed and alleged/rumored VIP child sex abusers in the UK</a></strong> .</p>
<p>Gerald Nabarro MP is mentioned here again in this forum in relation to <strong>pedophilia and ritual abuse</strong>: <a href="http://poundhillnorthindependentcrawley.freeforums.org/establishment-firewalls-protect-the-paedophile-untouchables-t1126-350.html">http://poundhillnorthindependentcrawley.freeforums.org/establishment-firewalls-protect-the-paedophile-untouchables-t1126-350.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many cases of jewish blood ritual since the year 1290. One of Winston Churchil’s occult team Dennis Wheatley exposed this going on in W W II. Sir Anthony Blunt Jimmy Savile Margaret Hodge Vanessa Feltz and the Conjuror James Randi are among those who have been seen at black magic meetings, and it is alleged have partaken in child murders
The 60s MP Gerald Nabarro named the Jewish MP who pushed the homosexual agenda Leo Abse as having bragged in the commons of attending occult rituals.
It is known that Leo Abse was like Peter Mindyourson a mouthpiece into the public for Rothschild interests.
Rothschild it is said always leave an empty space at their dinner table in case the devil should come.
The bottom line is that with so many children going missing never seen again, they are going somewhere</p>

<p>.............................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Another interesting and controversial doctor associated with the Child Mind Institute, is co-founder <strong>Dr Harold S. Koplewicz</strong>.  Here he is with <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> at one of his galas:  <strong><a href="https://still4hill.com/2014/11/25/hillary-clinton-honored-at-child-mind-institute-gala/">Hillary Clinton Honored at Child Mind Institute Gala</a></strong></p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3068207/Experts-make-impassioned-plea-parents-focus-mental-health-s-revealed-17-1-MILLION-children-suffer-disorder.html">here, where he advocates putting children on medication</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'The most staggering thing is that more than 17 million children in the US have some kind of mental illness, and yet less than 35 per cent have received treatment,\' Dr Koplewicz explained, before noting that, in comparison, only seven million children in the US have a peanut allergy, \'and yet the majority of those children have all been treated\'. 
CMI\'s research indicates that a staggering 80 per cent of children with anxiety are not receiving any kind of treatment; similarly 60 per cent of those with depression are missing out on the necessary care, as well as 40 per cent of children with ADHD. </p>
<p>\'Some parents are also nervous about putting their children on medication, even when that has been proven to be the best form of treatment for certain disorders,\' Dr Koplewicz added, suggesting that some parents avoid seeking help for their children because they are nervous about the treatment options available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, some critics accuse him of <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2015/05/child-mind-institute-insists-its-mental-illness-numbers-are-real/">exaggerating the scope of the problem and being in bed with the pharmaceutical companies</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koplewicz was co-author of “Study 329,” which has been described by many commentators as an iconic symbol of <strong>pharmaceutical industry corruption of psychiatry</strong>. A legal settlement between GlaxoSmithKline and the US Department of Justice summarized that the final, highly influential journal article about the antidepressant Paxil’s effects on children “distorted the study results and gave the false impression that the study’s findings were primarily positive, when they were, in fact, primarily negative.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444301704577631591596516110">Are ADHD Medications Overprescribed?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And in this blog, Dr. Koplewicz\'s notorious previous \'ransom notes\' campaign is discussed and a possible connection to a eugenics program is mentioned: <a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/ransom-notes-and-autism-speaks-partners.html">http://autisticbfh.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/ransom-notes-and-autism-speaks-partners.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The repulsive attitudes expressed by Autism Speaks, BBDO, and Dr. Koplewicz do not represent the majority view. They do not speak for us. Rather, they speak for a tiny number of bitter, twisted New York elitists who feel angry and cheated about having children with disabilities in their otherwise glamorous families, and who are throwing a colossal temper tantrum and spewing their vicious prejudice all over the media.</p>
<p>They are a hate group, pure and simple. They share a hideous eugenic agenda with disgraced white supremacist James Watson, who has been praised on Autism Speaks\' website. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other aspect of this institute which may warrant further scrutiny is their commitment to sharing their data with other companies.  On their website they write about this without mentioning who exactly they are sharing the personal medical data of children with: <a href="https://childmind.org/our-research/big-data-and-open-science/">https://childmind.org/our-research/big-data-and-open-science/</a></p>
<p>Much more to be found here I\'m sure.</p>',

           And in this blog, Dr. Koplewicz's notorious previous 'ransom notes' campaign is discussed and a possible connection to a eugenics program is mentioned:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The repulsive attitudes expressed by Autism Speaks, BBDO, and Dr. Koplewicz do not represent the majority view. They do not speak for us. Rather, they speak for a tiny number of bitter, twisted New York elitists who feel angry and cheated about having children with disabilities in their otherwise glamorous families, and who are throwing a colossal temper tantrum and spewing their vicious prejudice all over the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are a hate group, pure and simple. They share a hideous eugenic agenda with disgraced white supremacist James Watson, who has been praised on Autism Speaks' website.

           One other aspect of this institute which may warrant further scrutiny is their commitment to sharing their data with other companies.  On their website they write about this without mentioning who exactly they are sharing the personal medical data of children with:

           Much more to be found here I'm sure.

            Fascinating post, as usual.  Dr. Koplewicz seems to be alarmed that 80% of children experience anxiety.  In this society, I think I would be more alarmed about the 20% who don't experience anxiety.  Anxiety is a normal response to abnormal and generally threatening situations. Is drugging the children the answer?  Is talk therapy the answer?  These methods have had mediocre success at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            The society that causes the anxiety needs to be healed, not the children who are exhibiting a normal response to an abnormal society (but they do need to be supported, but not by the people who ruined the society).
We re a selfish hedonistic society who uses children for its own egoic purposes.   The abuse of children is not limited to pedophilia; countless parents use their children for their own vanity as extensions of themselves.  They share their personal hysteria with their children and fail to be responsible for handling their own emotions.

            Great research.  Upvoat.  Random mention of Vanessa Feltz et al attending black magick meetings!  Do you have a source for this?
