<p>Why won\'t NYTimes check this? <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Kpym6K.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/Kpym6K.jpg</a> The NYT CEO headed BBC during the Jimmy Savile coverup? <a href="https://i.sli.mg/oA4Xp3.png">https://i.sli.mg/oA4Xp3.png</a></p>

<p>Let me explain why this is a perfect one-two punch:</p>
<p>It is stunningly visual, and Scott Adams has explained why Trumps use of visuals are memorable and persuasive. It doesn\'t read &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; because those wanted images look so EXACTLY like them. They <em>will</em> get spooked because it <em>is</em> spooky. They will get more spooked when they see it\'s all true. And they can verify all of <em>this</em> part of our massive web of knowledge without having to go to a single source that Facebook and Google tells them is fake and Russian.</p>
<p>It does <em>not</em> say &quot;pizzagate&quot;. Don\'t worry! When they start looking up what NYTimes and Snopes have to say about Podesta and McCann... it will be the NYTimes and Snopes bringing up all this other crazy shit about some pizza place and some Alefantis nobody (who??) when all they want to know is whether the authorities have actually weighed in one the stunning face matches. INSTEAD OF SEEING ALL THE CREEPY SHIT AND TRANSFERRING IT ONTO US AS CREEPY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS (shooting the messenger), THEY WILL HAVE TO TRANSFER IT ONTO THE NYTIMES OR THE PODESTAS. They will have a better chance of realizing that the NYTimes is putting forward the craziest possible strawman to distract deep analysis of all the evidence. They will see the term &quot;pizzagate&quot; and the door will be open for them to doubt the NYTimes a little bit and see where between the NYTimes and the crazy strawman the NYTimes has constructed the truth actually lies.</p>
<p>This tweet-sized bit is simple and fast for the lazy. It does <em>not</em> try to fit the gigantic amount of information we have uncovered into 10 points per image file in a set of 5 image files, with tiny subimages, with tiny text that brings up way too many individuals and often with no way to see what the sources are.</p>
<p>If they go to look up the wanted images, or the Thompson/Saville articles, they are able to easily find, from &quot;real news&quot; sources, that these images are, amazingly, legit. They don\'t have to go to some weird &quot;archive.is&quot; site that might be hacking their computer or hosting spoofs. They aren\'t looking at some obscure instagram image with no idea how it ties to anything and that could easily be fabricated in MS paint like so many tweet images are. They don\'t have to do a crazy amount of work to become spooked.</p>
<p>It\'s perfect because the images are stunningly obvious, and that opens up a moment of opportunity. It offers them the truth that sources like the BBC and NYTimes really do cover up heinous things. It has an extremely specific and legitimate demand (verify whether these are real wanted images in the McCann case) to a specific actor (NYTimes). It does not go into Alefantis, who is not famous. It does not go into even less well-known people and try to harass them. It can be verified by going only to left-wing mainstream media (the NYTimes itself actually wrote a pretty critical piece of Mark Thompson\'s role in the Jimmy Savile atrocity... before hiring him as CEO).</p>
<p>We need to get this in front of as many NEW eyes as possible: Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, paper printouts, murals, article comments at places that still have them, whatever. This is the wedge we should lead with to give us a much better time with new witnesses to all of this.</p>
<p>Attached to this conversation, we need to make this extremely apt SAT style analogy:
Jimmy Savile IS TO Mark Thompson AS Jerry Sandusky IS TO Joe Paterno</p>
<p>Savile and Sandusky both had charities that they used as fronts to rape children. Thompson and Paterno did everything they could to maintain plausible deniability while coverup operations were happening in their organizations, under their watch, even as pretty much everybody in the ran and file had an idea what was really going on, but were too afraid to speak up. And both atrocities went on far, far, too long. So move the discussion that way when you can.</p>
<p>Focus criticism specifically on the New York Times because it has been used so widely as &quot;proof&quot;. If someone brings up Snopes, tell them, truthfully, that Snopes did not fact check this image. If someone hostile shows you some debunking article, zero in specifically on this image (even if they mention McCann, like Snopes, they probably avoid this damning image, like Snopes) and ask why they haven\'t checked if these are real wanted images, and if so, followed that lead to the next step (perhaps establishing their whereabouts on that day, or seeing what Podesta emailed on or before those days).</p>
<p>This is going into too much detail, but for example\'s sake, if they get to the point where they say &quot;well it\'s supposedly two different images of the same person&quot; you can truthfully say &quot;well maybe they thought it was one person but it was two closely related people&quot; or &quot;well maybe it\'s one other other, the Podestas should just establish their whereabouts thenâ€“what do the emails from then say?&quot; Then they might put the WikiLeaks emails in order of being written and get further spooked. Let them stumble on the art collections for themselves so they blame the creepiness on the <em>Podestas</em> and don\'t transfer it to <em>you</em>. And so on.</p>
<p>Futhermore, let Breitbart and the pro-Trump media, and any media, stay silent if they want until January, since nothing can be done with the current DoJ anyway. Let Trump talk soft on the Clinton camp so it doesn\'t look like a witch hunt and Obama doesn\'t get too scared and pardon. <strong>We are baiting the hostile coverup media into a trap.</strong> We will focus this meme first and foremost on the NYTimes.</p>
<p>But... Snopes, WaPo, and anyone else that wants a piece of us, that tries to gaslight us or marginalize us, that dares to smear us for fighting for the the victims of the worst cruelty our species has to offer, they can <em>molon labe</em>. The media figures (and do make this personal when you can) that have abused us are in a lose-lose situation. I truly believe they have already lost. But the longer they wait to step back onto the right side of history, the deeper they will be buried on judgement day.</p>
<p>Let this meme be the tip of the spear for our operations into neutral / enemy territory. I don\'t really know much about how to navigate those places without getting shadow banned or spam banned, but we need people who know that or are ready to learn and execute.</p>
<p>And of course, keep doing all the other great things you are doing. CARITAS IN VERITATE.</p>
<p>P.S.: Here are some extra credit opportunities:</p>
<p>We\'re gonna have to slightly switch up images from time to time anyway so if someone wants to add to the wanted image meme a shot of the article heading / source that they\'re from that would be a good improvement.</p>
<p>And there are at least three more damning articles about how Thompson protected Savile that could be worked into the other image.</p>
<p>Might want to use &quot;imgur&quot; sometimes, alas, just because people probably trust it more?</p>',

            I like this. The resemblance really is uncanny and I didn't want to look into this when it was first brought up because it seemed too "out there" wacky but again the connections are just too coincidental. Why haven't any of the news stories picked this up? You would think they would use this especially to show how loopy our theories are but they don't because it's too damning.
