<p>Here is a photo of a random child, who coincidentally has bags under her eyes.  She is holding up a number 60.   (Most of the photos I scrolled through were food photos so this jumped out at me.)

            Anybody digging into pizza places' social media, please check out "100 Pizzitas" in Austin (potential pedo hotbed).

            This pizza joint is a community partner with

            Melaney Parker was affiliated with Safe Austin before mysterious suicide (did she learn something she shouldn't have?).

           <p>
            Austin is also the home of NAMBLA and Stratfor....the same Stratfor where employee email (from Wikileaks) talked about a headcount to see how many people would be sharing a slice of pizza:

             I checked out their website, but didn't see anything suspicious. But the fact they're in Austin, where there's such a high population of jewish satanist pedos and shitty "punk" bands of loser "musicians" with zero talent, makes me suspicious, and I would say warrants further scrutiny.

            Also Pizza Ranch is another place, the founder is a convicted pedo who molested 15 employees at pizza ranch, he got 10 years and a judge let him off after serving 5 and vacated his sentence so hes not even a registered sex offender.  I made a thread about it but it didn't go anywhere.
