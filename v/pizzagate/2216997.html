            Yeah, the forums are a great source of info. KS is a perv. He can try to explain it away, but all signs point to "Pedo"!!!!

            But according to Corey Feldman #pizzagate is false so this must not be true. Right, Corey? How's the fundraising for that movie you're working on coming? Decide how to spend it yet?

            "I have heard KS rumors since the mid 1990's (pre-Internet) and all of these corroborated storied in here make me beleive that the ancient rumor about him stealing Bryan Singer's twink piece on the "Usual Suspects" set. He also didn't even try to explain away the pictures of him grasping some Croatian twink a few years back. Don't expect him to leave Europe anytime soon. He can chase after any dude he wants away from the tabloid glare"

            "I know a guy who knew a guy who was a friend of a friend of a waiter at Applebees where Kevin came in &amp; ate one evening. He said Spacey was eyeing him from his table all evening. Anyway, this guy was taking a break, nursing his diet mountain dew, and turned his back for 1 minute. He woke up in the restroom, having blacked out, &amp; there was Kevin arms outstretched, blocking the stall's exit. "I'm gonna rape you!" Spacey said menacingly. My friend screamed, "RAAAAAAPE!" and Kevin said, "I slipped you a roofie! It's 2:00 AM!" He then turned around, dropped his pants and said, "Besides, in Spacey no one can hear you scream!" It was terrifying to the poor guy. He never recovered. Kevin Spacey is an evil man!"

            The chick in the apartment next to me used to do PR work for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and told me they were having an annual charity dinner and she had an extra ticket so I decided to go for a free meal. There were a few B-list celebs there. I go to the bathroom and step up the the 3rd urinal from the right because there was a really short person on the 1st one and a tall one at the 2nd. I try to start peeing but I get nervous when there are other men in the restroom so it was taking a while. So, I hear the person next to me say "I'll show you mine if you let me suck yours." And I look over and the guy's head is turned, and I look at the 1st person and it's a kid about 12 years old who just looked shocked. So, the 2nd guy looks at me and it's YouKnowWho who gives me his trademark smirk/chuckle, then looks back at the kid and says "Come on, let me suck the cancer out of you." The kid ran out of the bathroom - without even washing his hands!! #2 looks at me and says "Kids have no sense of humor." I still hadn't peed, but decided to leave. (We're all making these stories up, right?)

            Damn. Quite a link.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Anyway, we all ended up back at the Hilton Garden Inn where JoAnne was staying, drinking from a case of Michelob Light that Joan had brought in, when who showed up but "K.S." himself. He immediately made a fool of himself all over my friend, who was already feeling a bit woozy from three Mickey Lights and a shot of the butterscotch schnapps Dame Joan always kept in her purse. Well, "K.S." offered to walk my friend back to his room, and that was the last we saw of him that evening!
           </p>
           <p>
            Weeks later, I ran into my friend and he said he'd awoken with a stabbing pain in his rectum, as if he was being violated without lubricant. He attempted to scream, but realized there was a wet rag stuffed in his mouth. Groggily he rolled over on his side to find Dame Joan Plowright violently sodomizing him with a strap-on black dildo, grunting like a feral pig in heat!
           </p>
           <p>
            It was years after that when I ran into JoAnne at the bar at "21" and she confirmed the story... La Plowright's dressers were well aware of her penchant for wearing sex toys strapped under her stage costumes. JoAnne said "Plowright" was actually a playful nickname given to her by the late great Sir John Gielgud.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I guess this story doesn't have much to do with "K.S." after all. But I hear he can sure be mean!"
