<p><strong>Michel Rosoor</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name Michel Rosoor is very interesting. He was quoted in the file of the CRIES by Weber who said to send him videos, but was never worried in this case. He fled before being arrested (to) appear in brothels in Brussels (later?).</p>
<p>Before that, when CRIES case, the cops learned that Rosoor had a business of exotic fish which allowed the transit of quantities of cassettes (for?) pedophiles. In the 70s and 80s, Rosoor was probably protected, since it was he who provided the children for sex in the Brussels region.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Jean-Marc Houdmont</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean-Marc Houdmont, a filmmaker who went into the exotic fish trade, was also questioned during the CRIES investigation because his name was included in the network\'s address book. </p>
<p>He was also involved in the case of the disappearance of Elisabeth Brichet, because he lived next door and was already known for his pedophile activities. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Houdmont is one of those many (26?) witnesses who died before testifying in the Dutroux case, in a car accident in February 1997. 
While he had been calling the cops the day before, (to) make revelations. As there was no sign of braking, the conclusion was that it was suicide. Both the fathers of Houdmont and that of Dutroux lived at the same time in the same village of Congo. Houdmont was suspected of trafficking in porno-pornographic images, such as those in his cottage, set on fire in 1990. 
 &gt;
Besides the pedophile, Jean-Marc Houdmont, who was in the business of exotic fish, Nihoul, had a box of fish wholesaler that allowed to travel between Antwerp and Brussels.</p>
