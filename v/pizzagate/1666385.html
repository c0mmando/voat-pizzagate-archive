            You misinterpreted me. Of course I concur with you, but if you believe in providence you have to accept that evil has a presence in the world in spite of same, at least for a time, and for a reason which we cannot fully understand, yet. But it is not so difficult to make the argument that providence might have a hand in revealing the depths of the evil of the deep state at this particular time in world history.

            I didn't bother watching that video because it in no way pertained to anything with pizzagate or pedogate. I'm glad you did though, sicko. you clearly are projecting your sickness onto me. I don't get any feeling of adrenaline from those videos. you're fucked if you do. i get a great sense of despair that makes me want to break down and cry and find everyone involved and hold them accountable. you're sick, dude.

            it very well could be Podesta, but anyone stupid enough to believe that weirdo on that site deserves what they get. making black and white claims on both sides when neither have concrete evidence of the identity of the man doesn't do any of us any good.

            I agree. I even think the videos can be easily fabricated. What folks forget is that what you see and what you hear don't necessarily have to be the same thing. The video could be from one source, but it's so vague it's almost meaningless without the context of the audio. The audio could be from another source, or more likely, 2 different sources. Anyone with a taste for the macabre and a bit of video and audio editing skills could make a video that'll make you want to contact the fbi.

             By that reasoning, all video evidence ever collected, or ever will be collected, is invalid, which is preposterous. There are ways to discern whether digital information has been manipulated or fabricated. Sometimes the methods are analytical, and other times they are qualitative, based on experience and intuition. My intuition is telling me something about these videos.

            As a brand new VOAT member, and as someone who has followed PG very closely from the time that the Madelaine McCann suspect posters matching TP/JP were noted and the Wikileaks/Podesta/pizza-code story really took hold in the alternative media, I have to disagree. There are a number of details that appear relevant and cannot be dismissed out of hand. There are three key videos found on one very obscure website. The three key videos contain extremely violent and criminal behaviour toward a child or children. In one video the child clearly says the name John. In two videos the voice is extremely similar to that of JP. In the last key video, the name "Skippy" is spoken by someone in close proximity to a child being tortured/smothered with a garbage bag. Skippy is a well verified nickname for JP. Some have said they can't hear it in the video. Neither did I for the first 30 or 40 listens, and then I heard it. If you cannot hear it, I say persist in your listening until you can. Once a listener locks onto it, it's unmistakable, and it's "Skippy" period. In one of the videos, the arm of the perpetrator is clear, and it's virtually a perfect match to JP's physique.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it is just a coincidence that one random website - which would have never even been discovered by a PG researcher were it not for providence or someone's design - harbors three child torturing videos with various clues leading to JP, then it is a thoroughly remarkable instance of coincidence.

            I don't think it's related to pizzagate, but an employee wrote some long post to someone questioning them and it basically made it sound like they stumbled across this sick shit when they worked with a certain group of guys and are now leaking it. We have absolutely no concrete evidence that it is Podesta in those tapes, but it's quite a strange coincidence and very well could be him just by happenstance of being involved in pedophilia in the Northeastern US where all of this stuff seems to be coming from. in that fatherhood video, you get a shot of the guy's arm who is holding the broom and his arm is pale and skinny like what Podesta's arm would like if it was him. I care about busting all pedos, not just those that further political goals or are in the gov't. the connections are flimsy as of now, but it's our duty to investigate all of this stuff instead of prematurely going "hurr, durr, it's a troll and you guys are wasting your time." the people claiming that it was shot in comet ping pong and that is john podesta spouting out his name in the video did a disservice, but ffs the site has legit child abuse videos being uploaded to it still as fresh as 36 hours ago which shows a child being suffocated with a black trash bag. if you want to ignore that stuff without debunking it, why are you here? do you really care about pedophilia and stopping it? why don't you do the right thing and debunk it as fake instead of making threads playing this occam's razor game with something so sick and serious? what does that do for anyone?

            I can't say for sure the name that is being yelled so to me it is important because it is a peek into the types of abuse used to create MPD/DID in a child. Reading is one thing, seeing is another, even if this is considered the most tame type of abuse and is "faked".
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping them confined in a small space/cage, perhaps with insects or some animal, using cold or hot water, flashing lights, yelling, etc. They may even be on drugs at the time to make the experience more extreme. They do this to try and keep the child in a disassociative state.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can say for sure is that what that child was experiencing was real, doesn't matter if it was a "prank" to the recorder or those involved, and based on what we know about MKULTRA/MONARCH programming, there are signs of the same methods being used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best case scenario, it is "fake" and not a real look into someones active ritual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Worst case scenario, this is some leaked video involving real ritual abuse. Maybe this is the tamest one that they could reasonably release obscurely like this.

            A lot of 'investigative protest' surrounding the video... Seems odd tbh
           </p>
           <p>
            Also recall someone going into some dark web chat room, perhaps from website of world corp, where moderator admitted it was Podesta. Tie that in with name identifiers and audio similarities and you have yourself a weapon to fight shills with.  Obviously created a positive reaction on social media for the overall battle.

            Agreed when it comes to tying this directly to Pizzagate... until there is solid evidence linking this to something related, it's a garbage repository of nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            However... the videos that seem to depict children being yelled at and abused should STILL be investigated by authorities. Even if this is a "hoax" - that is not a safe environment for a child. You can't dismiss that kind of torment. And if it was a hoax as you are claiming, it should be easily explained and the child should be totally safe.
           </p>
           <p>
            While it may not be worthy/linkable to PG, it should not be ignored.
