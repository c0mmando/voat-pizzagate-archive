            Gab.ai is allowing all conversations about pizzagate. In fact, the last time I was on the platform, the #pizzagate tag was a fixture in the left sidebar. Gab prides itself on being anti-twitter with no censorship (#SpeakFreely is their motto). It is one place to share info, but the Gab family is well-informed about pizzagate. Preaching to the chior. I try to be strategic and sneak in tweets on Twitter with the #pizzagate tag, comment in all comment sections like Breitbart, zerohedge, etc. You can leave links and reach a lot of people doing that. Seems that others are doing the same thing. Seems to be working.

             I joined Gab as well when they started all the banning on Twitter last week or so.  Most of the people on there are already wise.  Wanting to figure out how to break this so WIDE OPEN that there is NO WAY they can shut it back up.

             If we can get all the sheeple to wake up - just for an instant - this could change the course of it.

            I remember back to FBIAnon's posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            He mentioned memes over and over again. I've talked about it before, but I think he has solid points. He mentioned Twitter and Tumblr were good places to "invade".
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to start screaming this everywhere we can.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook is an echo chamber, I've tried over and over again to post things concerning PizzaGate and they all get buried. Sometimes removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if we could find a way around the censors, get people to move away from Facebook and start talking about it, I think we can blow the lid off this.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's gaining traction. There has never been a better time to act

             Memes.  Will think on that tonight.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of my circle are main-stream conservative or left leaning...
            </p>
            <p>
             But I'm a graphic designer and they are used to me posting quotes / images / etc...
            </p>
            <p>
             Get a picture of a cute puppy...  or maybe a spicy S&amp;M bear or SOMETHING to make them look ...
            </p>
            <p>
             I do remember FBIAnon preaching about memes and the guys were on it with all the pepe memes (which I found amusing but don't understand - maybe I'm too old)...
            </p>
            <p>
             Will think on it and see what I can come up with that will have mass appeal.  Thanks for the reminder.
