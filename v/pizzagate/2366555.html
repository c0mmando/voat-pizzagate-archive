The truth is crimes against children does not start and stop with the Podesta/Clinton/Mossad/Epstein/Brownstone/Deep State realm. They may have used the &quot;coded&quot; language but the operation has been in full swing since way before they rose to power.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, <strong><a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Aquino">Michael Aquino</a></strong> was a <strong>Psychological Warfare Specialist in the US Army from 1968 until 1990<strong>, when he was i</strong>nvoluntarily discharged as a result of investigations into his involvement in the ritual sexual abuse of children at the Presidio Day Care Center in San Francisco</strong>. Throughout this same time, he has also been a devout satanist and self-confessed neo-Nazi. He joined Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan in 1969, staying until 1975 when he left to start his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set">Temple of Set</a>, which has been in operation ever since.</p>
<p>Below are some claims related to Aquino and the abuse of children. <strong>I am continuing to verify, link and fact-check these claims, but I think most of you will find the collection of allegations interesting</strong>. Important to note that last year, a man named <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3845622/British-conspiracy-theorist-dead-sofa-Poland-investigating-alleged-Army-pedophilia-ring-just-death.html">Max Spiers was murdered</a> looking into Aquino\'s history. &lt;-- Be warned, once you enter this rabbit hole, it\'s hard to find your way out! ;)</p>

<strong>1980</strong> – According to sworn testimony given before a US Senate in later years, a woman named <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Brien_(conspiracy_theorist)">Cathy O’Brien</a></strong> claimed that she was programmed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino. She stated that Aquino used barbaric trauma techniques on both her daughter Kelly and herself that involved NASA technology. Cathy O’Brien claimed that she was a ‘presidential model’ Monarch sex slave, specially programmed to cater to the sexual perversions of the highest-ranking politicians in the USA. She stated that during her time as a sex slave (which started as a child), she serviced a number of well-known politicians, including both <strong>Bill and Hilary Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Pierre Trudeau, Brian Mulroney, George H.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Governors Lamar Alexander and Richard Thornburgh, Bill Bennett, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Robert Byrd (who she says was her handler) and Arlen Spector</strong>.

Years later, during an interview with private investigator Ted Gunderson, child abductee and sex slave victim Paul Bonacci revealed that, as a child, he was directly involved in Gosch’s abduction, having acted as a lure to draw Gosch into the hands of his pedophile abductors. According to Bonacci, the abduction was ordered by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, who later picked Gosch up at a farmhouse he was being held at and delivered him to a buyer in Colorado. For years, <strong>both boys were used for the pedophilia pleasures of high-ranking government officials</strong>.</li>

<strong>1986</strong> (November) – Allegations emerged regarding <strong>sexual abuse being perpetrated at the US Army’s Presidio Child Development Center in San Francisco</strong>. Within a year, at least 60 victims were identified, all between the ages of three and seven. Victims told of being taken to private homes to be abused, and at least three houses were positively identified, one of them being Aquino’s. Irrefutable medical evidence documented the fact that these children were sexually abused, including five who had contracted chlamydia, and many others who showed clear signs of anal and genital trauma consistent with violent penetration. Both Lt. Col Michael Aquino and his satanist wife Lilith were positively identified by victims as two of the perpetrators. At least one victim was able to positively identify Aquino\'s home and describe with uncanny accuracy the distinctively satanic interior of the house. <strong>Only one person was ever charged for the abuse of one child, and these charges were dismissed three months later</strong>.</li>

<strong>1987</strong> (November) – The US Army received allegations of <strong>child abuse at fifteen of its day care centers and several elementary schools</strong>. There were also at least two other cases at Air Force day care centers, and another one at a center run by the US Navy. In addition to these, a special team of experts were sent to Panama to help determine if as many as ten children at a Department of Defense elementary school were molested and possibly infected with AIDS. Another case also emerged in a US-run facility in West Germany. These cases occurred at some of the most esteemed military bases in the country, including Fort Dix, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Jackson, and West Point. In the West Point case alone, by the end of the year, fifty children were interviewed by investigators. There were reports of satanic acts, animal sacrifices, and cult-like behavior among the abusers. <strong>An investigation led by former US Attorney Rudolph Giuliani produced no federal grand jury indictments. His investigation concluded that only one or two children were abused, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary</strong>.</li>

<strong>1988</strong> (November 4) – The FBI raided the <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/18/us/a-lurid-mysterious-scandal-begins-taking-shape-in-omaha.html?pagewanted=all">Franklin Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska</a>, run by a man named Lawrence King</strong>. In the process, they uncovered evidence relating to <strong>drug running, pedophilia, pornography, and satanic activity involving prominent individuals in the local community</strong> and beyond. Eighty children eventually came forward and identified many of those involved, including the chief of police (who impregnated one of the victims), a local newspaper publisher, a former vice squad officer, a judge, and others. The children described satanic ceremonies involving human and animal sacrifice. Evidence that came out showed that children were abducted from shopping mall parking lots and auctioned off in Las Vegas and Toronto. <strong>Airplanes owned by the DEA were often used to transport the children. Other children were removed from orphanages and foster homes and taken to Washington, DC to take part in sex orgies with dignitaries, congressmen, and other high-ranking public officials</strong>. A number of the child victims testified that <strong>George Bush Sr. was one of the people who was often seen at these parties</strong>. <strong>Photographs were being surreptitiously taken at these orgies by the child traffickers for blackmail purposes</strong>. The key investigator in the case, Gary Caradori, was killed when his private plane mysteriously exploded in mid-air while en route to delivering evidence to Senator Loran Schmit. His briefcase went missing from the wreckage. This was the first of many deaths of people attempting to uncover this politically connected satanic cult/sex slave/drug trafficking ring. <strong>The Discovery Channel made a documentary about this case, entitled ‘<a href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-franklin-cover-up/">Conspiracy of Silence</a>’, but at the last moment, a group of unidentified US Congressmen paid them $500,000 to not air it, and all copies were destroyed (one copy survived). Republican senator John DeCamp, who was on the investigative committee, wrote a book exposing the case, titled, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">The Franklin Cover-Up</a></strong>.</li>

            David Shurter claims that Michael Aquino was his handler, and also wrote a book about the ritual abuse he endured,  in which he mention Aquino.

            1987 (August 14) – As part of the Presidio investigation, a search warrant was served on the residence of Lt. Col. Michael Aquino and his wife Lilith, and numerous videotapes, photographs, photo albums, photographic negatives, cassette tapes, and address books were confiscated. Also observed during the search was what appeared to be a soundproof room that may have been used as a torture chamber.  II Read about this raid and wondered if the raid was done to destroy evidence of others in those videos and tapes.  Nothing came of any of it.  Possibly eradication.  If people think that someone with the initials WB is not involved in any of this business in Omaha, they are sadly mistaken.

            When we brought him up at length here a lot of us started having really wicked dreams involving him and episodes of negative thought accompanied by mental images of Aquino. The whole "psy-powers" stuff seemed retarded to me until I was affected by him. And trust me, i know it still sounds like a bunch of hocus pocus but I have experienced it along with some other members here. It is real although I doubt it has any real control over a victim other than a "two way radio" effect in which he communicates negative images into the victim. I'm sure that could be highly detrimental to someone who is unaware of the methods employed by Aquino however I was aware of his research long before pizzagate arose. I just didn't believe it. After I noticed he was in my head I started sending back images of his demise and it stopped. It seems Aquino doesn't like when his victims don't remain victims and he cowers away. Typical of his ilk, hence the abuse of kids.

            Robert Wadman was the chief of police in Omaha who impregnated Alisha Owen.
When investigator Gary Caradori picked up highly incriminating photos from the photographer, Rusty(?) Nelson in Chicago which was prima facie evidence of extensive, blackmailing pedophilia as Nelson himself was the photographer, Caradori's plane exploded in midair above Aurora, IL,  killing Caradori and his young son.
The onboard photos were never recovered as the-then police chief of Autora was none other then Wadman.

            Funny how all of David Shurter's videos got taken off YouTube, and now all you can find is videos defaming him. He went in-depth on Aqunio's handling of him over a series of multiple, in-depth videos. Oh but you can still find that interview with Michael Aquino and Sean Stone, Oliver Stone's son, though. That's still on YouTube. I read MindWar. This guy is probably a 'superhero' to the elite.

            HUGE RED FLAG in regards to Max Spiers 'Last Interview' in it he discusses Michael Aquino.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/0-4KrCzit1o?t=9m20s">
             Max Spiers-'The Last Interview'
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He states that he is some sort of dark entity in the "Astral Plane" and he is a very negative being that thrives on human energies
           </p>
           <p>
            Max states that there would be a showdown soon between them...he dies days later after the interview.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Aquino is most likely at the top of the pyramid  because of his perceived usefullness of mind warfare tactics ....a trickster amongst tricksters .... be strong in spirit and of faith!! THIS type of being is where evil lives,thrives ......don't let it thrive, have faith and walk in righteousness

             Max Spiers was fake. Nobody had heard of him. His act looked produced. He supposedly pushed alien nonsense and was killed by "Black goo". The interview with Aquino looked like a setup to make Satanist look like silly larpers, but harmless. But here is a CIA agent and Colonel in the US military, with a cape and Dracula looking Satanist outfit, obviously something is not right. Gunderson acted like he had no evidence, when that is not possible. Whenever the question was asked "where is the evidence", each asnwered, "there is no evidence because....." We have more eveidence than them? He never mentioned the myriad of stories like Dutroux or other high progile events in opther countries? And anything on TV is one of their productions. This was staged to make the aligations look baseless and the accused look goofy and harmless.

              What? Your all over the place with that response....Max Spiers is fake because he pushed alien nonsense?? Maybe so Matybe No.... but there are things he states in the many interviews online that ring true to me. Also, aren't most "Alternative News" sources infiltrated by cult members anyways? 
Which Interview with Aquino? 
Who brought up Gunderson?
             </p>
             <p>
              His death was staged? I don't know? What did seem odd was the announcement of his death all across MSM 3 months after his death NOW THAT seemed staged

              You’re welcome! Simple browser search. Archive results show up with everything else. I use this:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                site:voat.co/v/pizzagate search term
               </strong>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This post was the result of Googling:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                site:voat.co/v/pizzagate aquino

             <p>
              Results vary depending on the search engine. I tried to stop using Google, but I go back because it’s better, imo. So, if we don’t get the pedos out of all these positions of authority, they’ll probably be coming to take me away someday. 😳

             don't stop sending that mental image to him. That is the essence of his "Psy-war" and it most ceertainly can be used against him. There are very limited number of him and hordes of us.  I'm sure if we used his "powers" against him we could get him to off his self.... never thought I would be talking about shit like this but it really is some stranger than fiction, out there type shit.

            Yeah, this guy really weirds me out. It bothers me that a high level satanist has been accused so many times; black magic poster boy; with so many connections to scandals; a direct source of MKUltra stuff... He IS pizzagate, out in the open, untouched and able to continue his sick activities with complete impunity. I read somewhere that he has gained a noble title and castle in Scotland. Also, there is a weird connection to an old game like D and D, about vampires. A particular group of vampires was called The followers of Set, and they were all about black magic and mind control. I have wondered a lot recently if somebody close to him started larping details that mirror his reality... sorry to make a huge comment. Just saying that this guy needs more exposure.

             Cathy O'Brien's mutilated vagina is viewable to any lingering skeptics on the "Cathy O'Brien gynecology exam" utube. 9 minute mark is when she is being examined and carved face on vaginal wall is clearly seen.

               Ugh.  That's why I like to read and not see.  Almost anything can be faked now.  Not that I don't believe her story, but I am sure there are people that will even discount that.  I don't know why someone would want to expose that part of themselves.  That is something you can never take back.  Very sad that they would feel they have to do that to make people believe.

                 I know.  I can't help thinking about her knowing what is out here about her.    I don't know how victim/survivors  can go on with their lives when they have to keep repeating it over and over.  I know that is part of the healing process but to have the whole world know......she is a warrior and has remarkable strength.

            Oh, absolutely.  But in terms of pizzagate, he is ancient history.  I have seen his name bandied about, though. But he is probably not a major player any more.

             I postulate that he is the reigning boss of the MK ULTRA shenanigans. If I’m right, that puts him in a position of immense power over all of the mind controlled zombies in the elites’ stables. Think about all of the stars that are suspected... and all of the unexplained deaths, Hollywood in general.

             Based on what? This sort of activity does not just rinse itself out of a person's soul. It is ingrained. Now that his free time is focused on his satanic temple he is likely to be more heavily involved.

             I disagree completely. He was hired and still working in the military under the Obama administration. He is a high level, if not the highest, level SRA/MKUltra trainer active today. He was even found to be on podcasts in his spare time spreading all kinds of satanic bullshit getting people to come together and unite under that shit. In addition, several people who called him out online on their websites were slapped with lawsuits as he threatens anyone who calls him out to remove it or be sued. I guarantee that if the above was posted on a private website he would threaten to have it removed or be sued. Since all charges were dropped he said he is presumed innocent.
