Monica was a State Dept. employee at the time who had security clearance for the position she held.   Monica\'s son was removed from her after a SWAT team arrived with CPS arriving an hour later.  The child was taken from Monica and placed in a foster home with two gay men.  <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/05/17/illinois-and-virginia-cps-conspire-to-steal-and-sex-traffic-children/">http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/05/17/illinois-and-virginia-cps-conspire-to-steal-and-sex-traffic-children/</a></p>
<p>I\'ve taken quotes from the following links to show the connections between the State Dept. , a Congressman\'s office, a Fairfax VA  child abduction, presumed threats and more.  
</p>
<p>&quot;Monika, a State Department employee with a security clearance, believes that she was politically targeted and this led to the seizure of her son. My investigation in this matter has revealed an acquaintance of Monika who has likely met with foul play, lends credence to her belief of being targeted for what someone thought she knew about child sex trafficking and elements of the U.S. government. Somebody thinks she knows more than she does because at the same time, this federal employee with no outside income was targeted by the IRS for an audit and the State Department began to drug test her. The operating hypothesis is based on the notion that this child abduction strategy was adopted in order to (use your imagination).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monika firmly believes that her son Dylan would be sex trafficked by now if it were not for our intervention. The evidence trail for Monika’s beliefs is pointing to Congressional involvement on both sides of this issue. I have been approached by whistle blowers with insider information which points to various nefarious activities in Virginia and other locations and these events are related to some very serious topics. The topics include state complicity in child sex trafficking and the suiciding of uncooperative witnesses.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Also within the article Dave Hodges reported that there had been a conference call meeting with 13 people in attendance.  Monika, her attorney and the Director of the Parent group Vocal were on the call.   During that conference call an unidentified person broke in and issued what could be considered a threat.  The unidentified source stated  &quot;Don\'t you know that the words you say can hurt you? &quot;   <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/07/16/update-on-va-mother-whose-son-was-kidnapped-by-the-virginia-cps/">http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2014/07/16/update-on-va-mother-whose-son-was-kidnapped-by-the-virginia-cps/</a></p>
<p>Here is a gofund me acct. set up for Dylan with some additional details:

<p>Dave Hodges posted that he was targeted after hosting his radio show and publishing the Wesolowski story.   Monika\'s attorney was also contacted by the Fairfax county, VA DA in regards to concerns the DA\'s office had regarding the radio broadcast about the case as can be seen here in the email that was sent to Monika\'s attorney:      
</p>
<p>&quot; Ms. Kramer,</p>
<pre><code>It is my understanding that you are representing Ms. Wesolowski. The Department would like to schedule a meeting with you and your client so that we can discuss the case and moving forward. The Department has some concerns about Ms. Wesolowski’s radio appearance this past weekend and would like to discuss that with you and your client. Please let me know when you and Ms. Wesolowski would be available for such a meeting. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to working with you.&quot;

<p>&quot;Congressman Frank Wolf (link has been scrubbed) formerly of the 10th District in Virginia is on the warpath against human trafficking. Congressman Wolf’s website used to contain numerous references to child sex trafficking in Northern Virginia, centering in Fairfax County.  Nearly every one of the links to legal actions against child sex traffickers, since I first published them in 2014 have been purged.</p>
<p>Just like the late Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer, the pedophile forces coalesced and combined forces to force Congressman Wolf from Congress. I believe that he is lucky to be alive. Schaefer, as you know was not so lucky, she was murdered to keep her research from going forward.&quot;   <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2016/11/30/pizzagate-traced-to-fairfax-county-virginia/">http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2016/11/30/pizzagate-traced-to-fairfax-county-virginia/</a></p>
<p>There are numerous other links within all the articles that are posted here but with time restraints I have not been able to pursue them further.  Perhaps other researchers would be willing to expand on this and dig in further.</p>',
