            I'm assuming Swatting means wasting your time engaging with shills, trying to point them out, and trying to get them to go away. Like swatting flies. It's just exhausts you and doesn't do anything.

            You know something, I believe there is a guy on Reddit that hit the nail right on the head. This is all about Globalists V Zionists, they were working together on the NWO but now something big has happened and they have fallen out catastrophically for them. The best of the two evils are the Zionists, but don't go dropping the ball because they are both here to fuck us up.

            It seems that someone who works for someone evil is being as bold and reckless as possible when hurting innocent pizza gate researchers. They also did this to me - posting my ex husband's personal information.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a really big story about SWATTING in the news a few days ago - some dude got shot and killed because some loser called cops and claimed he had killed someone inside his house.

            Very scary the lengths people will go to to try and intimidate lowly little forum posters on Voat... or the internet. It's like you guys haven't figured out that you're already above the law and you do not need to harass us for outing you, just call your little friend Hillary and have her issue you a pardon.

                This is on Voat's side. Up/down votes are internally tracked by IP address to make it more difficult to manipulate the system.

            David Brock is a sociopath with tens of millions of George Soros and Hillary Clinton dollars, who like also Gay Nick Denton, hunts down gay and mentally ill naive teen kids and convinces them to character assassinate others for his "cause". His cause is PizzaGate and Corruption so he needs to go to prison.

             Any links for that stuff. Not saying it isn't true but I'd love to have a source to save. Also, what happened to Brock, did he not just have a heart attack?

              I agree. Lauren Simonsen too. Looking back now, we can watch how jews swarmed the movement and started leading it. Its subversion. Many fell for it. Whites must tighten the circles.

            Sorry to hear about that.  We must all stick together and I commend you for coming out with this,  it is important to let all of us know when others are trying to plant disinfo about any of us.  I have noticed myself that there are many more shills on here lately and they are trying to undermine us and our research.  Beware and Keep Your Eyes Peeled.

              Yep, I saw someone use the term n^^^^^f^^^^^ in a comment here the other day, just trying to be as offensive/make us look as bad as possible. The MSM is using the same tactic re open borders, get a bunch of racist commenters on every forum so any legitimate criticisms/concerns are either drowned out or automatically labelled Islamaphobic, it's an annoyingly effective technique.

            man, i am so sorry to hear that. it's completely fucked up, but yeah, i think desperation is the defining word here. you're a brave soul to stand up to these people. just keep yourself safe in any way you can think of, because they are dangerous fuckers, as you know.

            Ad hominem  arguments and accusations. The closer you are to the truth the more the Saul Alinsky playbook is used against you. Everyone should read through this to better understand the enemy.

             as a targeted individual for the last 11 yrs., i can relate to that alinsky list of rules, because they use all of those tactics and more on me on a daily basis. they are evil to the core. i call the perps "empty psychopaths," or "empty meat suits!"

            You don't know what "swatting" is? It's when you call the SWAT team and make a false allegation against someone in order to get them raided by special forces. It is a criminal offense. They're trying to ruin our reputation by making us out to be lawless troglodytes.

              Unfortunately, swatting has become a trend of the more emotionally illiterate people of the world and isn't as small as you would hope. It would be an easy thing for media to pin onto autistic alt-right trolls, as they usually do.

               Thanks dude, that means more than you realize. I don't plan on giving up anytime soon.

               Also, i'd like to point out you can expect a shit ton of infiltrators on this sub in the next few weeks. In fact, i've seen an incrementl change in the tone of this sub over the last few months, to a partisan right leaning. Also lots of "anti pizzagaters" here, as you see on reddit, which is odd for this place.
              </p>
              <p>
               We think theres a huge PG crackdown on reddit, so it's safe to assume they're doing the same here. I think they're in the phase of trying to "wrap things up". Deemed it fake news, debunked, now they want to poison the well with anti jewish rhetoric, slurs, homophobia, and finally stamp this thing as done and over with so nobody ever takes it seriously in the future. Never let it happen.

                 If you were temp banned, it was by cloudflare, correct? I haven't heard of Voat's admin temp banning anyone, ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                 (To be completely clear, I've heard these complaints. But each single one was either 'rate limiting' by cloudflare's algorithm or simply 100% fabrication.

                 I think the time to double down may be now. Because they are certainly trying to "squash" this whole thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They think since it's been a year now, and some of the original investigators who were here at the inception have left, that they can brainwash any of the
                 <em>
                  new
                 </em>
                 PG'ers into dissing and dismissing key pieces of evidence that are largely accepted here and part of the investigation. They're trying to put out the fire for good.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And since they branded it fake news, anyone who googles it is lead to the orwellian google links of "debunked" and "fake news".
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's truly a well planned out censorship plot. We can't let this get buried and never spoken of again like the Franklin Credit Scandal.

                   Why not debate me on the issue of Jew-talk discrediting us?  I already debunked that: Jewish paper, article about Jews, interviewing Alefantis and mentioning pizagate.  Not one word about anti-Semitism; why not if it's so toxic

                  <p>
                   Obviously they're more afraid of more NORMIES becoming aware Jewish Ritual Sacrifice than anything, or they'd have mentioned it.

                   I saw your post on the mods sub and it made a lot of sense. You made a good case for banning him for good. Instead,
                   <em>

                   get my IP temporarily banned today and they will never ban donkey because crensch has the same warped opinion as donkey does.

                    Wouldn't it be great if donkey died in a burning car crash? More gruesome and brutal the wreck the better.

                    The best part is that because donkey is such a disgusting sociopathic piece of shit who's "proud to be an asshole", nobody would attend his funeral except maybe to piss on his grave.

                  They'll go after George Web before they go after the English royal family. They forget that Soros was a Nazi. And after that, they'll ignore that the big public elite players are not Jewish; Clintons, Podestas, the Kenyan, Merkel. The list goes on.

                    Oh, of course a high percentage of them are Jewish. I don't think I've ever said that I realise the high number of Jewish pedos is alarming and that someone being a Jew in a high up position makes it not unlikely that they're corrupt.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    However, when someone like Cernovich is actively destroying fake news and you try to discredit them just based on their faith, that is just blatant down syndrome and you need to find a professional in order to get the care that you need.

                   <p>
                    Also, the idea that Jews are "inherently" attracted to kids - that it's in their nature - is so fucking dumb that it should be a crime. Usually autism helps people come to the truth in this sub, but your emotional illiteracy means you instantly made a non-existant connection when you saw the pattern of corrupt Jews and just labelled them all that way. Maybe just dial the autism back a

             Sadly, I agree with this donk. Your apology at the end however was truly hillarious.

             You wouldn't even know that the Pegasus museum was part of the "kill room" without his video.

            <p>
             Also, I find it odd that a Pizzagate researcher is using random anti Jewish rhetoric and taking the word of Alefantis over one of your own.

              I am not convinced that Pegasus museum is used as a kill room. I don't know why they would chose such a location. Not saying I think it is out of the question. I don't believe the pizzagategear asshole. At all.

              Yeah I usually make sure to add my kill rooms to Google maps too.

              I find it odd that anyone whos spent any time on PG at all finds it "random" to connect thousands of years of ritual child sacrifice to Jews.  Maybe you should spend more time reading and less time "spotting shills."

                If you had read Mein Kampf or some actual scholarship you'd know that Jews have mostly controlled both since forever.  Unscrupulous greedy supremacists living along trade routes and distributed in every country is actually not very common.  That's a doozy of a comment you just made, might have to screenshot it.
