            This has absolutely nothing to do with pizzagate and Trump never mentioned anything about Bill that could even be construed to mean that he is a pedophile. Trump is talking about Bill's adult female rape victims. This should be obvious to everybody. Fucking idiots.

            So what do you make of the lawsuit brought by a woman who - with witnesses - says Trump raped her on Epstein's orgy island when she was a 13-yr old virgin? The case was settled out of court and obviously there would have been a rock solid gag order.

            Both were aired. The media danced around both and made different storylines out of each event. Everyone on the Trump train was following this, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example: Say Trump holds a press conference where he brings Clinton's accusers in - the media airs it. But then instead of asking the question, 'Are these credible' (which will only be asked if they can say 'no they're not), they will pose a different question such as 'Is it appropriate for Trump to be bringing these women in? Is it a sign of his unpredictability (or some negative quality),' and sidestep the issue of Clinton entirely.

            I think Azzipdoe could be another way of writing = (Alfantis - Azzi pedo)
azzip backwards is pizza. He has contributed NOTHING to VOAT - Click his name to see!!
He is definitely a shill, only posting negative comments on good names &amp; lead posts.

            Now that there are forums like this, you don't need to feel pressured to do a thing. Go with your gut. Read what you do. Research what you do. Comment. It is the little pieces of everyone working together like this that is truly leading somewhere. People like you that care about the truth have been badly needed for too long. So...keep up the good work and don't let it become stressful and turn you away.

            It also doesn't help that people IN the FBI are involved. I agree on the trust issue. I feel for Trump because he almost can't trust anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, as badly as I'd like to be wrong, I agree, this is not going to end soon. Anyone thinking Trump can just use bleachbit on them across the board without facing some serious legal backlash and possible impeachment...is smoking the good crack.

              What do you think? Azzipdoe could be another way of writing = (Alfantis - Azzi pedo)
azzip backwards is pizza. He has contributed NOTHING to VOAT - Click his name to see!!
He is definitely a shill, only posting negative comments on good names &amp; lead posts.

               Exactly i saw it also. Contributed himself nothing at all, only giving people a big mouth with negative comments.. Look at his comments, almost all really rude to people. Ofcourse sometimes things will be put here double. But he really attacks people.  Yes you could be right with that  Azzi pedo!

             I saw the question about suing answered elsewhere by someone apparently in the know.  He said it's very hard to prove a negative.  If you say "So-and-so molested a child on this date at this time at this place" then the accused can sue if, for example,  they have an alibi or if they have a video of said location which shows it was another person doing the crime.  But if you just say "He is a pedo" how does he prove he is not?  That he's dated adult women, married one, has never been accused of it before?  None of that is proof.

             That's always been David Seaman's contention: he's always calling out Podesta for being a pedocriminal, he's showing the world that he obviously has a case, or else Podesta would make a big deal out of his innocence and sue.

               This is true but defamation suits are also notoriously difficult to win when the person who is defamed is a public figure.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have to prove not only that the information is objectively false, you also have to prove that the publisher published the material knowing it was false OR published the material with a reckless disregard for the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               So you basically have to prove that they were malicious, and not just ill informed and stupid. Being wrong, ill informed, and stupid is basically a valid defense for publishing slanderous shit about people (when they are a public figure, anyway)

                I totally understand that it would be a tough battle to actually collect damages on.

                But making a public legal spectacle of it would in essence clear their reputation, regardless of exact outcome.

               Anyone who looks into the issue of pedo-gate/pizzagate takes the claims seriously - 
and actually very seriously -- !!
              </p>
              <p>
               However, MSM/CIA-corporate media aren't allowed to take the claims seriously -- 
they're under gag order.

               Because a lot of people take the claims seriously. The last poll I saw said 48% of Republicans and 25% of Democrats believed pizzagate is real, and I suspect independent-minded people are likely to be closer to the Republican number if not beyond it a bit. Perhaps that means 40-ish percent of Americans believe pizzagate is real. That's far from nobody, and the actual question is beyond "taking the claims seriously", which might be more like 50% or 60%.

                So could the slander/libel path be a course to flush them out? Publicly call out Clintons/Podestas as pedophiles everywhere we can and hope they take us to court. Get on the news, take out ads, paint graffiti and sign it. Do whatever it takes to get them to sue.

            If you have to swim in shark infested waters isn't it wiser not to bleed? Trump also slyly outed Epstein while seemingly paying a compliment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing you can't do anything about something, and biding your time until you can is one thing. Spending millions of your own money to get into a position to actually do it...that's something. If the Hillary investigation took years, why on earth are people expecting arrests this week? These people are serious heavy hitters. Right now they're ALL freaking out. Why is that do you wonder?

            That she defended a child rapist by trying to suggest the kid was "asking for it" was quite telling...
           </p>
           <p>
            But I think the 12 year old referenced here is the one where Hillary defended the rapist as defense attorney, and said rapist wasn't Bill. Still, I think it speaks to her psyche towards this sort of thing. She could probably permit elites to funnel trafficking through her foundation with the right rationalization.

             Hillary also lied in a sworn affidavit during that case.  She claimed to have been told the little girl that was raped had made false accusations in the past without ever naming a source.  She has no shame.

             For anyone who doesn't know the Kathy Shelton details, here is a pretty good article about it:
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3729466/Child-rape-victim-comes-forward-time-40-years-call-Hillary-Clinton-liar-defended-rapist-smearing-blocking-evidence-callously-laughing-knew-guilty.html">
              http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3729466/Child-rape-victim-comes-forward-time-40-years-call-Hillary-Clinton-liar-defended-rapist-smearing-blocking-evidence-callously-laughing-knew-guilty.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a youtube with the audio of Hillary laughing about the case:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tor00iWUhDQ">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tor00iWUhDQ
             </a>
             The audio is telling because it's a rare glimpse into one of these elites speaking about one of the "little people" and showing us how she really feels. Kind of like if the drive-thru people forget to charge you for your Big Mac and you get away with it.

              Yes, Barack Obama had multiple occasions where big black blowflies would come out of no where and land on his face. This happened even in the dead of winter. 
I had never known anyone who attracted flies like that guy. When Hillary had flies landing on her in the debates, it sickened me. WTF.
