<p>Based on the number of active Amber alerts, or amber alerts in which a child was found, it seems impossible for there to be as many missing kids as there supposedly are, without there being a huge lack of issuance of actual Alerts, unless this map is wholly inaccurate right now. Some of these go back to December and there aren\'t enough on the page to add up to 400,000 per year.</p>
<p>I also happened upon my state\'s Facebook page for DFPS which had a number of photos with stats on missing kids and human trafficking.They claim that the number of missing persons reports to NCIC per year in 2016 was something like 400,000. 
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/rMsul">https://imgur.com/a/rMsul</a></p>
<p>While it\'s apparent that many of the DFPS employees are well-meaning, we know from Senator Schaefer that CPS is a huge part of human trafficking. </p>
<p>This one photo (first in the album) <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rMsul">https://imgur.com/a/rMsul</a> struck me, if 3,000 kids go missing in Travis County in one year (Austin area) that this cannot match up to the global incident map referenced above, which may be incredibly inaccurate, but 3,000 still seems like a huge number of missing child reports for one county for one year. </p>
<p>Yet, it occurred to me that Travis County is a legit Sanctuary county, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/elcP0">https://imgur.com/a/elcP0</a> <a href="https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Sanctuary-Cities-Map-Full-Screen.html">https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Sanctuary-Cities-Map-Full-Screen.html</a> which means that the implications here could potentially be that a large number of these cases of human trafficking victims being detained, or alternatively offered services, and a large part of the motivation for DACA and wanting to protect dreamers and the entire LGBT / illegal immigration agenda being pushed by the Democrats might be due to the need to continue covering up who the trafficking victims are. If you de-legitimize there being anything wrong about being an illegal immigrant you will be able to blur the lines between what your motives are for helping them. Perhaps you really want to legalize them so they can stay in the US, perhaps so that you can allow them to call for help if their child goes missing, and perhaps so that you can do things like refuse to detain your illegals who haven\'t gotten citizenship, by doing things like saying that detaining them is unreasonably dangerous to them because they are LGBT. (I\'m not kidding, this was a part of the DNC 2016 platform see: <a href="https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/948970376830349312">https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/948970376830349312</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/948965053847437312">https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/948965053847437312)</a>). Fastest way to get cops to stop asking if you\'re legal or illegal or to stop ICE agents from investigating would be to imply that everyone who appears to be an illegal is on the 12 year path to citizenship and should be left alone. (See the Hegelian dialectic at work) </p>
<p>Nevertheless, with a large number of illegals in Travis County, it should still be easier to kidnap an illegal kid and traffick it, or to come into the country with kids you\'re claiming to be a part of your family who really aren\'t, because you\'re not going to be running around advertising your kid\'s birth certificate status as being from Mexico, or wherever, so you can much more easily hide behind your language barriers and illegal status in general. </p>
<p>Who would be noticed as missing less by the community than a child whose parents either 1) are illegal immigrants, where it is impossible for the parents to be able to obtain help in locating their missing kid without alerting authorities to their presence in the country illegally; or 2) children who are wards of the state (DFPS) or temporary foster children, whose real parents have no contact with them or very little contact with them?</p>
<p>Can others look into your state\'s stats on missing persons and missing children and see if they match up at all with the Amber alerts you can find out about? It seems to me like there is a discrepancy between the actual Amber alerts, and the incident reports on missing kids who aren\'t given an Amber alert for some reason. I found one story on that website the other day where the children were reported missing because mom took them when CPS was supposed to be coming for them. This would be considered a &quot;parental kidnapping&quot; as though the State\'s power of custody over the children is somehow superior just because they say so. Those children were not issued an Amber alert, but they were eventually found. </p>
<p>I assume CPS took them away because mom was &quot;acting psychotic&quot; or whatever, however that behavior wasn\'t enough to issue an Amber alert, just enough to get an incident report so the cops could go locate them and get them back into CPS care. </p>

             Silsby is a cog in the wheel. Ask yourself why n c me c gets very little attention around here. They say up front what they are. The national center. Missing and exploited? Sounds like pg to me esp when the national center has such an abysmal record given the money and connections associated with it both nationally and globally. After years of collecting all the kiddie porn they can find it’s still a growing and growing problem. Fancy that. And yet they continue to get millions and millions from our govt every year for their sub par work. But they’ve got a catalog of all those missing kids and every effed up video they can find. Nice... should be called ncpg.

              I agree. I am trying to start a hashtag #WhereAreTheChildren on Twitter, but since I'm shadow banned, it's pretty difficult to get real PG researchers to retweet me. My twitter is turning into more of an advance notice to pedos of what we find out about than it is of anything to get others to Retweet. Sadly... Silsby needs her own set of FOIAs going on right now, this is just getting ridiculous.

            The number is no longer 800,000 , that's a number from 20 years ago.  It's about 465,000.  This is reports of kids missing for any reason at all, even if they are found a few hours later.   So if a kid gets lost or injured on the way home from school and they don't arrive home at the expected time or they get lost at the mall, if the parents report the kid as missing, it's is part of these large numbers.  Kids who run away even for a night a part of these numbers.  In almost all of these 465,000 instances, the kid comes home.

              The 465 is the 2016 numbers.  The Polly Klass website points to the last public government study from 2003 that says these things.  They did another study, but have not published the results yet.

            I think some of those kids that they call Runaways may be in those holding cells as well.  All of this stuff scares me to death and worries me as to what they are doing to our children.  I believe there are all kinds of things that have happened to them, death, trafficking for sex, and holding them to exploit them for the elites or anyone willing to pay money.    Yes, as you say now the parents are categorized "acting psychotic" just because they want to hold on to their children.  I have read stories on Medical Kidnap about parents driving across country and trying to hide with their children.  Yes, there is a back story to many of them.  Check out the site.
