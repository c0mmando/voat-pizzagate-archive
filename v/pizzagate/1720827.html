            ohhh.... like.. the moose lodge... gross.   the logo looks like it's promoting gender neutrality.. all those lodges... shriners.. lions... rotary... key... they all seem sketchy.. reminds me of boy scouts of america..
           </p>
           <p>
            you should maybe consider putting a few lines about those concerns in another post about this.. make it a bona fide discussion..

            This site is such piece of shit for ideas.  No fucking brain trust or group thought possible inside this piece of shit website.    I've tried three times just to present the idea of looking at mooseheart under discussion and it always gets kicked back.   What's the fucking point of having discussion if you can't submis ideas to discuss.   Moose heart, look it up.  Look up fraternities that have children homes.  Don't be ignorant they're easy to start with like idiot drug dealers that think they can't be caught.  Everyone has a home for children.  I promise there's nothing good going on at any of them.

               All right, kingforpres, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't ignoring the submission guidelines because you're part of the CTR shill army that slammed us this week. (Don't believe me, look in the Removed Submissions area at the bottom of the sidebar. We've been removing posts as fast as we can all day long and have barely kept up.)
              </p>
              <p>
               In order to satisfy the submission guidelines for
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               research posts, you need to state a premise in your headline that accurately describes your topic and why it's important to the sexual abuse and trafficking of kids by the global elite (Pizzagate, as defined in the sidebar). You then need to provide links supporting every claim you made. Some of this can be hypothetical, but there must be some reasons you can demonstrate it may be true. It can't be purely speculative (we have a separate sub for that --
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               ).
              </p>
              <p>
               Now...you must have some reasons you suspect there is a problem with this organization. So, put those forward, with links to the supporting source material.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you don't have any reasons to suspect them that you can link to, then this isn't the place to post. You can go to our
               <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#voatpizzagatemain:matrix.org">
                chat room
               </a>
               on Riot to discuss it live with other researchers. You can post in
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               or

               . Or, you can post in the comment area of any thread on this board; that is totally fine and we encourage it.

               Why do we have these pain-in-the-ass rules?
              </p>
              <p>
               Voat is rabidly anti-censorship. Mods are not allowed to "curate content". All we are allowed to do is remove submissions that don't comply with the sub's mission-critical submission guidelines, which were developed and agreed upon by the community to allow us to remove at least SOME of the copious shitposts dumped here every day by those who want to shut down the conversation and undermine the investigation. However, we have to enforce them consistently or face censure by Voat. If shills make a post that meets submission guidelines, we have to leave it up. If legit users make a post that fails to meet the guidelines, we have to remove it. Everything else gets sorted out by up or downvoats and user comments. That's the system we have to work with. It's clunky, but Jack Dorsey, Jeff Bezos and Spez aren't going to suppress important information here, either.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hopefully, I've answered your questions. If no, please let me know what is still confusing. We want you to post your research, or post enough raw material and explanation of why you think it's important to get others discussing and researching. But you need to do it in a way that meets the submission guidelines. Thanks!

                Dude I don't see the side bar on my phone when I'm at home.  I know this place gets blown up all the time and it's bullshit.  It's just frustrating when you think you're doing things correctly trying to type on a damned phone and spend forever only to have it kicked back.  I realize there are protocols for how to submit posts but some of those posts are literally just a link to a picture and nothing else.  I get that you have to go through and find them to remove them and I wouldn't want your job.  I apologize for the heavy stance I had just finished a board meeting and had a few drinks more than normal.  I just want to help, and it gets old when we all spend 3/4 of our time trying to figure out if people are "shills" , wasting our time, or paid fucko's.  I don't frequent the other side of this subject  but I have to wonder if it is this difficult for them to get a group that works and is able to be productive.  Anyway, I get it, I fucked up, I never post because its impossible for me to do on a phone.  I should just stick to that.  I don't really think you restrict thought but that the requirements necessary to make suggestions or float ideas can sometimes be cumbersome, at least from an LG G5.  Please accept my apology, and believe that not just fixing this broken system but holding those accountable is my objective.  I have no idea if you are invested at all in the subject or just a mod but for what it's worth my intentions the best.

                 Hi kingforpres!
Thank you for the kind words. I understand your frustration
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1718135/8427755">

                 </a>
                 and wish there was more I could do about it. Voat on mobile is an absolute bitch for making posts. It does help to select "view desktop site" in your browser settings -- it will show the sidebar then, as well as the formatting buttons. But honestly, accessing it from a real computer is a far less frustrating experience for creating and submitting posts. Reading and commenting are not as bad on mobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am sorry I came on as strongly as I did, waving the ban-hammer and all that. I was modding by myself and had numerous posts to remove, with at least two or three different people just reposting the same trash every few minutes in an attempt to forum slide and piss off the community. It was only after I started citing repeated disregard for the guidelines and documenting it that they laid off. If you look at my comment history, you will see I almost never have to get like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I hope you do take the time to develop your post a bit more after you get a chance to read the sidebar and repost it in a way that we can leave up. Also, you can always "float ideas and make suggestions" in the comment section of any thread. We totally encourage that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thanks for caring enough about this to contribute. Hope you continue!
