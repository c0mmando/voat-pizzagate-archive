<p>According to this website, it seems to be fairly benign:
<a href="http://oto-usa.org/">http://oto-usa.org/</a></p>
<p>But, a closer examination of their symbols indicates that they are not. I\'m speaking specifically of the triangle featuring the Eye of Horus, the shape of their logo represents the vaginal opening, and the winged disk representative of the Anunnaki. Please see these images if you\'re not familiar with this symbol: <a href="https://images.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=A0LEVjfHW01Y9UoAGN8nnIlQ?p=annunaki+wing+symbol&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-002&amp;fr2=piv-web&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-002">https://images.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search;_ylt=A0LEVjfHW01Y9UoAGN8nnIlQ?p=annunaki+wing+symbol&amp;fr=yhs-mozilla-002&amp;fr2=piv-web&amp;hspart=mozilla&amp;hsimp=yhs-002</a></p>
<p>As you can clearly see within the website referenced above, they openly discuss magick, rituals, working with spirits, and Crowley. Here is one of their podcasts centered around such topics: <a href="http://oto-usa.org/main/podcast/">http://oto-usa.org/main/podcast/</a></p>
<p>Deeper investigation reveals that the OTO in Australia has been accused of many of the same debauched activities as we\'re seeing with John Podesta, the Clintons, and James Alefantis &amp; friends. </p>
<p>&quot;The obscure group Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) claims Dr Reina Michaelson and the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program described it in a website article as a satanic cult that sacrificed children and ate their organs and blood.</p>
<p>It has complained under Victoria\'s religious hatred law that Dr Michaelson and her organisation vilified OTO members, causing revulsion, ridicule, hatred and contempt.</p>
<p>According to OTO\'s statement of complaint, Dr Michaelson said it was not a religion but a child pornography and pedophile ring, that its members practised trauma-based mind control, sexual abuse and satanic rituals to discourage its victims from complaining to the authorities, and that it condoned kidnapping street children and babies and children from orphanages for sex and sacrifice in religious rituals.</p>
<p>The case began at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal yesterday, but was adjourned to today to allow a last-ditch attempt to settle out of court.&quot; <a href="http://www.theyfly.com/articles/gaia/oto.age.22.11.06.htm">http://www.theyfly.com/articles/gaia/oto.age.22.11.06.htm</a></p>
<p>Gosh, I wonder why they wanted to settle out of court if they\'re totally innocent? </p>
<p>Here\'s an interesting article about this case:</p>
<p>&quot;O.T.O Australia has already won a court victory over the conspiracy web site (a judgment they are still working to get enforced), and they now turn their attention to Michaelson who they say unfairly lumped them in to her delusional fantasy of a massive Satanic pedophile ring. Michaelson’s lawyer is defending her by saying that since she is telling the truth about Thelema she can’t be prosecuted under Australian law.&quot; <a href="http://wildhunt.org/2006/11/thelemites-fight-pedophillia-charges.html">http://wildhunt.org/2006/11/thelemites-fight-pedophillia-charges.html</a></p>
<p>Then, there\'s the story of Peaches Geldof, the daughter of musician/actor/activist and OTO follower Sir Bob Geldof, was discovered dead six months after revealing the pedophile ring online. <a href="http://www.evilyoshida.com/thread-5830.html">http://www.evilyoshida.com/thread-5830.html</a></p>
<p>I find it of particular interest that her father was also a Knight. I think those who have been knighted by the Queen need to be looked into more deeply because there appears to be a dark trend here.</p>
<p>And of course an article about the OTO in the Herald Sun has been scrubbed from the Internet. <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/sacrifice-children-denial/story-e6frf7kx-1111112562815?nk=8db5ae4aa26782427a789f74112df16e-1481466001">http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/sacrifice-children-denial/story-e6frf7kx-1111112562815?nk=8db5ae4aa26782427a789f74112df16e-1481466001</a></p>

             Sorry, I'm just a lowly researcher who's new to archiving. What's the best way to do this?

              Since you are a nub, just take screenshots. 
Strip the exif data to protect your personals and upload the album to every imagine host you can. There is also archive.is but I don't 100% trust it.
