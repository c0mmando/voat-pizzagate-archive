            If anyone has time, (and it's well worth it), take a look at the documentary "Boys for Sale" on Youtube.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-WLg5RJzBMYouTube">

           </p>
           <p>
            It's from 1981 and several brave men and two news stations got together to bring this report that is vital to understand what's going on today.
           </p>
           <p>
            One man involved in exposing these pedophiles was Professor Tom Philpot. He was "suicided."
           </p>
           <p>
            And if you get a chance and would like a very through look at how the media covers up for child molesters, please take a look at "The Witch Hunt Narrative" by Professor Ross Cheit.

            I agree. Anyone who hasn't seen the documentary should watch it. It is terribly sad with some powerful testimony. In the doc we see clips from an americas most wanted episode. What happened to the house that Paul bonacci took americas most wanteds cameras to??? This was some of the most damning evidence in my opinion. Paul bonacci (franklin scandal) takes them to a house in Colorado where he was alledgedly held. They go under the house and find all sorts of markings that corroborate bonaccis claims. What happened to this house? Did police ever go there? Do we know where exactly it is and/or who owns it?

            I watched this a few weeks ago. My heart and soul aches for that poor boy and his mother. And for him to come back then run away again. Evil evil monsters are on the loose and they kinda look like good guys. We have to do everything we can to make it harder for them to hide.
