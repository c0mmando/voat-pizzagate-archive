            Honeybee you have put together some great stuff here, wondering if there are any updates and if it is possible this Tracy Bloom works from home (as someone else asked). But for them to just change the article and take out DCF is very suspicious. Has anyone confirmed that there really was a bust? I had some experiences here in Canada where these police forces claim to be doing something and making progress arresting people yet I gave them a lead(regarding my own children) and it was returned to me in the mail, unopened and inside another envelope.In other words these fuckers in Canada were doing very little and showed no interest in doing what they claimed to be doing

             Yes and I did add an update to the title of this voat thread. I have submitted a formal request for information on the publication of arrests and a date when the child sex offender registry will be updated with the convicted persons and crimes. I have also not received any word back from Gordon Peppars from KTLA. I would assume that Tracy Bloom is a gun for hire and is not interested in defending the accuracy of her work, the search continues....

            How were  children prosecuted in California? Sent to juvie?  Would juvie be a safer option, providing monitors,compared to the streets ?  I think it would be better to put them in a rehab type of center, rather than the streets or a juvie hall with no rehab programs.

           </p>
           <p>
            Immunity from arrest means law enforcement can’t interfere with minors engaging in prostitution — which translates into bigger and better cash flow for the pimps. Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit.
As Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley, a national leader on human trafficking issues, told the media, “It just opens up the door for traffickers to use these kids to commit crimes and exploit them even worse.” Another prosecutor insightfully observed that if traffickers wrote legislation to protect themselves, it would read like SB 1322.
Minors involved in prostitution are clearly victims, and allowing our law enforcement officers to pick these minors up and get them away from their pimps and into custody is a dramatically better solution than making it legal for them to sell themselves for sex. That only deepens their victimization and renders law enforcement powerless to stop the cycle of abuse. SB 1322 is not simply misguided — its consequences are immoral.”
           </p>
           <p>
            SB 1322: Commercial Sex Acts – Minors, approved by Governor Jerry Brown on Sept. 26, 2016, amends Sections 647 and 653.22 of the Penal Code to render existing law that makes it a crime to solicit or engage in any act of prostitution “inapplicable to a child under 18 years of age”. According to SB 1322:
“Existing law makes it a crime to solicit or engage in any act of prostitution. Existing law makes it a crime to loiter in any public place with the intent to commit prostitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            This bill would make the above provisions inapplicable to a child under 18 years of age who is alleged to have engaged in conduct that would, if committed by an adult, violate the above provisions. The bill would authorize the minor to be taken into temporary custody under limited circumstances” — “pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 305 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, if the conditions allowing temporary custody without warrant are met.”
In other words, SB 1322 decriminalizes “child” (those under 18 years old) prostitutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The word “decriminalize” is defined as “to make a particular act no longer illegal by changing a law” (Cambridge Dictionary). Something that is “no longer illegal” is something that now is legal. For example, by decriminalizing pot, it is now legal in some states to smoke marijuana. Since SB 1322 decriminalizes (“makes no longer illegal”) child prostitutes, and since the act of those “children” which is now made no longer illegal is prostitution, this means California’s new law, whether explicitly or implicitly, whether intentionally or unintentionally, makes child prostitution no longer illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ergo, child prostitution is now legal in California.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Here's another  opinion by a professed Libertarian makes me question if the bill was put in place to make it easier for perps to access them, rather than a better program to intervene and get kids off the streets and  a  better system to nail perps.  But  I think the huge numbers of  perps in California wouldn't agree to a bill that helped the kids, cause these are the rule makers  branching   from  Hollywood.  What would happen to the Hollywood pedo rings ?  They wouldn't risk setting themselves or their kids up for a bust. This makes it easier for perps.  There's no way California has ever  put kids safety first, not in CPS, not in the Hollywood  scene,  so what makes anyone think that  the legal administrators are going to help?
           </p>
           <p>
            If they really wanted to help they would have focused on preventative measures, you know what all the  many  child funds are allegedly supposed to be in place for?
           </p>
           <p>
            No,   this bill is not an improvement  to protect kids. It's a joke to make these guys  look like they're doing something good for kids by keeping them out of juvie, when it is really doing nothing but keeping kids on the streets, groomed and accepting their life with nobody taking them out for potential rehabilitation.      Groomed  and sick kids aren't going to take themselves out of the situation and couldn't even if they want to, because  instead of parents these kids have  pimps whom their dependent upon -  and whom they defend.

            Decriminalizing the act absolutely makes it all the easier for predators to victimize helpless children as she describes. This is a seemingly intractable problem and I’m not sure what the best answer would be. It might start with a more aggressive and well funded program to take such underage prostitutes off the streets and into some sort of long term shelter (rather than jail or juvenile detention) and find a way to assure them that their cooperation in apprehending their abusers who put them on the streets won’t result in retribution from the criminals they’re caught up with.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the end, it’s hard to see how that California bill will do much to actually help at risk children. And yes, it basically “legalizes” child prostitution in all but name. The real travesty here isn’t how the bill is being described, but the underlying horror show which prompted the law in the first place.

            Who in the fuck is Tracy Bloom??? Pseudo-name for another writer? She has a profile page on KTLA5 with no picture but numerous stories.  Maybe they leverage this fake Tracy Bloom account to post controversial articles? I'm really not sure

             The original article by KTLA authored by Tracy Bloom who doesn't "exist" in the sence of a contact or even working for KTLA, implicated DCF had the children in their care while this was going on, findings have revealed that the story was changed without noting a redaction on the article, and that children have been taken out of the care of the government and put into care of non-governmental agencies after the rescue

               Someone who doesn't exist at KTLA broke the story and then changed their story the next day.

                In the state of California, all foster homes are contracted through private agencies. The state and counties don't actually "run" their own foster homes. They maintain legal custody of the children but use the private agencies to provide the direct care and placement of the kids.

            Thanks.  I deleted my comment because I know that it is a contentious issue and I see your side of the argument as well.  As I said, I don't want to detract from the focus of this particular thread anyway as this investigation is so important.

            Why does that video seem to make them okay? I'm just wondering if I missed something.

            I started breaking down CAST and started with ASSET (Julia Ormond's seems to be the head). Julia has a page on the Clinton Global Initiative Website  (
            <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/press-release-winners-of-clinton-global-citizens-awards-announced.html">

            </a>
            ). And she was a performer at the 2008 Clinton Global Citizen's Awards (
            <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/press-release-winners-of-clinton-global-citizens-awards-announced.html">
             https://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/news-and-media/press-releases-and-statements/press-release-winners-of-clinton-global-citizens-awards-announced.html
            </a>
            ) . And one of the board members (Alan Fleischmann - spelt wrong on the ASSET page had a mention in a podesta email and had this written about him (
            <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-donors-associates-boost-campaign-of-chris-matthews-wife/">
             http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-donors-associates-boost-campaign-of-chris-matthews-wife/
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another close Clinton associate that has provided funds to Matthews is Alan Fleischmann, the founder and president of Laurel Strategies, a business advisory firm.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The next one was Free the Slaves and Daniel Elkes is a executive at Genentech (Remember that big Pharma was all over the board of Center for Missing Children).
           </p>
           <p>
            I found that in 30 minutes of looking. I am thinking that even if some of these people are good. Some don't seem to be.

            According to the article, '
            <em>
             The Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking
            </em>
            , as well as the
            <em>
             Saving Innocence Organization
            </em>
            , were also organizing efforts to assist victims'. So of course these organizations need looking into as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking work with some organizations that I think are suspect.  Polaris, for one, has already been covered in other voat posts, as they seem to be passing data to the Clinton Foundation, among others.  The coalition also works with Thorn, which is the Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore org, which works with all the high tech companies Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Basically all the ones that work closely with the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm currently looking into who runs Saving Innocence, if anyone else wants to have a look.

            She has been writing/producing for KTLA5 going back to at least 2014:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also already a correction in the article saying that "An earlier version of this story had an incorrect surname for the L.A. County sheriff. The story has been updated."
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would Tracy Bloom post an update to that change but not this very critical change?﻿

            I was only able to listen to the 1st half of the press conference. The first speaker used the term 'child molester' in a way that seemed to minimize the offenses. I think 'child rapist' would have been more accurate, in recognition that a minor CANNOT consent to sex.
            <br/>
            2nd speaker was L.A. District Attorney Jackie Lacey: 
"Over the next several days and weeks deputy district attorney Jane Creighton who leads the human sex trafficking section and other prosecutors will be filing criminal charges against those who were arrested as part of this operation.  My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting the sex traffickers and those who pay for sex with underage victims."  The question is how aggressively will they pursue pimps/john that have the kind of social status and connections that have always enable the sick fucks to avoid justice?

            just a thought
Tracy is also a males name
           </p>
           <p>
            there is a Tracy Bloom in Connecticut that is a writer,
digital reporters don't have to be in the office to report.

            I have held the belief that children in the system are being trafficked both through the agency and fostered/adopted in homes with pedos where the state makes it very easy for these perverts to gain access to children.   There are tons of stories that can be found that link CPS with trafficking and  I'll just post a couple of links which show a connection.

            Here is another area of concern with the field of child welfare. Universities put a high preference on incoming students who are either LGBTQ or come from backgrounds of being abused. If you are a straight person from a normal intact family your chances of being accepted into a social work program are slim.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this system, that hands over immense power and control of vulnerable children and families actively recruits and turns out social workers who have been abused or come from a culture of deviant sex (I have nothing against gay people but it's weird that they are being recruited to work with kids).

             Do you have a source for that statement?  I find it ironic that you say that because many parents in the online communities who have lost their children or are presently involved in an open case with CPS have stated that their caseworkers are from the LGBT community.

              No it's just my personal experience going through a masters of social work program and then working for my county child welfare agency for the past 12 years. im not sure if there are nationwide stats on that but I will see what I can find about that.

               I went back to college at age 50 to get a socialwork degree. I ended up remarrying and never using the degree but in the social work program 80% were lesbian, 10% were gay guys, and the rest were native americans. Actually, I made up the percentages, but it seemed that most were lesbian. I didn't know that until I was in the program. The teachers and students hated me because I'm a Libertarian/Republican. God they hated anyone who was trying to save people from the government. Probably a good thing I never worked in the field because I would have run over social workers who placed children with pedos. I have no idea why lesbian are so attracted to the profession. Maybe because they don't become nuns anymore.

            The way CA runs its child welfare system is that they contract with private agencies to provide the actual care and homes for children who are in state/county custody. This leaves a lot of room for inconsistent care and makes over sight very difficult.  It has been this way since at least the mid 90's when I was a teen in their system.

            I found it odd that initial reports stated that all of the child victims were turned over to DCF. None of this kids came from families who were able to resume custody of them? It appeared that either ALL of the child victims had come from the DCF system or were trafficked from sompleace else. How else could it be explained that none of the kids had available family. This needs to be checked into. California is notorious of having a completely half assed child welfare system with LA being the worst of the worst. They are continually sued for their incompetencies.

             Is the article saying they were PLACED into the care of DCF or were they TAKEN from the care of the DCF (where they were being abused)? I am not necessarily understanding. Can someone clarify.

              That's what i have been trying to decipher. It says they were all placed in DCF care after having been rescued, but why wouldn't they be placed back with their families/parents? The only reasons that all of these children were placed with DCF instead of family is because they were already in DCF custody, their parents were involved in the pedo activities, or the kids are not from the area (and have no local family to assume care of them). There's really no other explanation for why none of these kids would be returned home. It's very sketchy that this information is not clarified for the public.

               It says, "The minors who recovered during the operation were being cared for by various Department of Children and Family Services Agencies across the state, according to sheriff’s officials."

               This doesn't even make sense so it's hard to know what they meant.

             Minors encountered during enforcement efforts were cared for by personnel from various Department of Children and Family Services Agencies in each county. In Los Angeles County, the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking (CAST) and Saving Innocence (SI) coordinated the emergency services response for victim care and collaborated with similar, non-governmental victim service organizations throughout the state.

            I reviewed the cached copies in the Wayback machine - it looks like the children are being cared for by the DCF currently AFTER their rescue. Nowhere does it say they were rescued FROM the DCF. It's really worded poorly and easily misinterpreted.

             Benifit of the doubt accepted, yet, they did not site the change of DCF to various child services, also, there are thousands of cases implicating DCF taking children without proper cause and the government making thousands of dollars per child that is put in the care of the state, also please watch my DC pedo investigations where I prove that government officials, agency directors, and private government contractors are convicted child sex offender's and that they hold strategic positions to help cover their pedopile chronies.
