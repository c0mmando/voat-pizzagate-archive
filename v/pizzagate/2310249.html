            Shortly before 11 a.m.  a problem with a transformer resulted in loss of power to Toontown and  Fantasyland at the park. Crews restored electricity to Toontown by noon, with power fully restored to all affected areas by 4 p.m.  The adjacent Disney California Adventure park was not impacted by the outage.  New arrivals were directed to neighboring California Adventure "which remains available for your enjoyment.” Disneyland has 49 rides and attractions, and California Adventure another 36.

            So five hours of power cut that's a lot of time to get things done if this was a sting operation. We won't ever know what caused it same way we won't know what caused Atlanta airport blackout.

             Not saying it definitely happened but we know from past articles that big crowded theme parks like Disneyland and Disney World are perfect places for kids to be rented and traded it's easy for a man and a woman to enter with a young boy or girl who they acquired now they are going to rent the kid out for a few hours and the exchange can take place more or less in plain sight they give the kid to another male-female couple dressed identically and nobody notices the switch.
            </p>
            <p>
             The two couples chat for a minute then the first couple walks away and the kids goes with the second couple. Who would notice that if you are there with your own kids or your friends there are so many people it's so crowded on a busy day or better at night the big parks stay open until 11 pm most nights it would take an eagle eye adult to notice the exchange happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the witness would have to think fast and be woke to this dirty business. Most people if they notice this would assume the kids is going with relatives with an uncle and aunt nothing to worry about.

             Cnn did 'confirm' that the power was out for 25 minutes and said that there were no reports of commotion... I surely don't trust cnn, but, assuming they can't lie about this one for a moment, 25 minutes is time enough for
             <em>
              something
             </em>
             to happen.

             No you would not notice the arrests happening if you are just an average angry tourist there for the day with your kids or your friends you would be so angry that you have to walk to other areas of the park where there was power only three areas lost power but that is enough to do the sting you have undercover agents swoop in 2 for each pedo  and a female agent to take the kid away then the 2 male agents walk the pedo out the nearest park exit telling him he's dead if he tries to run. The entire thing can be done in 5 minutes with a dozen pedos and 20 to 30 agents dressed as tourists each pedo being shadowed by 2 male agents and 1 female agent her job is to take the kid by the hand and lead the boy or girl to an ice cream stand for a snack "Hi cutie come with me we're going to get you an ice cream cone" while the male agents hustle the pedo away.

            A super busy day right in the middle of the busiest tourist vacation week of the year. A day like this there would be at least a dozen adults there with kids boys and girls ready to send them on their way for the day and night with a pedo who has arranged the time and location for the hand-off it's easy to do when it's so crowded the adult walks with the kid to get a pretzel or into the men's room and the kid comes out with a different man and no one notices. Or a woman handler takes a girl into the ladies restroom and the girl comes out with a different woman it's very easy to make the switch when it's crowded with kids.

            The security cameras might notice but Disney personnel are crooked they are part of the pedo ring so they look the other way and videotapes get erased every night if nothing happens for police to want to review. Now when there is an accident or a crime then they have to save the video surveillance but on a normal day tapes get erased each night.

            Apparently there have been power outages in the past in Anaheim but remember what Q said:
           </p>
           <p>
            There Are No Coincidences
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why I think this could have been a take-down a round-up of bad guys similar to the "power failure" at Atlanta airport last weekend. It's the smart way to do something like this. You have lots of angry families complaining but it gives the white hats enough time to make their arrests with ease.

            Yes, this is very suspect! Especially given the season and the rituals. A big bust would be great or our guys...ex navy seals busting the pedos
