<p>I know there are a lot of Trump supporters here and many of you seem to be right-leaning or conservative, so I expect some of you to not be receptive to this, but please hear me out.</p>
<p>Trump was elected as an anti-globalist, anti-establishment candidate who was seen as an answer to the years of divisive, far-left identity politics and the ever encroaching attacks on free speech and political incorrectness. He promised a wall paid for by Mexico, an end to needless wars, a special prosecutor to investigate &quot;Crooked Hillary,&quot; and much more. </p>
<p>While Trump may deserve credit for the good he has done, he, too, is a swamp monster in the making. In a phone call with Mexico\'s president, he admitted his wall talk was just that, talk, and that Mexico wouldn\'t pay for it. At a recent rally, Trump exclaimed that if he didn\'t get a wall funded by tax dollars, he\'d shut the government down. After his election, he said the Clintons were nice and have already been through a lot, leaving out any hope that he would come through on another promise. Instead of immediately removing the insultingly corrupt FBI director James Comey, he kept him on which eventually led to the introduction of Robert Mueller. Just recently, the FBI has decided not to release Hillary\'s emails because of a &quot;lack of public interest.&quot; Instead of filling his cabinet with anti-globalists, he filled it with swamp creatures from D.C. and Wall Street. People who worked in his campaign and pushed for his agenda got nothing. Trump is now surrounded by generals and Obama holdovers. At the same time, Trump has been relentlessly attacked by the media in an unprecedented onslaught, and I think the continual barrage along with his wanting to maintain the Trump brand long after his presidency may be why he is caving in on so many issues. McMaster and Tillerson won\'t even use terms like &quot;radical Islam,&quot; for example, and the war in Afghanistan that Trump rightly reviled for years is now one he has chosen to prolong.</p>
<p>So, in an effort to get through to those with ears willing to hear (or eyes willing to see in our case) and if you\'re one of those who thinks the government can be fixed &quot;If my guy gets in!&quot; I hope you reconsider. Statism is worse than cancer. It never goes into remission and cannot cure itself. To continue to believe that if we can  plug in the right spark plugs to a machine oiled with blood and coercion is one reason why the world, America in particular, has seemed to have lost its grip on reality and morality. </p>
<p>Instead of striving to be self-sufficient, peaceful individuals who focus on integrity and voluntary interaction in an effort to build a strong, virtuous society, we have become a people more concerned with group identity who vote for more political control over every aspect of our lives. Given that government is funded through coercion and extortion of its citizens, it\'s no wonder why morals are thrown to the wayside when such an apparatus is continually given more power to lie, murder, steal, divide and determine moral value. The reason pizzagate is as big a problem as it is is due to individuals failing in their personal responsibilities and granting the enormous power to politicians and their cronies to carry out such heinous things like war, slavery and human trafficking. </p>
<p>My plea with you guys today is to stop thinking the government will one day do the right things. The State thrives on division, manipulating group think/identity, false news and propaganda, underhanded dealings and backroom deals. Of course, government does good things, but for every good it produces, there are countless bads. </p>
<p>We should push for more voluntary, decentralized interaction and not relying on a centralized command and control entity to make the right decisions. It has been independent, decentralized investigation into pizzagate that has exposed far, far more than the State ever will, and this is how it has been and always will be. This is American. American people were at their peak when they relied less on the central planners of the State to sort things out and more on themselves, their friends and their families. </p>
<p>Trump is just a figurehead. While some of his choices may have been good and deserve credit, his overall actions are showing that he seems fine with being a George W. Bush rather than a Barack Obama,  a consolation that isn\'t very encouraging. </p>
<p>With all that said, abandon the political charade and the government scheme that keeps everything going in the same direction. Be individuals who work on the betterment of yourselves first, and society will benefit by default. </p>
<p>Keep up the great work and investigating. It is because of private researchers and people disillusioned by government that have provided the most damning information. This is how it ought to be. The FBI, CIA, NSA, IRS, etc. aren\'t here to keep us safe. They are here to keep themselves safe and that means maintaining the charade. </p>
<p>YOU are why pizzagate is being exposed and more people are waking up to it. The only hope is for more decentralization and wider access to information that will bring about justice for these victims through public outrage rather than typical, futile political means. Market-based solutions, like you, are far more important and viable to a free and virtuous people than state-based solutions.</p>
<p>Take care. May pizzagate be exposed and justice be served!</p>',

            We need a new subverse dedicated SOLELY to red pilling John Q Public. We CAN wake up the masses if we organize and plan together. Can ANYBODY here start  such a subverse so we can get to work?   I would do it, but I don't know how…not tech savvy and have little time w/ a 50+ hour work week I think we can all agree that the politicians and the MSM will do nothing to help get this out.... in fact their efforts go toward burying/ridiculing the information.  So c'mon... we can do it.  Start the new pedogate/ pizzagate redpill subverse so we can organize and work  together to wake up John Q Public. Where there's a will, there's a way. Eff the MSM and politicians. Who will start the subverse? Please.

            I feel defeated as well.  For a moment, I had a great hope that finally, someone was going to do something about the Elite's child rape and trafficking.  I agree that the acronym associations are NOT on the side of the people by any means, even though our tax dollars pay their salaries.  I believe with all my heart that we victims who are now adults, will be the leaders in exposing the vile acts of humanoids against children.  Thank you for this post and for the reminder.

            this is why i loved the documentary unacknowledged by steven greer. he had some amazing talking heads on that doc from high up in the government who know what goes on behind the scenes. and it was said that president carter asked for the extra terrestial files and george bush senior said no you're not getting them you dont need to know about that. this is the head of the snake. the boss of deep state. rumsfeld, cheney, kissinger, bush sr. theyre running america not the president. the president is a part time employee that they tolerate. trump doesnt have a hope in hell of making any changes because they control the industrial military complex and they are taunting him in the media. and organising antifa rallies. the antifa symbol is an illuminati symbol by the way. its really scary. george bush sr is a sadistic paedophile as are his mates. he is the devil incarnate no wonder he married alester crowleys illegitimate daughter barbara. they organised 9 11 and they will not be brought to task because like soros they all operate above the law. they control the law. they control the police and with the cia they are planning on taking over the world and not in a good way. this is why there have been no high level arrests and the clintons operated as the arkansas mafia killing anyone with impunity that got in their way.

            Want to see some change? Start disposing of prominent journalists and leave a note behind about telling the truth.  That's how we spark this fucking revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shit will not end until we can drag the Deep State traitors through a brief judicial process and publicly execute them for their crimes against humanity.  Things would change REAL fucking quick.

             "Start disposing of prominent journalists"
            </p>
            <p>
             Get a clue.  We do not employ them.  Our opinion of them does NOT determine their employment.  If it did, sleazes like Mika B. on MSNBC and all the other countless media scumbags would have been out of jobs long ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most media "personalities" are in the ruling families.  That is why there is a REVOLVING DOOR between the White House and big corporate media.  That has been the case for DECADES.  Trump being in the Oval Office will NOT change that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there is the CIA's Project Mockingbird. CIA have controlled all major media since the 1950s via that "project."
            </p>
            <p>
             SO, if you think that complaints and negative posts  in comment sections will get these fuckers fired you're incredibly naive.

            The only hope we really have is a Black Swan event on a global scale.  Even if we (the good people of planet Earth) all mobilised against (((TPTB))) tomorrow, our factions would be swiftly infiltrated, subverted and neutralised.  We might get to burn down a few Gov buildings, blow up a few tanks, decapitate a few bureaucrats but the head of the beast would laugh!  They had us beat centuries ago but it's only now in the 'Kali Yuga age' that we can fully appreciate it.  Pray for the fight to come whilst you're still young enough to fight back, that's the best you can hope for.

            Sorry to hear you're discounting everything based on one portion of one sentence. Later on I state that I'm spit balling ideas, but you admit you didn't get that far. Why even bother replying if you aren't going to even add an idea to counter mine?

            I am coming to the conclusion you have drawn, this thing is way to big and, way to many swamp monsters on both sides are drowning in it, as well as big business, corporate, bankers, social media, msm, etc etc etc.....Sessions has added nothing to the fight, Trump is keeping holdovers in all departments of FBI CIA, DOJ, etc, so Hillary remains protected, even today the FBI said they would not release Hillary's emails because of lack of interest from the public.....crazy!!.....everyone in this cesspool will continue to scratch each others back, Trump and Sessions included, and until I see any large scale news breaking, and names being named soon, I will continue to believe that,.....remember the Congressman who met with Assange, silence so far....2 more months marks 1 year on PG, and we are still waiting for answers.

             That's been the PROBLEM in this country since its founding.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone SITS AROUND WAITING for SOMEONE ELSE to "do something."
            </p>
            <p>
             It's too late.  THEY are in CONTROL.  THEY founded this country.  THEY are the "historical figures" we were all BRAINWASHED TO WORSHIP IN SCHOOL.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently, it's only gotten worse thanks to SUPERHERO BULLSHIT!  (written by JEWS, of course!)

            I agree with your rational and well-stated sentiments, and if we are going to have to find our own means at reaching our goals, there aren't many chess moves on the board for us. We really need to start
            <em>
             seriously
            </em>
            brainstorming.
           </p>
           <p>
            My Favorite Chess Move: We could all gather on one day internationally to stand
            <em>
             peacefully and silently
            </em>
            wearing 'PG is Real' (or something) shirts around the White House, Buckingham Palace, Comet Ping Pong, Dr. Pong's, and even mill around the towns near the Russian River (Behemian Grove) and near the Belgium building paintings, and other major international PG "landmarks" on one single day world wide.
           </p>
           <p>
            How They Block this Move: 
Soros would sick his dogs on us by having his paid action everywhere groups (Antifa, BAMN, etc.) or Manchurian candidates (as if there's a difference) to disrupt our demonstrations, and the media reports us as violent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Internet efforts are effective, but we have limited reach because so many people only stay within their Facebook Bubble, so we're not red pilling enough people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another Interesting Chess Move: If someone's knowledgeable in hijacking airwaves (and willing to get arrested and prosecuted for an FCC violation), we could always spread our message over the Tel-evil-vision
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLpvD2qGlks">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLpvD2qGlks
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But, have they already blocked this move when they forced everyone to change from analog to digital frequencies? (fast forward to 4:25)
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVo6bSPj380">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVo6bSPj380
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know what the strategic solution is to getting everyone red pilled and see the international pedos taken down, so I'm really just spit balling. "They" are certainly great strategists with more than enough avenues available to them, but there are options out there to spread the evidence and make the world aware of what these creatures are doing. (Funny/Not so funny thought: might some members have to invest in Carrier pigeons to pass on sensitive plan information?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, you're right that we cannot trust the government to do anything, and even if they were, we all know that the government moves at a snail's pace for everything, so what's the plan? What can we do to create a peaceful revolution? Of course, even if we could figure out how to gain traction peacefully at first, we all know there will be blood as they begin their death throws and doing everything they can to remain in power. I don't believe this can be avoided because this is how psychopaths react when they're cornered.
           </p>

            I just read about Trump giving a 100 billion dollar arms deal to the Saudis to continue bombing yemen where currently 10000 are dying every day due to malnutrition while the media is kept silent and no journalists are allowed in the country.
Trump is a monster. Im done with him completely. I will never defend him or his actions to anyone.
Sadly there are many who think we would have been better of with Hillary. I will never say that. But Trumps a fucking arsehole as far as im concerned. Fuck him and his bullshit. Hes just another parasite. He deserves no more concessions. Hes a good liar. Sure we could say his hands are tied and so on.. But na.. Hed have to be pretty fucking stupid if he didnt know what he was up against. I remember when people used to defend Obama saying oh hes just playing the game to stay in office etc.. Like a double agent. I always knew he was a parasite.. Now im sure Trump is too. Plus his wifes early modelling career just reeks of mkultra etc.. Fuck him hes dead to me.

              So giving $110 billion to the Saudis for ams deals is not a big deal then? Biggest hand out to the saudis ever. And you call me an idiot. Read all my comments. How would a honest man sleep at night after doing this?
Your saying its out of his control?
Then why are any of us pinning any hope on him to do anything? I call BS.

I called you an idiot (sorry) because the logic did not flow.
               <br/>
               1. trump has illicit ties so does killary.   they are battling.   if he could I believe he would wave a magic wand.   the dam government DoJ needs to feel the pressure of the American people to do the right thing howevr they are also compromised.           I do think we are naïve to think this will work.   there aren't enough of us, we have no leader.  I do believe things are going on behind the scene those.
               <br/>
               Now anout the money given overseas while the kids are dying.....That is absolutely awful.  we as humans cannot control what happens overthere.  we don't like something so we impose Sanctions----big deal.  nobody want the innocent hurt anytime    what we are told, what we see is manipulated.....always.......Hey look at the sierra lona , sudan or ethopia or Somalia------not our goverments responsibility.   I hate what is happening but not our gov problem

                If you mean by our govt then if your american then your govt is the USA scumbags and Trump is your president. He signed the deal. Biggest deal to the saudis for Arms EVER!
You say cannot control what happens? WTF.. Trump is a human isnt he? If he has any heart at all then he wouldn't have signed that deal.
If he had no choice at all but to sign that deal then why should we have any faith in someone who has no choice in his decisions?
Yemen is your govts problem! They are funding the Saudis. Your govts paying for the bombs and artillery and giving them a green light!
Im not american. Im from NZ. Our govt is also totally corrupt. The CIA owns our govt too. I dont trust anyone in our govt any more than I trust yours. 
I dont have any hope for scumbags to give a shit about us anymore. Total revolution may be the only answer.
They wana take away your guns so that you cant stop them. There is no easy answer. 
IN NZ we had a group that was plotting to create its own sovereign nation within the country with its own laws and so on. The govt sent SWAT teams in and arrested them all for been terrorists. I dont have any answers.

            Their job is to spread disinfo and demoralize us. "Resisting is futile. Whatever you do is futile. You can't win." That's the message here, but you wouldn't be posting this if everything was so futile and if we couldn't stop The Cannibal Elite.

              And you've done what again? Other than shoot your mouth off under the safety net of shills and Soros bitcoin pay-offs? Well, what have you done? And yet you criticize someone because they can't wave a magic wand and make things all better in a weekend? Let's see it's been eight months. Eight months that Trump's been in office. He's had his cojones in a Cuisinart since even before the election! Skanks coming out of the woodwork (and probably burial grounds), to relate strange allegations about being abused because he didn't ask permission to kiss them? His family trashed, his son called out, his wife criticized, his daughter shaded by Chelsea (to the delight of MSN). This is in addition to every single major newspaper in the country breathing down his neck and printing propaganda and lies. Then there's the Russian collusion story, the investigation, f&amp;cking every PedoWood has-been/star making some kind of derogatory remark. Then you have the jokes about assassination that earned some a visit from the FBI. And the calls aren't restricted to alcoholic/drug-riddled stars. Loud-mouthed Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal's done it also. Then there were the holdovers from The Kenyan's administration, and members of his own party that didn't even want him running for president! He's had more hate and venom and propaganda thrown at him then any other president in history, and still he battles on showing an interest in helping WV back on its feet. And giving the green light for all these arrests that have been made. They've found tunnels used for human trafficking, and his daughter is devoting herself to helping children. He's persisted because, I don't know if you know this, but this is a democracy. He's been playing by those rules unlike others that shall stay nameless (The Kenyan! The Cannibal Queen! Pedostas! DWS!)
             </p>
             <p>
              Then we come to you. A spineless POS who likes to shoot his/her mouth off and posture as this all-seeing eye of Argus. You're what Trump is doing this for? I can tell you that he's a billion times better than I am because I'd meet some little nothing like you and think, "I'm going to go through hell for this clown?" and pull out of the election. I'd figure you deserve to have The Cannibal Elite up your ass. But you know what? Those kids don't deserve it. They haven't grown up to be a morally bankrupt. twisted sack of shit like you. And, again, that tells me he's not what you say because he can look past the assholes that can't even keep their mouths and keep focused on the kids.

And you've been here since Day 1 and choose to use your big fucking mouth to criticize Trump when you have emails talking about throwing kids in the pool, raw and uncut time with underage minors, grabbing 100 Haitian orphans off the streets with a known human trafficker, handkerchiefs with maps that seem pizza-related, with a pizza joint with an encrypted section on their website and an owner that posts lewd, obscene, disgusting remarks replete with pictures of children on his social media, with The Cannibal Queen talking about a One Hemispheric Government where Canada, the United States, and Mexico would be one giant shopping mall, and where the Pedostas, chief advisors to The Woman That Would Be King are invited to a craven, hideous crone's spirit cooking dinner? PUH-LEEZE!!!! Every single point you made did not involve evidence, just the ramblings of a lunatic that diddles with him/herself at night to pass the time. Then there was the magazine and #cumpanda and kids with dark circles under their eyes and cartoon babies crawling into the oven where they're cooked seemingly alive?
               </p>
               <p>
                Yeah, you can stuff your hubris, ego, and peanut-sized brain where the sun don't shine. You can't even give lip service to someone that's doing the dirty work!
               </p>
               <p>
                Guess what? You have earned a block. It usually takes one or two times at the rodeo for that to happen, why wait?
               </p>
               <p>
                And as for me being nuts, I don't fucking care what you call me! Why? BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT THE KIDS!

             Your on my radar for not seeing the other side of what cries like this could be. How do we know your not here to just keep the status quo.. Keep people holding on and hoping somehow the parasites and owned elite will take down the parasites and owned elite?
Look at history.. How has real change ever happened? Its happened when people get together in huge numbers and force/demand action.. Thats how its always happened.

             <p>
              If t is, shills come out en masse to bolster it. I'm surprised CNN didn't send a crisis actor to cry over my criticism.

               Your an idiot if you think im a shill. From my point of view Im at an advantage of knowing 100% that im not a shill, and thats good enough for me.. Something youll never know 100%.
And if your criterior for a shill post is when a bunch of fed up and pissed off people jump in with their two cents then I feel youve gone into that addiction of calling every man and his dog a shillosaurus.
Good for you. I cant speak for anyone else but at least I know who I am :)
Im sure there are plenty of shills about to call out for what its worth..

                Their standard line:  "Arrests of the :"elite" are imminent!  It will be happening ANY DAY now!"  Except we've been hearing that BS for SEVERAL MONTHS!!  (Not to mention it's

                 I've seen a number of profiles pushing the "Trump is our savior" bs lately. QK is one, LA_Trump &amp; Commoner as well. To be frank, I haven't 100% decided if they're shills or just ignorant. Although QK apparently has no problem sounding her shill alarm any time someone disagrees with her narrative.

             I've been saying the same thing for a while. you certainly add more flair to it. we can use the internet to  unite and communicate what we citizens want for our society. what laws we still want and which we deem irrelevant. we can find alternatives to the monopolies and restraints against us at any moment. we hold the power. just not enough people realize it. the govt can't bomb us into he stone age. they would have nothing to rule over. let's start taking back our rights faster than they were taken away. we're all just playing by made-up rules we choose to follow and the ruling class constantly ignore. we keep talking race religion and parties instead of how to fix our country.

             Jonathan Williams recorded in his

              LEGIONS OF SATAN
             </strong>
             ,1781, that
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              General Cornwallis revealed to Washington that a holy war will now begin on America, and when it is ended America will be supposedly the citadel of freedom, but her millions will unknowingly be loyal subjects to the Crown.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Cornwallis went on to explain...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Your churches will be used to teach the Jew’s religion and in less than two hundred years the whole nation will be working for divine world government. That government that they believe to be divine will be the British Empire. All religions will be permeated with Judaism without even being noticed by the masses, and they will all be under the invisible all-seeing eye of the Grand Architect of Freemasonry.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             He should have told the public they have hijacked the Lost Tribes of Israels British monarchy also, as all else monarchy’s is related to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of Judah and also from tribes of Israel must be involved, because they are what G-d says in the Bible “kills their Prophets” sent them to correct their ways. For sure the tribe of Dan is involved in the occult. The Prophets was not for the Khazars, or the edomites and kenites (goyim/Serpent-seed). This is the last thing they do before their final fall. Always in Bible history it was like this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many might mistakenly think and believe the British and other European monarchy is of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel (British Israelism), They are not, they are impostors, identity thieves, cheaters and liars. When the Commonwealth of the Israelites was doing good in all the nations the so-called colonies under their leadership it prospered, and they did what they SHOULD do, be a Light for The Nations, when the Edomites and Khazars (askeNazis) took over after the coup d’état and ruled for looting via the East India Company, Central Bank usury and alike, it all went down.

             The current English royal Oldenburg family and Scandinavian Bernadotte, which are root to many other nations royals, are Edomites (fake jews, spirit of Edom is called Red Plague, ref. the same peoples communism by Satanist Rabbi Karl Mordechai Marx Levy, and the monarchies cousin Baron Rothschild, Red Shield his name means), came from Black Nobility / Merchants of Venice. The original family name, Guelph, and they were brought to power in England by the Prince of Hannover. This is of course not accidental. Look at the Holy Roman Empire. 200 years later did the same dynasty put another family to power, it was Bauer family who were to become Rothschild. All the time since they select their puppet politicians (they are selected, not elected), in all nations under their dominion.

             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In every nation, in every major event, the Edomite Jews have been behind it. Edomite Jews control the White House. To do this successfully, they have helped to promote the idea that the synagogue of Satan (Revelation 2:9 / 3:9) – those who say they are Jews and are not, are the real «Israel», in order to draw attention away from themselves. When for the most part, these so-called Jews are actually Idumeans (from Esau/Edom), Ashkenazi (Genesis 10:2, 3) &amp; Khazars.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Genesis 25
             </strong>
             records that Rebekah bore Isaac paternal twin sons, Esau, whose name was changed to Edom, and Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel. While still in the womb the two sons of Isaac «struggled together within her.»
            </p>
            <p>
             The Lord explained this rivalry to Rebekah:
            </p>
            <p>
             …Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder [Esau] shall serve the younger [Jacob]. (Genesis 25:23)»
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead the elder (Esau) took the power, and let’s the younger (Jacob) serve them. This is in the Bible terms as the time of ‘Jacob’s Trouble’. They are really heading for a gigantic fall. They are Satanists of an extreme grade, contrary to all requirements and commands of G-d Himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              They are not human
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Esau (Edom) and Jacob (Isreal), the grandsons of Abraham were twin brothers, presumably born with the same bloodline. However, Esau married two Canaanite women in violation of G-D's law. In doing this, Esau’s line became contaminated, because among the Canaanites, who were the progeny of Satan and the Fallen Angels, the evil bloodline thrived and coalesced. Subsequently, Esau’s descendants would carry the demon seed of Lucifer and transmit it widely.

                The Khazar theory has been debunked via DNA studies.  Arthur Keostler, who wrote
                <em>
                 The Thirteenth Tribe
                </em>
                , the BOOK PROPOSING THE THEORY, was a COMMUNIST JEW WHO WORKED WITH THE CIA.

               <p>
                The "synagogue of Satan" is 100% BS.  In fact, the OPPOSITE OF WHAT "JESUS" SAID IS FACT:  There are MILLIONS OF CRYPTO JEWS WHO ARE PRETENDING TO NOT BE JEWS, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!

                 After the demise of Khazaria they established themselves in Venice and Genoa. They married from the Venetian and Genoese oligarchies into the Royal houses of Europe in the early part of the twelfth century. Then they set up in Amsterdam and captured the British Throne through the Khazar Jew, William of Orange. They infiltrated the Protestant Churches, set up the Jesuit Order against Rome and the Protestants, organized Free Masonry, and by introducing the Babylonian fractional reserve banking system (or usury), became so powerful they are now a parallel government in most all countries.

             And of course this shill piece opens the path for crazy disinfo nutso replies like this one. Now the Daily Mail or CNN will pick up on it and there you go! More bad publicity for people who only want to stop human trafficking and child molestation.

              You think this is a shill piece?
Trump gave 100 billion arms deal to saudis recently. Thats the kind of guy he is. A sweet talking piece of shit. I used to defend him to friends and family. Now I feel like an ex obama supporter!
Citizen unity really is the only path to justice.
You got a better idea? Keep on keeping on ad infinitum? Look how far thats got us.
Who cares what the fucking media say.
If they dont spin our words into what they want they will just make stuff up anyway.
You think we can solve this through Trump, through govt? Your dreaming!
Truth is we do outnumber them. They are trying to divide us. Through knowledge and action we can do what iceland did.. Throw out the bankers and crooks and  start fresh.
You got a better idea? Yes im pissed. Were all pissed. Are you hanging on and hoping for change? Get real. Its time we got real.
Armed resistance and a revolution jusg might be the only way?! After all these false flags and huge effort to take guns away from people is because they are shit scared we will do exactly that! Get it?

               I think that the deal didn't go through, and that there was an objection from someone in congress. I'll have to take some time to research this but I know there was definitely TALK of a congressional objection to the Saudi arms deal.

              You are so goddamn pretentious.  You think HACKS WRITING FOR JEWS just wait around for a forum post to ridicule conspiracy theorists?  Which comment here prompted the Welch shooting, or any of the hit pieces?

              Why dont you say a single word against rhe TONS of alien garbage posted here daily? You probably believe aliens are more guilty than Jews, fuckin brainwashed shiksa.

               Yes. It's called the jidf. They use a program called megaphone. It allows one jew to alert "antisemetic" messages to otherscin the jidf. This allows the to swarm comments

            THANK YOU. It's amazing how so many people have such a desire to see justice that they put their blinders on and refuse to see reality. We cannot rely on a savior. WE have to bring about the changes we want to see. No one is going to do it for us. Trump didn't surprise his way into the presidency, he was placed there. The elections are rigged; he wouldn't be president if he wasn't supposed to be. He's not our guy.

            I don't think ANYONE believes Trump could fix everything. I don't believe his leaked Mexico call says anything that we didn't already know about him. He still wanted to build the wall. Our government is fucked as long as bribes are legal imho.

               You mentioned BRIBES, which is NOT the subject here and suggests generalized CORRUPTION.  While that exists, that is NOT the topic being discussed right now.

               Trump is a JEW of ROYAL BLOOD.  He will advance the Illuminati agenda like every other POTUS, including JFK before he rebelled and was taken out.  There is NO BRIBERY involved in that.

                Corruption comes from the legalized bribing (lobbying). If only you had some evidence that Trump was a "Jew of Royal Blood". You could change my mind.

                 Nobody would deny that lobbying is a problem.  Lobbyists, however, are NOT at the pinnacle of power.  And the GLOBAL agenda is NOT accomplished with mere lobbying.

                <p>
                 Trump is a Tribe of Dan crypto Jew.  He and Hitlery are COUSINS, and their lines are so intertwined that those knowledgeable in presidential genealogy were unable to predict WHICH one would "win" &lt;cough cough&gt; the "election."  (The "victor" is the one with the most royal blood.  That has been the case in every POTUS election since the 1789 (s)election of George Washington.)

                 You can start here.  Burke's Peerage is an unimpeachable source.  They do the genealogy for Buckingham Palace (peerage being a HUGE DEAL over there).

                 EVERY POTUS has been from at least 1 of 3 royal bloodlines, 2 English and 1 French.  Most are of more than 1 line.

                  They share the same 18th grandparents? How many millions of other people also do? You should check your own lineage. You're probably related to them as well. When you said cousins I crazily assumed you meant first cousin. This is incredibly common, I'm a descendant of several royal bloodlines.

            great sentiment.  also trump's is status quo on mid east policies that benefit intl userers and other interests (as opposed to the american ppl) such as attacking syria "cuz his daughter wanted him to" over highly questionable claims about genocide and despite saying doing so was insane a yr or two ago
