            This is ridiculous. I bet the people are pissed. He’s accused by 5 men! FIVE!
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Murray resigned as mayor in September after five men had come forward to accuse him of molestation they say occurred decades ago when they were teens. He has rejected all of the accusations of abuse.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The CITY will pay to settle a lawsuit. The perverted MAYOR ISN’T PAYING IT! Not only that, he continues to deny the accusations like a coward. They even say it allows Mr. Heckard to move forward with his life. Well isn’t that special...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The city of Seattle will pay $150,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by Delvonn Heckard, one of five men this year to publicly accuse former Mayor Ed Murray of sexual abuse decades ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             “With this settlement, the City takes an important step in putting this sad chapter behind us, limiting litigation expenses, and allowing Mr. Heckard to move forward with his life,” City Attorney Pete Holmes said in the city’s statement Saturday evening.
            </p>
            <p>
             Murray agreed to the settlement, but in his own statement continued to deny the allegations: “The lawsuit was painful for me, my husband, my family, and my former staff because the allegations were untrue. I did not molest or have any sexual contact with the plaintiff.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Murray will not pay any part of the settlement, but he is responsible for covering his own legal fees, Holmes said.
            </p>

            Changing --
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for these reminders -- despite the sadness and horror --
           </p>
           <p>
            Just want to remind us all  -- as we see in the details of The Presido sexual abuse and every other
kind of abuse inflicted upon the children in day care at more than 30 military bases, including West 
Point and Fort Dix -- that the perpetrators made sure that the acts were so outrageous as to cause 
any normal human being to shy away from the stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well we did for a very long time --- but evidence kept bringing us back to these stories in an
effort to try to help the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            We didn't ignore the outrageous acts we read about -- we faced them.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we're coming to understand that "Satanism" is merely a cover story for 
the violence of the human beings involved in MKULTRA and in sex trafficking
and as a cover for their perversions.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no Satan -- no Devil -- no Demons.
These are the inventions of organized patriarchal religions which underpin Elite patriarchy.
The violence is real -- but the "boogey-men" are created to frighten us and to stop us from
investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not happening any more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every human being is capable of fascism and seeking control over others,
of forcing their ideas on others -- of violence and evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we are facing is organized evil.

             Let's also remind ourselves that much of the news over these past years has
been about the RCC and their pedophile priests sexually abusing children ...
and the way the RCC protected those pedophiles, not only by protecting their
crimes but also by protecting them by transferring them from one parish to 
another where more innocent children could be sexually abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             Italians have also confirmed for us that sexual abuse in the RCC has been going on
since the first days of the RCC - 2,000 years!

            Don't mind me, just documenting the Posts you allow as a Contrast to the Information you're trying to suppress. Why you're trying to suppress anything? I can not say. I can say, that if I fucked children. I would I try to suppress information that would ultimately lead to exposure of every establishment in the country that is involved in the systematic fucking of children as well as, Well the other heinous topics that aren't allowed on your pizza party forum.
           </p>

            But listen. Just because that's what you're doing, doesn't mean you personally fuck children. I don't know what It would mean.... But I'm sure that has to be at leats two reasons for doing what you're doing.... Right?
