            The hearings probes and sessions are an attempt to portray a working system and prosecution for wrong doing is always a possibility. That is false. It never happens. Ever. Stop wasting your time with this show. Trump is not an enemy of the media. Wake up. They are playing chess and you guys are playing Candyland. Now wonder they rule over us and have no fear.  They are smarter and have memories.

             Trump is correct that directed energy weapons were used on 9/11 and this is the Free Energy technology Podesta is pretending has been sent by aliens.  Alright?  Sitting comfortably?  Good.

             George Soros runs Tavistock
            </p>
            <p>
             Tavistock developed the CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA engineered the 1960s via drugs. Tavistock engineered The Beatles. The Beatles promoted Crowley The Movement promoted promiscuity, liberalism and ended in the darkness of The Manson Murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy Leary wrote "How to wash brains" with Robert Anton Wilson. Timothy Leary is suspected to be CIA and spent time in the same prison as Manson prior to any of the alleged murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Beatles went to India with Mia Farrow (B- blood), who played the role of Rosemary, in Rosemary's Baby about the birth of the antichrist.
            </p>
            <p>
             The film was directed to Roman Polanski, his wife is Sharon Tate, who was murdered by the Manson family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rosemary's Baby was filmed in The Dakota Building, where John Lennon was shot.
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry Kissinger's favourite film is "Chinatown", directed by Roman Polanski. It features someone wit the same Mark Of Cain that Madeleine McCann displayed in her photos.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Oscar's this year, saw the star of Chinatown being humiliated and instead, a cast member of another film, who has a significant Mongolion Spot (blue birth-mark) was awarded.

            Trump dropped hints that Muslims and Saudis did 9/11 making him a liar and a traitor. He thinks his pal Larry Silverstein is a great guy and a victim. Stop following this zionist insider and this phony battle between Trump and the Deep State. They put him there. Zero arrest made. No investigation. No special prosecuter for Hillary.

             Just so you know, Trump is on video saying there is no way the planes took down the towers due to strength iof construction.  Clearly says bombs involved (on video)...also estimated Silverstein lost $1.5B when all was said and done-despite the insurance renewal.  Not saying you are wrong about Trump, just pointing out some mitigating factors...you can reference the above via YouTube

              You are dead wrong. Trump did a limited hangout. He said the Muslims were celebrating but it was the dancing Israelis who admitted to being Mossad agents. Trump confused? They had a mural on their van of a plane flying towards the twin towers. Trump miss that? No plane hit the third building and Trump never mentioned that. He forgot? Trump suggested the Saudis might be behind it. Not Mossad and CIA. Silverstein owned them for months and then all three buildings he purchased came down. Lucky Lucky man. Trump is his buddy and didn't notice any impropriety. Oh, and he was at Epsteins Island because that's where outsiders not part of the club go. Sometimes those not in the cult are given a peek. What is wrong with you guys? I am the enemy of these creeps, but you guys just don't cut it. It's just so confusing isn't it? He spent his entire life in bed with these evil scum and part of their society, and they put on a show to pretend he is an outsider fighting for us, and you gusy buy it. If not, why this thread? Unbelieveable. Hint, nobody is sweating any hearings or investigations on either "side". I won't always be here to baby sit you junior. Please grow up fast.

               Its common knowledge that (old Mossad) and Saudis are in bed together including 9/11.  Trump may or may not be aware of this.  Trump acknowledged that the planes couldn't bring down the towers on video...this includes 7 WTC.  Silverstein took out an insurance policy on the buildings months before and renewed a 99 year land lease months before.  He owned them for a long time prior to that.  It is estimated that with the Insurance payouts and the construction of Freedom Tower, Silverstein lost over $1.5B.  Not so lucky.  Trump was at Epstein island and has rubbed shoulders with elite pedosatanists...so have a lot of rich people who aren't compromised.  Trump also banned Epstein from Mar a Lago for trying to solicit sex from one of its members kids.
I think a lot of people on VOAT are hoping Trump is not compromised and will do something about the elite corruption but retain a healthy level of skepticism.  What I and others find annoying is the level of certitude with which users here State their claims and theories-even despite evidence to the contrary.  I am not saying you are wrong about Trump, but what I am saying is that at this point it is too early to state these claims with the level of certitude you have (the egotistical bravado also mitigates your stated goal).

             Trump is correct that directed energy weapons were used on 9/11 and this is the Free Energy technology Podesta is pretending has been sent by aliens.  Alright?  Sitting comfortably?  Good.

             George Soros runs Tavistock
            </p>
            <p>
             Tavistock developed the CIA
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA engineered the 1960s via drugs. Tavistock engineered The Beatles. The Beatles promoted Crowley The Movement promoted promiscuity, liberalism and ended in the darkness of The Manson Murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timothy Leary wrote "How to wash brains" with Robert Anton Wilson. Timothy Leary is suspected to be CIA and spent time in the same prison as Manson prior to any of the alleged murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Beatles went to India with Mia Farrow (B- blood), who played the role of Rosemary, in Rosemary's Baby about the birth of the antichrist.
            </p>
            <p>
             The film was directed to Roman Polanski, his wife is Sharon Tate, who was murdered by the Manson family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rosemary's Baby was filmed in The Dakota Building, where John Lennon was shot.
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry Kissinger's favourite film is "Chinatown", directed by Roman Polanski. It features someone wit the same Mark Of Cain that Madeleine McCann displayed in her photos.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Oscar's this year, saw the star of Chinatown being humiliated and instead, a cast member of another film, who has a significant Mongolion Spot (blue birth-mark) was awarded.

               Tony Podesta studied at MIT before working with Henry Kissinger, at the time Nixon was ousted.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hunter S Thompson hated Nixon, and has been said to have watched snuff films by a journalists who stayed with him for a time.
              </p>
              <p>
               "I studied at MIT," Podesta explains, "but, uh, I didn't bother to take computer science." He did, however, pick up enough by the late 1980s to realize that seemingly unbridgeable cultural differences were blocking a potential alliance between Washington and Silicon Valley.
               <a href="https://www.wired.com/1998/12/podesta/">
                https://www.wired.com/1998/12/podesta/
               </a>
               So we have Tony Podesta as the one who bridges the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington, who works/worked with Kissinger, who is speculated to be the handler of Sarah Palin.

             I thought Sessions recused himself from the Hillary probe...no idea he did with Russia.  I would guess Sessions establishment buddies got to him and said we need leverage over Trump.  I think Trump should replace Sessions with someone that will get rid of Mueller/McCabe and go after the Pedos

             i dont know why everyone has to downvote because they disagree. dont make your mind up about these people or the narrative. just something to consider. pizza gaters are intentionally being misled by the MSM as well as other conspiracy theorists. you really think hannity is on our side here? no, its a show to convince you. these people are not in power because they are stupid.

              I haven't seen the MSM report much about pizzagate since, well since last year.  (random story random date)  From what I can tell pizzagate continues because of the research that has outed pedos / websites / etc.  The Seth Rich investigation continues because truly he did not deserve to be killed.  And if you believe that Clinton had nothing to do with it then you are living in your own delusional world.  But that's okay, you go right on.

              The misleading part of the Seth Rich story is that Guccifer hacked those emails. Are you saying you believe Podesta that his emails we're hacked by the Russians? hahaha

            Wow, so he talked about Comey, McCabe, Mueller, and his 15 min. talk with Putin about adoption  He sounds disappointed in Sessions for recusing himself, but I think it is a possibility that Sessions has been threatened.  Oh, yeah, and that little thing about the shooting in the back.

            I'm surprised the times printed all that. Second half of the article was way more interesting than the first half...It is noted that Trump brought up conflicts of interest with Rosenstein, Mueller and McCabe too.
