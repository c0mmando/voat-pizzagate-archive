<p>This is Part 1 of a 5 Part Series of my conversation with &quot;Emma&quot;, her name and company she worked for with her husband has been redacted for her and her children\'s safety. In this first segment, Emma explains first meeting her husband and then a few years later finding out his dark secret. He was obsessively collecting and creating hardcore porn as well as pornography involving children and animals. His obsession with gaining power by learning about and joining the so-called &quot;Illuminati&quot; after 9/11 was the first signal to Emma that her husband may be up to something sinister, and it goes much much deeper. Emma is currently in an undisclosed location and just yesterday had to flee with her boyfriend to another state, yet again.</p>
<p>In the 4 upcoming segments of this interview, Emma discusses the code words her husband uses on the web that corroborate with the FBI Code Words, along with images and words used in the Pizzagate scandal, Podesta and STRATFOR emails. She shares other code words that most of us may not be familiar with and also other techniques that elite rings use to market child porn covertly on the internet. Stay tuned for Part 2.</p>',

            I came to look at this post today and couldn't find it ANYWHERE in HOT or TOP.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have had the same thing happen twice to a specific post about a week ago.  only galvanized me and now I am making a monster post about the same topic - a rebuttal to The Intercept's whitewash of the "exonerated" convicted SRA abusers the Kellers - please look for it at the end of the week Honeybee.
           </p>
           <h2>
            So my main message to you is - you still reach people when you post on Voat but when it drops off the first page especially if it has elements of SRA in my opinion, it gets shadowbanned or "lost".   It can't be found again unless someone searches for it by specific words in the headline or has a comment under it and can search their own comments.  That's how I got here today, just 1 day later.   So DON'T BY SHY ABOUT REPOSTING REPOSTING REPOSTING every few days.  It's fine and even necessary now.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Now Im going to watch the interview.  Thank you in advance for this.  -VB

            Good to have a seal on our side. But it seems like he, as nice and intelligent as he seems, has much to learn about the old families and their reasons for child trafficking. He better keep a real good eye on those he has allegedly formerly worked for,  particularly the Templar Knights in the Seal program. Is he not aware of the fraternity that bred him?

            Interesting to hear that Kevin Shipp on the same video corroborate that LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOTICING THAT THE ELITE ARE using satanism as a tool to produce multi personalitied mk's

            No. Scripture isn't "all from god" unless you mean the false god. Go research the history of that book and good ol' King James the freemason.

            This is bullshit!
           </p>
           <p>
            People are are IN HIDING DO NOT give out names of former employers, companies they worked for, etc.  It would be TOO EASY for them to be IDed based upon those FACTS.  Also, it gives away the location(s) where they worked/lived.  Even if they have moved away from those locations, knowing those FACTS would help confirm their identity.

            The actual interview begins at 03:05.  The first few minutes are gushing over Honeybee.

            Thank you again Honeybee for all that you do.   I have a feeling you are going to get more people to come forward with their stories after hearing this.

            Edit. Ok i had to stop listening when she said something like god  acted through her. Everyone who thinks that god is in direct contact with them is a looney in my books.

             Atheist here. My agnostic wife had an episode in which she heard a voice in her head telling her something important in her life. It said "This is where you need to be,"  as she was entering a Unitarian church. She was not mentally ill or high.  I can easily see how someone religious could hear such a voice and attribute it to God.  My wife did not.  She just said she heard a voice.  (Some Unitarian churchgoers are agnostic. This particular church later turned down a prospective pastor for being "too theistic".)

            Wow! Thanks so much honeybee. Looking forward to watching this later when I can. Please send this woman our deepest thanks for speaking out. If the community can help protect her in anyway, please let us know. I'm hoping she has some concrete proof she can share with you to hopefully keep her safe.
