Because of PizzaGate, somehow I got interested in Kubrick again. I don\'t know how to say this, but I know a secret. Not even 10 days ago I looked on youtube and watched a version 3 hours and 15 minutes long. I also found a single article in reddit where a guy claims he made the greatest discovery about Eyes Wide Shut. Apparently, nobody followed up. I thought it was strange what he was suggesting, so I tried it. Many others in the chatroom had a difficulty with what he said in finding corroborating evidence. Either that or they were just shills paid to protect the truth.
Either way, I tried to ascertain if what this guy said was true. Here is a link to the original article. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/305ks1/i_think_i_have_made_the_greatest_discovery_about/">https://www.reddit.com/r/StanleyKubrick/comments/305ks1/i_think_i_have_made_the_greatest_discovery_about/</a> His thesis aligns itself with what we know of Kubrick\'s Shining, remember, &quot;the Shining&quot; meant the ability to say something without actually saying it.</p>
<p>There are two part in the movie where Kubrick made it clear how it was that he would transmit the information that he had to give us before they killed him for it. The Rainbow is a mirror of sorts. Under the Rainbow is the other side of this mirror. Things are opposite in the mirror, thus Kidmans Eyes wide open in the shot looking into the mirror, the opposite of the title. Look, Cruise tears up a hundred dollar bill and hands it to the taxi driver. This happened on the version I watched @ 1:29:29. The length of the film I saw was about 3 hours and 15 minutes. At 2:59:57 seconds on the version I watched last week on youtube, (the version was subsequently taken down), Tom Cruise and Sydney Pollack exchange a ripped piece of newspaper. This happened almost exactly doubling the number of when the dollar was ripped and handed to the taxi driver. I thought that this was a serious indication that this man was right, mathematically speaking, I found it more than a coincidence that these two incidences happened at the exact same time. The passing of the torn item was telling us to re-cut the film at the locations he was telling us to.</p>
<p>You see, the two parties in Eyes Wide Shut were set up so that they revealed things which Kubrick could not say. Yes we know he was talking about satanic human sacrifice, but what else was he saying? Well, who was behind it ? Kidman asks \'who were those two girls?&quot; Well we know one as a Windsor and the other related to Rockefeller somehow. They are in the house of Rothschild while these Satanic happenings are occurring. Clear references to the Star of Ishtar (pronounced &quot;Easter&quot;), and Christmas trees throughout, yet when the movie begins we can see Cruise passing a banner reading &quot;Happy holidays&quot;.
The h in holidays was purposely made small. The reason for this is clear. In Christian versions of these &quot;Holidays&quot; God is smelled God with a capital G. Only the pagan version of &quot;god&quot; is smelled with a lower case g. Thus Kubrick is trying to tell us that these are the pagan versions of the holiday. Pagan versions of this holiday featured that these symbols were part of a Saturnian theme of human sacrifice. The Christmas tree and Easter are both seen as representing fertility and human sacrifice.</p>
<p>So I set up two versions of the movie and played them side by side, and I cannot remember everything and cannot refer to my notes because I decided to watch it once over without taking any notes. But here is what I remember and what I thought in my mind proved that this was exactly the &quot;Shining&quot; that Kubrick was trying to avail to us. There were about 6 or 7 of these occurrences which said that blatantly this is exactly what he intended to do. I can only remember 2 out of these occurrences so I will leave them here with you all. But needless to say, these instances convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p>The scenes of Kidman in black in white being seduced by the Navy guy she was fantasizing about came on and played at the same exact time. It gave me chills.</p>
<p>Nuala Windsor is the same exact girl in the mask which can be seen in the edited version at 1:20:00 minutes. She was literally looking at Cruise in the same exact way at the same exact time as Nuala Windsor was looking at Cruise in the movie. Kubrick was trying to tell us that Windsor, the English Royalty is behind these Satanic Cults, along with Rothschild and Rockefeller. By using a real man and wife as the couple, he is telling us that this is real life, not a movie.</p>
<p>I apologize for not being smart enough to make a copy, I was not aware I was watching the actual Kubrick version. It\'s out there people. The real one. I watched it. They took the video down because of what it was, authentic and meaning revealing.
Who are those people and what are they doing ? Kubrick is SHINING us the truth.</p>
<p>p.s. The Shining is about faking the Apollo 11 moon landing. Once you understand this you will understand some of the methods Kubrick uses to Shine us the truth. p.s.s. Children of the Corn is a similar mirror written by Stephen King in 1984, where Children are ritualistically giving up their parents to &quot;Malachi&quot;. Malachi is the God Moloch. If you switch this around, like when &quot;No Gas&quot; is written in the window backwards one could see the word &quot;Sagon&quot;, another word for the Devil. What was King trying to tell us ? Wasn\'t he really trying to tell us that it is parents who are giving up their children to Moloch in a form of Satanic Worship ? I think so. Once you understand how Kubrick shines, the movies take on a life and story that can only be revealed by using a code to trying to understand what it is exactly that Kubrick is Shining.</p>
<p>The rainbow represents a covenant with God as it did in the old testament. &quot;Where the rainbow ends&quot; is the silence one must keep as part of a covenant with the Devil. Where the rainbow ends is a covenant with Satan. Thus, when Cruise knows whats really going on and he sees a Christmas Tree in his home, he shuts the lights off. The rainbow, represented as all the colors on the tree, representing the covenant with God has ended, and the covenant with god/Satan has begun.</p>
<p>Also of interest. There is a specific place that was located in the movie, &quot;Back Fence&quot;. It used to be located <a href="https://voat.co/user/155">@155</a> Bleeker Street, NY NY. As we see, nearly everything that happens in the movie happens on this street , as is revealed by the very images of the mirrors/windows of the Rainbow Rentals reveals. Bleeker St means roughly &quot;being beyond hope&quot;. Without any hope. It is a real place, because it is reality.</p>
<p>Further, Sonata Cafe means &quot;its not a cafe&quot;. You have to say it fast to get the meaning. You can also see the implicitness of this in the fact by the juxtaposition of &quot;Gillespie Cafe&quot; and &quot;Sonata Cafe&quot;. At the Sonata we have Jazz, where at Gillespie\'s you see actual cafeteria setting. Gillespie\'s is named after one of the greatest Jazz musicians Dizzy Gillespie, and yet they are playing Jazz not at Gillespie\'s but at the Sonata. &quot;It\'s not a cafe&quot;. He is telling us. So what is it ? Look into the mirror again at Rainbow Rentals and you will see that it is a &quot;Diner&quot;. That is, people are dying and they are being eaten. Satanic Cannibalism. &quot;Its not a cafe, its a diner&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, once you see that almost everything is happening on Bleeker St, you will realize that there was no reason for Cruise to take the trip in the taxi other than for Kubrick to show us to cut the movie, just as he tore up the 100 dollar bill. I\'ll give you half now and half later we are told. In the Shining, he crashed the red beetle with the semi for one reason, he was not telling Stephen King\'s version of the story, he had a different story to tell us entirely.</p>
<p>Kubrick Shines as the Greatest Director and Story teller of all time. Period.</p>
<p>Sonata Cafe, its a Die ner. Its not Easter, its Ishtar. Its not Christmas, and Santa isn\'t Santa.</p>
<p>happy Holidays indeed !</p>

           His thesis aligns itself with what we know of Kubrick's Shining, remember, "the Shining" meant the ability to say something without actually saying it.

           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/155">

           Bleeker Street, NY NY.

            If Bill's daughter is the key to this movie, it makes for an absolutely horrifying twist heightened by the likelyhood that Kubrick chose Tom and Nicole because they were a real life couple symbolizing that the movie is actually REAL LIFE. In the wake of the Pizzagate scandal I am physically sick when I think about it.

            Interesting, but the link provided is just a slowed down version of the original..

            I don't think anyone will have the version Stanley Kubrick showed to Warner Bros. before he died 4 days later :(

            Okay... but isn't that where the problem originates? Like, isn't anti-Christ
            <em>
             anything

            considered to be inherently evil?
