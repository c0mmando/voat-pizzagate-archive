Well I think the stuff you guys just found on the shipping issue is HUGE!  And huge to their operation, and extremely important and necessary.

<p>I saw the new post yesterday on Charles Ortel and all his information on the CF.  Here\'s an excellent YT by him:</p>

<p>Some of us had posted about his work a while ago, but most people probably didn\'t see it.  I DO think, going by what the anon kept stressing, concentrate on the CF, that it really IS just as important, in getting some action.  I\'m sure the anon has worked with pedos for years, and knows the probability of anything being done about it, or what is most likely the biggest smoking gun.    Also, if you haven\'t seen the Mr. Cati YT on his observations of the killroom, it\'s definitely worth watching.  Remember, we don\'t think like these evil people, so it\'s hard if not impossible to rationalize what they do.  But one of his main points was to look at the TRANSPORTING of kids, right in DC, and TO these locations.  No matter where the actual killroom is, there have got to be routines and many transports of kids on a regular basis.</p>',

             But unfortunately I don't think they will stop.  Remember HC freaking out at a staffer, referring to them ending up in nooses???  Even HER superiors have everything to lose, so cost is no concern to them to keep the status quo.

             Just now Rush Limbaugh (even if you don't like him) is discussing first that if he didn't know better, he'd think they are trying to 'Watergate' Trump's election...
