             I've gone through the google chrome cached file's before to resolve something like this. Do I need to try Mozilla?  When I've got the cached page then I can point fingers for sure. Please save me a few hours work just buy saying yep we deleted it - you triggered the LGBTI's again too much as usual and we made a moderation decision.

            Can someone summarize why they think this is a false flag because the chief of staff of the ex- Congressman from Charlottesville was at a giant  national political event in Charlottesville????
Wouldn't you expect political types to witness this?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Brennan Gilmore being there is an odd coinkydink.

           <p>
            Like this comment just seems silly.  No he's not a coincidence, it was a big public rally and  he went to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what was unusual about his being there?  The former Congressman was there too.  If Nazis came to my hood, I would certainly be there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, fuck, these shitheads led a torchlit March screaming Blood and Soul through the streets of Charlottesville the night before?  You think folks wouldn't change their Saturday plans?

             Right on cue AreWeSure shows up to allay any suspicion a contractor for THE STATE DEPARTMENT is through random chance the first person chosen by the media to interview at an event eerily similar to a "Nazi" "white power" march in Ukraine right before their democratically elected government was overthrown by
             <s>
              a Soros funded NGO
             </s>
             Fascists.
            </p>
            <p>
             And we're talking almost identical right down to the same slogan which was, ding ding ding, "Blood and Soil". That's right AreWeSure they weren't shouting "Blood and Soul" they were shouting "Blood and
             <strong>
              SOIL
             </strong>

                No.  It's not.   It's not even worth discussing it with you, because your sense of what Smith Mundt is and what the 2012 change did is so whacked.   It's like I told you that the Boston Celtics will not win the World Series this year and you want to argue about how good the players are.  It's really not going to be fruitful.

                This whole goofiness is based on the fact that NY Times published an article on the 12 and then updated and edited the article.  Have you not noticed this before?  This happens all the time with breaking story.  You claim the edits were to no longer mention this guy WHO NO LONGER WORKS at the State Department.  (Did that slip by you?

                <p>
                 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — A planned protest in Virginia by white nationalists was abandoned on Saturday after a spate of violence prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency and law enforcement officers to clear the area.
The demonstration, which both organizers and critics had said was the largest gathering of white nationalists in recent years, turned violent almost immediately and left at least one person dead and a number of people injured. “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here,” Mayor Mike Signer, said on social media.
In comments from Bedminster, New Jersey, President Donald Trump condemned the violence and called for the swift restoration of order. “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,” he said.

                <p>
                 The city of Charlottesville was engulfed by violence Saturday as white nationalists and counterprotesters clashed in one of the bloodiest fights to date over the removal of Confederate monuments across the South.
                </p>
                <p>
                 White nationalists had long planned a demonstration over the city’s decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee. But the rally quickly exploded into racial taunting, shoving and outright brawling, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency and the National Guard to join police in clearing the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those skirmishes mostly resulted in cuts and bruises. But after the rally at a city park was dispersed, a car bearing Ohio license plates traveling at a "high rate of speed" plowed into a line of cars, in an episode that left a 32-year-old woman dead and injured at least 19 other people who were protesting a rally staged by white nationalists. Some 34 others were injured; at least 19 in the crash, according to a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Center.

                There is literally no evidence that the State Department was involved in any way with this rally.  An ex-State Department employee who LIVES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE filmed and tweeted about the event.  Then he was interviewed about what he witnessed.

                 Besides there's tons of other evidence. The driver's mother is a paraplegic but didn't have a handicap license plate. Yes she could have had a placard on her rear view mirror but the standard these days is getting it on your license plate so it doesn't block your, ding ding ding, field of view.

                  You still haven't provided any evidence the State Department was involved.  You don't even seem to understand that.  You also can't make up evidence of State Department involvement.  Question, what evidence have provided that the State Department knew anything about what Gilmore was doing, let alone had any influence on it?
My original statement still stands "There is literally no evidence that the State Department was involved"

                  "Handling PR?"   I'm not sure you actually understand  what PR entails.    Any citizen.  Even one who worked for the State Department or a Charlottesville congressman can have a twitter feed and videoblog on it.   That's not PR.

                  If you have any evidence whatsoever that the State Department knew of and was involved in what he did please provide it.  If you do not, we can safely ignore your claims as evidence free.

                   You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the process works. People like you and me, witnesses, bystanders, even police detectives make observations. We gather raw evidence. If there's enough evidence then a District Attorney would step in with a subpoena and do some real digging for the concrete evidence you're looking for. You demanding concrete evidence FROM ME is almost laughable.

                     You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the process works. People like you and me, witnesses, bystanders, even police detectives make observations. We gather raw evidence. If there's enough evidence then a District Attorney would step in with a subpoena and do some real digging for the concrete evidence you're looking for. You demanding concrete evidence FROM ME is almost laughable.

                     You've made this same mistake time and time again here. It's more of the same: "Nothing to see here folks. Move along!". You're not getting paid to "Resist!" here

                       That's like if we're two detectives working in DC and someone is killed by a sniper. We find out the license plate of a car seen leaving the area belongs to former Army sniper

            DarkMath, I thought you were better than this. The website you give is the website for the entire school district not Sandy Hook specifically, and they were using another website during that time. While I do believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Sandy Hook was closed by that time, this is a bunk argument. Also, I told you months ago that Sandy Hook was fake and you completely ignored me, told me you didn't believe it, and said you weren't willing to do the research. Otherwise, this was a good post. Youre a 10% shill, we all know it.

             I did and I'm sorry. I really apologize from the bottom of my heart. Back then I still believed the U.S. Government wasn't literally an all powerful organized crime syndicate with nukes.

                 Not really, for the year 2012 right before the "shooting" the school district web site was active while the Sandy Hook site was not. That sort of debunks your theory.

            I think this faction is just starting to really gather steam.  Someone had posted on Twitter a pic from Charlottesville of a protester dress as White Supremacist and then covered his shield, etc. and was then dresseded as Antifa protester.  You could see his shield w/emblem peeking through under a black cover.  These are Soros groups. Trying to divide us so we will fight each other and not them. The 8500 who rule the world.

              He is basically an Obama puppet.  He is schooled in the Saul Alinsky thought process.  Marc was taking millennial groups over to Israel to train with the
Palestinians.  Chaos and division is one of the Rules.

              (Rules for Radicals) He was convincing these kids that groups like BLM, etc., are similar to others in the world and they need to train for protests in the streets, gorilla tactics, etc. I think these overseas training camps are 6 wks long.  He keeps churning them out so to divide the sheeple and not notice how the New World Order's of taking away more and more of our rights.

             It hasn't been repealed because DarkMath is lying to you about it is.   He doesn't know he is lying because he is an exceedinly gullible sort and he swallowed this Smith Mundt Act thing Hook, Line and Sinker.

             This is the sort of thing Smith-Mundt authorizes.  Remember when Donald Trump JR met the Russians in Trump Tower. And American's learned a bunch of names they never heard before?  A year before that this profile of one them was published by RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty

              "Public Diplomacy Broadcasts" and pass it off as real within the MSM then I stand guilty.
             </p>
             <p>
              For those playing along at home the original Smith-Mundt act of 1947 was passed by congress to keep what had become a massive propaganda industry during the war from staying in business by targeting a domestic audience. You must remember at the time America's economy was on a war footing and there was ample incentive to keep it on one. Had Smith-Mundt not been passed you could easily have seen a daily struggle to capture the public's attention using dishonest half-truths to highlight one issue over another.

                I see you're familiar with the sanitized explanation of the Smith-Mundt "Modernization" Act of 2012:
                <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/">
                 http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/
                </a>
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 A former U.S. government source with knowledge of the BBG says the organization is no Pravda, but it does advance U.S. interests in more subtle ways. In Somalia, for instance, VOA serves as counterprogramming to outlets peddling anti-American or jihadist sentiment. "Somalis have three options for news," the source said, "word of mouth, al-Shabab, or VOA Somalia."
                </p>
                <p>
                 This partially explains the push to allow BBG broadcasts on local radio stations in the United States. The agency wants to reach diaspora communities, such as St. Paul, Minnesota’s significant Somali expat community.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                I could give two fucks about the U.S. Government countering Al Shabab propaganda. The problem is there's no clear distinction between what is domestic opinion and what is Russian "propaganda" for example. All the State Department would need to justify countering someone like George Webb is to show the Russian's were pushing the same news story.
               </p>
               <p>
                And worse there doesn't even need to be a foreign narrative for the State Department to produce domestic propaganda. All they need is to start a campaign to counter "violent extremism" (sound familiar) somewhere outside the United States. They can put on a hoax "Nazi" white supremacist march in Charlottesville Virginia and pass it off as real in the foreign press and voila the State Dept is "countering violent extremism" abroad.

            The very beginning saw 150 or so white dudes when only 6 antidemonstrators had arrived, but theyre not stupid enough to take bait.

            So after their "THE GOYIM KNOW!" chant the Jays had no choice: they needed death to put this in the news cycle all week and put Trump on the defensive after a huge underreported popular immigration bill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing is more important by their own admission to the Jays than immigration, because birthrates do their job for them and we will soon be a balkanized nation of large minorities unable to decide our own fates and completely distrusting of other groups because it will be thought that their gain is your loss.

              People self segregate by race at every legally permitted opportunity -- because theyre inveterate racists, no doubt.  Prisons, churches, school lunchrooms, neighborhood and marriage included.

               I forgot to mention about the race stuff a city is always going to expose you to other cultures even though you live locally with people of your same race. When you go on the subway, bus etc you mix with other races. My point earlier about you moving out of the city is it would help lower your blood pressure vis a vis "The Jews!(tm)".
              </p>
              <p>
               I lived up in Cambridge MA for years in between Harvard and MIT in  place called Central Square. I loved it but I can see how if you were a Nazi you'd get real sick of it given all the brown people there or in your case all "The Jews!(tm)".

               Move out to Eastern Pennsylvania. I wouldn't recommend you try New Jersey or Long Island for obvious reasons. But in Eastern Pennsylvania you could still take the train into the city if you missed the hood. White people abandoned the city for a reason it's stressful. They'd welcome you in a place like Pennsylvania or maybe parts of Connecticut. I don't know what you do for a living. If you've got money try one of the old

               like Darien or New Canaan. They let in blacks now. Or try Norwalk or Bridgeport if you're on a budget. How do you feel about Hispanics?

                Thanks for explaining what a city is you stupid old BITCH.  You dont need to have ever met a Jew to know what they're about and be against them.

                A member of the JApanese parliament even wrote a boom about Jewish global domination and it was a best seller. They are fascinated by it because their religion ALSO believes theyre destined to take over the world or some shit.

            I had a funny feeling about this as soon as I saw McAuliffes face on TV. With each passing day I became more convinced. Also, the protesters at those Antifa protests during the summer reminded me of the protests all around the country after the event. Folks, do not let them get away with this. They are trying to separate and divide us. Don't let them. In order to beat them down we have to stay united. Now yes, how about that LP# I feel it has been used before maybe at another event? That car could belong to the CIA, after all we are in Virginia. And WTH is Paul Ryan doing down there. Hmm.

             Interesting compilation of observations...I archived it.  The pic at the bottom is missing because it's a video, but it shows the driver's mom with her car in the garage.  There's a comment, "In addition to the mother having the world's oddest reaction about hearing her son mow people down, they also have a car with a GVF 1122 plate?  That's weird.  Much like the sun roof, probably not important... but made me keep looking and that's when I stumbled upon Brennan."

              GVF 1111 Was trending on Twitter today in a big way.  Someone on Twitter hinted it might be a Vanity Plate of some kind.  Could GV Stand for Government Vehicle?  His Mother struck me as some type of Air Head.

                 LOL!  I had read a vehicle registration on the car that someone posted, thought it was in the link.  Anyway, that document stated that the car had a sun/moon roof.  The car in Charlottesville had the same license plate, but no sun roof.  I thought maybe it was a typo or mistake.

                 Edit:  Scroll down the link...it's there (the vehicle registration)

                    I am thinking GVF is the company and 1111 and 1122 is maybe employee number or just a number for the car...either one or the person's code #.

                     Looks like more digging is a foot.  It never ends lol.

                    <p>
                     Wanted to share this though it's not on topic...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And along the lines of 'digging' I typed in Samantha Bloom...and Deja Vu!  That name is also the name of an actor.  Recently I mentioned how I had lost track of how many times looking into Antifa/BAMN related events and people, I've tried searching a name and the search turns up an actor by the same name (sometimes making the search a pain because of too many pages of actor related hits).  Most recently, a name tied to Guccifer 2.0 situation, turned up as the same name of a famous Communist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So it's no surprise really to find that the actor Samantha Bloom:

                     During one part of his life he "was involved in revolutionary movement with then underground Communist Party of Russia. Because of his association with communists he was arrested three times.."
Later in his life he not only opposed the mainstream official Soviet culture but  "Mayakovsky went to extremes, he called to trash all history and traditional culture, such as the 19th century writers Alexander Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy, as well as classical art."

                      I have something interesting about the Fringe Festival if I find it.  Some nutbag is doing a play and traveling around with it, it is trying to soften the views about Pedophiles.  Fringe is featuring it and I am thoroughly disgusted.  I just found this out so let me try to dig it up.

              Thanks.  But the thing I am worried about is convincing others about these False Flags.  My husband believes about all the missing children, trafficking, etc.  But this morning as we went for a walk I brought up the possibility that Charlotte was a False Flag, and he said everything in life is not a False Flag.  ARGHH!!  Well, I will have to keep working on that.  I must admit he is more gullible than I am.  I pretty much question everything.  This event though just Screams False Flag.

                Yeah, well I think he's getting a little jealous of my time on voat  :) so that could be the problem.  Will have to do something about that. Sometimes convincing those closest to us is even harder.

                  Since this happened not too far from me, I knew it was to divide us further. McAwfull wants to deliver a dem governor back in the state mansion. What better way than to broadcast over an over and over this sad day in Charlottesville.  The Republican candidate does not want the statues removed.

                  So, you see what happens? And, the girl who was run over....her go fund me page has already garnered 200k. A friend's family is on the police force there. They are unsure why they were told by the governor to stand down. This was not a local funded or organized protest. And, Charlottesville is extremely liberal because of so many Hollywood types and the University professors.  Remember the talk of the purple revolution after hillary lost? I think this part of it and Soros-funded. Warren Buffet owns the papers in town, Bloomberg is pals with McAwfull and have tried to figure out ways to limit 2A. In the state. So, so many ways this has played into their hands. I would not be surprised to find out that both sides are on the same side and funded by the same people.
