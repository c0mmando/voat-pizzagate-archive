            Just a reminder of how it is known that Besta has a basement:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/RMGGSY0A8r8?t=259">
             https://youtu.be/RMGGSY0A8r8?t=259
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            These jokers don't believe in Pizzagate because they're too cool, but they took it upon themselves to investigate at the restaurant. They went in the back door of Besta with a camera and saw stairs leading down underground.

            We know Buck is a term for paedos. We know Alefantis has described himself as a Buck. His friends have also called him Pan and he has agreed with them. This new restaurant is just more taunting.

              That area has some weird stuff in the past. Remember the guy or 2 guys that disappeared and they found them buried on a farm there. We researched for short while. Some saying the boy they charged had a mental problem. Possibly someone else committed the crime like the parent. But the Furry Parties take the cake. These included Children that were a abused. They were forced to wear the costumes as well. It made me so sick. LE is so compromised there.

              Yes!  I am so glad someone else knows this. I remember a Kiddie Show where they said C’mon all you Buckaroos or to that effect. Also there is a connotation of Buck with gay etc. Bucks County in Pa. had Furry Parties  and some said other things as well involving Children. Buck is a favored name like Buck Henry.

                Those were horrible crimes. If they really dug into and then really printed the truth about his connections they would scatter like the rats they are. Yes and Buck is used by many that have a sick need for Our Children.
