            On December 31, 1968, Franklin Credit Union was founded in a minority neighborhood in Omaha, Nebraska. The primary purpose was to provide loans to minorities. In August, 1970, Lawrence E. "Larry" King, Jr., (a black man, not television talk show host) and fast-rising "star" in the Republican party, became manager and principle executive. Larry King was indicted by a Federal grand jury on May 19, 1989 and later tried and convicted of fraud and income tax evasion directly related to the Franklin Credit Union matter. He remains incarcerated in federal prison.

            FBI- IRS RAID--On November 4, 1988, the Franklin Credit Union was raided and closed by the FBI and the IRS. Thirty-nine million dollars was missing. Shortly thereafter, reports began to circulate concerning pornography, videotapes, and photographs which had been confiscated from the Franklin Credit Union by the FBI. Then, in a trickle- which soon grew to a flood- other allegations began to arise. These allegations involved drugs, sexual misconduct, child abuse, pornography- even satanic activity. The names of prominent individuals in the Omaha community began to surface as those involved in these criminal activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            GRAND JURY THROWS OUT CHARGES--On January 10, 1989, the Nebraska State legislature constituted a special committee to look into the allegations with State Senator Loran Schmit as Chairman. On January 30, 1990, Nebraska State Attorney General, Robert Spire, called for a grand jury to investigate allegations. February 6, 1990, former County District Judge Samuel Van Pelt was appointed a special prosecutor for the Douglas County Grand Jury, which convened on March 12, 1990. On July 23, 1990, after hearing many hours of testimony, the grand jury issued an unusual and unprecedented report throwing out all of the allegations concerning sexual child abuse and labeling the charges a "carefully crafted hoax".
