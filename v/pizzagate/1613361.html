<blockquote>
<p>I\'ve been writing about the abuses going on in adult guardianship proceedings now for over ten years. Details regarding the physical and financial abuse of seniors and disabled are nothing new to me. One might have thought I would have been prepared for The Worst Interests of the Child, by Keith Harmon Snow. But I was not. </p>
<p>&quot;This book is about the organized crime of Family Courts in the United States,&quot; writes Snow in the preface to this book. Keith Harmon Snow is an award- winning journalist, photographer and writer who has worked in 45 countries. He worked as a journalist accredited with the United Nations Observer Mission in Congo (MONUC), as a human rights investigator for Genocide Watch, and as genocide investigator for the United Nations in Ethiopia. </p>
<p>In this compelling and disturbing book, Snow has launched an expose of Family Court in Connecticut, although his research and findings are echoed in courts across America. The victims in his study, like the victims of guardianship court, are vulnerable and cannot protect themselves. However, unlike the elderly victims of guardianship court, these young victims are just beginning their lives. The scars from the abuses that Family Court refuses to address, refuses to protect them from, will be carried throughout the rest of their lives. Through no fault of their own, through the unfortunate happenstance of being born the child of a predator, these children have received, as Snow so aptly states, a life sentence. </p>
<p>Snow writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with Family Courts is that financial interests outweigh the judicial issues, and the entire legal system has been geared to support the financial plunder of clients. This is most evident by examination of the behavior of lawyers who take cases for both perpetrators of abuse and protective parents (not only, but usually, the mothers).</p>

            From the page :
"The state of Maine has trafficked my child Mila," Lori Handrahan told me, in January, right before the court forced a gag order upon her and shut down her web site. "There's a massive cognitive dissonance and denial about child trafficking by the U.S. public. This happens in India and Africa but it can't be happening here. The cover in America is child custody."
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Lori Handrahan is a professor at the School of International Service at American University in Washington D.C. Dr. Handrahan's credentials are impeccable, with over 20 years of work in international development and human rights all over the world. She was a guest on CNN and her op-eds about human rights and sex trafficking were often published in the New York Times. "Now that my child's life is on the line I can't get any news coverage at all. Every single media outlet I've gotten interested has killed the story at the last minute."
           </p>
           <p>
            Lori and Mila's case also involves corruption within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including the illegal naturalization of Ukrainian and Russian nationals who have stolen Mila away from her loving mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            While available to discuss her case in early January, Lori Handrahan was later served with a gag order, intimidated into silence out of fear for her daughter's life, and possibly her own. Sometime in late January or early February of this year, the web site created to help them -- "Saving Mila" -- went dead. "

             I think with all thats coming out about pizzagate and this California CPS ring bust, it might be timely to ask Schaeffer's documentary producer if he now has the courage to release it

             It seems like the system needs to be completely revised, but how and by whom is the million dollar question. I don't know why there are so many pedos out there, but it seems (from all this investigation) that they are everywhere and until this is REALLY addressed vulnerable kids are at risk.

             I should probably add that I did not read the book, but I found the review (link) very heartbreaking.

              Which came first: the politician or the pedophile?
             </p>
             <p>
              As in, which ones were picked for their positions because they were pedos (hastert for instance) and which ones became pedos after working their position- either by trickery ("didnt know she was underage" ect) or "hey this looks fun" (yuck yuck yuck)
             </p>
             <p>
              Obviously not just politicians but that sounded best.. either way pedophilia is the ultimate blackmail. Very powerful evidence to have over your enemies and friends so implicate everyone you can, on every level.
             </p>
             <p>
              So like you said, it all needs to be rebuilt, and rebuilt with absolute transparency. Like JFK said, no more secret societies, agencies, alphabet bullshit - that may be out of context ha

              They - the pedos - only SEEM to be everywhere because we are looking at what have been their favorite feeding places for many years.

              It is still a quite rare sexual aberration. Do not let anybody make you think otherwise. And do not let anybody make you believe that love of children is suspect.
             </p>
             <p>
              All well developed adults love children how could they not? Pedos seek to arbitrage this natural affection for their own cover/gratification. Do not fall for it.

               Actually child sexual abuse is VERY prevalent! One in four girls will be molested and one in six boys. That's a lot of kids being victimized! It is a big problem!
