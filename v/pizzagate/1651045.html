</p>
<p>Here is the image showing that it is indeed a bathtub/shower we\'re looking at: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/d7fcy">http://imgur.com/a/d7fcy</a></p>
<p>Now getting to the actual video. There is a small child in the bathtub. The man screaming is, from what I can tell, OUTSIDE of the bathtub and filming with a mop in his hand.</p>
<p>There is SOMETHING inside the bathtub with the child (will discuss this something shortly, and it might be much worse than a man beating the child). </p>
<p>While the child is inside the bathtub with the glass doors slid shut, the man repeatedly uses the mop to nudge and hit the glass door of the tub, from the outside, while the child is inside running back and forth. </p>
<p>When you watch the video again knowing where the child is... I am sorry to say this, but it is even worse.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of images showing you the placement of the child. Look at these, then watch the video knowing where the child is, and you\'ll see the child very clearly panicking and pacing around in the tub. At a couple of points, the child pushes on the glass doors with his or her hands as if trying to escape whatever torment is happening inside.</p>
<p>This first image is of the child facing the glass and wanting out. Please do not look at this if you can\'t handle, it\'s very bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/XpqRn">http://imgur.com/a/XpqRn</a></p>
<p>This second image is of the child again trying to push on the glass to get out, as the mop hits the glass. </p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/clleE">http://imgur.com/a/clleE</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the video in full (warnings apply): <a href="http://worldcorpo.net">http://worldcorpo.net</a> </p>
<p>Now that you know where to look to see the child, you\'ll see him or her frantically pacing around inside the bathtub. The man filming routinely wacks and swipes the glass door from with a mop (especially after issuing a command),</p>
<p>What has been established so far: there is a terrified child inside of a bathtub. There is a man hitting the doors of the bathtub.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here I am going to offer a hypothesis. **Note that what I say here stands on its own and it has no bearing on the truth of what has been established above. **</p>
<p>Now, clearly something else is happening in the bathtub that is harming and scaring the child. Now that you know where to look, maybe you can figure it out. </p>
<p>If I were pressed to say what I think is happening, it seems that there are bodies or body parts hanging on the tile walls inside the bathtub. They may be dying or tortured somehow. I say this because you can hear several other voices moaning in pain in addition to the screams of the child and the commands of the man. </p>
<p>There is also what appears to be some kind of strobe light with alternating colors placed on the floor of the tub, with the flashing light aiming upwards. Strobe lights can be used to induce a state of trauma, trance, or suggestibility to commands. The Central Intelligence Agency has used them: <a href="http://ciastrobe.com/">http://ciastrobe.com/</a></p>
<p>Thus the idea seems to be to disorient the child\'s senses while causing extreme fear and trauma. In this disoriented state the man is giving the child commands. The child seems to be seeing things/bodies strung up on the tile wall of the bathtub and may have been drugged with a hallucinogen. </p>
<p>Another possibility is that there is an animal (or multiple animals and insects or snakes) in the tub, and the man is using the mop to agitate the animals and cause them to move around and possibly angrily bite at the child, inducing pain and trauma in the child. I say this because (a) the child looks at the ground/walls sometimes and abruptly tries to move away from it as if something is stinging or scaring him/her, (b) the man himself chose to be outside rather than inside the tub, (c) independent testimony from another child victim describes being put in a small container with insects (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLgNm_ay4Sk)</a>), so if this is the pizzagate/cia column/luciferian cult doing this, it is a familiar torture technique to cause trauma and disassociation.</p>

            WOW, jeez that's impressive. If you download a gif maker (I like gif toaster) it can separate EACH FRAME. The 40 something second clip produces 400ish photos. I can't recall the exact number but I'm sure you get the gist.

            You only run back and forth pointlessly when you've completely lost it. They want to prolong that state as long as possible. To collapse. But not death. Thats why they always have doctors medical people in their covens to check pulse etc.

            They wear you down competely. To the point where you pray for the end. But if its not thefirst time you know it wont end. So you no longer care. If luck comes you can go where you go. In the end it stops and you come back. My dog was made to bite me over and over. I thanked God when her teeth began to rot and the biting no longer hurt as much.

            Crazy coincidences, for sure, but I stumbled upon a very inappropriate Instagram account yesterday featuring sexual images of the account owner (a photographer), s&amp;m, and a few pictures of kids, predominantly of a boy about the same size and complexion as what you "see" in the "fatherhood" video, perhaps the other 2 shower videos too... I reposted in /pizzagatewhatever the original post of 3 which got deleted within the 1st hour...here:

             Strange Instagram Coincidences
            </a>
            there are a couple of photograms in the fatherhood videos from which one could possibly take facial feature markers and make some measurements to compare with the Instagram kid, WIP... This photographer lady is linked to a VJ who creates pretty intense videos, curiously by the name "Gustavo" like one of the latest Worldcorp videos...

             DANG, why did I go look at that... those pics are extremely upsetting. Gah, this makes me so mad &amp; it's all the more frustrating, not knowing what to do. THAT POOR BOY, being advertised like that!!!

              I know, they are really upsetting. Even more upsetting is the fact that the majority of information I posted was immediately deleted by mods, mostly by Millennial_Falcon. you can already see how unpopular #pizzagate has become everywhere, like it's already been solved... We move on to calling it #pedogate, thus defocusing investigations even further..Boom, the whole thing dissolves like a fart in the wind... If you ever post anything, make sure you post not only in one forum, but many. And archive everything!

            This is very interesting thank you for sharing this. I am researching how these scandals progress so I really appreciate it. The best way to predict future behavior is to know the past. Thanks!

            Oh come on, read my posts and comments before doing something like that, not cool at all, you completely misread and misinterpreted my intention, rather moronically I will say, because I am offended. In addition you're just wrong, from the numbers of seen, I think the article said the one room had sixty thousand members and it wasn't hard for that person to get an invite, that's enough to fill a football stadium full of pedos, and of those more than half v that responded we're into the torture variety. I don't know were the fuck you get trying to normalize it from that from stating that, more likely you are. The point was here we are hundreds of PI's trying to figure out who is in this one video, when there are probably hundreds freely floating about the dark week right now worse than this one. Didn't on any way suggest anyone look at them or post them or go into the dark web at all, just know that it exists, and what it is, so we know what we're fighting to stop, fucktard.

            New voat member. First post.
           </p>
           <p>
            A quick read of all content in this subverse does not appear to contain the following information, so for the sake of completeness and at the risk of redundancy, consider the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            At the 24 second mark of the video, a reasonably clear image of the back of a right arm is visible. The person is wearing a dark or black T shirt. The build is of a caucasion of slim/scrawny build. This is consistent with the build of John Podesta as revealed in this photo:
            <a href="http://impiousdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cwa_0NFUAAAjqlE-1024x683.jpg">
             http://impiousdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Cwa_0NFUAAAjqlE-1024x683.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            My intuition is that the video is being filmed by someone other than the person holding the broom (which could be a scrub brush used to scrub the shower). Reason being, the camera angle appears to be to the right of the person holding the broom (if indeed the 25 second mark shows a right arm) and it appears as though the person is holding it with their right hand farthest down the handle, meaning his back is somewhat to the camera. I cannot see how this recording angle could come about even if the person holding the broom was using only one hand.

            It looks like there is something sitting on the bottom right in the bathtub in fatherhood..also at the 10 11 12 second mark it looks like something whips/jabs the child? It also looks like he/she is occasionally getting pulled side to side being stopped from getting out?... I believe there may be 1 or 2 people in with the child. 
ALSO EVERYONE keep an open mind about all this... especially this guy that keeps showing his face, could be a puppet/ target dummy.. 
As always this is my opinion, but great work everyone keep it up

            I really wouldn't download anything from that site.   It screams setup.   I haven't watched this video yet but I can only imagine it borders on the illegal.    And wouldn't it be great if they busted down a bunch of Pizzagate investigators with CP on their computers?   I've been real wary clicking links when it comes to this for this very reason.

            I slowed it down and raised the gamma, but didn't notice anything that looked like a moving object in there with him.  Can you post a screen cap with an indicator drawn onto it of what you're looking at?  Also give the exact timestamp of the screen cap.

            In this video it looks like there is someone else in the shower with him to the right back corner. The child keeps looking in that direction and we can hear moaning coming from somewhere else at the begining of the clip

             Definitely another person in the shower. Looks like an adult*(moan in the beginning... What the hell.). Also, kid looks as if he's being punched in the stomach near the middle of the vid. 
Otherwise seems to be getting shocked with a cattle prod by the sudden jerks
That or being stung with something.
This is so fucked. I've been looking into this since October and here, seeing MKULTRA trauma-based mind-control in action is really fucking with me. If this turns out to be the majority issue, THIS is what WW3 will be about.
Fuck. I also feel like a lot of investigators are going to get charges pressed against them, I don't know why yet, but I do believe even accusing someone of being a pedophile is worse than being convicted of pedophilia.
Wordcorp's homepage... Click on the logo. It invites you to a chat room. Be FUCKING careful, I didn't proceed, I think this is entrapment. Please be fucking careful, we want the degenerates and sickos behind bars/executed... Not the good guys.

            OP you are a hero for this post.  This is the most logical, reasonable thing I've seen about this during the entire episode of having this float around.  We are witnessing in this video true MK Ultra style conditioning it seems.

            Q:  Do you think this was a leak from the white hats (to rattle the perp)  or from the blackhats (to handle the perp)?

             Anything's possible. It could be coming from either side, for various reasons. They want to threaten Podesta, they want to see how the public will respond, how the police will respond, who would get involved, how much correct info could be gained by throwing out this crumb, in connection to the whole pie.

            one of the most disturbing aspects of john podestas past that i came across was his years working slaughtering pigs. his description of drugging them before cutting their throats makes you think he enjoyed it. he also kept a disturbing photo of a dead pig on his laptop that his office co-workers asked him to remove because it upset them.

             WTF, that IS messed up. Hanging kids on meat hooks... horrible!!! It's like, a contest or something amongst evil beings. Whatever they've heard as being the worst, they want to outdo. They want to be a legacy. They want to be feared.
            </p>
            <p>
             I once heard a story about another pig slaughtering, murderous looney toon, Robert Pickton. Course, you gotta be some kind of heartless creature to be able to do that kind of thing, enjoying it even. So creepy!!

              i just saw your reply ........ yes when i first started studying paedophilia at uni 20 years ago i soon worked out that the worst kind of paedophile is the sadistic one because it is their mentality to receive pleasure from inflicting pain

            I'll say that the imagery in these videos is consistent with what I've read about how this trauma-based mind control works, but I don't see any reason whatsoever to say or suggest that the man in the video "might be John Podesta." Sure, it's possible, but likely? Probable? I don't know about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an actor, if I were to come up with an "impression" of John Podesta: Sadistic pedophile, it would probably sound a lot like the voice in the video, but I really don't encourage researchers to make that leap. Be open, but don't set out trying to confirm that. Personally, I don't think there's much sense in doing so.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the production of these videos, as a filmmaker/editor, I would say that that these have been edited deliberately to give off the dark, surreal feel that they do. Honestly, this doesn't seem too far from the kinds of dark surrealism I'd expect from the likes of Marilyn Manson, etc. These bursts of static seem totally fabricated, like the editor wants to give a vague impression of "found footage." Whoever edited this wanted it to seem dark, disoriented, fucked up, and creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, that is not to say that some of the footage isn't real footage of torture/abuse. That is entirely possible, but more than anything, I question whoever uploaded this and made the associated website. Why would this fall into our laps all of a sudden? Honestly, it does strike me more like a dark "art project" than it does true footage of SRA/trauma-based mind control. I came up with some animations when I was teenager that had a very similar dark, surreal vibe to them that is so familiar to me, it's hard not to recognize its spirit in these videos. The editor seems to have surreal, psychotic qualities in mind that they are trying to convey through the work. Nothing about the video comes off as "natural." A lot of the creepy factor seems intentional. Of course, it is entirely possible that someone involved in this kind of abuse would
            <em>
             want
            </em>
            to produce a little homage to their handiwork like this, but honestly, I think if we were looking at real footage of this stuff really happening, we'd be much closer to legitimate snuff film territory than this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have to say, when I heard Seaman talk about these videos, I cringed a little. Don't get too sucked into them. Don't ignore them, either, but I seriously, seriously doubt a smoking gun is going to look like this.

             Your hypothesis is worth consideration.  We live in interesting times.  The abuse videos seem real to me, but that does not prove that they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             To pursue a determination, can we quantify the elements of these videos which we might be able to analyze for indications of being staged vs. being real?  I'm no expert but I'll throw out a few suggestions:
            </p>
            <p>
             (1) The voices of the child, the adult, and any persons audible in the background
            </p>
            <p>
             (2) The lighting, of all types
            </p>
            <p>
             (3) The movements of the child

            Need some help analyzing audio I've made a
            <a href="https://clyp.it/q5eebpc1">
             compilation here
            </a>
            of same words from the video and a speech made in November. I need to know if it sounds like the same person even though one is yelling louder. If anyone can help me analyze what sounds alike I would greatly appreciate it.

                Yeah It's the second!  What got me was the "you" and "your"  and the velocity of the IS is a match as well.  The pronoun confusion is interesting but not definitive.  But I wanted to get more ears on this and dig in deeper for the phonetic sounds (today, tomorrow, to, too) of words that aren't the same, because I only did the word matches from both files.

            That actually does start to make sense.  The late hours of the "all ages" shows give cover to bringing a child into CPP as well as sound to drown out the torture, and the late hours also would be helpful in allowing busy politicos like Pedosta to be able to be there in person.

             The man who filmed this video named Frank Winstead accused Alefantis of rape and murder in a town hall meeting in 2008.

              Winstead did no such thing.  He said that having CPP open late at night
              <strong>
               would invite
              </strong>
              rapes and murders.

              Your lookout idea is plausible.  Those guys don't look like they play ping pong enough to be excited about playing it for the sake of playing it.

            Yes. If you time it right you can force a dopamine dump via pain... wait... inflict pain...wait...and it builds in the system eventually creating a floaty feeling.

            I have only watched that video about 1-3 times - I'm not sure I am ready to watch it again. But I thought the first couple of times it looked like a large commercial sized mop, except that it didn't sway like a mop head should. So I thought it might be a huge commercial broom or some type of hoe. It made a sound whenever he hit something so I assumed he was hitting the child with it. It did sound like the child was definitely in severe pain or being tortured. I wondered if he was killing the kid, but I think the "conversation" lends itself more to MK Ultra programming and instilling mind control. I'm positive that he was trying to program compliance in the child in terms of calling him his father. So it makes me wonder if it's a girl or a boy, if it's a kid he is raising or if he is just the handler. It could even be Madeline McCann.

             Raising the gamma level in the videos makes it very clear that the kid is behind a shower door.  The mop/broom/whatever is hitting that, not the kid.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the downside, there may be other... things... in there with the kid, so the lack of being hit might be irrelevant, ultimately.

               I am becoming more convinced.  I wonder, has anyone looked at Tony Podesta's voice?   It would be interesting as surely they'd have a similar accent having lived their lives in parallel.
              </p>
              <p>
               If TP ALSO sounded like he could be the perp- it would mean 1)  we might be able to pull a lot of different men from the same background and think it was them 2) maybe it was Tony instead (!)
              </p>
              <p>
               If TP DID NOT sound like he could be the perp - it strengthens the case that it could be Podesta.   The argument being that despite similar backgrounds, Podesta's voice is that unique.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know how your time is of course, but if you had the time...

                 it is clear there is NO way it is him in the Fatherhood video.   I think this strengthens that it actually may be J Podesta.  It just shows that even raised side by side AND living in the same place for the last 40 years, the brothers have very different voices.   Tony's is more normal, and John's is just incredibly unique.  And identifiable.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I still think putting up an analysis of Tony's voice is a good idea to drive that point home.  I know it takes a lot of time though.

            Thus video makes me sick to my stomach. I wonder how old the video is? It DEFINATELY looks like the kids being groomed. It looks like CIA MKUltra. That program was supposedly shut down in 1973, but I wonder if it really was?

            I've been wondering about this lately. What sort of 'torture' was eliciting these screams.. in that kind of setting. I think I agree with what you wrote. Nothing to ad.

            This is standard Satanic Ritual Abuse stuff. Could be mutilated /dying dismembered animals (or alive) or people. How do I know this? From personal experience. I am an SRA victim. Part and parcel of mind control conditioning techniques for dissociation. Hate to say from watching the links you posted this is a very real possibility. Live snakes are often used as well. But I am getting the feeling that the bodies , if there are any, are already dead and mutilated. If alive we may have seen &amp; heard them hit shower door. Closed enclosures are often used for MK . Coffins, boxes, cages. etc...

             You can hear a prolonged moaning at the very beginning of the "fatherhood" video and it definitely isn't the kid who's screaming or the guy yelling.

            Haven't actually looked at the videos as yet to judge voice or activities you are describing, but thank you for all of your efforts in trying to figure out what is actually happening in these videos.
Some of the comments on one of the other videos having to do with "voice of John Podesta?" suggest that the video is being made from a glass rooftop and dropped mic.
In the case of this video, it is obviously the abusers/torturers who are doing the recording.
Is it likely that both are happening????
           </p>
           <p>
            The dogs are reminiscent of CIA/Gestapo, concentration camps and Guantanamo.
Same ideas behind it.
           </p>

            The paintings also show us they are very carefully detailed - i.e., painting of a young boy hung by his
hands/wrists from a tiled area and without doubt the child is not only being tortured, but is being starved.  We see the same thing in the corpses. 
I note that the paintings are very detailed because they have to have been done from photographs.
            <br/>
            First come the photographs, then the paintings.
Somewhere we will find a photographic source for the paintings.

            Here's the thing, a lot of people are saying they can't believe this is real, and how horrific it is, etc... And it is, but this is nothing compared to what's on the dark web, I've never gone into that pit, but I've read numerous articles written by people who have gone in there too report on it and, this is nothing. There was a guy who amputated peoples arms and legs and put hooks on their back, and sold them as living sex dolls that you can hang up. One person did a poll in a pedo forum and the majority preferred CP of the torture variety. We're running this down in his it has something specifically with the pizzagate dc pedo ring, otherwise this really is just another child abuse video of which we could all go into the dark web and see Just how frighteningly common this sick shit really is.

            you all are amazing. Thank you so much for doing this research. I cannot do it. I wish I could but i am weak. My heart breaks for these little ones. God bless you all, even if you dont believe in God. You are doing His work, and this is how we most of us will ever experience God: is through other people's actions. And Im just so thankful for eveyrbody doing this. 
(Sorry, im crying and all emo right now.)

            This is a pretty accurate assessment, the mobile light machine is interesting, bc comet has a similar one, but it might be what all these psychos use to do this sort of thing. We've got a possible voice match, we have a light machine like at comet, and a whole bunch of circumstantial evidence that podestas are into this crap

            He's former military, so the evidence is strong that he's a sheep-dipped NOC asset doing work for the CIA.  Especially being a published writer that promotes violence, the drug scene and satanism.

            Kid says John John, guy says what's my other name, kid either says dad or John again, guy says I am your father. At that point he says fadda, changing th to d is consistent with Chicago accent. Not sure if they do that in Boston accent, am sure it's norm for Chicago.

            this stuff is dark magik people. even if you dont believe in anything... frequency, energy and vibration are real. protect yourself while taking this stuff in...smudge, pray, claim your space, cast of negative frequencies anyway you know how. I know how these things can insidiously weave itself  into  your consciousness and this can lead to illness, mental health issues and dare i say
            <em>

            or whatever you want to call it. I say this from experience... find a way to create a 'clearing' for yourself after viewing. claim your space and create protection for yourself going in. I am sure some are going to jump on this with negativity, but for those who are sensitive and aware, its worth mentioning and its easy enough to do...

              Orgonite. yes. That is what started my journey in 1997. I have since realized that the human body is the perfect orgone generator if properly acknowledged (in awareness and as a practice).

               Wilhelm Reich was a genius. Too bad Einstein's Russian spy secretary kept the information from getting to the masses. I wish he could have seen the birth of Kirlian photography. To see on a photo what you've devoted your life to proving...that would be a trip.

            At :06 you can see a shiny black handle and what looks like a small broom, , kinda looks like a tar brush

            Not sure, doesn't look like a regular mop. If it's a broom wonder if the kid is afraid of what's on the broom?
At one point you can clearly see a fore arm lifting whatever it is over the top.

            I agree with you 100 percent. Something I will add, regardless if the child was told to scream, it's abuse regardless. The act itself is pure abuse. Do I think this was an act? Absolutely not. That child is screaming for his life. When my kids are scared in some way they have a recognizable scream and their words are almost indistinguishable. It's exactly what we hear going on here.

            I don't want to listen to that video anymore but could someone else try to verify this? Another user on twitter says it's at the 37 seconds mark.

              , since you worked on the audio and are the author of this epic thread (

               i have listened and absolutely it kinda sounds the way described not like podesta but podestay, however because it's being said fast and he appears to stop or get interrupted it's hard to say for sure. If we had someone to clean up the audio with an enhancer I could say better for sure.

                 To me it sounds like the child first calls him skippy in the fatherhood video before he calls him John. Also I hear him screaming, "no skippy" right before the worst screams start in the each vid..but I could be wrong. Just my interpretation. Before I learned of skippy it sounded more like Satan to me in the fatherhood video. But now I hear skippy or Satan the first couple times before  John.

                  I'm not a forensic/voice recognition analyst but I can try to clean it up. I could really use some guidance on what exactly is needed, I grabbed the video from dasbo0ts link (nice handle, I worked on that DVD lol). The list posted by TheTuringTest has a lot of files, where do I start? I saw the post today with the bathtub/shower analysis, so happy to help that #$%^&amp; go to prison for eternity.

            If you are going to arrest the Podesta brothers and possibly the Clintons, there is going to be rioting in the streets.  It will cause most Democrats to believe that President Trump had fake evidence manufactured in order to permanently remove his enemies.   More than 1/2 the country will believe that he is an insane madman who is seizing power in order to become a dictator.
    To the average person, the idea that the Hillary, the NYT and other media have been infiltrated by a worldwide pedo network is so ludicrous that it doesn't even deserve consideration for a second.    The average person wouldn't even want to look at any supposed 'evidence' when it clearly is lunacy.
            <br/>
            I believe that is why the Podesta emails were leaked in the first place.  To get people to start spreading the word;  To get them used to the idea.  Now as we get closer to the actual arrest they want to make sure enough people believe the charges before making the move. 
   If they released direct proof, it would be 'debunked' as CGI, and discredited by the NYT, WaPo etc.   By releasing this mess,  the pedos really can't debunk it without drawing more attention to it.   It is possible that they are dribbling out evidence slowly with hope that a significant percentage of the population get an understanding of the situation before the arrests begin.

            I almost entirely forgot about Skippy's shower fetish. I wonder if he had a muzzled dog in there with the child? Maybe to scare the child, but not harm him? Would explain no barking.

            I think the trauma of the child being in there with flashing lights and he guy screaming is enough torture to get the response but sure there could be more going on. Also the figure seems larger than the voice, but maybe that's because a tub raises you up a foot or so.

            There is definitely something in that tub. Right before the horrific scream in "each", I think I heard the child saying "eating me". I initially thought it may have been "scaring me" that was said. As soon as my ear picked it up as "eating", I had to turn it off. I can't handle listening to it again to double check. I could be way off and need a break, but I wanted to post it anyway. It may be worth isolating the child's voice because he/she says a few things while the abuser is making noise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please, someone tell me the kid doesn't say "eating".

             Something in the bottom right of the shower almost looks like a person at 5 sec about. Person/creature sitting.Right before the screams start it looks like this person/creature moves it's head around in a bizarre manner. Really weird....tried pausing frame by frame.... too sick

              if you download a gif maker, it can divide each frame from the video. I did that but it really didn't show anything like I'd hoped it would.

                 The video each makes more sense to my eyes if I view it from the "skylight" top down perspective. Also in full screen mode now it appears a figure rushes onto it's victim from the middle right of the frame at about 4 secs and then proceeds to rape said victim...that's what the rapid head/body movement looks like to me...grabs victim then immediately goes into these convulsions....just what I see...but I can't be certain and it's only for 2 maybe 3 seconds you can see this after the 3-4 second mark. Either way it's all fucked up.

                 So in examining that horrible shit again I actually think the video each is filmed from above and the fatherhood one is of a shower. Putting it in full-screen I believe that the man yelling at the child is behind the door or in the shower with the child. He is on the left side. Maybe had no clue he was being filmed and recorded. Definitely a boom mic in my view.

                  Can you do a screen cap with an indicator added of where you're seeing the boom mic?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, if it's being filmed from above a skylight, I don't understand why the camera would be moving so much.  The audio is definitely too clear to be coming through a closed skylight (in my uneducated opinion), but if there were a boom mic, then that could explain that.  But... if the boom mic is being held by the person recording the video, then the skylight must have been open.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My wild guess is that someone was observing this standing next to the abuser and chose to record it.  Whether the abuser knew about the recording or not I don't have a guess.

            He most likely had the water scolding hot, or there is some kind of electrical current running through the water. This is at someone's home it is NOT at Comet. I'm about 90% sure this would not happen there. However, Pegasus Museum, this may be happening there for sure. This could even be at Tony or John Podesta's house. The shower and tile are all home like. Can someone please direct as to where this video was found. I have been following it since it broke but I'm having trouble finding the reference as to where the source of this video even came from.

             If it isn't a dog in there, it could be scolding hot water. Explains the steam from the inside appearing almost fog-like. I do agree that this is in a personal home, and more than likely not CPP. That would have to be some very strong glass/plastic doors, so a child couldn't break through it.

              Not necessarily. My guess is that their goal is to make the child choose to endure that pain and fear. Imagine how fucking scared you'd have to be to choose whatever is in the tub as "safer" than what is outside of it. Could be a way to confirm disassociation. The only person you can go to for help is the one who is hurting you. I feel fucked up just thinking about that.

              The child would also insure themselves trying to broke through that and a child wouldn't be strong enough to do so, especially depending on the age of the child. The child could range anywhere from 6-12 years of age in this video I have determined. Either way, we're all deeply disturbed by this.

            Bathtubs have long been associated to MK-Ultra, torture and mind control, by researchers well before Wikileaks, Podesta, etc. Indeed it is commonly understood that if you see such references in video clips, etc. (as if you see monarch butterflies), this is what it means.

            As to audio, at very beginning it sounds like an older woman having sex to me. They get off on this shit. Then the boy is clearly yelling John, several times. With headphones in, having kids, it's very clearly John in a screeching kids voice. If someone showed it down and lowered the pitch, sorry not my thing, I think it would be clearer.

            Agreed also these are not garden variety pedofiles these are serial killers, who emulate Satan. They know what they are doing and they do it because they like it. There is pure evil in the world and that video is what it looks like.

            Its certainly a shower cubicle but that could be anywhere. I'm sorry but you have provided no proof there is anything in the SHOWER cubicle. Its not a bath tub. The thread title also makes it sound like you have located the child. You haven't.

            Op, first of all, congratulations on your genius research and post. Second, I think I found something very interesting in relation to the bath tub theory that you might want to take a closer look at. It could possibly big. As I was going through James Alefantis' jimmycommet imgur album, I found this picture
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32401567065/">

            and thought wow. Could the father not only be outside the door, but literally outside, in the woods? I mean they look like the exact same doors as found in the worldcorp video. If not the same bath tub, could this be a different 'abuse in a bath tub' isolated spot? I also found two more very suspicious Instagram pics from the same album here:

              What does birding mean? Birding(noun) birdcatching or
              <strong>
               fowling
              </strong>
              meaning hunting. You could also check the urban dictionary for the nasty definition. I won't even post the definition here because it makes me physically sick even mentioning it.

              I don't understand what you mean. The JA pic is a look from inside the bath tub. You can't see the handle from there because it's on the outside of the door, not inside. And if you look closely at the bath tub door latches from the outside, you see they are vertical but since they are brought together and shut, they have an elongated look, but they are two vertical latches brought together and look horizontal. Idk if you understand what I mean. Having a hard time explaining... sorry

            If this was leaked it was probably chosen because it would not violate the child porn laws by seeing. The images would need to be blurred. Many people think the FBI or another agency leaked it.

            I had quite a few speculations last night and most were off. Someone asked how we know the door matches this door? If you stop the vid at :14 (more tolerable with the sound off), you can clearly see the hardware, how it forks to the right. The hardware is on the outside on the right side, on the inside on the left door.

            I don't want to rewatch the video to find this, but there are a few video frames which show the purple backlight shining through the translucent barrier.  Notice that the light is refracted in the same manner as the "ripple glass" used in older shower walls - also called a framed glass, versus frameless glass.  Only this type of glass would refract like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, I will agree that the color hue seems to be very close to the purple over the drum cage at CPP.  But that drum cage has clear pelxi and would not refract light like rippled shower glass.  The purple could easily be achieved using a stage gel over a strobe or two.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldn't be surprised if this "frequency" of purple has some "property".  If there is a preferred version of purple, all they would need to do is by gels with the same color number.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a thought...

            FUCK. I just found another worldcorp YT channel called

             <strong>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The channel only has 1 video called Deleted1 and the video only has 191 views (so I guess no one has found it yet) and it was posted on the Published on Aug 13, 2016.
           </p>

            It clearly has a bathtub in it with blood splattering in it.   Sorry couldn't watch to the end though.

            God that artist is so awful, I just don't get why anyone would like those pictures or if they did, why they would admit it? The last picture, is that dogs and dentists chairs? Wasnt there something about them using dentists chairs to torture children on? I'm sure there were a few victims who had said that there was a dentists chair  they were sat in at one point, or that they saw dentists chairs in rooms they were taken into by emmebrs of the cult.

            A coloured strobelight flashes in a dark while the kid is screaming and running around the bathtub. The man bangs the glass shower and screams "What's my name?"
           </p>
           <p>
            The kid yells something unintelligible and the man screams "What's my other name?" Then he yells "I'm your daddy now! Call me daddy!"
           </p>
           <p>
            The kid finally does - though I can't really make it out, the man seems satisfied with the kids response.

            Looked up the first line of lyrics and looked at Google Image Search. Noticed a picture which linked to a Twitter profile photo (

            Thank you, I was up very late trying to find shower hardware to match that, and failed. This is it, no doubt. Well we have a match for the shower, but still no location pinned down. Great work.

            I wonder what the symbolism of dogs is. Or did they just start using dogs cause they were around, and it became a tradition?

            Part of it might be creating evidence that makes them want to stay and shut up.

            . Some BDSM plays off feelings like humiliation, but maybe this video is more like "if you don't do and say what we want, we will put this video out for all to see" to keep them in line.

             The dongs are a common theme. Beastiality comes to mind. There are stories that have surfaced once in a while about dogs eating a neighbor alive I remember in California something happened to a woman. Later it turned out the couple was making porn with the dog.

            This child (who feels 'male' to me) is definitely running around in shower or enclosure with sounds like....other children.
           </p>
           <p>
            When "John" keeps asking him "what's my name now" the 'boy' repeats it and screams/pleads with him that 'I am" (cooperating and calling you what you want me to).
This is clearly torture and most likely grooming of a child.

            World Corp just uploaded 3 more vids today. Nothing to do with children but it shows they're still active.

             If you see full video from a diff source it shows the kid's face better toward end.  Looks like he got buried in the woods though....I can't tell what happened but his eyes look weird. The WorldCorp Guy then posted a picture of what resembles John Podesta with his head hanging down out in the woods.

            I can't handle the video because the child's screams are so real - is it possible the child is being scalded with extremely hot water and the smacks on the door are to make the child stand back in the spray? I ask because the snippets of the video I have seen before being able to turn it off instantly made me remember a couple of arrests of adoptive parents who routinely did that as punishment a few years ago and also brought to mind that murder of a mentally ill inmate by prison guards by confining him in a scalding shower and taunting him as he screamed to be let out :/

            That is how I feel. Killing is dignified way to die. These freaks should be housed in glass rooms and studied like rabid dogs. Study their psychology, do MRI scans, they will make a fascinating study. What makes them tic? How their compartamentalized brain works? Split personalities. Analyze Podesta, then analyze Skippy.

             These studies have been done already since the 60's. You are not going to learn anything from podesta other than that he damage good beyond repair. There are so many studies regarding this and have not changed anything. Who will do the studies? Which university will you pick especially after knowing they are all infiltrated at the top. Don't be naive. The studies exist and our most vulnerable have been victimized.

            I have all the proof i will ever need to know that PG is real. There is no way any rational human being (who will commit to doing some reading) can deny it is real. I wont keep making the same points - please enlighten me as to how we can leverage this video, even if we can safely conclude it is JP voice? Can you think of any hypothetical situation where it will benefit the cause?

            Did you guys notice that as soon as this video started circulating, shills have gone to sleep. Shills could easily put it through the voice analyzer and tell us it's fake - but even if they did that, child screaming is real! Shills are gone, debunking 9-11, building 7 was a phantum, never existed.

            The whole saving Manson from the chair, was the so-called "let's study him" BS! The only thing I ever saw of studying that POS was a few fucked up scripted interviews!

             Same here. I'm so glad we can get rid of the hypothesis that it was at comet ping pong. It clearly is not. I was also convinced prior to this post that there was a third person filming the two people in the shower.

             This is a big break. Maybe we can find pics of JP's bathroom in his house?

               Because there's not a shred of evidence. The lighting is not laser lighting used on stage. Laser lighting is pinpoint beams of light that would look nowhere near like they do in the video. The Comet Ping Pong comparisons were because people thought it could be those stage lights. In addition, the video VERY CLEARLY shows a towel bar on the shower stall. The towel bar would not be there on a drum room (some people think the glass could be a drum room). The frosted glass is another indicator that its a shower. A drum room would be clear because the drummer needs to be seen on stage, not covered in frosted glass.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now the inside of comet ping pong has been dcumented pretty well. There is not a shower in comet ping pong that we know of, so why on earth would we want to embarrass ourselves even more and assume there is one because of a video like this!?! It would completely discredit us. Comet Ping Pong should not be associated with this video until theres actual proof of it.

                 Dude. I've been here for months. I've submitted a couple things. 95% of what I comment is positive stuff that agrees with most people. I'm not freaking JA. I actually might want to change my opinion on this video now though. I watched the video where someone edited out the treble and mids, and just left the bass. I think that makes it even more plausible it's at CPP. The only reason I don't want to edit my comments is because I think it's important to shred doubt on people's opinions if I really feel there could be doubt. There are so many shills out here that will take a bad lead and pump the freaking hell out of it to spread disinfo. Anyway.... just felt the need to respond to you.

                 I just need more convincing I guess. Right now I hate it how EVERYONE who wants to mock us uses Comet Ping Pong as the prime example to say we're crazy. WE all know the screwed up shit that goes on there, but then people start to speculate a little, and the media picks up on it to make it look like we're crazy. This is a huge thinktank here. We share ideas and theories and are proven right or wrong by each other. For someone to jump in and treat our theories as FINAL CONCLUSIONS, that's where we lose ground.

                  Your post claiming we can be sure this wasn't at CPP was full of bad logic (e.g. having no evidence --&gt; firm conclusion).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Your subsequent posts in this same fork of the thread are very good and I agree with them fully.  Put the "FINAL CONCLUSION" crap the media keeps doing in a longer context, though.  It will ultimately just serve to further discredit the false accusers, so don't stress too much over it.

                  i think the shills are definitely fanning the flames to make us look unhinged and i am a huge fan of getting to the truth.  this could be CPP, it could be somewhere else, no way to know for sure.

                 <p>
                  i think we need to cut people a little bit of a break if they jump to conclusions.  feeling helpless and wanting this to end could cause them to cling to any plausible answers

            Great breakdown and fuel for thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            But lest not forget, there was absolutely NO correlation between the vid on World Corp and Podesta. It was us, independent researchers, sleuthers and guesser who linked one person to an arbitrary video. 
So this is by no means proof that that was Podesta in that horrific video.  What it is is.... a reminder how truly sick our world really is.
           </p>
           <p>
            And nothing for nothing, I tend to have a real good radar innately wired in and can gauge others quite easily so having said that...I feel Podesta (and many of his associates) are truly evil and sadistic individuals.

            WHY IS THERE SO MUCH CONSISTENT HEAT ON THIS ONE NON PROVABLE PIECE OF INFO????
 (yes i am shouting because with every new post about this vid I get the sense more and more that its a "look here, LOOK HERE" attempt).
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone(s) is trying really hard to keep this in focus, then I certainly am heading the other way. Even if we could PROVE it is JPs voice, can we prove anything else? Can we prove actual harm happened to a child in that video? Can we prove that the adult and child voices are from the same source, and that they were not spliced together?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes I fucking hate this clip, it horrifies me. Yes it seems to me that what is portrayed is actually happening. But even if we can prove that it is indeed JPs voice, what else can we prove with it? Fuck all is what id say. I for one am ignoring any further posts regarding this video.

             Someone tried to do an [audio analysis](Comparing John Podesta's Voice to Voice Heard in Disturbing Leaked Video) on Podestas voice versus the one in the video. It does seem very similar.

              I saw that, but I still cannot see how any way we can leverage it our advantage. Do people think JP will hold his dirty hands up and say "yup, that was me".
Thank you for you for your positive interaction friend. I appreciate it. Keep hunting!

             Mate this is blatant proof a child being harmed; i'm not sure what else you want, do you want to see a video of what happened before or after to this kid? Because anyone who watches this video, including you, knows deep down in their gut that kid is most probably dead. If this is proven to be Podesta's voice then this is the smoking gun and he's done.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it's not Podesta, we have evidence of who owns the website it's hosted on, where the owner of the website LIVES, and more leads regarding these people.

             I cannot see it adding any 'value' to the investigation. If you can add some clarity here I will remove my complaint. While we might have differing opinions on what benefits the community, I am open to hearing your side and open to changing my opinion. I respect your opinion, and I understand why you might call me a shill.  If I am missing something, please tell me what that is???

               I agree 100%, I take the video at face value, it is exactly what it seems to be. I just see no path where this can be used in our favour. Again I am completely open to changing my opinion, so if you can point out something I am missing please tell me. The reason I complained is that almost half of this sub seems to be dedicated to just this one clip these days. Its sucking resources from all the other leads we have, and more and more every day.

              Friend PLEASE (in all sincerity) tell me what we can do with this if we can prove its JPs voice?

              I cannot see it adding any 'value' to the investigation. If you can add some clarity here I will remove my complaint. While we might have differing opinions on what benefits the community, I am open to hearing your side and open to changing my opinion. I respect your opinion, and I understand why you might call me a shill.

            Like I mentioned before, the mechanics of it have already been studied. Pedophilia is a diagnosed mental disorder caused genetically by an interference with a certain section of the brain. Sociopaths feel no remorse or empathy because the portion of the brain that controls empathy (not sure which part) is lacking. I mean, we may not have all the info on it yet, but genetic mental disorders have been studied for a hundred years now.

             I call quackery on this one. I would like to see the data myself and who the subjects were and what kind of control group there was. Also remember the invent d false memory syndrome that they created to dismiss child victims testimony. You either care more about the pedos or you care about the children. Pick a side and stop being Wishy washy.

            fucking horrific! Looking closer at the video it does look like the kid is avoiding the right side wall of the shower room. He goes to try and open the door a few times and backs up quickly to the other side really scared of something. It looks like something might even be protruding or hanging on that wall.
In the second video when he starts to chant the kids song, the kid has planted himself against the glass and you can see something else moving in the shower with him. Maybe that command wasn't for the kid but for whatever is inside with him/her.
But of course then later this song could trigger trauma inside the kids head. Very trauma based mind control. The disassociation comment was very on point it seems. This might be an actual video of their methods in doing this. The kind we only used to hear about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe I can run this into some video software with a few filters to try and see more into the dark areas.

              The "other voices" really need to be analyzed. I almost thought I heard a deeper but still younger kids voice maybe trying to instigate scaring the kid. Who knows what's going on in that shower but if the FBI were to analyze it, be damn sure they'd comb over every aspect like this 10x over. We have the software for the most part and can do what we can with it. Surprised nobody has yet.

            wow. didnt expect that. i already knew it was a kid screaming in the video, but still, the video got a lot harder to watch once i actually could see the kid frantically going back and forth. Fuck these pieces of shit need to be put down.

            Not sure if there's much to study man. There's plenty of research on pedophilia and psychopaths to realize that it IS a mental disorder. But there's a difference between the closet pedos who have an uncontrollable disease, and never act on it, and the satanic sadistic filth that are raping, murdering, and sacrificing children in ways that would be just as shocking as if they were adults.

             It's time to clean up the gene pool. I dont buy the mental disorder, that implies it can be cured. That is meant to generate lack of accountability and sympathy.

              Most mental disorders cannot be cured mate, lol. I have no sympathy for psychopathic or sociopathic murderers/pedos, regardless of whether or not they have a disorder. They should be impaled on stakes and flayed to the bone. There are people who have been subjected to horrendous torture and murder for simply believing in a different religion or having sex with grown men. If you rape/murder children or animals, you deserve to be made an example of.

               It all makes sense why the law and the judges were so soft on child abuser and child rapists. No more! People are starting to wake up and will have justice one way or the other! May god raise an army of vengeful people that can save these children one way or another!

             Turn the lights on in that bathroom and study how tough this motherfucker actually is.I'd rip his sack off. Oh, you're so tough with your fucking broom? Shove that about 3 feet in his ass. I'd rip his head and and shit in this dude's neck. There is no studying this. If you see it, kill it. This is what the death penalty is made for. I'll be goddamned if we spend 50k a year to keep him locked up reading books and sketching demonic art. KILL THESE PEOPLE ASAP! That's all there is to it.

              He will not survive prison. He'll be raped and stabbed to death more than likely. I'm sure the fucking weirdo would enjoy being raped by big black men though.

            What is there to study? What good can these people possibly bring our species? They thrive and live off misery and the lowest most disgusting and useless form of human behavior. If these people aren't brought to light and punished and this entire situation at least somewhat rectified I don't see any real point in living to be honest, if these people are the ones deciding our futures and livelihoods.

            They mutilate, rape, and torture children. We can study them by taking hot pincers and pulling flesh off their bodies. Let's study their courage or see how willing they are to beg after putting other people in that position for years.

            Violence is not usually the best option, but disgusting subhumans like this deserve to be made an example of.

            I'm gonna admit it. I am so desensitized  in regards to violence that even when I watched the video it didn't do anything to me. Of course I felt disgust, but I've seen so many evil stuff that this shit just seemed another walk in the park to me. I was only taking it at face value.
But when I read your hypothesis, I just wanted to fucking shoot that motherfucker that recorded the video. If the theory you're posing is anything close to the real events, it's just bad, man. So fucking bad.

             That is exactly my feeling. The only thing that I cannot bear watch is animal cruelty. So I was able to analyze it with cool mind - that sounds like JP, 95%. And my first imoression was that it was a glass door &amp; bath tub. Child has his/hands plastered against the glass, trying to escape. This all makes sense. And this freak was going to be US secretary of state had Hildabeast won.

            my gut tells me this video is put out by the
            <strong>
             good
            </strong>
            elements of the IC that need the public outrage behind them to help them. because of most people's normalcy bias, it is difficult for most to citizen researchers to objectively analyze what is in the video. thank you for getting us over this hump!

             Yes, I think we are being shown how MKUltra is done..the process of splitting the personality.

            This is really good work.  I wonder if the FBI has got this far on it?

            I can't say for sure there's something in the tub. I'd wager this kid is scared to death of this asshole who just trapped him in a shower and is whacking the door with a broom, with that fear heightened by events that may have occured before the video, the strobe, and perhaps even drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps, even, the light is waterproof and the mop-wielding monster is simply running the shower at full heat (or just high enough to make the child reel in pain, rather than scald and potentially kill them).
           </p>
           <p>
            In any event, there's some pretty clear child abuse going on, and I'm not buying that it's just "acting". Perhaps it's just "my feelings" and I can't disprove it's fake, but I digress.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Looking at the Each video, it sounds like there's a radio being used to play scary ass terror screaming to scare the child up (Fatherhood), or Caillou in the case of the Each clip.

            That poor poor kid....the way you described it is probably true....the fact its a child makes it incredibly hard to take.

            Thank you for the analysis.

             I couldn't watch the video. This has been a dark journey for me through pizzagate. I have a little one and already teeter over depression. But I stand with you in prayer fellow warrior. I like to think the way that Trump rose to the white house was none other than God's hand. I know of no other way anyone could have beaten the globalist scum and survived the character assault. I hope it was for this very purpose... To shine the light on this evil incarnate, for the world to be forced to look upon. Then perhaps our nation can heal. No, our world can heal.

             I'm with you. Seeing this video and actually knowing what's going on now has made me feel probably the worst I've felt in the entire investigation. I feel completely repulsed and anxious and defeated and can't stop thinking about what's actually happening to this kid in the video and what happened to this kid after the video. I can't even conceive of people like this existing let alone running our fucking planet. Stay strong for everyone

              EXACTLY. That sums up how I've been feeling lately after having watched these videos. I feel this strong urge to protect but possibility seems worlds away. Is she even still alive? Who was this child? Who posted the videos &amp; why? Was it intended to distract from a much larger clue? The questions just don't stop. I

              </em>
              feeling like I'm idly sitting by, hence my need to search for more detail. It's very frustrating &amp; it's a commonality we, as a whole, are experiencing together. :(

              But we have seen these things before if anyone dares to recall -- in the tortures of The Crusades run by the RCC, in the tortures of the Holocaust in Germany, in the Witch Hunts -- all of this links back to the Papal States and teachings of hatred which poisoned the minds of citizens in those states.
It is organized patriarchal religion -- including the Old Testament which "Jesus" was standing against -- which introduces a violent god, Satan/Devil.
This has long been hidden, unaddressed except by the few.
              <br/>
              This is an opportunity to confront and stop it -- for all time.
             </p>
             <p>
              (Sadly, we also saw it in the return of support for torture by the US government in the years after 9/11 and the W administration at Guantanamo.  Certainly torture has been re-introduced now for a purpose.  No dictatorship can exist without torture of citizens.)
             </p>
             <p>
              And in all of it we see sexual abuse -- even at Guantanamo that was obvious.

               , Jesus didn't stand against the OT; that was still the Word of God. He reiterated much of it &amp; explained the things that changed, or needed to be changed.. such as, "an eye for eye". Big difference.

                S3v --
First, "God" didn't write anything -- men did the writing -- and it is all organized male-supremacist religion.
Our Founders did the same thing in creating an Elite patriarchy -- endowing them with land grants -- giving them immense influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is all myth repeated over and over again in order enable males to continue to hold power.
The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.  Until that time family lines were based on females.
Mary's lineage was actually transferred to Joseph.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jesus was a revolutionary standing against the violent "god" of the Old Testament.
And standing against the male-supremacist concepts of the Old Testament.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember that, even IF there was actually a "god" in the sky who can do everything, he has continued to 
do nothing to end the suffering on this planet -- and never will do anything about it.
You're on your own, folks!

             Another possibility is that there is an animal (or multiple animals and insects) in the tub, and the man is using the mop to agitate the animals and cause them to move around and possibly angrily bite at the child, inducing pain and trauma in the child.

            Ew, you could be right; remember Podesta's favorite artist? Dogs, showers, and tubs seem to be a common theme.

            She isn't the only artist that uses the theme of dogs and kids, there was another artist that did the same thing. And let's not forget all these sickos on Instagram share suggestive photos  involving dogs.
           </p>
           <p>
            You also mention how someone could be hanging in the shower. I personally think this is less likely, as I feel the kid wouldn't have enough room to move if there was a body hanging up in the way, but then again, there is another theme of children hanging up in what appears to be a shower:

            Who the fuck was filming? And why the fuck would you film something so incriminating? If this is genuinely Podesta (and it sure as hell seems like him/'Skippy') he deserves to be locked up for life. Total fucking monster.

             Somebody was doing it for blackmail purpose. It ended up on Weiner's file, seized by NYPD, given copies to the FBI, Comey reopens investigation, then under pressure exonorated Killary again - hedging all bets Killary would win. Gambled &amp; Loss. Donald wins swing states. Panic. Files are still sitting. Sessions is sworn in, Dems lost power, White Hat agent no longer fears - leaks the file and sends out a meme. It's now game over. Voice analysis gives it a 95% match. They are paniking. Michael Flynn knows what's comming, steps down to calm things down. It's all out now, all exposd. For the past several decades US was being run by satanists. Flynn will have the last tweet.

              I was going to see him speak once, but it was cancelled due to the fact that he had to spend a few nights in jail for raping a 12 year old in a small town on his way to the gig. Can't find any mention of this online, but this was way before the Internet.

                It is interesting to consider.  There would need to be good soundproofing; merely having a dirt covering isn't enough if it's not a thick one.  Beyond that... it's conceivable.  They would have to have some way to get the kids in and out without drawing attention.  There are various ways that might be handled.

             Do not make too early conclusions.
You can't build a blackmailing pedo shadow government by illogical perverts!
That means underestimating that scum.
            </p>
            <p>
             This could be a kind of REPROGRAMMING.
Just like experts say, that pedos breed pedos.
I ask myself if it's possible to even turn one of the strongest feelings, sexuality, into a non-reproductive oneway, what else could be possible, if kids are put under such extreme psychological torture and stress - maybe aimed at a certain direction?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is that the reason for their growing army of people in key positions, supporting all kind of perversions and propaganda for it? What if psychopaths could be intentionally created?! For example with that kind of extreme shock?
            </p>
            <p>
             Could it be, that behind spreading satanism is much more than a few accidentially retarded people? What if it is possible to program kids to become worshippers of evil - for example by reprogramming them?
Absurd? Wait a second:
While I am thinking about it, without being an expert, there comes one thing to my mind:
            </p>
            <p>
             Beloved children themselves become loving persons. 
Now I am not a Christian, but another thing comes to my mind: religions, especially Christianity, tells us: you give love and love comes back. In short: love breeds love.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why shouldn't it work vice versa, too?
What is the impact of inducing so much fear, awe and terror, that is beyond imagination. What can do that to the personality of a KID, which is in the most sensitive phase of developing and exploring the world?
            </p>
            <p>
             We know, that "bad childhood" is somehow correlated with a bad life.
And bad childhood = no love. Or not much love and protection.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what is "possible" to do to the human soul, if there is not only bad childhood, but a phase of unimaginable horror and terror, like shown in this video?

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[11][12]

              This is the basis for creating multiple personalities -- and the "fake memory syndrome" is BS created to try to prevent survivors from speaking out.
             </p>
             <p>
              The new personalities created can be programmed -- yet the individual can go about life unaware of these other personalities and programming and what they are doing.
              <br/>
              This includes being able to create "photographic memories" in the new personality.
These other personalities have been used as drug runner, homosexual prostitutes, and for espionage/spies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Survivors of sexual abuse often become abusers themselves -- but not all of them -- and I don't think the majority of them.  But the numbers add up.

              There are some testemonies of persons who survives and escaped. And if you look for it, even more than expected. But, it's a punishment/reward system. If they behave they will get more freedom and power, if remain "problem" you most likely won't make age (lets say) 12/14 that is i think needed to escape.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also there are (atleast) 2 groups of (elite) pedophile victim groups you could group.
             </p>
             <p>
              First the young abducted victims and own familie members that are raised, brainwashed, tortured to the satanic beliefs and practises. One's playing the game, the next leaders,
             </p>
             <p>
              I think kids that are in teen years that are abducted/seduced are kept in order by violence and blackmail and pure for the sex, if playing by there rules, you get more freedom and supplier next generation leaders. At least, thats the way i read newest Epstein court papers.

            . This is EXACTLY RIGHT. The child is inside the shower, 100% undoubtedly. It's clear as day once you read this description, you can clearly see the child running around in the shower. We need to clear this up and have everyone aware of this/on board. Your hypothesis is fucking horrific and makes me sick to my stomach but is also the most likely situation.

            They are the same light.

            This video is "Fatherhood" with nothing but bass, all the treble and highs are cut.
            <strong>
             We can hear what sounds like a live band playing. The bass is leaking through the walls which indicates this room is close to a stage or speakers

             BASED ON THIS NEW INFORMATION IT IS EXTREMELY LIKELY THIS IS HAPPENING IN COMET. IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE FOR THEM TO HAVE A SHOWER, EITHER FUNCTIONING (TO WASH THEMSELVES OFF) OR NON FUNCTIONING (AS A "CHAMBER"/CABINET FOR CHILDREN). IT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR THIS TO BE OCCURRING WHILE A BAND IS PLAYING, TO DROWN OUT THE SOUND. DURING THE "AFTER HOURS" "ALL AGES" PERFORMANCES AT CPP, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THE BANDS ARE PUT ON PURPOSELY TO DROWN OUT THE SOUNDS OF THE CHILDREN AND "CLIENTS" IN THE "TORTURE CHAMBER", WHICH IS WHAT THIS ROOM IS.

           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             THERE IS TOO MUCH GOING ON - THE MATCHING STROBE AND THE BAND PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND - FOR THIS TO BE IN SOMEONE'S HOME. AT THIS POINT IT IS MOST LIKELY HAPPENING IN COMET.

             I agree with all that as well.

            <p>
             However, why the band to drown out the sounds? Soundproofing is not difficult. It is, complex, expensive.. noise is cheap and mobile masking and when you add the pizza delivery + entertainment aspect you've got a color by numbers makeshift turnkey franchise.
            </p>
            <p>
             These assholes are all sheep and color by numbers is their key to success. They also always want to be the biggest.. global, and dominate in all they do.

             In Fatherhood there is a kid running around in the shower stall. In the caillou video it looks like a kid laying down on the floor. You can clearly see a face on the floor at about the 10 second mark.

             I don't think it's happening in Comet.  That doesn't make any sense.  Too much noise.  My guess about the lighting being the same is that if CPP is a CIA type of front organisation they are well versed in colour therapy and the way lighting affects the psyche.  So, having inappropriate bands playing to 'all ages' within a dungy environment is a softly, softly approach to affecting the psyches of audience members.  It's why for example, I don't lsiten to certain types of pop music or watch a lot of TV, as much information I know will be affecting me at a subconscious level.

             I see the child and it's fucked up as shit, but a shower can be built anywhere there's plumbing.  We know Comet Pizza has plumbing and we know the Podesta boys know what they're doing with construction.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's that unaccounted for area at the Pegasus Museum and Podesta seemed us to really not want to look at Pegasus, the thread on it is interesting everyone should go read it they have an upstairs room that they photoshopped out of a pic and the sliding lofts make it so no one can leave the upstairs room or use the stairs to go up without the loft in place, read more here:

             The lighting being the same makes me think it's CPP though.  They could just carry that light orb from the background of the Heavy Breathing speech over to wherever they've built a shower.  It wouldn't take much room, and we know they have that #killroom etc  There's tons of places you could fit a little shower like that especially if you have a team of pedos that do regular construction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just don't want people to stop looking at CPP, the red/purple/blue lighting with the occasional green flash is the same as in the Heavy Breathing speech, that can't be a coincidence.

              It could easily be in Tony Podesta's basement special video room, using similar lights   It actually could be a lot of places.  You can't just be so certain that because some lights look similar that it is proven, it is a lead, maybe a hunch, but not proof.

              If all you have is a hammer... New citizen investigators, we need to be critical of new evidence. Once we've ruled out other possibilities/explanations for a piece of evidence does it become worthwhile. 
     This video seems to show torture of a child for the purpose of getting them to call the man "father". That's it really. It's sick yes. Who's voice is that? We have no clue. How many other people have we compared the voice to? zero. A lot of us consciously or unconsciously want the voice in the video to be John Podesta's voice but even if we can convince ourselves that it is, what good is that as a serious piece of evidence. It isn't.
     Where did the video come from? Worldcorpo.net a shitty website by all accounts. Why is it there? who does worldcorpo.net belong to? the "whois" search comes up with google inc. That doesn't seem right. What connection is there from worldcorp? None that I've seen. Lots of other creepy crappy videos on there, none of them link to anything we know belongs with pizzagate stuff. 
     The strobe light matches CPP? Are you kidding me? People are trying to put a random bathroom torture scene at one of 3 locations. CPP, podestas house or Pegasus museum. 3 out of how many bathrooms in the world again?
     This MK-Ultra, SRA, CP stuff sucks and is horrible and can't/shouldn't be ignored. But please keep your thinking caps on.

               That's funny, but I seem to have compared the voice to everyone that I've ever heard. I'm also confident in my ability to recognize nuance in audio patterns.. do it all the time. There's no doubt.. no point casting doubt. It is a VERY exact match. A null test wouldn't tell you more.
              </p>
              <p>
               What good do you think a 'serious piece of evidence' would be? I think that's the one you're breaking your teeth on. I think you could get a signed video confession and people would still be left sucking their thumbs. You know, since you want to cast doubt.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah, the light matches CPP. How is it a 'random' scene? This is purely spastic in nature? There are no other links? Honestly.. and so fucking what what other possibilities existed? Doesn't negate the fact that the light patterns are a very close match (and could also be replicated in the other places). In fact, one should expect them to be.

              <p>
               For those unfamiliar with this, AnonymousScandanavia's twitter has been dropping cryptic clues for awhile leading up to may be a big reveal on Feb. 19, 2017.  Julian Assange in New Zealand.

              </p>
              <p>
               Vault 7 - if it means nothing to you, there are hundreds of people discussing the possible meaning of it all.
               <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vault+7&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">
                https://www.google.com/search?q=vault+7&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               The following is supposed to be important: Earlier article from Assange "Google Is Not What It Seems" (by Julian Assange)
               <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">
                https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/

              <p>
               Note: Google searches on this often do not bring up all of the information. However, if you run searches in DuckDuckGo or other alternative search engines, you will get more on Vault7 and Pizzagate.

              A shower could've easily been built in Comet for the sole purpose of washing off after engaging with children. This is actually extremely likely, and we've already got those suspect Instagram photos of Alefantis digging holes in the restaurant and when questioned on them he replied "have you heard of plumbing?"

Stop jumping to ridiculous conclusions. Multicolor strobes are cheap and plentiful. All have controllers that allow you to change colors.

                Live performance, same strobe lights. Showers obviously are a 'must' because it's some messy stuff going on. That's what all the tiles are about. Obvious.

                It is videos like these (Fatherhood), and worse, that the FBI said made them sick.

             It says last modified "2016-06-24 17:30 5.8M", but it just appeared in there. So does that mean these dates are when these were recorded (so Fatherhood and Each were actually recorded 8 hours apart on the same day?)?
            </p>
            <p>
             It shows an old bearded fat guy crawling around a fenced in beach(??) area with a feather duster up his butt. Very clear shots of his face when he crawls back to the camera.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why the fuck is worldcorpo still uploading? Why hasn't the site been taken down...false flags or someone trying to help us? wtf is going on. Why would a new video appear today?

                Gary Lee Monroe has a diff voice from video.  It's not his voice.  The added part is obviously to discredit the first part.  The first part was not acting...or they should both receive academy awards.

               It could be that this video was leaked, or about to be leaked, and so to get out in front of it, they had to leak it themselves, and surround it with 'modern art' videos (which must have already existed).
              </p>
              <p>
               That is what disinformation is.  Information mixed with a small amount of lies.  So in this case the 'Fatherhood' video can be portrayed as just 'modern art', and not 'clear evidence of torture of a child by __________' (possibly Hillary Clinton's campaign manager!)
              </p>
              <p>
               So, a real video, that they want to control the narrative about?  Unless they show how they filmed this video, that has to remain the hypothesis.

               Guys listen. The only thing we need to make sense of here, is that these people are messed up and evil. Children are being tortured, raped and killed. I know we're trying to connect the dots. But we most likely won't find any ties being uploaded to the original video. Pizzagate as a whole throws things around like crazy. We've connected many of the dots, but many of the stuff is just evidence that leaves us asking "WTF?" Now I feel like I'm rambling. This video just really disturbs me.

              Yeah there's a few vids on there where you can see this guys face. This seems to be the clearest though. I really don't know what to think. Part of me thinks this website was created as a whistleblower purely for the "Fatherhood" video to be leaked, and the rest of these clips are just sort of "filler" meant to disguise the Fatherhood video as being part of a collection and not a standalone vid which I believe it is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't believe this guy in these vids who's face we can see, as fucking deranged and disgusting as he is, has anything to do with the Fatherhood video, or else I would think he would be posting more intense abusive shit of his own.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm really not sure, obviously, as none of us are at this point. The Fatherhood video is the clip of interest, still, with the leads to Podesta's voice etc. The others are disgusting but somewhat irrelevant unless he releases something that ties him to the Fatherhood video directly.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also can't connect this freak's voice and face to the same voice in Fatherhood. It's just not this guy.

               The piss video show the fat bearded man's face as well. It is him pissing in a toilet then scooping up pissy toilet water and drinking it. Deranged for sure.. sometimes I hate the internet.

               I agree that I also don't think this guy is related to the Fatherhood video.
              </p>
              <p>
               But why is this site still being curated (videos like this being added and videos like Dad.mp4 (where the guy (late teen or early adult, couldn't tell) is being forced to rub poop on himself in a shower, have been removed) at ALL?
              </p>
              <p>
               And why would Fatherhood and Each not be removed if someone is curating?  Is it some kind of trap or some kind of help or some kind of plausible denial having the other vids up etc?

                So mostly it has edge play bdsm videos with adults, the kid shit seems to be mixed in.
               </p>
               <p>
                Terms like big/little, daddy/daughter, daddy/boy are all commonly used in adult bdsm role play. It may help to know the terminology when searching.

                Side note: all for adults doing what they want with consent of other adults, pedos can get bent.

             Agreed. Dead on analysis. The only thing I can't seem to hear is the other voices. Others have mentioned them, but I can't hear any other moaning or voices. I seem to hear the muddled chatter of a tv or radio going in the background, but it's not distinct enough to tell for sure. Does anyone else hear this?

              I can't hear the other voices, the man's voice is too loud and close to the mic and the kid's screams are too overwhelming to be able to focus on background noise. We need someone brave enough (or drunk enough) to dissect the audio.

               I tried dissecting the audio. It left me with a headache and feeling sick. I'll try again soon. You can check my submission history for an edit I made removing the child from the audio.

             Well said and totally makes sense. This is really horrific but there is clearly something like this going on. Looks like some kind of MKULTRA abuse / SRA - to shatter the mind.

              "To shatter the mind."  'Shatter' is the perfect word for it.  This video makes me so sick.  I wish I hadn't watched it the first time and I'm not allowing myself to watch it a second time, because the pictures show enough for me and I remember a lot of what I saw the first time.  I have DID and I don't remember a lot of what happened to me, which I consider a good thing for now because I don't think I could handle knowing what some of my alters know and remember.  If my mind hadn't
              <em>
               shattered
              </em>
              into those pieces to create others who could suffer the trauma for me, I really don't think I'd be alive today.  It's sick and I feel so freaking helpless because I want to do something; I want it to stop, but I can't think of anything I can do.  I feel powerless to help them.  Even though these things are a trigger to me, I refuse to turn my head and ignore what's happening to those kids.  There are far too many people who are already doing that.  I just have to be careful who I try to talk to about this because sometimes my symptoms include paranoia and sometimes they misconstrue this as paranoia.  I wish I could just convince people to look into it themselves but no one wants to hear it or know about it.  It's heartbreaking.  Sorry about the long reply and most is irrelevant to this topic, but I just wanted to tell you that 'shatter' is truly the right word.

               , thank you for sharing such a difficult &amp; personal story. I think it's wise to put some distance between you &amp; this particular case because the last thing you'd want is to be triggered somehow. I hope you take meds, they've done wonders for me &amp; made a life that was extremely difficult turn around to be totally opposite. Best wishes to you. You're stronger than you think! :)

               Thank you, everyone for your support.  I was expecting to come back to a lot of hate, but it really made me feel good to see the support you've shown.

               I was going to reply that my therapist often uses the word 'fragmented' and then I saw it in the link you shared.  Shattered is harsher of a word... fragmented seems like a politically correct term for it, and shattered is like its blunt sibling that simply tells it like it is.  I am also an artist - a cartoonist.  I'd love to be an animator someday.  I have an alter who recently discovered that he likes to paint digitally on my drawing tablet.  It's crazy how different our styles are.  I have a very young alter who draws too, but it looks like an actual child drew the drawings.  I've only been working on this in therapy for a tiny bit over a year, so the terminology is still kind of new and the things we are really capable of still amazes me and I don't really understand all of it.  Anyway, I really do appreciate everyone's support, especially when I wasn't expecting it.  I hope with all my heart that this stops soon.  I know it won't completely stop, and probably never will, but if they get a huge chunk of it stopped, that's at least something.  I have more hope for it to stop right now than I did even a few weeks ago.

                , have you looked on YouTube regarding alters? There are so many fascinating videos where people talk or show their alters. It's therapeutic &amp; the alters seem to enjoy having their own voice &amp; place for expression. I don't know how you'd feel about doing that but if you're not into making videos, you can always watch somebody else's. Hope this helps!

               Thank you for the reply and I feel for you and what you've been through. I've been reading a lot about MKULTRA, Project Monarch, and Satanic Ritual Abuse. As a social worker working with abuse victims I have come across DID (dissociative identity disorder) which used to be called and is commonly referred to as 'multiple personality syndrome'.
              </p>
              <p>
               One thing i know is that the mind is incredibly complex and like all parts of our anatomy has biolgical and chemical self-defence mechanisms. In the case of the human psyche, the mind can split into separate alternative identities as a form of self-protection. Its trauma-related.  In a way the mind is compartmentalising and hiding extreme distress because a single person cannot cope with it. So people like Kim Noble hide the worst abuse memories in her 'Ria Pratt' alter, which she uses painting as a form of therapy.
              </p>

               But shatter is better. Because its breaking something which was once whole and the individual pieces are not the whole but now distinct.

               I just wanted to stop in and say you're not alone. A lot of us are dealing with this, and a lot of people care, hence this open source investigation. It is eerie how perfect the word "shatter" is here.

             Many are tortured and killed, others are groomed to become assassins, or CIA black op operatives like JA, others find thelmselves in the media or in high powered position in washington. Now we understand what Newt Gingrich meant by Donald not being part of the club - THE CLUB! He has not gone through the initiations - Newt's own words. Is Newt part of it - I bet my bottom dollar he is. It emerged that Anderson Cooper was abused by mother who was into satanism. What about Megyn Kelly? Would a normal woman given that freak Alifantis a free pass? The sooner the public wakes up to reality the better!

              Re: Gingrich, he's a NWO guy... but... given how fucked up all of that is, I can't be sure there aren't some folks within it who would prefer that it go away.  For all I know, Gingrich may be one of those.  Messed up, but not so messed up that he has no soul at all.
