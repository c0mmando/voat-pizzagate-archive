<p>CFR members created and run the Carlyle Group. Carlyle manages more than $75 bil in assets and
 has bought and sold a list of military contractors.   Carlyle Group is one of the world’s largest private

America has never turned back from the road of huge military spending. Spending that included the
 purchase of radioactive fallout on American citizens in the 50\'s, and buying thermonuclear waste from
 the Russians as we approached the year 2000. Spending resulting in a national debt of $18 Trillion 
Dollars that continues to grow.   and interest payments have grown from of $270 
billion a year to $880 billion a year. </p>

Foreign Relations trying to make the United States economically vulnerable to influence from outside sources,(NWO)

            Trump is in bed with all those organizations. So there is that. So Jesuit loving pedo Island visiting Trump who likens his foreign policy to that of Kissinger, well take on his brothers and sisters in the secret societies and will join with the corrupted FBI that is now going clean, to take um all down. I guess I will have to wait you guys out on this. Eventually, you will run out of patience and start seeing all the evidence you already compiled and use it. So as I always ask, how do you guys want to get things started? Let me know when you are done with the Trump psyop.

             I never understood why everyone continued to believe in trump draining the swamp after we all saw that his cabinet is full of Goldman Sachs execs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last time I voted for pres was when Dr Ron Paul ran. He would have actually had the balls to try and fix this country; although, I don't think they would have let him live if he would have won the election. I don't want to feel like we're screwed, but that's how I've felt since 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             I got a little caught up in the trump hysteria and hoped maybe he would be different but I realized pretty quickly that all the hate thrown his way on the msm is fabricated. TPTB aren't stupid, they see that people are quickly waking up to what is going on in this country, so I personally think trump is their controlled opposition. Maybe he wasn't at first, maybe they pressured him or bought him out, I don't know, but he is definitely just another puppet at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that the federal reserve still stands and trump hasn't made a peep about doing away with it tells me everything I need to know about his purpose in all of this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is here to lull everyone back to sleep. Back to the left right republican democrat liberal conservative paradigm...it seems to be working honestly.

              any good he does will not be aired, you know why
he is not here to lull us back to sleep at all.   I think what you are expressing is frustration at how slow things
are moving.   I feel the same way.  however I have to remind myself I have no idea what is going on behind the
scenes----what strategy he is using etc.
              <br/>
              my opinion--no one gets that wealthy without some guilt under his belt.   He borrowed money from the rothchilds 
paid them back before time due.  they are not happy with him....lol    he does want to get rid of the fed reserve..
you must believe-------or all hope is gone....:)

               I want to believe but I don't want to blindly follow. That's what happened with Obama - all the people that voted for him and believed in him, blindly believed that he could do no wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
               If trump does end up saving the country, I'll admit I was wrong about him, but I can't just keep believing he's gonna change anything when presently things are the same. I do hope things will get better, I just know the cards are stacked against us. It might take more than politics to fix this, and I'm not sure most people are awake enough for that.
              </p>
              <p>
               I pray every day that good will overcome evil in the battle for our country and for all the children suffering. Its hard, every day that passes is another day of suffering for those stuck in horrible situations, and everyday is a day closer to the agenda that tptb are trying to achieve. Lord please stop the madness.

            You need to support your thesis that Racine is central to pizzagate. All you've done is provided explanations of the organizations and listed the names of political members in Racine.

             They use Racine as a model toward Agenda 2030 and Total Global Enslavement. We will use it for Global Enlightenment.

              Say we had good evidence, who would we give it to?  Would the media plaster all the daming evidence, or cover it up? Would the DOJ get right to work? FBI go clean and put an end to it instead of covering it up? This needs to be explained, because I feel you are all running in circles, and I am starting to see it is by design. We have to do this ourselves. Again, let me know when you guys are done with hoping the  "authorites" go from completely corrupt to taking down the system. And if you are not waiting for that, what good do you think evidence will do?

               Many people in Racine, Wisconsin already gave evidence to the District Attorney, State Attorney General, County Sheriffs, multiple Police Departments, congressmen and Senators, the FBI, the DOJ and other authorities. Once each of them came to realize that it was connected to groups including SC Johnson, Clinton Foundation, Rotary International, the mafia, and secret societies, they tried to dismiss it or pass it onto another agency until it went all the way to the top to Loretta Lynch who was personally involved in the RICO investigations. They actively covered it up, obstructed the investigations, and enabled gang stalking, retaliation, and other forms of intimidation.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a result, an alarming string of sudden resignations in Racine County have occurred involving many officials involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The latest is the criminal mayor who was involved in racketeering and a long list of crimes involving these groups, and was rewarded by being appointed to control the Great Lakes fresh water supply with private corrupt interests. It is part of Agenda 2030. The FBI, CIA, DOJ, DHS and other groups are involved in the network with an unusual number of secret society members and Luciferians linked with LDS, Jesuits, Kabbalah, and OTO. Trump is also involved, and is enabling the system to continue through deal-making with Clintons and others.
              </p>
              <p>
               Paul Ryan was the third person on the secret plane meeting with Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch. They know Racine is a weak link and main hub of the entire network.
              </p>
              <p>
               THERE IS NO JUSTICE IN OUR BROKEN &amp; CORRUPT SYSTEM. THE ONLY ANSWER IS TO EXPOSE THE REAL TRUTH AND UNITE THE WORLD.
              </p>
              <p>
               Their real agenda is Total Global Enslavement through Sustainability and forcing the The Mark of the Beast through Community Policing.
              </p>
              <p>
               The "ROOT" of all Evil and the model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is Racine, Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               Shine the light on Racine, and we can Save the World together.

            Well I wonder why Les Aspin died at the age of 56?  So young.  At Georgetown University Hospital, no less. Hmm.  Yes, and I am sure that the CFR had a hand in that radio active material called uranium dumped in various places all over the country, including St. Louis.  The Manhattan Project that came out of the Bilderburg Group had a hand in it.  All connected to the CFR and their thirst and hunger for war and profit. Thank you for another insightful and well written post
