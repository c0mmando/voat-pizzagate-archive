<p>Pizzagate began with researchers reading Wikileaks/Clinton emails and discovering that convicted child trafficker Laura Sillsby and her &quot;charity&quot; was mentioned several times. She was caught trying to illegally transport over 30 &quot;orphans&quot; into the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, where they planned to build an orphanage:</p>
<p>&quot;On Wednesday, a Reddit post titled “I believe I have connected a convicted child abductor who was caught stealing children in Haiti with the Clintons,” contained a list of email links regarding Laura Silsby, former director of The New Life Children’s Refuge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Silsby was found guilty in Haiti of child trafficking in 2010, after she attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children — all but one of the children had at least one living parent and were not orphans. Nine others who were arrested along with her were freed, thanks to the efforts of the Clintons.&quot;  
</p>
<p>&quot;“Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura’s NGO (EmailID 3776). Laura had claimed she planned to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but authorities in the country said she never submitted an application for this purpose. They instead located to Haiti,” the Redditor wrote.&quot;

<p>In a recent VOAT discussion, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2932236">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2932236</a> Carmencita posted:</p>

<p>&quot;She and her husband had a close relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton and a couple of other names listed.The Kissingers, Charlie Rose and Barbara Walters</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger: It’s Personal. Very Personal.</p>
<p>What Clinton did not mention was that her bond with Kissinger was personal as well as professional, as she and her husband have for years regularly spent their winter holidays with Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, at the beachfront villa of fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, who died in 2014, and his wife, Annette, in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>The Clintons and Kissingers appear to spend a chunk of their quality time together at that de la Renta estate in the Punta Cana resort. Last year, the Associated Press noted that this is where the Clintons take their annual Christmas holiday. And other press reports in the United States and the Dominican Republic have pointed out that the Kissingers are often part of the gang the de la Rentas have hosted each year. When Oscar de la Renta died in 2014, the New York Times obituary reported:</p>
<p>Over Christmas the Kissingers were among the close group who gathered in Punta Cana, including Barbara Walters, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Charlie Rose. “We have two house rules,” says Oscar, laughing. “There can be no conversation of any substance and nothing nice about anyone.”
This gathering of the Clintons, the Kissingers, and the de la Rentas seems to occur most years. In 2011, de la Renta, a native of the Dominican Republic, told Vogue that he built this seaside estate so he could host his close friends, and he cited the Kissingers and Clintons as examples. “At Christmas,” he said, “we’re always in the same group.”&quot;</p>
<p>I did more digging and found this:</p>
<p>Oscar was WELL connected and talented. He is a key to all sorts of relationships. Here is an excellent in-depth article on his life. MUST READ. Here\'s some info on his house in Dominican Republic : “He loves their house in Kent, Connecticut, where he’s created gardens that supply “the most spiritual and purest of joys,” and the house in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where he has built an orphanage and day care center that serves more than 1,200 children.&quot; &quot;Their dinner parties – in their homes in Manhattan, Connecticut and the Dominican Republic – were legendary, mixing old and new money with fashion, entertainment and politics.&quot; &quot;“He works side-by-side with his stepdaughter, he dotes on his adopted son Moises, and he has an enormously wide range of close friends, all of whom say pretty much the same thing that Nancy Kissinger did years ago: “Oscar and Annette are the two most thoughtful people I’ve ever known.”&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In June 2001, he created a garden for Lord Jacob Rothschild at Waddesdon Manor, the turreted French château-style home built for the Rothschild family in Buckinghamshire, England. Read more about it here.&quot; &quot; Life in the social world’s elite advanced for Oscar when he became the third husband of Françoise de Langlade in 1967....She had been a mistress of Baron Elie de Rothschild, and married firstly to French businessman Jean Bruère, and secondly, diplomat Nicholas Bagenow.&quot; <a href="http://www.mylusciouslife.com/fashion-history-oscar-de-la-renta-bio-archive/">http://www.mylusciouslife.com/fashion-history-oscar-de-la-renta-bio-archive/</a></p>
<p>Hillary\'s BFF is Lynn Forrester Rothschild. Lynn was introduced to Rothschild by Henry Kissinger:</p>
<p>&quot;The former Jersey girl wants a fairer world and a certain friend in the White House.
Sometime during the months after Hillary Clinton had stepped down as secretary of state and before she announced to the country that she would mount another run for president, Lynn Forester de Rothschild said this to her longtime friend: “I just want you to know I pray every night that I die before my children and after you are president.”&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her friendship with the Clintons dates back to the early ’90s, to Bill Clinton’s first campaign and administration. Lynn Forester was already a powerhouse Democratic fundraiser and played a small role in his administration. It was Henry Kissinger who introduced her in 1998 to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild at the Bilderberg Group conference, an annual confab of industry and political leaders, in Scotland.
Two years later they were married...&quot;

<p>According to a Jimmy Comet instagram pic, Lynn appeared to support David Brock\'s book launch at her River House.</p>',

            Clintons’ Haitian Black Magic Secret
by Corey Digs
           </p>
           <p>
            "Some may already be aware of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s experience with voodoo from the passage in Bill Clinton’s memoir “My Life”. However, I don’t believe anyone is aware of their dark secret regarding the former President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his black magic.....this journey begins in 1975 when the Clintons took their first trip to Haiti shortly after they married........Bill, Hillary, and their friend David Edwards had the opportunity to see voodoo in practice in a village near Port-au-Prince. The priest was Max Beauvoir, who had abandoned his career as a chemical engineer when his voodoo-priest grandfather died and named him as his successor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beauvoir gave them a “brief course in voodoo theology” as Clinton described it. Later that afternoon, the ceremony began. Clinton wrote:
           </p>
           <p>
            “After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton wrote that his “brief foray into the world of voodoo” furthered his fascination with “the way different cultures try to make sense of life, nature, and the virtually universal belief that there is a nonphysical spirit force at work in the world.”.......  The headlines of the March 29, 1995 issue of the Haiti Observateur read: “CLINTON ASSISTERA A UNE CEREMONIE VAUDOU EN HAITI” (Clinton to assist in a voodoo ceremony in Haiti). The story, confirmed by Haitian officials, stated that initiating Clinton under the power of voodoo had two purposes — to render him impervious to the attacks of his Republican enemies in Washington, and to guarantee his re-election."

            I personally visited Haiti in the early '80's when Jean-Claude Duvalier was still President (he was later overthrown and fled with all the country's money). I accompanied Christian doctors on a medical missions trip. Very eye opening! Trump's "shit hole" description would have been accurate at that time. Haiti had no sanitation infrastructure, just open trenches. The AIDS epidemic was in full swing. People lined up and waited all day to see a doctor for the first time. One doctor commented that they should have brought a vet, because most of the health issues they saw were common animal ailments. Many worm pills were given, only to be later taken with unclean water. I remember thinking that the best thing that could be done to help Haiti would be to supply clean water. The people were desperately poor, but thankful for the help. AIDS orphaned four year olds would carry two year old siblings on their backs to bring them to a missionary's free meal center. Their only meal for the day. Heartbreaking! One of the young Haitians hired to translate quietly confided to me that voodoo was secretly practiced in the Catholic church. A Christian Haitian pastor said that the voodoo priests were putting hexes on him and trying to run him out of the community for sharing the Gospel with citizens.  Truly, there is a demonic stronghold there.

              The making of Oscar is interesting with his grandmother and mother obviously elites in any time on that Island. When he got to NY it was Ben Shaw (Mr 7th Ave.) that gave him the real platform. His Son Jerry was 50% partners in Oscar De La Renta until a buyout in 1988. Jerry died and I can not remember the name of his two sons. My point being that the Shaws were the money and the connections for him, are still a big deal up there. A Derek Shaw is also mentioned in Epsteins book. Jerry had a penthouse in the fashion district, as well as a spread out in (Fairfield or new Fairfield?), while Oscar chose Kent. Halfway to NY is Chappaqua. Wes Craven also filmed in Kent. Sorry, I can't remember where Jerry lived, but I was a stupid 17 year old at the time, so paying attention was not my thing yet. I do remember it was close to NYC.

            Very interesting, excellent work. It goes to show that all of this has nothing to do with political parties.

            There's been a lot made of none of the deep state elites tweeting over the holidays. I wonder if they ever do, has anyone checked? I would but don't do twitter myself other than to click on a tweet here and there.

            Every wealthy elite family is/was out of town right now. They never spend Christmas at home or in their own country. Many of the Rothschilds were in the Maldives. Other “elites” were in Harbour Island, this one is well known in their circles. Doing who knows what...
