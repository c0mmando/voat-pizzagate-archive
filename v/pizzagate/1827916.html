Heggs praises and links to a super creepy video by his friend that features. Can you guess ? Kids. Of course.

Check out the animation at 2:25 mark. Appears to be an old woman taking the souls of little kids and then pinning their dead bodies to her hat.
Hegg\'s friend is Temple Bates. Her art has a theme of creepy kids also. (dot com)

           <p>
            I have been thinking about this post since I viewed it yesterday and believe it is a depiction inside the world of the elite banker/illuminati/MK control messed up world we find ourselves in.  It seems especially so after viewing the video by the Dutch banker, Ronald Bernard, who talks about rising up the levels in the elite banking world, where people like him are compartmentalized in their jobs, and the entire world is oblivious to what the few are doing to control the world.  First off, the animation video in this post is called "Peeker", because it is giving viewers a peek inside the world as they see it.  I think we may be the man/child (abused as indicated by a band aid on their head) inside the snow globe who is doing a mindless activity, because the things we are concerned with in our daily lives, working, sports, etc., are meaningless as far as making any changes to the world.  We have no control and  are simply their toys/entertainment.  Then you see the "eye" (illuminati) peeking through the window watching one of their lower level clowns(politicians?) watching us.  The eye belongs to a doped up robotic  person who turns the cranks for the old mustached man to rise up the elevator in a playhouse to the different levels of hierarchy in their system where each level seems progressively worse.  Level 4 is when the man/woman is killing little babies, whose souls later haunt them. The person looks distressed over what they "had to do". Level 4 brought to mind the Dutch Banker and his experience with rising up the levels and getting to the point where he was asked to sacrifice children.  His conscience kicked in and he could not do it, because he was not mind-numbed on drugs as his associates were.  The next level shows a  banged, bearded clown person blowing a frog/baby  around the table.  I don't know what to think about that, other than it is a higher level politician, and we are the frogs.  Level 7 is the treadmill with electric shock being done by a person with a smirk on their face who is not even watching.  It also reminded me of something the banker had said.  He told about how his actions had caused an Italian businessman to go bankrupt and commit suicide.  At the time, he laughed about it when he heard what had happened.  It did not occur to him that he was destroying people's lives.

             That is a spot on analysis. Don't be too disheartened by these creepy revelations. There are good people in every facet of society. Not perfect, but people who have power and can't look the other way. What one needs to keep reminding themselves when facing these horrors, is the desired outcome. Which for every good soul is to unmask these people and put a stop to their deeds. No, it can't be 100%, but keep fighting the good fight.

            The Dialogue does a really good analysis on Cathy O'Brien, Brice Taylor and Fiona Barnett SAR/MK-Ultra victims, but what I found interesting was the video at 9 mins 47 seconds where the camera zooms in on Brice Taylors daughters eyes, they look like they have the same defect that Madeleine McCann has, or is it my imagination?  The interesting thing about this point in the interview she is talking about the royal family being interested in her genetics in the bloodline and that it has a special component.  By the way, does anyone know who the baby son its she talks about 'giving up to the royals'?  Does he have the same eyes?  Source: The Dialogue, youtube

            Child with hands bound behind back, on treadmill being zapped by current to the sadistic whim of that creepy old woman - life imitates art. This is entertainment to them. Again, trait of a psychopath is to let it hide in plain sight to get high on duper's delight. They are one twisted sadistic SOBs! They will get what's comming. Please share this with anyone you know and ask then what they think - it's a sanity check. If anyone does not give it at least an 8 on 'Disturbing' meter is a sadistic pedo or he/she has had a lobotomy!

             Inside Pedo-Malcovic - deranged, degenerate, diseased subconscious of a pedo on meth! Why doesn't Colbert show that to his audience - I am sure he will think of some nice sadistically-funny pedo jokes (wow a new phrase)! This is a spiritual war whether you are a Christian or an athiest - this is the time to come together!
