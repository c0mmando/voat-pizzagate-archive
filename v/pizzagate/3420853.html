<p>New York/ – New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, recently announced that he will personally fund the creation of four charter schools in New York City. The announcement was welcomed by New York financier and education philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, a long-time supporter of Bloomberg, has financed numerous charter schools across the country including the Maya Angelou schools in Washington DC, the highly acclaimed Bard High School Early College in New York City and the Harlem Link Charter School.</p>
<p>Bloombergs funding will come through his foundation, the Young Mens Initiative, which is also funded by George Soros Open Society Foundations. Once approved by the state Board of Regents, the co-ed charter high schools will open in September 2014, alongside four public schools in five high-poverty neighborhoods: in Brooklyn, the South Bronx, Queens and East Harlem. Both the public and charter schools will share a board of trustees, with Melanie Hartzog, a former City Hall official for Health and Human Services, as a proposed member....</p>

<p>NEW YORK/ Well-known science philanthropist,</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, founder of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard</p>
<p>University, has provided essential funding to the famed Institute for Advanced</p>
<p>Study at Princeton. The funding comes at a time when four Institute physicists</p>

<p>in particle physics.</p>
<p>&quot;There\'s no better time to invest in particle physics,&quot; Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>asserted. &quot;Much needed unifying theories are finally coming to light.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, each of the four physicists who received the Fundamental Physics Prize</p>
<p>was cited for their unparalleled contributions to physics. Arkani-Hamed was</p>
<p>cited for his theories on large extra dimensions, the Higgs boson,</p>

<p>showing that &quot;black holes and quantum mechanics are compatible, resolving the</p>
<p>black hole information paradox&quot; and for providing &quot;a useful tool for the study</p>
<p>of strongly coupled quantum systems.&quot; Seiberg was named for his unifying quantum</p>
<p>field, string and supersymmetric quantum field theories and Witten for non</p>

<p>NEW YORK/ The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation has given crucial funding to the New York Academy of Art, one of the few graduate art schools in the United States that focus on a purely classical approach to the visual arts.  The funding comes at a critical time for the Academy since it has recently expanded its continuing education and alumni programs, along with its master classes and special events.</p>

            </h1>
            <p>
             NEW YORK, Feb. 19, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Jeffrey Epstein, one of the largest funders of scientists around the world and the founder of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University, has put his support behind WildAid Inc. and China's first real crackdown on ivory poaching.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just last year, the Chinese government destroyed approximately 6 tons of confiscated ivory in the city of Dongguan near Guangzhou. The act represented the largest embargo on the Chinese ivory market. The embargo came on the tails of WildAid Inc.'s consistent efforts to raise awareness in China. And to support them, the

            <p>
             The well-known science philanthropist and founder of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University, has heralded the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the first inhibitor combination clinical trial for melanoma patients.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's about time," Jeffrey Epstein remarked who donated substantial funds to the Melanoma Research Alliance (MRA) over the last few years. Based in Washington DC, the MRA is the largest private funder of melanoma research and has awarded more than $49 million to researchers around the world...

             "Chinese government destroyed approximately 6 tons of confiscated ivory in the city of Dongguan near Guangzhou." Sure they did. The philanthropists in the MSM  told us so. I told everyone about Beckham's properties in Sarasota, Florida right? WildAid is the opposite. My Dad was right all along. Biggest assholes in the World!
