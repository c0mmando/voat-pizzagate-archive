<p>“Documents from the Obama administration have been transferred to the Barack Obama Presidential Library.  You may send your request to the Obama Library.

RAIDED by the GOOD GUYS (per POTUS).
Shockingly quiet. 
No leaks?
Presidential libraries are put in place to retain control over self-incriminating c-doc releases.
Scam!
Review the law.
What is different re: Hussein’s PL?
Who controls?
These people really are stupid.
Q</p>
<p>Then this article, which I think someone on Voat discovered when article was published in Oct:  <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama-presidential-library-scholars-academics-children/2017/10/10/id/818858/">https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obama-presidential-library-scholars-academics-children/2017/10/10/id/818858/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Once completed, the library will include a play garden for children, outdoor picnic space, basketball courts and a recording studio. It won\'t have all of the former president\'s documents, letters, and gifts he collected while in office, unlike most presidential libraries, which typically house the early drafts of speeches, legislation and correspondence that researchers and students can sift through.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the lack of personal materials, the library could still hold value for historians and researchers, according to the former head of construction and development for former President Bill Clinton\'s presidential library. Here\'s how it will be attractive: through the forums, workshops and programs they conduct,&quot; said James Rutherford, now dean of the William J. Clinton School of Public Service, to the Tribune. &quot;They can host conferences with administration officials, discussions on how Obama approached healthcare, how he developed the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order. That\'s how the center will become a research institution.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Apparently this library won\'t house the usual records, it won\'t be under normal scrutiny or oversight, and according to the article title will be the &quot;Obama Library More for Children Than a Place for Scholars.&quot;!?!?  What is this...are (((they))) serious?!?!</p>',

            Off topic autist post here , Saudi billionaires arrested and NOW Montecito Ca., home to the highest concentration of US billionaires,  has been evacuated for 4 days with manmade fires surrounding it. I predict the enclave burns but not before billions worth of art and jewelry disappear, smells like Trump .

            Construction on former President Barack Obama's presidential library has yet to begin, but current plans indicate children will have more interest there than scholars, The Chicago Tribune reports.  Sounds Wonderful doesn't it?  Well it would have, before we found out what we know now.  A garden for children, a basketball court,  that sounds really refreshing.  A place for children to play.  Those used to be Innocent Words.  Now they scare me.

as the way he funded/built it (partnership with U of Shitcago) means it's not subject to NARA (national archives &amp; records administration), and therefore not properly secured

              If so that means Trump does not give a shit then right? Because if he did Obama would never survive the scrutiny right? And with pizzagate in the air don't you reckon Obama is smarter than that and is thumbing his nose at us? Making wild claims with nothing to back it up, and then nothing happening, seems to be a habit going around lately. Seems to be coming from Qville, and coincidentally the same village that wants to support a Freemasonic Party full of pedophiles.

                I'm still wondering why yall don't sift through it in CBTS and only bring back the jewels because by not doing that it only makes Qville look like a prediction center that rarely yields fruit. If yall would stop posting it until you actually find something valuable I bet your support factor would rise. I might even come in there and help you dig through it but as long as it keeps getting dumped here every time Q utters a sound it only annoys me.

                 I agree with you there. There is the CBTS forum. Bringing back the jewels to pizzagate is a great idea. Now when I post about Q, I post it there and then just ping the ones I know that are interested in Q. That way the pizzagate sub isn't clogged with distractions.

                 I also get annoyed when unrelated posts get to stay up, and related posts get deleted instantly (Organ harvesting)... So, keep calling it out ESOTERICshade, I'm not the only one who thinks its a good thing what you're doing... But when you meet resistance, maybe we'll strike gold... It's a balance act brother.
