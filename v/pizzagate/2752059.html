<p>– A counselor at Camp Napowan faces multiple charges for allegedly having sexual contact with three teens at the camp.</p>
<p>An alleged victim had found Coleman Leonard’s notebook in his room at camp that “contained a list of all the individuals that (Leonard) had done things with at the camp,” according the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Leonard allegedly had contact with three other staff members – ages 14, 15, and 15 – this summer and last at the Scout Camp in Mt. Morris.</p>
<p>The victims described various encounters with Leonard. Leonard admitted to some incidents and denied others, the complaint says.
Leonard faces charges of repeated sexual assault of a child, two counts of child enticement, fourth-degree sexual assault, sexual assault of a child under the age of 16, and exposing a child to harmful material.</p>
<p>The organization\'s CEO and Scout Executive said the following:</p>
<p>This behavior is abhorrent and runs counter to everything ...... Upon learning of these reports, we took immediate action to remove this individual and prohibit him from any future participation in our programs.

            This is a list of who in Congress belonged to the Boy Scouts including the Volunteers.  Check Your State.  I am not saying all of them are abusers but I am sure some will raise eyebrows.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan was a member and Priebus and Walker have ties to the Assoc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boys in Boys Town and the Boy Scouts have been horribly abused for decades.  Extremely Shameful.

              Would not be surprised he is a member of the Knights of Pythias as well.  One of the highest and so he would be a member of all the right ones.  All of them.  Not all of them surely were up to no good, but as I said many were.

                Before his death, in 2010, Byrd was the longest-serving senator in the country’s history. Throughout his career he made many attempts to amend for drawing in 150 members to the Klan, and for attaining the position of “Exalted Cyclops.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Those attempts led the National Associated for the Advancement of Colored People to issue a statement in praise of Byrd upon his death, and for Clinton, when she was secretary of state at the time, to comment on his passing. She started the video commemoration by saying, “Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd.” Clinton also said that Byrd had been “the heart” of the U.S. Senate.
