<p>Here in the Imo\'s Pizza logo, within the handkerchief, you can see one very clear double hear, and one debatable heart within a heart.</p>
<p>More importantly than that, even, is the fact that on their actual products where the logo is colored, the handkerchief is colored green. Green in handkerchief code means pimp/money maker/hustler, as seen here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code</a></p>
<p>Here is their logo with color. I\'m sure someone out there can find a better one with full color: <a href="http://shop.imospizza.com/v/vspfiles/photos/PNWC1048-1-2.jpg">http://shop.imospizza.com/v/vspfiles/photos/PNWC1048-1-2.jpg</a></p>

            I remember the case of the scumbag Imo's Pizza manager Michael Devlin.   When the police went to his apartment and located the missing boy they were searching for, they found a teenage boy there who had been missing for years.  The teenage boy had grown too old for the sicko's tastes, so Devlin went hunting for a replacement.  I was so sad for those boys.  Their innocence was stolen, and their futures were destroyed before they ever happened.   Partial justice was served when an inmate sickened by Devlin's crimes stabbed the creep with an ice pick.  If only he had finished the job, the monster wouldn't be stealing our air.   On another note, the St. Louis Archdiocese has a long history of covering for their pervert priests.    In the case of some friends of mine, they paid the mother some hush money and promised that the perv priest would be reassigned to a position where he wouldn't be around children.   They lied.   Sorry for sourcing that rag NY Times here, but it covers the main points.

            thanks for your post and your vigilance, but i think you may be reading too much into that logo as well.  imo's is a well-established franchise with over 90 locations, not a shady pizza joint that caters to weirdos and hipsters.   over the course of more than a decade, I worked for 3 separate owners at 6 different shops.  from my experience, i can assure you that the guys i worked for were legit (certainly not-pedo) and that there isn't a chance in hell that any pedo-related activities went on at these stores while i was there (especially at the store that i managed and worked at every day for 5 years...though, obviously, i can't speak for the other franchisees.)
            <br/>
            that being said, all this talk about STL on here the past couple days has really given me pause regarding what sick shit has gone on there over the years....

             I highly appreciate your input! Regarding them being franchises, how much autonomy would you say each store has? I wouldn't go so far as to say the whole chain is involved in trafficking and prostitution, I do think a green handkerchief with a heart within a heart is worth a closer look. My thinking is that most stores have nothing at all to do with it, but maybe one or two and the high ups behind the scenes may be involved in a few different things.

            I always appreciate the skepticism. If you'd like to check out my other St. Louis post(s), I highly suggest it. The main one I mention in the body of this post. There is also this one:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Worth mentioning, there is/was an Imo's location directly across the street from the now defunct Tenet Healthcare's Deaconess Hospital, where a pedophile with the same gene anomaly as Soros and Madeline have had gone missing, the keyhole in the eye, although on him it is manifested differently. Same gene malformation though. Pax2 or Pax6, I believe. Here is his picture:

             http://gustaba.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/supercurioso.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He was likely trying to meet up with a violent pedophile priest that was employed there at the behest of the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm trying to say is this is not all the evidence I have... I have put breadcrumbs out there. Let you plans be dark, as they say.

             could you give a bit more info on that particular case?
             <br/>
             also, sounds like you are from the Lou as well, so you would know that imo's locations are like McD's...fucking everywhere.  so i'm not sure just the fact that there is one across from that hospital really means much (unless, of course, you have more info on that.)
thanks for all your research re: STL recently...it has really begun to open my eyes.  definitely not going to feel the same when i return for a visit this summer...
