            In hindsight, it seems very risky.  He must have known he did not have much more time in this life when he did Eyes Wide Shut.

            Bill Cooper did a whole Mystery Babylon radio show.  He did discuss the Rosicrucian Order, but I do not recall what episode it is.  There are 43 episodes total.

            It should not surprise you that he was gunned down by the police.

            Understood.  It must be thrilling to pull one over on the profane.

            I want to ask you a few questions, since you seen to know a lot about this based on your informative posts.  If you do not mind...

              Was this put up by a particular group within the NWO?   I assume there are different NWO groups with competing interests, some kinder to humanity than others.

              Have you seen 2001: A Space Odyssey?  Specifically, the Dawn of Man sequence.  Here it is with some Bill Cooper commentary.  Are Kubrick and/or Cooper worth listening to?

            It seems like Kubrick was "in the know".  Same with Bill Cooper.

            Someone recently pointed this out to me.  Jack Nicholson is striking the Baphomet pose in that famous Fourth of July picture from the Shining.  As above, so below.  I did not notice it before.

            Congratulations. You've inspired me to post after weeks of lurking. All I know is what I know. I don't know about contacts or any of that. I don't know If the MS weirdos think they're GOOD, EVIL or somewhere in between. What I do know is that worshipping a particular symbol or performing a specific ritual to some fairyland entity is utterly harmless and powerless and should be tolerated by open-minded people.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when you inflict pain on any living being, you reap the result in triplicate. Ultimately, I pity these people. Not only are they utterly devoid of knowledge and power, they are going to pay a high price for their karma.

            It's real simple, folks: don't cause suffering if you can help it. We reap as we sow.

            Absolutely. Another really interesting trend is the forced public transvestism of major celebrities - I can't tell if it's for punishment or ascension,  but you can see this happen again and again with major media icons like Brittney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry, Johnny Depp, etc. Swapping genders can be a source of and initiation into power in the mystery traditions as it allows the person to unite both principles energetically and directly draw on their otherwise untapped power, and that's fine, but it also seems to be tied into the Soros agenda of neutering everyone by stealing their innate energy and subverting it. Tie the former into a very public shaming due to these peoples bizarre behavior and you get something that looks a lot like a death cult initiation through the death of their identity.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to stay on topic with the forum, this absolutely relates to pedophilia and the exact same type of mindset that allows it to continue on and cause so much damage. I mean, I see nothing actually wrong with homosexuality or transgendered people (both behaviors occur normally in the animal kingdom), but when those are FORCED onto children and adults it is irreparably damaging.

            I actually agree with 95% your points about this. Perhaps "enlightenment " wasn't the best term to use - they believe it is their dharma to guide and force the evolution of humanity to a very specific point (which they call global illumination) in which we are a unified body lead by a single head - I was in college at the time i was most active, and I actually changed my major to the now-maligned field of sustainable development to assist in their goal; that's how subtle and manipulative these groups can be, I thought doing so was purely my choice and had no knowledge of the global elites true NWO agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 5% I do not agree with is that they actually believe their end goal is evil - the hermetics in general have a saying: the pendulum must always swing back. These groups believe (and they do so with good reason as it is true) that personal and collective power can be generated and sustained by harmonizing traditionally good acts with evil ones, darkness and light can be equally blinding but where they meet is true power. We see this again and again in the pizzagate investigation and even in some mainstream sources: charities connected with these people do immense good like providing food, shelter, and medicine to those in need...while engineering the conditions that bring about those peoples poverty and then stealing and killing their children. It's all a well coordinated ritual to generate and cultivate spiritual power for the purpose of mass ascension of the chosen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like anything, the foundation they have coopted is based on truth and could be applied to good ends, through good means...but they are so deluded and so badly manipulated by forces outside humanity that they believe the path they are creating and marching us down is the best and only way to do so. Think of how CERN uses massive amounts of energy to reveal and then affect the fundamental particles of the universe, well, that same type of activity is applied to all of their workings. Again, this is why they are so dangerous and why redemption may not be an option for them, they believe they are doing what is right.

             While I believe at some point in the quest of the spirit there is a reunion with Source, I think the Other is making a small scale diorama of what we feel is true in our bones - reunion with Source.  They want to urge a reunion with their god and centralization under one leader.  To me, the true God, Source, wants everyone to exhibit their uniqueness, not their sameness, but to do so in harmony and love.  I can think of nothing sadder or less divine than to submit to somebody else's definition of divinity or of being ness.

              That definitely rings of truth, and this same formula is applied to everything on the agenda - they take a core of truth and then intersperse bullshit throughout its structure, my personal belief is that because the truth resonates with people on some level (spiritually or unconsciously, take your pick), the lies they include are easier to accept at face value...kind of like being served ice cream with ground up maggots in it, all you're going to see and taste is the ice cream unless you really analyze it.
You can see this at work in religion, politics, media, government, academia - everything that can be influenced in society seems to be affected and it's been part of their toolbox for as long as we've had the rule of law and interconnected civilizations.

             Yes to all of it. I joined when I was 20 and I thought all of it was fantastic until I "saw" what you refer to as an evil spirit sort of using the man leading one of our rituals as a puppet. It was extremely disturbing and I started to see the truth so i very quietly distanced myself. This was over a decade ago.

            I tried researching them once because I thought it might have been a fun topic for a fictional novel.  All I really know is that they think they were founded by Christian Rosenkreuz (more than likely not a real person) and are also called the Order of the Rosy Cross.  I also have heard William Blake was probably a member and that The Sick Rose poem of his makes allusions to their rose symbolism.  Blake always creeped me out.  I thought Anton LeVay was boring but that William Blake was a flat out sociopath. He was basically a worse version of Satanists before they ever even went by the name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think the Rosicrucian order has a connection with MK Ultra?  I once heard about an elite who was obsessed with "The Seth Materials" and have started to think it is possible there was some MK Ultra connection.  The only site I can find in searches that talk about these sorts of connections are generally GodLikeProductions and I don't trust that site in the least to click on it.

             I believe Blake and Bacon were both member's. I think you're referring to The Temple of Set, founded by Michael Aquino. Aquino is a high ranking us military officer and is one of the people who spearheaded project monarch and helped implement SRA as a form of mind control. He was implicated in some of the 90s pedophile rings and the military base daycare abuse cases. As far as a connection between the Rosicrucians and the temple of set...i honestly don't know, maybe on some level? A LOT of Rosicrucians are doctors, lawyers, and psychiatrists who work with or close to federal bodies.

              Hmmmm, interesting.  I need to read up on the Temple of Set.  All I knew was that they seemed like dipshits for having the Baphomet star (I'm not even sure how that symbol is Satanic.  A star symbol is still a star no matter the angle you turn it) in a church related to an Egyptian deity.  I will read up on their project monarch involvement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder if the Temple of Set and "The Seth Materials" are linked?  Seth is used as a variant of Set but outside of that I haven't found anything to support a possible connection.

               It's definitely important info to research and is embedded in the entire pizzagate issue. 
The baphomet star is an inverted pentagram, the latter being a symbol that denotes perfect harmony in nature and in man - each corner of the pentagram is related to an element interconnected with the others. The inverted pentagram symbolizes an inversion of the natural order, it's also called the Sign of Menes/Mendes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Menes was the first Egyptian ruler to unite the southern and northern parts of Egypt, his symbol was the goat and his tribe/clan were supposed descendents of Set/Sethis, a being depicted with a sort of dogs head, pointed ears and a forked or pointed tail - much like the depiction of the western Satan. In fact, the words Sethis and Shaitaniel (Hebrew word we derived Satan from) shared linguistic roots with the Akkadian mushtilil, which referred to Venus as the morning star...as we know, Lucifer is the Roman word for the god of the morning star, or venus.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a LOT to research on this stuff and it gets really deep. Basically, the claims about the elite cult going all the way back to Babylon are supported, at least academically, by their linguistic and cultural anthropological connections.

             Exactly, but they all serve different roles and have a different mode of operation. 
The Masons are the "right hand," in the occult the right hand is the active, ordered principle, it inacts the directive of the Will(power) and creates those things conceived of by the Mind. The Masons embody the symbolism of the right hand  by being a place to network and make business contacts, further creating a network of power with their actions in the real world.
            </p>

             The Rosicrucian Order is the left hand. When I was active we would meet and perform ceremonies in the loft above a Masonic lodge, after the rituals and initiations and all of that was complete there would be an announcement about the organizations participation and activities with various ngos, non-profits, and charities.
There were always rituals to be performed that were on the direction of the Imperator and Illuminatus, which they stated would serve the purpose of furthering global spiritual energy per their agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw, Abramovich is most likely a well groomed distraction - none of her rituals would actually have a metaphysical effect as they are not coherent enough to generate the energy needed for an occult working, although they do contain legitimate symbolism and they seem to coop some well established metaphysical principles.

            "These people further hide their power and influence through membership of various secret societies such as freemasons, Jesuits, Opus Dei, knights of Malta, Knights Templar, illuminati, Rosicrucians, Yale college skull and bones, Bohemian grove, Priory of Sion and others. Some of these societies exert their power through politics, some through religion, notably the Catholic Church."
           </p>

            "The Rosicrucian Cross combines the seven Red Roses, Lotus Flowers or Chakra’s with the Cross we have seen in the Caduceus Staff or the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah. When the Roses Bloom on the cross, the Chakras has been opened. The twelve rays are the influence of the Zodiac as the roses symbolize the planets."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Council of 13, Committee of 300, Knights of Malta, Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society and other groups are behind this. It is all linked to Black Nobility, Kabbalah and OTO which is why Ashton Kutcher and the music industry play such a big role, particularly connected to the political elite including Schumer, Clintons, Bushes, Pelosi, McCain, Paul Ryan, Podestas, Emanuels, and others in both parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            The families in the Council of 13 are pushing the lie of Sustainability through Agenda 2030 and other initiatives, and Racine, Wisconsin is a main hub and weak link to the entire network tied to many billionaires involved including DuPont, Rockefeller and Rothschilds among others. Wisconsin is controlled by corrupt elite, freemasons and mafia groups.

            WOAH! Thanks OP for the knowledge bomb! I was an anti semite before this and I thought it was the Jews, but now I see the light. It's been the Rosicrucian's the whole fucking time! We need a final solution to the Rosicrucian problem! Someone needs to stope these Rosicrucians!

             Hmmm, I've been lurking here for a long time and something I've noticed is that if at least two of the resident shills start posting in reply to a topic that means it is included in their keyword watch list and it has merit.

            I have some AMORC literature.  It's not nearly as interesting as
            <em>
             Morals and Dogma,
            </em>
            but it is a requirement in every CTer's library collection.
           </p>
           <p>
            They hold some strange beliefs.  I can spot an AMORC physician; the "good" physicians know the AMORC info on hands and digits.

            Basically anything that Sir Francis Bacon was associated with you know is evil.

            The HQ are very interesting -- In addition to the Egyptian Museum, they have a planetarium.
