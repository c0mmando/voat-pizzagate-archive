<p>BILL COSBY, PROJECT ARTICHOKE, MENGELE &amp; THE DARK MESSIAH, PART I</p>

<p><em>&quot;William Henry “Bill” Cosby, Jr.’s (born July 12, 1937) secret Blood Covenant with the DEVIL began long before he entered HollyWeird. It began sometime after 1956 during the CIA-MK ULTRA mind control program when the young U.S. Naval Hospital Corpsman was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital. The Bethesda Naval Hospital is the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center located in the community of Bethesda, Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The original Medical Center was composed of the Naval Hospital, and Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI). The NMRI was founded in 1942 under Dr. Andrew C. Ivy. He was a Special Consultant to the Secretary of War regarding war crimes of a medical nature at the Nuremberg trials, 1946-1947.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;From the ninth grade, Anna Nichole Smith was raised by an aunt in Mexia whose primary industry from 1943 had been looking after 3000 to 4000 foot soldiers and officers of Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler’s elite blood covenant Schutzstaffel (SS). From 1943 to the early 1950s, Mexia to El Paso running down to Houston and San Antonio became a SS Nazi corridor in Texas. It stand reason to assume that Anna Nichole Smith’s family bloodline roots; and her sudden mysterious rise to international fame and fortune within a Satanic Circle of the Dark Messiah and the BLOODLINES OF WOTAN lies within the  <strong>SS Nazi Texas corridor</strong>.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>In 1992, Anna Nicole Smith, stripper of that absurd place in Texas called Mexia, started her so-called modeling career at Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Mansion. Out of all the beautiful women of HollyWeird and the World, Hugh Hefner sent Anna Nicole Smith a plane ticket out of town to join his stable of blood oath covenant guest playmates at the mansion. The Playboy Mansion is a state of the art <strong>CIA MK ULTRA Factory</strong>.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;William Henry Cosby, Jr. is a such a black collaborator to warn the masses to watch and stay away from. He is a clandestine/covert BLOOD OATH SECRET high level MASTER MASON, and a BLOOD OATH SECRET hierarchical member of Negro section of the ancient BOULE [2] that serves the underground THIRD REICH, and Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler’s SS Cult of the Dark Messiah, the SHADOW power behind the throne. Cosby is a Master of Deception, ILLUSIONS and DUALITY.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Davis and Marilyn Monroe had top secret clearance to the nuclear film production studio and mk-ultra training film production center called Lookout Mountain Laboratory at the top of Laurel Canyon.</strong></p>
<p><em>In the public eyes, Davis was a little harmless carefree driving force of individual artistic freedom while on the hidden side- he was a high level ILLUMINATI Negro whore also connected hand in hand to the Black Hand- the MAFIA. Davis was also a covert master of deceptions, duality and ILLUSIONS.  It remains forbidden knowledge which Masonic lodge Davis or Cosby belonged to, and when they were first initiated into freemasonry. However, we are certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Davis was a Freemason.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He was an ultra secret and well established Luciferian 33 degree York Rite Master Mason. At sometime for extraordinary services to the craft, he was promoted to the highest degree of the clandestine York Rite Freemasonry, KNIGHTS OF MALTA. As a clandestine crusading European KNIGHT, he moved among an ultra secret elite global cabal of Olympians, Nazis, and the IMPERIUM.[11] The founding fathers and architects of Project PAPERCLIP and the CIA, William “Wild Bill” Donovan, Allen Dulles and Himmler’s SS Puppet GENERAL REINHARD GEHLEN, were among Davis’ covert order of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The CIA/MK ULTRA program is an enormous American shadow government institution dedicated to mind control, mass population control, and force the masses to be completely submissive and subservient to a global satanic semi-divine master controller race.  Since 1953, the MK ULTRA program has evolved into a far reaching vast multi-billion dollar conglomerate of high ranking government officials, military intelligence agencies, corporations, freemasons, lawyers, doctors, clinics, prisons and some of this country’s most esteemed universities and hospitals locked in multiple layers of iron clad blood oath secrecy and security. It has the footprints of the management style of Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler’s SS Satanic Empire.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>THE SEXUAL DECADENCE OF WEIMAR GERMANY</strong> (* NOT all Jews, &quot;those that call themselves Jews but are not&quot; -<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1738976">The Phareesaic Babylonian Cult of Baal</a>)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.darkmoon.me/2013/the-sexual-decadence-of-weimar-germany/">https://www.darkmoon.me/2013/the-sexual-decadence-of-weimar-germany/</a></p>
<p><em>&quot;No account of the Jewish Question in Germany can be complete without some mention of the tidal wave of sexual immorality that was to engulf the country during the period of the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) following World War One. This also happened to be the apogee of Jewish power in Germany. Every single sphere of major influence had now fallen under <strong>Chabad Lubavitcher</strong> control.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Dr Karl Wiehe</strong>, in his Germany and the <strong>Chabad Lubavitcher</strong> Question, is painstaking in the details he provides:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Well before 1933 the <strong>(Chabad Lubavitch)</strong> Jews had <strong>taken possession of the film industry</strong> even more thoroughly than of the theater. That was understandable, because the earnings in the film industry overshadow the earnings of any other artistic activity….&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The biggest step in the direction of the decline of the German cultural life [however] was taken in the field of the light entertainment genre. Here—in the genre of musical comedy and above all in revue and burlesque—frivolity and lasciviousness were to rear their ugly heads. So much so that during these years <strong>Berlin was quite correctly considered the most immoral city in the world</strong>.&quot;</em></p>

             WEIMAR GERMANY AS A DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THE SUBSEQUENT SEXUAL REVOLUTION OF THE 1960s
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.darkmoon.me/2013/the-sexual-decadence-of-weimar-germany/">
             https://www.darkmoon.me/2013/the-sexual-decadence-of-weimar-germany/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            My own impression, though I could well be mistaken here, is that Weimar Germany can be seen as a trial run or dress rehearsal for the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s, a revolution in attitudes and behavior that was to convulse America and then spread like a moral virus to Europe and the rest of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recollect that it was in Germany during the Weimar period—in 1923 to be exact—that the Institut für Sozialforschung was set up at the University of Frankfurt. Financed by the Argentian Jew Felix Weil, this was later to become the infamous Frankfurt School. [23]
           </p>
           <p>
            It is my own hypothesis that the Germans were to be the initial guinea pigs of these Cultural Marxists [24], all of them initially Jewish apart from Habermas. These were revolutionaries intent on complete social control by the imposition of their Marxist worldview on the rest of society.
            <strong>
             It is self-evident that there is no other way to get control of a society with strong moral values than to weaken those values
            </strong>
            . The formula is simple: destroy the belief system on which that society is founded, especially its religion and its traditional codes of honor and decency. Promote godlessness and a philosophy of despair. To put it in even plainer language: reduce men to beasts if you wish to control them.

            It was George Lukács [25], one of the founding fathers of the Frankfurt School, who had called for “a culture of pessimism and a world abandoned by God.” [26] And it was one of their most fanatical ideologues, Willi Munzenberg [27], who had said he wanted to turn the world upside down and make life a hell on earth. His exact words:
           </p>
           <p>
            We must organize the intellectuals and use them TO MAKE WESTERN CIVILIZATION STINK! Only then, after they have CORRUPTED ALL ITS VALUES AND MADE LIFE IMPOSSIBLE, can we impose the dictatorship of the proletariat. [28, emphasis added]
           </p>
           <p>
            With Jewish intellectuals like this at the helm, doing their utmost to promote moral anarchy and create an Orwellian dystopia, is it any wonder that the Germans went helter-skelter down the slippery slope and ended up where they did?
           </p>
           <p>
            In America the Cultural Marxists were to apply a variation of their Weimar techniques, but refined and honed to a high degree. This time, they would use multiculturalism as a weapon of mass destruction in addition to moral corruption. They would flood the country with immigrants, legal as well as illegal. They would turn race against race (engineered ethnic conflict), parent against child (attack on authority), and man against woman (radical feminism). Above all, they would teach the non-White races to regard the White race as the ultimate evil: “the cancer of human history”, to quote Jewish feminist Susan Sontag. [29]

            The above comments are admittedly controversial and will elicit anger in many quarters. For this I apologize. My purpose is simply to give voice to an urgent and widespread perception. Not to be able to say what many people increasingly believe is clearly undesirable.
           </p>
           <p>
            What did the cultural Marxists learn from Weimar Germany?
           </p>
           <p>
            They learned that the Sexual Revolution, in order to succeed, had to be a slow and gradual process. “Modern forms of subjection,” the Frankfurt School had learned, “are marked by mildness.” [30] Weimar had failed because the pace had been too frenetic. People were aware they were being corrupted. That was fatal.
           </p>
           <p>
            To corrupt a nation effectively one must make sure that the descent into degradation is an infinitely slow and imperceptible process, one miniscule step at a time—just as those who wish to cook frogs alive in a saucepan, reducing them to a state of comatose stupor, are advised to place them in cold water and boil them to death as slowly as possible. [31]
           </p>
           <p>
            Lest I be accused of antisemitism by this portrayal of the systematic sexual corruption of the German people at the hands of their Jewish masters—a classic instance of social engineering practiced on an entire population—let me allow a well-known and respected Jewish authority on the Weimar era to have the final word. He is Dr Manfred Reifer, and he is writing in a prestigious Jewish publication:
           </p>
           <p>
            Whilst large sections of the German nation were struggling for the preservation of their race, we Jews filled the streets of Germany with our vociferations. We supplied the press with articles on the subject of its Christmas and Easter and administered to its religious beliefs in the manner we considered suitable. We ridiculed the highest ideals of the German nation and profaned the matters which it holds sacred.”  —  Dr Manfred Reifer, in the German Jewish magazine Czernowitzer Allegemeine Zeitung, September 1933
           </p>
           <p>
            In the same month those words were written, September 1933, Adolf Hitler removed every single Jew from positions of influence in the mass media: from the fields of literature, art, music, journalism, the cinema, and popular entertainment in general [32]. The influence that the Jews had exerted on the German psyche was to be regarded henceforth, rightly or wrongly, as pernicious. And Kulturbolschewismus, or “Bolshevik culture”, a derogatory term for Jewish culture itself, became synonymous with moral anarchy and sexual decadence.

            I've just woke up, I'm going to get my breakfast ready and then I'm going to do some deep digging on Hollywood, because we all know Hollywood is crawling pedo's and desperate parents, gullible teenagers willing to do anything for fame and fortune. This is a great post

               I was reading his Wikipedia last night. His humanitarian contributions include Haitian Relief Org, Haiti: The Journey is the Destination, also some obscure "Art of Elysium"- it's some deal for children with mental conditions in Hollywood. They had a (sold out) $5k/plate event to celebrate 20 years of whatever it is they do.

             Has anyone looked at the art on the walls in those 40 pictures in that link? Some look suspect. I know nothing about art but maybe someone can identify the artist(s) and find a connection that way. Just thinking out loud... if Jered Leto even is the owner of the pieces

                This is all I'm finding on this Dorsey guy, founder of twitter and square, but definitely seems to be part of that silicon valley/burner crowd. Oh, now also an exec at Disney.

               <p>
                Jack Dorsey dropping nearly ten million clams on an mid-century modern-minded residence alarmingly cantilevered over a nearly sheer and rocky bluff in San Francisco’s quietly swanky (and often socked in with fog) Seacliff neighborhood. As of 2012.

Every trail and every traveler on that trail lead circuitously back to the Clinton campaign, and Clinton Global Initiative. Plus Hollyweird connections. Alefantis fingerprints are on the Obamas, and even on Kenneth Starr (investigated death of Vince Foster, ruled suicide).

            A direct connection to Pizzagate you say, even in and throughout all of this crazy Nazi talk?
           </p>
           <p>
            Huge donors to the Clinton Foundation:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Billionaires James &amp; Tom Steyer
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            There isn’t anything strange or unusual about using walnut sauce on pasta, especially, for a fine, rich (billionaire) and cultured man like Steyer. James‘ brother is billionaire Tom Steyer. I suspect that both are interested in religion and theology. And, the Steyer brothers’ blood money in combination with George Soros and other Zionists are behind covert funding of Black Lives Matter. The Steyers’ father was
            <strong>
             Roy Henry Steyer, a law partner of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Sullivan &amp; Cromwell should always raise a lot of red flags. It was the CIA MK ULTRA Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles‘ powerful and clandestine law firm. The elder Steyer (Lt. Roy H. Steyer, USNR) was an OSS Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor. The Dulles brothers used their law firm partners to collaborate with and cherry pick SS-Knights of Black Sun and Nazis for Operation PAPERCLIP.

            If you'll notice, Hitler's regime was essentially a hired mercenary force meant to clean up the mess that the brainwashers created, a society filled with so many degenerates and criminals from all of the drugs, sex, pornography and decay the MASTERS of the chessboard created in the first place.

            Quentin Tarrantino was telling you part of the mystery in his film
            <em>
             Inglorious Basterds
            </em>
            when the Hitlers Master of Propaganda Ernst Goebbells was planning on releasing his BRAINWASHING FILM
            <em>
             Stolz der Nation
            </em>
            (Pride of the Nation).
           </p>
           <p>
            The film is a remarkabley similar tool used not too long ago here in America:

            ALL of Hollywood is meant to brainwash you, ALL of it, ALL of  "THEM".
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about the cartoons you were subjected to as a child, all the violence, road runner and all his acme kill tools, wonderdog had to take a pill to be a superhero, popeye had a pipe, and you didn't EVER want to make the hulk mad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combine that with the
