            Is still think GWAR knows something, they previously lived in DC for too long not to know something, and my gawd look at the lyrical content. Granted Oderus Urungus/Dave Brockie is dead now, and he probably would've known the most.

            Not saying they were involved, and just because you sing about raping dead babies doesn't mean you're really into that sort of thing, just saying we need to talk to GWAR.
