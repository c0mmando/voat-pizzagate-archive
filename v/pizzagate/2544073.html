<p>This is interesting: <em>Despite the snow, today marks the first day of spring, and with the new season, charities across New York City are preparing to take advantage of the nicer weather with their annual spring galas and events.

            Pizzagaters, it's not too late to obtain your invitation to the First Annual Clinton Foundation Gala on May 24th. A donation of $2500 gets you in whereas a $100,000 donation will enable you to be seated at  a special table of 10 and includes an invitation to the  Annual Foundation Briefing to be held sometime later. (This probably resembles a shareholders meeting)
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the entertainers will be the Jamaican musician Shaggy. More details will be forthcoming.
           </p>
           <p>
            The date is auspicious for being the Feast Day of  Hermes Trismegistus, a Kabbalistic Renaiessance
tradition to honor Hermes, a male god of writing and magic or alternatively the patron of alchemy and boundaries as well as being the guardian of graves and the patron of  thieves. Hermes' duties do indeed  reflect Hillary's interests and may explain the Hermes scarf she has been wearing on her recent  Austrailian tour.
           </p>
           <p>
            I for one cannot wait to attend as I am sure Marina Abramovic  will be there  along with Madonna and Lady Gaga. I do hope those ladies will restrain their own powers in deference to Hermes, I mean Hillary.
           </p>
           <p>
            I apologize for not providing links as  I  have still not figured out how to do this on my cell phone. This is not satire, the info is genuine. These galas need to be exposed.

             Are you sure that's for real? I saw that and heard it was a 4 or 8Chan parody.

              the Clinton Foundation upcoming gala is indeed for real, all over MSM.  The occult references were obtained through googling. If only we were rich, we could pay for admission and all show up as the victims of  the Clintons. The Clintons desparately want to go down in history as  great politicians , great philanthropists and finally as part of society' s upper crust.  Hillary is on another world wide tour to promote herself. I smell a Nobel Prize nomination in the works. What a hoot if she is nominated but loses to Trump as a result of the historic  unification of Korea!!

               Oh, OK then. Thanks for letting me know. Here I thought it was a joke, not that it still isn't. LOL! I hope lots of protestors show up even if they can't get in. Maybe a rich white hat will get in... I hope.

                If you thought it was a joke, others did, too im afraid. If i were more tech savvy i would have made a separate post out of it. Feel  free to so.  Google Hillary gala and then do Hillary Hermes,  then  google may 24 Hermes god.  Thanks for bring up topic.

            Yes. Love this line of thinking. Of course it is occult connected and is another way In which they flaunt their wealth and hob nob with each other. There are probably a TON of activities that occur on the regular that no outsider would understand from illicit partying to backdoor deals and prostitution to money laundering and ritual abuse. At the very least CDAN has revealed that a large number of rapes and drug use is rampant at these "festivities".

            Many of the world richest gather on the French Riviera with their multimillion dollar yachts for the Cannes Film Festival which is held often times in conjunction with the AmFar Gala, notorious for Harvey Weinstein's exploits.

            The Order of Malta was present at this year’s Met Gala.  Designers included YSL and Rick Owens... the theme was Heavenly Bodies and a bunch of A Listers were dressed in upsidedown crosses and Popul-esque garb while promoting sex drugs and rock and roll under the vassad of some kind of sanctity with the church.  You don’t need to research this, it’s as blatant as it could possibly be.

             Think DeBlahBlah will be there?  Maybe he will bring his pet Schwartz (or is he in lockup still?) or The Mook (like a gimp but a little better socialized).

              haha Mook, that seems to be 90% of "The Elite" at this point - I will say it's probably hard to turn down the illuminati when their offering up Katy Perry as a literal sex angel

            Galas, parties, and those ridiculous yearly awards. All VERY expensive to produce. Celebs, elites and their self-aggrandizing, public circle jerks must mean BIG bucks for some powerful somebodies. Sure, these events and shows have sponsors - some certainly paid well for their sponsorships, rather than the other way around. We DON’T KNOW where the real money that pays all the bills for airing this tripe comes from, or where the fundraiser money comes from, or where/who the funds raised ultimately go to. Nothing about celebs and elites celebrating themselves is essentially related to entertainment value, talent, accomplishment, ratings, or anything of substance. We DO KNOW, all of this shit is an easy cover for propagandizing and money laundering.

            this is an excellant topic to ruminate about. The galas tout a worthy cause but in the end only a small portion of the money raised goes to the designated charity because the cost of putting on the gala is so large. the elites use public facilities that belong to all of us for the purpose of self-aggrandizement as well as a subtle form of recruitment to their ranks amongst well heeled and well connected  status seekers. The annual Met Gala has been  one of high society's major events but this year it was rather strange with its  theme  of Catholism which resulted in female attire that was pretty close to costumes as one can get without the masks which I expect  we will see in the next Met Gala. By the way the Clinton Foundation is putting on its own gala soon .

            This gala makes me suspicious: The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's (CCAI) Angels in Adoption® Gala is one of Washington, DC's most inspiring events that seeks to bring awareness to the millions of children around the globe living without a loving family to call their own. This is an evening you do not want to miss!

              Heh, Heh, yeah.  Just like the laundering of the art work at Museums and Art Galleries.  Really, I would think how can people not see this, but I didn't either until it was put right in front of me.  Who really thinks people are this evil, using children for profit?  We have so much more money are our disposal now since we stopped donating to charities.  Really, that would put a huge hole in their $$$ amount.  Stop giving.  Help locally.

               True, but at the same time they're funding these gala cults with their own money because it costs hundreds to thousands of dollars to even attend. Just like how Scientology uses its members to give often and generously, these galas are the same. How do we figure out exactly where the money is going? Can we report them to the IRS? I just can't figure out how to crack these nuts except to start going through their honoree list(s) and go from there.

                Reporting to the IRS may be futile, because I have heard people say on here that the IRS is a mere shell now.  But who knows, we do not know what the truth is anymore.  I think we have done a pretty good job figuring out how to research.  Good old fashion shoe leather and pounding the pavement type research will probably be more successful than waiting for results from a govt 3 letter agency.

                 It was just an idea because there needs to be some sort of agency to look into this. It's sort of how we have to report any CP or child abuse allegations to the CPS when we already know they're corrupt.

                  I don't know that we even have one that we can trust.  AND, none of them are equipped to handle it really, evidently.  You would think the FBI would have a dept. that handles such reports, but why would we expect them to do that when they have posted pedo symbols.  Hmm.  Does the ICMEC even have such a dept.?  Not that I would trust them.  There should be an org. just for Helping People Report Injustices Regarding Children.  A place to call.  A Clearing Center of Sorts.

                    It would certainly be worth a try.  I have heard things about them too, but I have also seen some really good things from them as well.  As with most agencies nowadays there are some that are bad but most are still good.  We must hold out hope for we know that most of our people in this country are good.  We just seem to forget being that we deal with so much filthy day after day.  I believe it might have been Interpol that was responsible for Operation Cathedral.

                I wonder if they say it is for charity so they aren't audited but the IRS and claim to be a nonprofit group. Lot's of abuse in that area. I seriously doubt the money is given to charities too.

                 Yes, I doubt it as well, unless they are providing money under the table to adoption and foster agencies, so the cult people they want to adopt and foster are chosen over the people who truly will be good to the children.
