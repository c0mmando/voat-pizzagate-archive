<p>I was reading a thread posted by MolochHunter, and within the comments I came upon an instagram page that was posted by <a href="https://voat.co/user/realityisinsanity">@realityisinsanity</a> . After looking at the page, I was overwhelmingly compelled to compile the photos that were most damning, in my opinion.</p>
<p>This very much relates to pizzagate. Here’s a picture to prove it… <a href="https://kek.gg/i/6zBT9n.png">https://kek.gg/i/6zBT9n.png</a></p>
<p>This woman/girl’s name is Bianka and she calls herself EUROPEAN CANNIBAL on Instagram. And I have no doubt that she’s describing herself truthfully.</p>
<p><a href="https://kek.gg/i/3jsLxj.png">https://kek.gg/i/3jsLxj.png</a></p>
<p>She has a shit ton of pics of herself in a beat up and bruised state.</p>

<p>Here are pics of her pupils acting crazy. Does anyone know what would cause only one pupil to dilate?</p>

<p>There are so many pictures of alcohol, drugs, and S&amp;M sex… but I didn’t feel like going through all of those. I already looked at her stuff more than I wanted to. But here’s a little preview of the strangeness… “when someone loves me”</p>
<p><a href="https://kek.gg/i/5gFfzb.jpg">https://kek.gg/i/5gFfzb.jpg</a></p>

<p>And last, but not really... because there are so many other photos that I haven’t covered…
In this pic, she outright calls the guy a Pedo… and the symbol on his tie is very similar to the triangular pedo swirl that the FBI released. I know it’s not exact… but I found it interesting that it’s showing in a pic where she calls him a pedo. What do you think?</p>

           <p>
            Hello everyone! i'm new here and i never commented or posted anything before so i don't really know how it Works, but i wanted to add some information about this girls boy-friend. I was browsing through her IG and found out her boy-friend (the one she refers to as "my pedo") is a relatively unknown Italian designer called Giovanni Forbice:
            <a href="https://instagram.com/gioforbice">
             http://instagram.com/gioforbice
            </a>
            I'm Italian and i never heard of him before but it seems That this guy has some famous friends. He designed a line of Daft Punk t-shirts That depict some pretty dark themes. Here is the website:
            <a href="http://www.gioforbice.com/">
             http://www.gioforbice.com/
            </a>
            Look at those shirts.
           </p>
           <p>
            He Also designed Puma shoes for Rihanna. The line was called Forfex. Now he has launched a new creepy clothing line called Darkdron. I'm gonna add some articles so you can see for yourself:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://annazgray.com/Writing/Secrets-of-Success-Forfex">
             http://annazgray.com/Writing/Secrets-of-Success-Forfex
            </a>
            (Here he says his parents work in the fashion industry)
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/07/07/cult-brand-darkdron/">
             https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/07/07/cult-brand-darkdron/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So this couple gives me a bad vibe...They clearly have some famous connections (we should look into Daft Punk too), they display a creepy, cult-like life style on their social media and the clothes this guy makes are full of inverted crosses and hooded figures. If there are some other Italian researchers on here i hope They can help me dig more.

            Sadly, this is what many of the kids we are all fighting for end up becoming. This girl was obviously brought up SRA and sexually abused. I feel really sad for her. And yes, she is friends with Walter Pearce and Ray Chandler because she works for them through their modelling agency. Shes featured in some fucked up modeling shoots. Walter Pearce is another one of these kids. They all are. I wish we could start an agency to help these people after going through all that trauma.

             Thank you for this intelligent... big-picture comment. I feel sad for them, too. Like they didn't have much of a chance, straight out the womb. It's a generational cycle of abuse and trauma. Sucks so much. I only see one way to stop the cycle... and that way doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth. But we want to protect our own... so what shall we do? Sigh...

            I want Trump and the gang to show the normies 100% of the truth. It's the only way to pry their minds away from their TV-hypnotized safe spaces. I want normies to realize that voting for gibs will always lead to bad people having power over them. I want americans to learn to be afraid of the big government nanny state.

            Satanists love those eyebrows. Peter H. Gilmore, president of the “non-theistic” branch os the church of Satan is an eyebrow wannabe compared to Aquino, tho. I think grandpa pic in this post is almost definitely Aquino.

            My Hungarian isn't the best, but when being asked about her IG feed, she says "Nothing special. My instagram is just like someone else's family photo. The pictures are about normal everyday life." Okkkkkkay, then.

            The secound to last image link, upper right corner photo, that creepy looking old guy with the spiked up eye brows, I've only ever seen those eye brows once.

            . The photo in the article is from the 90's I'm assuming, but same elongated earlobes, and creepy brows.   I could be wrong, but this shit is just too important to ignore.

             Although, I did find a video of him, which appears to be from 2015, and he still had hair and the sideburns.

             Edit: Looking at it again.. the guy with the cannibal has a much flatter forehead.

            Her eyes look Exactly like David Bowies eyes (the pics with one big black one and one normal looking little one) Bowies eye with the big black pupil, got permanently damaged when some nut at one of his early concerts threw something at the stage (I forget what it was) it got stuck in that eye. From then on his two eyes looked exactly the same as the lovely Ms. Cannibal.

             actually no, david bowie had two different color eyes, not two different sized pupils. the pupils like that would be from traumatic brain injury. david bowie got bleach in his eye when he was young and that changed the color of that one eye - it didn't happen at a concert.

              Oh ok, I read a different story and couldn't remember all the details but I've looked at many pics of him because I always wondered how his eyes got like that, his blue eye has a normal size pupil. The brown eye has a giant black pupil. I just now checked out a couple pics.

            The two different pupil sizes are probably from a head injury. You see this in severe falls, head injuries, and fighting matches

             yes! i was going to post this. this is definitely from head injury as drug induced pupil dialation (sp?) would be both pupils i believe. when i was hit by a bicyclist and thrown across 4 lanes of traffic the first thing the fire dept did was check my pupils for that.

             100% NO, this is definitely not Aquino. This is just another one of MANY elder satanic creeps in the world who love what they do and put their eyebrows up that way as a fuck you to everyone who doesn’t accept them in society. Eyes, nose, earlobes, jawline (square vs oval), weight, everything is way off.

               Find me a picture of Aquino the way he laughs like this heavy guy, who seems like sitting behind a keyboard. I bet he is a musician, the way he smiles in this picture is nothing like the many videos I have seen with Aquino. But I could be wrong of course, who knows?!?!?!
