  'formattedContent' => '<p>This UK \'human rights\' barrister, <strong>Barbara Hewson</strong> came to my attention when she recently insulted Sara Payne (who is the mother of 8 year old Sarah who was killed by a pedophile in 2000). Side note - Sarah Payne campaigns for better protection from pedophiles, namely \'Sara\'s law\' similar to \'Megan\'s Law\' in the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/dec/13/childprotection.qanda">explained here</a></p>
<p>Link to where Barbara attacks her -
<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6387704/barrister-attack-sarah-payne-mum/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6387704/barrister-attack-sarah-payne-mum/</a></p>
<p>I did some digging on who this lawyer was...
Barbara thinks the age of consent should be lowered to 13 as described here in a BBC article <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22459815">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22459815</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She argues for an end to complainant anonymity, a strict statute of limitations to prevent prosecutions after a substantial amount of time has passed and a reduction in the age of consent to 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She also thinks sexaul assualt of a 9 year old is a \'low level misdemeanour\' as decribed in the same BBC article -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her remarks come after a number of high-profile arrests over allegations of historical sexual offences in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.</p>
<p>Among those to have been convicted is former BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall, who admitted 14 charges of indecently assaulting girls, including one aged nine, between 1967 and 1985.</p>
<p>Ms Hewson described Hall\'s crimes as &quot;low-level misdemeanours&quot; which &quot;ordinarily... would not be prosecuted&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has also said in this article <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2483390/Barbara-Hewson-Rape-victims-morally-responsible-ordeal-says-woman-barrister.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2483390/Barbara-Hewson-Rape-victims-morally-responsible-ordeal-says-woman-barrister.html</a> that rape victims can be partly responsible for their ordeal.</p>
<p>She has called for an end the UK sexual abuse inquiry in this article she wrote for The Daily Mail <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3814949/This-fiasco-sex-abuse-inquiry-totally-control-end-says-public-law-barrister-BARBARA-HEWSON.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3814949/This-fiasco-sex-abuse-inquiry-totally-control-end-says-public-law-barrister-BARBARA-HEWSON.html</a></p>
<p>stating that people should not be encouraged to \'remember\' any past wrongs. The following quote is her words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inquiry claims to be working with ‘grassroots organisations that represent victims and survivors’. </p>
<p>While no doubt most of these are well-intentioned and capable, some will undoubtedly have axes to grind.</p>
<p>So is it helpful or kind to encourage people in mature middle age to recall unpleasant or brutal experiences from their childhood?</p>
<p>The counsellors and campaigners who insist childhood abuse causes a host of problems in later life are using a contentious model of psychological trauma.</p>
<p>I believe that forcing people to revisit memories of past wrongs can be counter-productive; for some vulnerable souls, it is damaging.</p>
<p>Does all this remembering do anyone any good? </p>
<p>I believe collective remembrance can be toxic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She also thinks it\'s \'bizarre\' that each head of the enquiry steps down and then has nothing to do with it (no doubt once they discover how deep the rabbit hole goes and how they don\'t want to touch it).</p>
<p>In the same article she does admit that in terms of evidence, the UK sex abuse enquiry has - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>100,000 items in the archive, which mostly comprises individual children’s files, and some 26,000 boxes of material held in locations around the country</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>yet she calls for it to be halted before this evidence can be examined?</li>
</ul>
<p>In another article she penned, for the online magazine Spiked, she pushes the idea of witch hunting and that the abuse enquiries are a bigger threat to soceity than the pedophiles themselves - <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13604#.WxZMrXlG2Uk">http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13604#.WxZMrXlG2Uk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not support the persecution of old men. The manipulation of the rule of law by the Savile Inquisition – otherwise known as Operation Yewtree – and its attendant zealots poses a far graver threat to society than anything Jimmy Savile ever did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said enquiries are harming people (no doubt her elite friends) such as the deputy speaker of the House of Commons</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now even a deputy speaker of the House of Commons is accused of male rape. This is an unfortunate consequence of the present mania for policing all aspects of personal life under the mantra of ‘child protection’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinks believing the victim is a recipe for injustice in another article she wrote for Spiked - <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/believe_the_victim_a_receipt_for_injustice/14272#.VXWHvGBN30c">http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/believe_the_victim_a_receipt_for_injustice/14272#.VXWHvGBN30c</a></p>
<p>Talks about a \'victim industry\' and calls out Roseanne Barr on adding to this due to quote made by Roseanne in 2013 -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contemporary victim industry, according to Best, mass-produces victims.
Even those who deny prior experience of victimisation are seen as candidates for conversion. Best quotes the comedienne Roseanne Barr from the early Nineties: ‘When someone asks you, “Were you sexually abused as a child?”, there’s only two answers. One of them is, “Yes”, and one of them is “I don’t know”. You can’t say no.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who is this woman and why is she a still practising lawyer? Albeit now a private one. Could she be defending elites who think like her?</p>
<p>I did a little digging on Spike who appear to like people who call out sex abuse/trafficking as \'moral panic\' namely a Natalie <strong>Rothschild</strong> who wrote the following article in 2009 stating - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sex-trafficking scare is exposed as a tissue of lies</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/7625">http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/7625</a></p>
<p>and who wrote another Spiked article trying to debunk sex trafficking as a cause for concern -</p>
<p><a href="www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/5973">www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/5973</a></p>
<p>and wrote this Guardian comment article where she conflates the issue of sex trafficking with the small minority of women who want to be sex workers, again discrediting the term \'sex trafficking\' as something of no concern - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/13/prostitution-humantrafficking">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/13/prostitution-humantrafficking</a></p>
<p>Although some of these articles are old, Natalie Rothschild and Barbara Hewson have active twitter accounts and Natalie Rothschild at least appears to promote the idea that women are good for sex slaves and this is ok. don\'t know if she is related to THAT family. </p>
<p>Barbara\'s cousin Jonathon Denby is a close friend of pedophile Harvey Proctor, this info I found in tweets from this guy who has covered quite a bit on Barb - <a href="https://twitter.com/ciabaudo">Twitter</a></p>
<p>Barbara Hewson\'s <a href="https://twitter.com/BarbaraHewson">twitter</a></p>
<p>Rothschild\'s <a href="https://twitter.com/n_rothschild">twitter</a></p>
<p>Hope you all find this interesting! I am new here so hope I posted everything ok :-)</p>',

             Thank you for the link to that blog, not one I've came across before. The UK historical elite pedophile industry was huge you can dig forever. They were so blatant. Unfortunately the enquiries dont grab headline news that often due to the media downplaying it all. It makes we wonder how big the industry is now but they seem to have learned past lessons and keep it well hidden. People like Barbara could be a good way of finding current links.
