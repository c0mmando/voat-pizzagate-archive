<blockquote>
<p>George Ormond, 62, coached a grassroots football club in the 1970s and 1980s before going on to work for United\'s youth system in the 1990s.</p>
<p><strong>Newcastle Crown Court heard he used his &quot;position of power&quot; to abuse 18 boys and young men between 1973 and 1998.</strong></p>
<p>He was convicted of 35 charges of indecent assault and one of indecency.</p>
<p>Ormond, who the court was told has been living at temporary addresses in Gateshead, was cleared of two further charges following a six-week trial.</p>
<p><strong>The jury was told Ormond &quot;manipulated his position&quot; and held out a &quot;glittering future&quot; to young players, but could block their progress if they stood up to him.</strong></p>
<p>He would indecently touch boys while massaging them or treating them for injuries and insist they not wear anything under their shorts, then check they had followed the rule.</p>
<p>Judge Edward Bindloss described Ormond as &quot;wholly preoccupied with sex&quot; and said he &quot;used his position as a respected football coach to target boys and young men in his care&quot;.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;Some victims you do not even remember - what was for you momentary sexual gratification was for your victims a lifetime of difficulty.&quot;</p>
<p>Victims\' statements described their shame and embarrassment, and in some cases deep regret that they had not spoken out earlier.</p>
<p>One said his ambition had been to become a footballer but &quot;that dream turned into a living nightmare&quot;.</p>
<p>Judge Bindloss said: &quot;No-one observing this trial could have failed to have been moved by the complainants and other witnesses over the six weeks of evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;[They were] largely men in their 50s, largely from working class and sporting backgrounds, speaking with calm and quiet dignity about how they failed to understand what was happening to them.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;And because of the times they lived in, and due to their circumstances, they were unable to speak about it.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>George Ormond had already been convicted of sexual abuse before:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In 2002 Ormond was jailed for six years after being found guilty of abusing seven boys under 16 between 1975 and 1999.</strong></p>
