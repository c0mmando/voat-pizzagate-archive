<p>That word even being in the same sentence as a child is disturbing. Much less describing her private parts in such a way.

<p>Huma is an idiot. Some of you may know from a couple of months ago, that her and Weiner were going to try to work it out. Well, now the sick ass <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/05/30/huma-abedin-has-invited-anthony-weiner-back-home/">moved back home.</a>. Awww isn\'t that nice? I bet it\'s a lot more comfy there than prison. But, the poor thing has to register as a sex offender. 🙄 I wonder how he describes his 3 or 4 year olds privates. I hope he doesn\'t bathe him. One of the pictures that he sexted is of him <a href="http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8730272.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/TEASER-ONLY-Anthony-Weiner-main.jpg">showing his bulge</a> with his little boy next to him!</p>
<p>Is Huma really that dumb? I thought it\'s possible they are playing that role so that, if she ends up getting charged with anything related to helping Hillary with all of her illegal activities, including helping to delete the emails and lie about it, then Weiner wouldn\'t have to testify against her because they are married. If THAT is the reason then she\'s being smart. If it\'s for love, then she\'s a moron. I should add that they probably don\'t have the capability of love if they are into Satanic cult stuff. So who knows why.</p>',

            OP, along with Satanic Ritual Abuse of children you should look up mind control methodology and programs. There's a lot to read, but no shame in just digging in. Everyone gets to these points at different times.  So,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/srayzie">
             @srayzie
            </a>
            , if you're serious about digging in on this, go for it, and don't let negative responses to this post keep you from fighting for the truth to come to light. We need more people in the fight! Peace!

             Thank you. It's refreshing to find someone nice 🙂 I have been learning about mind control and MKUktra stuff. I need to keep reminding myself that these people don't think normal. It's hard to get out of that mindset sometimes.

              Agreed, the mindset is hard to understand. It's an entirely different way of both living and if seeing the world. I watched this video the other day by Aug Tellez. I haven't seen the intro to his story, but as far as I can understand it seems he has gone through ritual abuse, programming, and some other kind of "far out" stuff. He said that if we don't understand ritual abuse and mind control programming, we'll never understand the bigger picture, The Who and the Why. He also said that it's not enough to care, and that when we care AND do something about it we build a community force that is harder for this type of evil to penetrate. I do believe this is good vs evil, and appreciate your desire to do good! Don't let negativity get you down, keep on going and you'll begin to uncover info that becomes leads. It's just a matter of time! Peace and love,

            Until more evidence is released, I don't think it is a big deal. Yes, he said that she has a little girls p, but he did not say if he approves of that, disapproves of that, or is saying it just as a matter of fact.

            There is no proof here that it turned him on.

            Huma the  Lesbian goat is a Muslim with mutilated vajayjay! Weiner the kid Diddler is a Jew! Then the two freaks was married by Slick Crooked Willie Clinton! So NO this has nothing to do with love! 
YES Huma is a freaking HillPedo's lesbian gopher lover! A Clinton puppet! 
All for show, so as to not have to testify against each other, same as HillPedo and Slick.

            I see a lot of talk about Jews and muslims.. Weiner and Huma are satanists.
           </p>
           <p>
            When are we going to get it, that the Powers don´t believe in any of that.. they are L U C I F E R I A N S.
They use all religions to pin them against each other.  We must stop blaming this to any other group then the satanists.

            Unfounded? All the evidence of their repeated imagery paints this picture. It was only for us to recognize the repetitious pattern. But not you. Coincidence. Over and over and over. So lets here your take, since the thought if making such an accusation is outrageous to you.

            There is a mountain of circumstantial evidence painting the same picture. Your "you can't prove it" attitude is one of a guilty man relying on the lack of a smoking gun. Why pray tell me is that your angle?

            I suggest you guys start even before that. Find evidence that there actually were children killed, raped or something to that extent by the aforementioned people. The louder you guys yell "I know the truth" the more it portrays the lack of real proof and your (subconscious?) insecurity regarding the issue.

            I'm pretty sure if I let a registered sex offender live with me, my ex husband could get full custody of our children.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Huma is the type to let a pedophile live with her and her children, what does that say about her??  She cares about him or herself MORE than the safety of her children??
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm with numerous people on this thread who thinks she's a Saudi spy, but unless those kids aren't hers or are for show or whatever, I'm highly disturbed our legal system allows people like Weiner to live with children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who protects the children when you have 2 sickos like that for parents?  The one complicit is just as bad if you ask me and shouldn't be trusted.

             She works for the Clintons. The chances of her being ethically challenged are high. Seth Rich seemed to have qualms. He of course is dead. She is doing fine and her husband continues his ways unimpeded, not bound by the same rules of society that the caterpillars are. Or is that unfound speculation?

            Huma Abedin is the daughter of some Islamic terrorists last I checked. They likely cut her genitals up at birth. Who knows - whatever the case may be, I don't feel sorry for Hillary's lover.

            Their relationship, just like the Clinton's, is all for show and political gain.  You can not rationalize them as you would a normal couple.  Just look at Bill Clinton's womanizing... Hillary never gave a crap about it, except what it did to her/their image.  It is really easy to forgive a rapist husband when you are only in the marriage for political gain.

            I never thought of that. Couldn't he just not take him being a Jew serious? Just like a catholic was raised catholic but they never go to church and follow the traditions. I don't know much about Jews. It would make sense she's a spy tho because of her and her families background. It wouldn't be a good cover to marry a Jew tho if they aren't supposed to marry.

             This is about Jewish BLOODlines.  BLOODlines, genes, and DNA are with you for LIFE.

            I think Huma could be smart when it comes to saving her butt, and dumb when it comes to love.  There could be all kinds of reasons she asked him back.  We have also heard rumors about her and Hillary sexually, and I don't really care about that, only if it involves children, not the two of them together.  They are consenting adults.  When it comes to affecting their child that is where the buck stops as well.  These two adults are so screwed up who knows what their intentions are.  Huma could have an abuse background as well, the fact that she condoned and put up with Weiner's sexual antics all those years.   Either way, I feel really sorry for that little boy.
