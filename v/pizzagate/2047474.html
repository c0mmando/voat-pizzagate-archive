  'formattedContent' => '<p>A few months ago (Mar 2017), Ben Stein was publicly accused of having groomed a 12-year-old girl, taken photos of her, and asked to have sex with her. It seems that the victim, Morgain McGovern, came directly to Voat to let us know about her charges (which dated from 1986-87) and her concerns about pictures of young girls on Stein\'s current Facebook. Morgain (if it was her) later deleted her account. The original charge remains up on her blog, however, so she has not gone entirely silent. It seems appropriate to look again at Stein\'s published record.</p>
<p>The earliest blurting-out that I could find was in <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=HJbW_6l-uRUC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=ben+stein+pedophile&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CtRTSjF2hM&amp;sig=ubbqt-iMeWx8_gCtqq7Borc4T-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWjYiPgcfVAhVIzGMKHetjD3gQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=ben%20stein%20pedophile&amp;f=false">SPIN magazine for Dec 1999</a>. Stein was asked to compare Washington D.C. call girls with Hollywood call girls (he answered that he prefers Hollywood); then the interviewer noted that Stein would be very good in the role of Humbert Humbert, from <em>Lolita</em>, to which Stein replied, &quot;Oh, God, would I ever! You know me so well! How do you know me that well?&quot;</p>
<p>A little further on, Stein qualified his answer, saying, &quot;I do love little girls, but I don\'t love them that little. I like them, I\'d say, early to mid-20s.&quot; But then when he was asked who he would like to play alongside in the role of Lolita, he answered, &quot;Christina Applegate. I worked on <em>Married ... With Children</em> once and just fell madly in love with her.&quot; At the time (fall 1994), Applegate (b. Nov 1971) was only 12. </p>
<p>Stein wrote two pieces for <em>American Spectator</em> in October 2006, referring to the charges brought against Congressman Mark Foley. In the first, which was subsequently taken down, Stein took a tone of outrage against the Democrats for picking on poor misguided Mark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Representative Foley “scandal” is really worthy of a whole book on hypocrisy. On the one hand, we have a poor misguided Republican man who had a romantic thing for young boys. He sent them suggestive e-mail. I agree, that’s not great. On the other hand, we have a Democratic party that worships (not likes, WORSHIPS) a man named Bill Clinton who did not send suggestive e-mails as far as we know, but who had a barely legal intern give him oral sex kneeling under his desk in the Oval Office while he talked on the phone to a Congressional Committee Chairman, took great pleasure in putting a cigar in her orifice and then smelling it and tasting it, and having her fellate him when in the sacred seat of power of the world’s leading Republic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://mcblogger.com/?p=937">drew some hostile commentary</a> (which was perhaps why it was taken down). <a href="https://spectator.org/46311_pedophile-nation/">His second American Spectator essay</a>, also in October 2006, was much more cautious and measured, and instead of blaming the Democrats, he blamed whoever is in charge of dressing America\'s pre-teen kids. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, it’s not easy to have a lot of sympathy for Mark Foley. He did some extremely questionable things, and he’s being heartily punished for it, with more to come, most likely.</p>
<p>But he has raised an interesting issue long overdue for national discussion. The media and the pundits are acting as if something brand new happened when a grown up discovered the sexuality of teenagers. They’re acting as if teenagers are innocent little children who never heard of sex until they got e-mails from a Member of Congress.</p>
<p>The truth is just the opposite. This is a nation that is absolutely drenched in juvenile sex. I am not sure exactly when it happened, but it sure was going on when I was a teenager and that was a long time ago in the days of James Dean. The problem is vastly more prevalent now. ...</p>
<p>Look at fashions for young girls. They are getting dressed like Parisian streetwalkers from the 1950s. Little girls are getting dressed by the fashion industry as if they were little hookers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is classic deflection, normalizing and minimizing pedophilia by continually talking about side issues rather than the central point. In a long life of speaking and writing, a public intellectual like Stein <strong>might</strong> have made one or two random remarks like these without them having any deeper meaning. Every writer and celebrity has off days. But then we have <a href="https://morgainmcgovern.com/2017/03/25/open-letter-to-press-and-law-enforcement-regarding-ben-stein-the-pedophile/">Morgain McGovern\'s report</a> that her mentally ill and much-arrested mother knowingly tried to &quot;pimp her out&quot; to Stein in 1986-87, in exchange for money and a positive write-up in Stein\'s newspaper column. This would have been immediately after Stein\'s rise to fame for his role in <em>Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off</em>.</p>
<p>The statute of limitations may have passed on the original crime, but there is nothing saying that Stein should get a pass in the court of public opinion. McGovern has added that since her original Mar 2017 post, several other victims of Stein have come forward.</p>
<p>Will the <em>American Spectator</em> disavow its remaining Stein essay on the subject of pedophilia? Will his friends in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. acknowledge that these are serious charges, and that even Stein\'s own remarks on the topic now make him sound like a creep and a child-rape apologist?</p>
<p>This is one more story about Hollywood pedophilia that is not going away.</p>',

            superficially (from his public personality, looks, etc), is anyone really that surprised that ben stein either a) pays for sex or b) would groom a 12 year old?
            <br/>
            i know that donkeyote got downvoated for using slurs and highlighting Stein's jewishness in this thread (rightly so at least as far as the slurs).  but, since p/g researchers here are hip to pedo problems in hollywood and stein proclaims his preference for hollywood hooker, i think it's fair to point out that Stein wrote an article for E online proudly boasting that the "jews" do run hollywood (and he sees no problem with that):

             His account is a week old and has something like -90 in comment scores. Letting the "Jews did it" argument derail every thread is bad because it eventually leads to the "Hitler did nothing wrong" argument. Since what we are trying to do is alert the world to mass child rape, it should be obvious that it can only hurt the cause to endorse mass murder of children.
            </p>

             Either DawnKeyhote is a shill trying deliberately to drive competent people away, or he's obsessed with Jew-baiting and fighting to the detriment of any practical purpose.

              good 'heads up' about potential shill and clikckbait.  I get what you're saying and, no, I don't want to put simplistic blanket blame out there.  I will say that hopefully "competent" people can discern the differences between the extremes you mentioned (but maybe they're not or there's not enough competent people).

              wtf is that first question yo?  as to the second question:  it seems many voaters still aren't buying that there's a lot of ashkenzis amoungst the  big criminals, so stein proudly acknowledging what is supposed to be a stereotype should point out, in a roundabout way, that fact (since it's accepted that very bad stuff goes on in hollywood).  Sorry it wasn't as "consequential" as dropping kike bombs and putting out the (obvious) fact that stein is jewish

             I'm going to help you understand something important about how the Internet works.
            </p>
            <p>
             Google "Ben Stein pedophile". Notice how the Voat thread that Morgain McGovern posted gets a high ranking (in my search, it actually comes first). Google scores that thread higher because it is rich in non-spam links. Whenever the search spider gets around to it, Google will score this thread similarly.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Jew-bait all you want, start whatever pointless fights you can. My post will still be here ten years from now, red-pilling anyone who is curious about Mr. Stein and his outlaw sexual proclivities. They don't even have to know Voat exists.
