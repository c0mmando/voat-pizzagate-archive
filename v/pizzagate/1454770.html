            this is what i found about panda's : "The belief that having sex with pandas increases libido, fertility and lifespan stems from a traditional Chinese legend in which the hero Xin Ha, who is said to have been abandoned by his family at birth and was raised by pandas, lived up to 922 years and had over seven hundred children."
