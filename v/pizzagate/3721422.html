            Wow Oprah once had on a guest  that talked about how ritual sacrifice of children was the norm in her family. She said her mother , a prestigious professional  in the community , was a participant in these rituals. Happened to be of the Jewish faith.

            The bodies were drained of blood? In Chicago? That reminds me of this article:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://journaltimes.com/news/local/satan-worship-theory-discounted/article_9768b227-9dc6-5d3b-94e2-81c3a0152645.html">
             https://journaltimes.com/news/local/satan-worship-theory-discounted/article_9768b227-9dc6-5d3b-94e2-81c3a0152645.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Satanic killings are known to cause injuries similar to those suffered by murder victim James M. Madden, but a medical examiner said Monday Madden's death was a homosexual homicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Jeffrey Jentzen, Milwaukee County medical examiner, said he based his conclusion on an examination of Madden's body - which was decapitated, dismembered, dissected and
             <strong>
              drained of blood
             </strong>
             June 27, 1990.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jentzen testified during the murder trial of Joachim Dressler, 43, formerly of 11739 5 Mile Road in Raymond. Dressler's trial is in its second week before
             <strong>
              Racine County
             </strong>
             Circuit Court Judge Gerald Ptacek.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Isn't Chicago the "New Racine"?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jentzen rejected a satanic explanation for the death of Madden, 24, of Whitefish Bay. But he said there were similarities between Madden's injuries and the type of ritualistic wounds linked to devil worship.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Although the injuries may be consistent with a satanic type of death … it's my opinion that it's a homosexual homicide," Jentzen said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Such sexually motivated killings, according to Jentzen, involve many more injuries than are necessary to cause death and frequently involve mutilation of sexual organs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jentzen, however, said he was familiar with the characteristics of satanic murders.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I am aware of the taking of the head, the bodily organs," Jentzen told defense attorney James Mathie of Milwaukee.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mathie, who contends Dressler is innocent, said
             <strong>
              Racine County authorities failed to properly investigate the possibility of a link between satanic worship and Madden's death.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Mathie said the victim's head is placed on a pole and later dumped at the murder scene in a satanic killing. He said the victim's left hand and genitals also are sought by devil worshipers.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The satanists believe that by taking the left hand, it will give them power from the devil," Mathie said.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said satanists would use a man's sexual organ to make an item used in ritualistic ceremonies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Madden spent years following the Grateful Dead rock band, according to Mathie, who said the legion of "Dead Heads" also includes a satanic cult. He said Madden had spent time with other Dead Heads in the week before his death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jentzen said he "wouldn't be surprised" by the existence of such a cult.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mathie asked Jentzen if he had heard of Racine County sightings of people wearing hoods, filing into wooded areas. He also questioned Jentzen's knowledge about the ritualistic killing of a dog in a rural barn and suspected satanic activity near Waterford.
            </p>
            <p>
             "They (authorities) do indicate there is a general amount of satanic action in rural areas," Jentzen said.
            </p>
            <p>
             District Attorney Lennie Weber and Sheriff Robert Rohner said there is no reason to believe satanic practices are common in Racine County.
            </p>
            <p>
             Weber said Mathie developed his theory about a satanic link from reading sheriff's deputies' reports about the death of Madden. Those allegations already have been investigated and rejected, she said.
