            I hope she is alright.  She responded directly to me way back when Pizzagate was starting.  I read her story and it made me sick.  I have been nonstop studying this stuff since.

            fiona is a very intelligent woman with a husband and daughter she was being targeted after she came out and they installed an agent as her neighbour to torment her i am praying that she has entered a witness protection program because it took so much courage to speak out publicly the way she did

             There are also rumors that Nicole Kidman spent Christmas of 1996 at Fleet White's home in Boulder CO, the same place JonBenet Ramsey (whose father was best friends with White) attended before her death. Fleet White's family was credibly accused of being pedophiles, and his father had other Hollywood connections like to Goldie Hawn, so the rumor is at least plausible.

            Like I said last time this type of question was posted here- unless Fiona's husband comes out and says she is missing, she's not missing. She's likely just laying low and staying out of the spotlight. She deserves some peace

             That’s a good rubric. No news is good news. There’s no point in her being whacked this late in the game. Now that she’s told her story, the cabal bosses likely want her left alone. If she gets punished, that would only lend credibility to her story and risk a martyr situation. Better for them to let her live and call her crazy on tv. That said... it’s certainly possible that she said something that REALLY ticked off on of the satanic monsters. It’s easy to imagine one of those types going of the reservation and attacking her for revenge, but they may get just as much of a kick out of just trolling her publicly. Just sayin... she is likely alive and reasonably safe fro the cabal, just hiding.

             You could be right, it would be interesting to know if she's with family and if anyone has filed a missing persons report.

            So where's the source of your claim that she is "feared missing or dead"?
Didn't she announce that she wished to go underground years ago?
Someone deletes a twitter account means nothing.
Elon Musk and Playboy's Facebook pages are gone. Are they missing or dead?

            Yeah, her Facebook hasn't posted since September, but she rarely posted in the past, while she was on the run. She is probably in hiding right now or sick of the drama of all the trolls.

            David Shurter, who is a survivor of the Franklin Credit child sex trafficking ring in Omaha, is a good friend of Fiona's. Because of being a targeted individual, he deleted all of his videos on YouTube (except for new ones he's making because they're still targeting him so he said fuck it). I can't remember when exactly, but it was sometime last year in one of his now deleted videos that he said Fiona told him she was going underground because they're heavily targeting her as well. Here's a post he wrote about this on his website back in February of this year:

            'Mediawatch' in Australia did a shabby piece of journalism debunking Fiona Barnett's claims with flimsy reasoning. You can watch it here.

             http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4343957.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Having read everything about Fiona, pizzagate and being from Australia, I wrote to Media Watch on their messenger asking them if she was okay, if they could check. At the same time Nicole Kidman had run after run in the Australian, with help of godfather Murdoch, photo after photo, Australian of the Year?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also at this time was when my facebook was hacked into twice, and my twitter account was deleted. This is odd, because i never ever tweeted or used twitter. Its an old dormant unused account. Problems with computer, NBN shutting down, I dont know it all happened around same time. These guys are onto us. As we are unto them. I hope Fiona is okay. What about her family/daughter?

             Yes, that gratuitous character assassination on Fiona Barnett by MediaWatch delivered by Paul Barry really made me wonder about the ABC.  If the ABC is the equivalent of the BBC, which has allegedly been controlled by paedophiles since it existed, pedos must have influence at the ABC too.  BTW Australia has an equivalent of Jimmy Saville.

             Good question, I don't know if she's with her family or she left on her own. Also, a slight sidenote but I have MSN Australia news feed set as my homepage on Windows 10 and Iv'e never been able to change it even after looking up and following how-to's. I looked it up online and many people complain about not being able to change it as their homepage. So there must be millions of people with Windows 10 who are stuck with it and think it's the somewhat legit. It's a blatant propaganda scheme, MSN is the bottom of the barrel, pure propaganda.and misdirection. I only mention this because your comment made me think of how multiple examples of when pizzagate exposure was getting too hot for tptb, I'd see nonsense glorifying articles about prime suspects at the top of the feed, next to something about Trump/Russia, or another out of the blue useless Maddie McCann article. Or when the Royal Family, or Ellen, or Obama, Oprah, Elton John etc is getting a lot of heat from the p-gate community I would almost like clockwork see a fluffy article about them put at the top of the feed within days.

              I have the same MSN. Homepage, and I have noticed that phenom as well! Lol... I decided that I’m comfortable with it. It gives me some boxes to check in my personal research and keeps me on my toes. A striking example for me was the case of Kevin Spacey. We had all the info here on voat, but MSM was a step behind. My homepage started with a big headline that put him in a good light and promoted his house of cards thing.

              Cathy O'Brien is  very  sensational, but  frankly again-there doesn't  seem  to  be any  hard  proof of her startling allegations of Nixon, Reagan etc.
I am personally on  the  fence re:  the  integrity  of Ted  Gunderson, who worked with O'Brien to  publicize  her  story-I can't  get  past the  fact that Gunderson was  shacking up with  the  Chief Satanist's  old  lady-something  stinks  here

               Cathy O'Brien said her vagina had a carving.
You, or anyone, can see this carving at the 9 minute mark of the video "Cathy O'Brien gynecology appointment'.

               Yes, I have doubts about Gunderson, as apparently does David Shurter (who I tend to believe.) Gunderson, though, would count as a good actor (he was smooth and convincing) unlike Barnett. It's not just his association with the satanists in Gunderson's case, it's the fact that he was Cointelpro in the first place - and then we're supposed to believe that he worked against the black hats in his own agency in a super high-profile way. Same as we're supposed to believe another 'Mr Cointelpro', John Podesta, happened to be incredibly slipshod and went around with a password which was 'p@ssword' (must have skipped some modules on his training) as well as leaving a trail of 'clues' (aka red herrings) when going to Portugal with his brother.

             No it hasn't been proven, and she did make some very incredible claims. Tbh I've never made up my mind about her and have always remained about at least 10% skeptical. Keep in mind that this was before pizzagate, so it adds even more credibility to her claims, as well as the fact Antony Kidman fled and died just after she went public. If she's making it all up she's a phenomenal fantasist and VERY committed to the bit... One of the things that stuck with me and I find hard to believe, was when she described Paul Keating meeting at the site where they had buried a boy they murdered, and they apparently dug up the corpse so Keating could have his way with it. And then there's the Richie Beneau sacrifing babies story. Her whole story really is hard to believe, and if Pizzagate had never happened I'd probably write her off, but given what we've discovered it's kinda hard to.

              The most credible thing about her, is the group of support that she has. If she was a kook or a shill, she would not have the continued support of friends and family. There is additional tangential support from the unconnected reports of elite luciferians, pedophiles and cults in Australia. The nail for me is when she says, point blank: “the way that she has been treated for reporting this hurt worse than the abuse”. I teared up a bit up with her when she talked about the other victims. I’m a grown man. I don’t think of myself as gullible, and my instincts have always served me well. I believe Fiona to a reasonable degree.

              Like I said I  believe  her story, but  my  concern is  there are PTB that will sometimes  put  forward a  stooge  to  pass around an incredible  story only  later to be found false, with the motive of covering  up real abuse, to  discredit real victims; you  have to  remember that  that some  of the  most  powerful and well funded elites will stop at  nothing to do the  evil they  do and cover their tracks

              Bob Hope had a very likeable persona but it turns out he was a satanist.  I believe the same could be true unfortunately of Richie Benaud.  Why would Fiona Barnett make this stuff up?  Also her evidence closely matches others who were raised in satanic cults such as Jay Parker in the US and Toos Nijenhuis in the Netherlands.

               Yes!  Bob Hope lied about his marriage to Dolores in that they were never married until late in life as though he had to do it as a cover up, imo.  They never had biological children either.  All 4 were adopted.  He had many affairs and set up an apt. for one woman but I propose these were set up to cover that he may have been gay.  Here is what I found in his Wiki:  Their long marriage was fraught with ambiguities. As Richard Zoglin wrote in his 2014 biography Hope: Entertainer of the Century, "Bob and Dolores always claimed that they married in February 1934 in Erie, Pennsylvania. But at that time he was secretly married to his vaudeville partner Louise Troxell, after three years together on and off. I found divorce papers for Bob and Louise dated November 1934, so either Bob Hope was a bigamist or he lied about marrying Dolores in February that year. He'd actually married Louise in January 1933 in Erie when they were traveling on the vaudeville circuit. When he claimed he had married Dolores in Erie he was miles away in New York, on Broadway. More intriguing, there is no record anywhere of his marriage to Dolores, if it happened. And there are no wedding photos, either. But he never forgot Louise and quietly sent her money in her later years."[86] It is interesting to note that "New York City, Marriage License Indexes, 1907-1995" at Ancestry.com, includes a 1993 marriage license for Dolores Mary Defina and Lester Townes Hope in Manhattan.[90]   Many stars have succeeded in covering up lies about their past.

                 Don't think i wasn't surprised.  I thought they wee always married even though I suspected he was gay and possibly eve a pedophile.  All the children were adopted.  Another Red Flag.  I wonder if there are any stars in Tinsel Town that are not gay.  Very few, imo.

                  Hollywood is filled with people that ran away from home to try and get famous. Rejecting their upbringing and common sense, doing any deviant acts imaginable to join the crowd and gain acceptance. There are likely more than a few who have taken a long hard look at their lives and felt a profound sense of regret. Far larger, I imagine, is the percentage that just doubled down and kept going forward into more depravity, promoting an unprincipled, undisciplined culture and broadcasting the liberal ambience for generations.

                   I think there are also those that got in so deep they would never let them out of the depravity because of the blackmail they have.  They will use them and abuse them until there is little left

               I know what you mean it could very well be true. Billy Graham was clearly a bullshit person and I don't at all doubt that he was involved in pizzagate stuff.

                Do you have any links for that info? I know his son Franklin made $572,145 salary and $250,188 for other compensation in 2015 filing for his popular Samaritan's Purse Charity which sponsors Operation Christmas Child. Connections? 
His operation was in Nepal right after their big earthquake.

                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                "When asked if his work through his charity is having the same kind of impact that his father's work had, Franklin said, "It's different. I think the work here at Samaritan's Purse no question is different. But is it impacting the lives of people? No question, absolutely. The greatest work that I can do is not how many hospital beds I can send or how much medical equipment I could give away; it's how many people's lives I can impact with the Gospel.""

            She took down some of the interviews on her Pedos Down Under YT channel so I guessed she'd been threatened.  She has a beautiful family too.  Perhaps she's not very free to speak.

             All of her work will likely be mirrored into perpetuity IMO, as long as the internet stays free. I think I have her “candy girl” videos and some other stuff saved just in case. I’m sure others more savvy than me have done the same.

             Where ever she is I hope she is safe.  I also hope the best for her family as well.  Ihave read many things on here including that her husband is her handler and I don't believe it.  There will be shills as we know on here for sure, they want to poison our minds against those that have the courage to tell the truth.  YES Why in the world would she make this stuff up?  This is the same thing our resident SRA Survivor

              @StcharlesSeminary
             </a>
             says over and over.  Why would I make this stuff up?  If they are making any money like Fiona could be from her book and appearances, why would she endanger herself by saying these things about Famous People?  She has a price on her head for sure.  It just does not make any sense.  And as for our SRA Survivor, she is not making a penny.  She is the Most Courageous Woman I have ever known.

            I should have been clearer in the title for those who don't know. She quite credibly claimed to have been victim of the 9th Circle Satanic Cult when she was a child and witness to many child rapes, murders and sacrifices.

             It's so bizarre that Antony Kidman was publicly accused as a pedophile, fled to Singapore (where Nicole's sister Antonia was living)  then his death was announced.  Soon after, Antonia's husband dies of a heart attack at 46 despite being fit and healthy.

             I was about to write a brief explanation but then realized the article link I put in the description explains her pretty succinctly, just have a little read of that. Basically she came out with these claims
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zln_Nq-1C0c">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zln_Nq-1C0c
             </a>
             and the man she named as the main player (Antony Kidman, Nicole's dad) fled the country and died mysteriously 2 months later. Probably check out her documentary on YT if you haven't already.

            While I'm at it has anyone heard anything from the other Aussie guy who used to post here all the time and was really deep into investigating the whole Australian side of "pedogate" and had been for years?  (the one with the slightly unruly mouth...)? His name is Luke, can't remember his last name. He used to be here all the time and was about as devoted to the cause as you could get. Maybe a little unpalatable at times, but he was one of the most pro-active and vocal of anyone. If you're reading this Luke let us know...

              He was able to find and link the most horrible things. He found fotos of satanists from their social media, taken before, during and after rituals... all kinds of things. He punished himself for our cause, so it is no wonder that he had issues. My mind can’t take that, especially the bloody images. He could really use a partner... one to take his links and points and coalesce such things into well communicated posts. The first times I read hojuruku’s writings, I thought he was an “English as a Second Language” student or something. I just COULD NOT understand his sentences.

               Yes, that was a problem, too. Dumping a lot of raw data without properly forming it into coherency. The 24 Hour flair might work for him, if the community is willing to help.

              Ah thanks. Hopefully if he ever comes back he can tone it down a bit if only for communications sake, and stop saying "faggot baby rapists" so much etc... lol

               I would be amenable to unbanning him and giving it another go. The new 24 hour flair might take the sting out of getting sideways with the rules in a way he could cope with, as long as he is willing to make real Discuss posts that can be edited.
