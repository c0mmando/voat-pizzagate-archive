            Maybe. You raise some great points. I'm still undecided though. I do find it funny that Alien Spaceship hoax bull shit died out. I was thinking that was how the Deep State would distract from all this sordid shit. But I think they quickly realized you can't forget this shit. It's life changing. None of us will ever be the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason I'm not totally convinced is there's plenty of evidence other than child porn and the like. And there will be mountains upon mountains of new evidence leaked everyday until this fucker comes down. And this fucker IS coming down. It's only quiet now because Deplorable Shit Lords like you and me have given Trump about 6 to 9 months to start the process of restoring our Democracy and our Constitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Trump doesn't do it then the people will. They know this. Everyone knows this. It just takes a while to wake them up from a 50 year reign of depravity. And we'd all concede this past 8 years of consequence free decisions to sell the American Middle Class down the river went far beyond mere depravity. They had graduated to the cocaine, mescaline, medicinal ether, quaaludes, phenobarbital, oxycodone,

             I just want to ask the questions, so that we don't underestimate them or their capabilites. I'm wondering if this cyber hack even happened. I know its not just child porn and manipulating the internet or claiming its vulnerabilities allows for  evidence (CP or organ trafficking or Satanism, etc) to be discredited. Also, claiming that persons are harmed because of interference of hospital systems could provide justification for charging Wikileaks with criminal charges, either by US or England or whatever other of the 90 or so countries that have been cyber attacked.  On the other hand, if these attacks are real, it is probably the CIA who are the most likely culprits with access, motivation, deprived morality, and an expectation of never being caught or charged.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't can't read/hear news anymore without second guessing accuracy or motive and I appreciate your opinion.

             <p>
              Yes but that works both ways. If any evidence were to appear that they intentionally did it to frame Wikileaks then Wikileaks won't be the ones going to jail. They will. And they know other countries Intel Communities would be more than willing to provide that evidence.

            They probably planted cp on everyone's computers so when they get caught they can blame it on the hackers, "see you have it too"
