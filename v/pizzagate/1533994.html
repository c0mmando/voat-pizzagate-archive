<h2>Yunus corruption &amp; close ties to Clinton</h2>
<p>A documentary “Caught in Micro Debt” found that Yunus had stashed (or \'mishandled\') nearly $100 million in aid money from Grameen Bank to one of 30 companies he controls. This was done in contravention of the agreement behind the aid and done in secrecy without informing the donors.  <a href="https://archive.is/Tw4Sx">https://archive.is/Tw4Sx</a></p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Bangladesh accused Yunnus of being a \'blood sucker of the poor\'. <a href="https://archive.is/Tw4Sx">https://archive.is/Tw4Sx</a>  Charges were brought against Yunus by the government of Bangladesh.  Backed by Hillary and Bill Clinton  Yunus filed an appeal in Bangladesh Supreme Court against the High Court’s verdict.   Here is the Department of State defending Yunus from the allegations made by the Bangladesh government: <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/09/214047.htm">https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/09/214047.htm</a>
Even Obama got involved: <a href="https://archive.is/Kjm21">https://archive.is/Kjm21</a><br />
Why is the US government coming to the aid of a man who has been shown to mishandle millions of aid dollars?  Yunus has donated 125k-300k to Clinton Foundation.

<h2>Micro-credit fuels sex trafficking, human trafficking and organ trafficking</h2>
<p>Yunus invented \'micro-credit\'--giving loans to very poor people who would not otherwise be eligible for loans.  Micro-credit is touted is a great mechanism to lift people out of poverty.  In reality, it sinks people further into debt.  Borrowers often struggle paying off the debt and turn to loan sharks and are even forced to sell their organs, many times not getting the money promised for an organ.   Here is an academic paper entitled “Microcredit-not yet a panacea to end trafficking in women” which sets out the downfalls of micro-credit and how it fuels the sex and human trafficking industry. It speaks specifically about Yunus and Grameen:<br />
*Many borrowers are pushed to take out additional loans from local lenders at high interest rates to meet the initial payments on the microloan.76 They also seek economic opportunities elsewhere and, as a result, have a high risk of being lured into seemingly legitimate employment positions that operate as a guise for trafficking.77 *

<h2>Abdus Sattar</h2>
<p>There are numerous articles about microfinance being responsible for the rising trade in organ and body parts.  In ALL of the following articles an Abdus Sattar is named as a trafficker and as the person who places pressure on borrowers for debts to be repaid:</p>
<p>“Yunus Microfinance responsible for organ bazaar”
Abdus Sattar mentioned as the trafficker: <a href="https://archive.is/yatwy">https://archive.is/yatwy</a></p>
<p>Another story related to the kidney trade, with Abdus Sattar mentioned as the trafficker, who had been prosecuted, but then quickly started trafficking again:  <a href="https://archive.is/SF43O">https://archive.is/SF43O</a></p>
<p>&quot;Inside Bangladesh\'s Organ Bazaar&quot;, again mentioned Abdus Sattar:</p>
<p><em>Sattar … built up a network that connected kidney patients in Dhaka with willing sellers in the villages, creaming off fat commissions in the process. The brokers roam around the diagnostic centers where kidney dialysis takes place. They know it’s a good hunting place for kidney patients,</em>

<p>In a previous post, I mentioned that an Abdus Sattar had been making comments on the Facebook page of The Yunus Centre.  Here is a screencap of one of Sattar\'s comments.  <a href="https://sli.mg/blALOE">https://sli.mg/blALOE</a>  When I search for those posts now, they appear to have been removed.  
</p>
<p>I do not know how common a name is Abdus Sattar, and whether the Abdus Sattar commenting on Yunus\'s Facebook page is the same Abdul Sattar who is trafficking.   I tried to find the Abdul Sattar commenting on the FB page but was unsuccessful. He doesn\'t seem to exist any more.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if Yunnus is watching Voat and making sure to delete any evidence of wrongdoing. Perhaps someone else will have more luck than I.</p>
<h2>Grameen uses pedo symbols</h2>
<p>You will note from the above that Grameen uses the swirl as its logo.
This archive contains a picture of a Grameen initiative logo: <a href="http://archive.is/lYvEL">http://archive.is/lYvEL</a>   Note the open hands and the swirls.   
</p>
<p>I\'m not tech savvy and I\'m hoping that some autists will look into Yunus and Grameen.  I have to admit that this issue has affected me deeply as I can\'t imagine how it\'s possible to abuse vulnerable little children, and I have to be careful when I open links to make sure I don\'t see anything too disturbing.</p>',
