             Carter and the stray dog
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             At his home in Plains, Ga., Carter once tried to attack and kill a small dog with a bow saw. Agents had befriended the stray dog, a terrier, and given it the code name Dolphin.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the dog ate some food Carter's wife, Rosalynn, had put out for their Siamese cat, Carter "got the bow saw off a woodpile near the family room patio" and "tried to kill the dog," one agent who was there told Kessler.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dolphin dodged the attack, but Carter insisted that agents remove the dog from Plains. The orphan dog was given to the press corps.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I had always thought Carter  (political beliefs aside) was sincere/the real deal.  Alas, my heroes fall one by one.

            Where is the legislation preventing this? This should be deemed abandonment of the adoption and require setting aside the court order of adoption and placing the child under proper legal authority for  future foster care or new adoption. Of course this presumes adequate oversight by state authorities and we know what a failure that has been for a long time.

            You do not get to send back the children.  Even cats and dogs are yours forever.  What a horrible thing.  If you were to give birth you should not either unless you die.  This is a horrid idea.  It must stop.  There should be more care with choosing parents.

            Couple times a month I ride by that so called school.  Amazes me it is still operational/but then maybe not bc the area is littered with fundies.  There are a lot of really good ppl in this area but pockets of radical nut cases too (guess that is everywhere
            <em>
             grin
            </em>
            ).  We thought for sure the school would shut down with all the publicity but nah, business as usual.  Don't know if it still gets fed funding/wasn't supposed to teaching religion but loopholes are still in style.

            Thing is he adopted those girls when he was running for reelection and it rounded out his family pictures.  He kept using the pics with the girls after he had passed them along.  The babysitter told some very sad stories of how she was supposed to treat the oldest girl and she would disobey when the so called parents were gone and give the girl a bit of freedom bc she was kept locked in her room.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a follow up the girls were placed as far as anyone can tell in loving homes that were especially suited for children with prior abuse and the new homes declined to do press things wanting to protect them.  Local papers are not as corrupted as msm and following what happened to the girls when placed elsewhere seemed pretty legit.  It was a big deal in this area and lots of ppl concerned about the girls placements.
           </p>
           <p>
            ps...here is the rest of the story/I had some of the facts mixed up...it was the middle girl that was kept locked in her room, no toys, just food and water.  The older girl they only kept 6 days.

             Twenty problems with 20/20's coverage of the Justin Harris 'rehoming'
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Rep. Justin Harris had direct influence over the DCFS budget,
           </p>
           <p>
            Growing God's Kingdom is paid for almost entirely by taxpayer funds, via DHS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is rehoming bad? One reason is that it creates an opportunity for predators to get their hands on kids. Bizarrely, this message almost gets lost in the shuffle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The saddest part of this for me is 'rehoming' goes on all the time with international adoptions as mentioned in your post.  Watched an excellent docu on it last year.  There are message boards where ppl advertise the children and pedos abound.  Since the kids are international there is no real oversight and they are passed around.  How many 'Skippy' call me father's are out there taking advantage of this?  How many of these children just disappear and no one ever knows?  How many are procured for SRA?

            Here's a couple in Seattle advertising on Houston's Craig's List. They say they're aware that it "take a village" to raise a family - obvious Hillary supporters. No pic of the family, which seems suspect.

            Even the pine cone reference they make causes me think of the pineal gland, which is often an MK Ultra focal point. Maybe I'm going overboard with these ads, but it just creeps me out that people are going to Craigs List when people are told time and time again that it's the last place you want to find new owners for pets you need to rehome.

            I searched DC's Craigs List for 'child adoption' and you can see a few mixed in with those who are advertising pets. What if there's a code like 'pizza' and they're hiding the children with the word 'chihuahua'? Just a thought...

            Is that a pizza she just ordered from the food truck where she's flashing the 666 hand sign? Strange that she would choose this pic to post over everything else that she could've possibly chosen.

              I'm not sure it's Laura Silsby/Gaylor. I found another ad for this lady in Baltimore.
              <a href="https://baltimore.craigslist.org/com/6155736950.html">
               https://baltimore.craigslist.org/com/6155736950.html

             </p>
             <p>
              I clicked on show contact info, and searched for the phone number.

               https://i.imgtc.com/jLKGWu8.jpg
              </a>
              I know we here on pizzagate do not advocate leaking personal information but I was just using it to find out if this was Silsby. Please DO NOT call the number.
             </p>
             <p>
              The search result came up with a classified ad in the Hudson Valley times.
              <a href="http://www.ulsterpublishing.com/pages/ad_details/listing_details/details/49069178-i-hope-pray-to-adopt">

               http://archive.is/tvMSX
              </a>
              The person there has an email with the name "Laure" in it. While internet searches did not give conclusive results searching for the phone number nor email address, AdvancedBackgroundChecks.com and Pipl.com suggested that it might be a lady named Laure Cunningham. (
              <a href="http://archive.is/WqZ3g">
               http://archive.is/WqZ3g)
              </a>
              ) (

               https://i.imgtc.com/Ci4IuCw.jpg)
              </a>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              I am just posting this as pizzagate has always tried to show people which rumors are true, and which ones are not. So while there may be bad people trying to adopt children on Craigslist, I do not think this particular lady is Laura Slsby.
             </p>

              Edit: misspelled Laure

               Thanks for posting that, and it truly adds much to the creep factor. Funny that she always changes the heart pic under her photo, but not the photo. So happy to see this ad was already archived. Thanks to whomever did that!

               the name means nothing really.   its her photo right.   I mean you can use any alias.   but when You show the pic you are
connecting---associating with the person in the pic.

                I did a google image search and I came up with these parenting profiles for her:

                I can do some more digging into the details mentioned in the bios later, but what stuck me is that she said she is single and has no children, yet wants to adopt. While I do not want to make generalizing statements, on top of everything else this seems to be a red flag. No husband, no prior children, and posting ads all over the northeast.

                 Her posts profile etc is pretty lame meaning it speaks nothing about her.  It's what I would write in an add before being educated.   Lol 
Nothing speaks to her mind and soul

                <p>
                 Anyway I do believe that photo is a dead ringer for her

              Here's the same woman you linked to, but the heart symbol is different. I found her searching 'baby adopt' on DC Craigs List.
