<p>Last week as you may be aware of, Internet Sleuth George Webb dropped the bombshell that Seth Rich may actually be alive and well with Eric Braverman in Israel, citing intelligence from French Mossad.  In another video, he laughed with Goodman about wishing Mossad would come and save him also.</p>
<p>In yet another puzzling clip, Goodman smirks wildly while mentioning to George how many people were <em>very concerned</em> about Braverman.  And in another strange moment, Goodman makes a joke about how Reality Winner should to go &quot;Lose Bar&quot; (pronounced Lou\'s Bar).</p>
<p>In case you missed them, here are the clips -</p>
<p>Webb talks of Seth Rich - &quot;maybe he\'s on the same kibbutz, you know, growing chick peas right next to Eric Braverman&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Beth El Cemetery</strong></p>
<p>The Beth El Cemetery is located at 4700 South 84th Street (84th and &quot;L&quot; Streets) in Ralston, a city that is south of Omaha, Nabraska.</p>
<p>Beth El Synagogue bought land for the cemetery in 1927, and the cemetery was opened in 1939.
The cemetery is part of the Conservative community of Omaha. It is a medium-sized cemetery that is situated on three acres.
In May 1999, the Etta and Harold Epstein Family Chapel of Remembrance was dedicated on the grounds, enabling congregants to hold indoor services at the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Burials</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Johnny Rosenblatt</strong> (1907–1979) Mayor of Omaha (1954–1961). Rosenblatt Stadium was named after him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Edward Zorinsky</strong> (1928–1987) American politician. He served as a <strong>Democratic U.S. Senator</strong> from Nebraska from 1976 until his death in 1987. He was the first Jew elected to statewide office in Nebraska</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seth Conrad Rich</strong> (January 3, 1989 – July 10, 2016) was fatally shot in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C. He was a 27-year-old employee of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cemetery also has graves for Jewish soldiers and officers from Omaha who were killed in World War I, World War II, and other wars</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>It seems evident from the above that Seth Rich was not only Jewish American, but very much connected with Israel.  
</p>
<p>It also appears that Webb et al may know much more than we do, about Seth Rich.</p>',
