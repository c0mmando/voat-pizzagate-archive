<p>&quot;The basics for shooting sync sound have not changed much overtime but the refinements sure have. Mic Boom operators applaud the lightweight carbon fiber revolution in boompole construction to help reduce ‘on set’ fatigue common to a long shooting day and still capture quality audio. The discipline of sound recording is truly an art that any boompole  operator will attest too. Bobbing and weaving around  set pieces, camera dollies, lighting fixtures and live  action turns science into art. Advances in microphone technology mirror those of  image capture but the tried and true \'boom\' with a mic dangling from one end has  been around a long, long time. As has been said,  \'If it aint broke, don\'t fix it\' so what  Proaim has done is make it even better  than  before&quot;. (end quote).</p>

<p>Until Kevin Flynn did this video no one could see what was going on (well not as much as in the original) but Kevin has made things a little more visible. The reason i have done this is because like i said earlier people have mistaken this for being a broom/mop when its i believe anyway -audio equipment.</p>
<p>I hope people can appreciate how traumatic this video has been to those who have spent time on it. I personally have found it very upsetting. That is why i said please don\'t leave any nasty comments because i can\'t take much more.
Thank you for your time.</p>',

            That is definitely a Masco or similar brand shower enclosure.  That is not a boom mic, nor is it being held like one.  If I had to bet, I'd say it was a (golf) putter a little closer to the camera.  Does Podesta play golf?

            I am half convinced, I had a thought which I am wondering if you considered. If that is indeed a boom pole, maybe it was not neccessarily part of making this video, could be permanent equipment in that room? The next step would be, can we find a picture of a boom pole in the same orientation from comet ping ping, i.e. more proof this was filmed in the basement of cpp? Just an idea, would be a long shot but would be great evidence to convince a lot of people if it works out

            If that's a boom mic it isn't being held like one. I have never seen people use the mic to bang on surfaces. Also for part of the time it is just held at ground level. Doesn't make a lot of sense. Doesn't mean it's NOT a boom mic, but if it is, the person using it is, well....not using it properly, if you ask me.

            As for the drum screen theory, it's possible I guess, but that looks soooo much like a shower door to me.. I even see what appears to be a handle where you can pull the sliding glass apart. I'd be more inclined to believe this if I saw a drum screen that looked more like what I'm seeing here.

            It's fine that bands sometimes use these, and that Comet has bands. We can't pretend the proof of it being a drum screen is that Comet has bands, and that the proof of this being at Comet is that this is a drum shield. Circular proof doesn't work.

            The shower wouldn't necessarily be in a dressing room. The place where I was, was specifically for concerts and a whole lot bigger than CPP. So, maybe they have a bathroom with the shower and the video was shot with the door open, which is why we can see the stage lights.

            This would make perfect sense! Being tortured on stage for their entertainment. Rock music is super satanic.Maybe the video with the man saying "get in the the water" was put out to get us off? When he was saying "get in the water" he sounded a lot different. Or maybe the have a drum screen is over a shower pan that can be filled with water? I wouldn't be surprised if they torture the child during the band playing and then kill him afterwards.

            Nice work! While I'm in agreement with you about the boom pole, I'm still holding the belief that it's a shower stall the child is in. I have been back stage at a popular concert venue before and there was a shower in the dressing room that had glass doors. I would think that any place that had bands performing often would have a shower available for the band members to clean up after the show.

            UnicornandSparkles mentioned the floral design. Many shower doors are opaque with some sort of design or texture imbedded in the glass where as drum screens are clear. Could a 6yo knock over a drum screen?

            Could it be that the child is outside the door and the person inside the shower stall is not only recording but inside banging and yelling and serving as a bogeyman terrifying the child.  Of course none of this squares with the separate video showing what appears go be the same boy happily playing with his brother.  We need to source this before it drives us nuts.

            I just got finished looking at dozens of images of drum screens and none of them have that metal work unique to shower doors so yes it's a shower door but the boy looks like he is outside the shower at least in the first portion...that he is in a large bathroom about to be forced into the shower stall. I didn't notice the floral design...good eye on your part but please don't make me view that footage again.

            It might be helpful to post a pic of a drum screen and clarify the "shower"...also, how do you explain the whole container...seems like there is a tub and water there too...how is it is so secure and not toppling over when the child is pushing it? Thanks for answering these questions for those of us that haven't put it together like you have.

             If this is a permanent structure for use over time they surely could have reinforced whatever it is as they seem to have endless money. I remember seeing what really really looks like a sliding shower door with the horizontal towel rack on the front. Those are simply not on drum shields or whatever the stage tool is called.

            I've been thru all the videos and images on WorldCorp recently and yes they are tame by comparison. The images are macabre but nothing to suggest adult or child porn. I have wondered tho if they serve as portals to something else. Most all of the videos are pornographic but amateurish and immature. The Fatherhood and related videos are in a different class entirely meaning the person behind WorldCorp uploaded them from a different source. He seems to be parceling out the material to keep his audience engaged and we are his audience since about Dec 2016.

            Yes 1:14 I agree that is what it looks like it could be. I do believe that is also a shower door.

            I completely agree that it is an audio sound device. The child is not inside a shower stall...he appears to be in a space large enough to pace in and to bang  against an exit door. He bangs against the "shower" door as well where the sound device is situated.Was there not a suggestion some time  ago that the shower doors were in fact glass stage doors frequently used by bands?  Is that what we are seeing in your opinion? Who is Kevin Flynn and how did Worldcorp get its hands on this? Your reference to the gutwrenching aspect of this film footage means that it is real, no? Are you going to reveal more to the Pizzagate community? I have some thoughts on how to get this into the proper law enforcement hands but I'm waiting for some more authentification. I have research on Worldcorp which I'm preparing to post but I will await additional revelations by you.

            P.S. I hear ya when it comes to being sensitive. I'm old school since I'm an oldster and I am quite frankly shocked by both the aggressiveness and profanity/vulgarity all over the Internet. Not that Im a prude it just detracts from the message and shows a lack of critical thinking. When I see it I feel surrounded by junior high kids. Anyway, we all need to get to the bottom of this Fatherhood stuff.

             Actually, I think they mean to be polarizing in that they attempt to get around discussions with people that are more sensitive, and therefore less prone to reason. I find it to be a rather pragmatic solution for fixing interactions with trolls/shills/etc., who seem to give less time to people that can see through their bullshit. For instance, a lot of them use a plethora of loaded words and emotional appeals to persuade. It seems like this is their way to get around that off the bat.

             Also, the vulgar language may serve as a signal to the former.
