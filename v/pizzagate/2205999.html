<p>If you wanna see pizza shit hit the fans of Tony, now\'s the time to take FACT-BASED, &quot;normies loving&quot; infographics like the one attached ( Podestas &amp; McCann - <a href="https://imgtc.com/GrCUkoj">https://imgtc.com/GrCUkoj</a> ),  or the infographics on Podesta emails (include the Wikileaks email ID tags for validity) and add newly surfaced headlines linking &quot;cheese pizza&quot; to child sex abuse and trafficking, like last week\'s Myrtle Beach hotel arrests saving 84 kids, as young as 3 months old. </p>

<p>The only way you\'re going to expose the harsh reality of pizza, Podesta\'s and ping pong to normies who still think &quot;a white confederate hick shot up an innocent family pizza place because he was crazy&quot; is by linking it for them, in a way they can digest it.</p>
<p>Sessions may have recuse himself from &quot;Russia&quot; but REMEMBER WHY I TOLD YOU HE DID. He did so because HE DIDN\'T NEED RUSSIA! Russia nothing more than DEAD-END BULLSHIT, when INVESTIGATED in connection with Trump and they all knew it going in... even Mueller. Remember?! </p>
<p>You learned a year ago that HE WAS THERE FOR URANIUM... guess what?! Mueller knew he was there for it all too and well before y\'all did, via Wikileaks. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST, ALONG WITH HIS BUDDY COMEY, TO JUMP SHIP AND CUT HIMSELF A DEAL IN EXCHANGE FOR INFO!</p>
<p>In the meantime, Sessions/Wray have been investigating and DISMANTILING (((their))) hardly MSM covered but STILL HAPPENING, CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING/SEX CRIME NETWORK, under the general public\'s noses. Sessions and Wray have had MORE WINS THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY! Let me ask you... how\'s ANYONE from the former Obama (Bush, Clinton and Bush Sr., also) gonna answer to all of this?! How will any of (((THEM))) explain their supposed &quot;neglect&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot; to what everyone will realize is an actual fucking EPIDEMIC, bigger than opioids for fucks sake?! Here\'s the answer... they CAN\'T.</p>

<p>Now everyone needs to ignore the ALL of the inevitable shill and slide threads and get on this relentlessly for the next few days! Create it, archive it, use normie-geared meme magic that would spark your own mothers, grandmothers, aunts, etc. interest. Don\'t scare them off with creepy/gore images. Keep it fact-based simple, with &quot;normie verifiable&quot; source links that will interest them enough to do the work. </p>
<p>Remember friends, something is only considered a &quot;crazy conspiracy theory&quot;, until enough rational, educated, verifiable FACTS and CONNECTIONS can be made, to make the perplexed masses, QUESTION IT. PRO TIP! You do NOT need to redpill them. You only need to lead a thirsty horse to water. Only THEY can make themselves drink, you just gotta get them to the water. BRING THEM TO THE WATER. </p>
<p>Know why the &quot;pizzagate&quot; efforts of last year, ultimately failed to &quot;redpill&quot; the majority?! Here\'s why... IT WAS TOO POLITICS DRIVEN. Don\'t waste your meme magic trying to redpill a staunch democrat Hillary supporter/voter, by relating all of your memes and efforts to &quot;democrats&quot; or &quot;Hillary&quot;. IT WON\'T WORK and by now, y\'all already know that. We are so divided as a nation (on purpose thanks to (((them)))) and trying to pin this on Dems or Hillary, via an already politically strained mass, isn\'t a winning option. No one wants to hear it. </p>
<p>Plus, let\'s get real. &quot;Pizza&quot; and all the benefits it provides ALL of (((them))), the dirty &quot;establishment&quot;, is one of the MOST BIPARTISAN things, the swamp agrees and actively colludes together on. </p>
<p>YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS PARENTS! Know what PARENTS don\'t give a one single fuck about when it comes to the safety, security and protection of their children?!? POLITICS. Parents aren\'t democrat or republican BEFORE BEING A PARENT. In fact statistically, most adults agree that they didn\'t give a shit about politics UNTIL THEY HAD KIDS...</p>

<p>No. I told y\'all you\'d never see Hillary herself, going down for pizza.

<p>You all have an opportunity right now, especially coming off Hollywood, to cash in on pizza, using the spotlight and attention the MSM is giving Mueller\'s investigation on Tony P. </p>
<p>NO ONE KNOWS TONY PODESTA unless they were actively paying attention to pizza for the last 18 months.

             Read all her posts and you'll see she didn't. She said the 21st was the deadline Assange had given Meuller to come clean on the Russia investigation. That's all. It's also the Weiner emails she reports are being released, rather than Hillarys.

            I agree with the replies of not using the word pizzagate in the attempt to bombard the masses.   We are not going to turn anybody's head using it, however the words pizza and parents should be used as focal points.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all agree that THE most important issue is the welfare of babies and children and to inform parents of the crimes against these helpless victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            My idea is to initially approach the subject through you tube.  Simply using pizza and children as search words reveals an exorbitant amount of videos and cartoons that send clear messages that something is very f'd-up.  This would certainly open their eyes and cause them to ask questions -  Are my children watching these videos on their tablets?  What is this pizza,connection about?  etc., etc.  Children, videos, cartoons, and pizza.  A good starting point IMO.

            Here's a simple, solemn way to present the "cheese pizza" = "child porn" concept. Rudimentary. Does it need a link or hashtag?

             That's excellent!! Love the simplicity. You could have it like that and have a version with the wikileaks Podesta email link added, and possibly the link to the officer getting charged last week re Cheese Pizza. It's just great on it's own : )

             Plus, let's get real. "Pizza" and all the benefits it provides ALL of (((them))), the dirty "establishment", is one of the MOST BIPARTISAN things, the swamp agrees and actively colludes together on.
YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE IS PARENTS! Know what PARENTS don't give a one single fuck about when it comes to the safety, security and protection of their children?!? POLITICS. Parents aren't democrat or republican BEFORE BEING A PARENT. In fact statistically, most adults agree that they didn't give a shit about politics UNTIL THEY HAD KIDS...

            this is fucking huge.  I've encountered the same problem.  We NEED to be better about politicizing these things.

            We can use that headline regarding the Jersey cop busted to confirm the cheese pizza code to the parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            My sources just said something regarding "connecting Jeffery Epstein to George Bush and also try to connect Tony Blair if possible."
           </p>
           <p>
            Theory based on that: If you can connect Epstein to Bush, you can de-politicize pizzagate into something that BOTH the left and the right are involved in.

            Thanks for posing that question for me! Super awesome. I should do a video breaking down MegaAnon. BELIEVE me - I want this to be legit a real insider and not a LARP. I’m proceeding with caution. Getting memes out is a great idea anyway, regardless of it comes at the behest of an anon from Chan. You rock.

             You're welcome Tracey, it was a great question and we got some great answers clarifying. I'd dearly love to see a video of you breaking down MA, it's a super interesting subject and if true, extremely positive for justice, the world, the children, and for us who have been working on this since last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm with you in hoping it's legit. She's very invested, and either it's intended to distract and wear us down, or she's legit. Let's pray it's the later and let's bring it on. And yes, won't hurt to connect dots between the shady Podestas and the new shady happenings.  Godspeed!!

               Wew, yes it was 404'd. No reason for it to be, it should have been archived by the system as it was a full thread. Idk.. it's all fishy. We're being 'shut down'.

               Check out the artist Biljana Djurdjevic. That's who's art it was, and Tony Podesta is a collector.

            WHAT THE FUCK! Been following this since story broke last October somehow I missed this thread here at VOAT.

            Thread contains many disturbing images of children all mostly archived from a Instagram account of a Jason Kreher, and i quote OP " Jason Kreher who is a Film Director at a global company called Wieden+Kennedy Advertising Agency. He and few other friends who work with him at W+K have some of the most distubing posts i've seen and these guys are all high profile directors who do work with some of the most famous celebrities. "

            With all the happenings concerning Weinstein and PedoWood did anything ever come of this after digging? These are even more sickening than JA Instagram page

            Guys don't forget--if you're going to create memes--you need to include pictures from James Alefantis' Instagram. Nobody seems to mention him anymore and I feel like he's completely fallen off of our radar. Bring him back into the conversation via memes. Even if you can get someone to say "Okay I agree that those pictures are pretty strange," that's a good start. Baby steps. You can't introduce the idea of baby-raping and child snuff films into people's minds right away or the MK Ultra kicks in and they just go into full denial mode. You have to just show them the tip of the iceberg, enough to make them realize "something is clearly going on, and I want to know more."
           </p>
           <p>
            Get people to see how creepy Alefantis is, and then when you connect him to both Hillary and Podesta, and then you connect all of them to creepy emails, creepy art, creepy instagram posts, people will start to see that its a creepy NETWORK, not creepy INDIVIDUALS.

              To clarify, Tony isn't being investigated for pizza but if you start tying him to pizza now, while his name is being thrown around by the MSM, then you can use that with your pizza related archives and tie The "Russia meddling and illegally funded" Podesta Group, being investigated with Tony, to the pizza dealings y'all already proved they funneled dirty, pizza-tied funding/revenue/payments through, a year ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              The MSM just made Tony Podesta a recognized name because Mueller is investigating him in direct connection as co-partnership, with his brother John, to the Podesta Group they own/operated together, to funnel half the backdoor shady Clinton/Obama deals through (Clinton Foundation is the other one they all used, as you know), right?!
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm suggesting y'all use the opportunity the MSM has given you by already telling everyone the Podesta's are being investigated for shady, unfathomable shit, to connect them further, to more shady, unfathomable shit, like pizza. I mean, you have a headline from last week via several credible news outlets confirming a dude looking to sexually abuse young children, referenced pizza and cheese, in his public request for kids to abuse on Craigslist.
             </p>
             <p>
              Connect those dots alone to the normies and you instantly make those once seemingly vague, misunderstood emails of Podestas and everyone else, referencing the same gross as fuck shit with "pizza maps" left behind and "pastas being questioned a year later that were given last Christmas as a gift in a big box from an unidentifiable sender" start looking pretty fucking weird to even the most normal of normies, no?!

            Memes created the anti-vax movement. Is that really a good idea? Personally I would prefer NOT to get measles because some stupid white chick thinks it causes autism.

              As long as you include at least one relevant link, so it satisfies the submission rules. Here's an explanation of how to do it:

               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1826522

               @fuspezza
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              And BTW:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Millennial_Falcon">
               @Millennial_Falcon
              </a>
              is a fan of meme warfare. We tried to get some rolling a while back, but it never quite reached translational lift.

               Hi. I came across this site a couple of months ago and have been kind of following you guys because I agree with a lot of what you all believe. I just wanted to give a suggestion and it's just a suggestion. Maybe you shouldn't even use the #pedogate because it will most likely it will instantly turn off a lot of people and they won't read anything else you have to say. Maybe use something simple like #Sexual, Physical and Psychological abuse. Then once you've grabbed their attention, gradually spoon feed the rest. I would leave any kind of personal religious beliefs out of the narrative and just stick with the facts.

                Since they succeeded with the Harvey Weinstein distraction, use it to your advantage and take it a few more steps. Women aren't the only people who suffer from abuse but so do men and so do children.

               Do BOTH!  "Pizza" is the CODE WORD USED!! It is important to keep the Pizza Context!!  I get it,  Comet Ping Pong MIGHT be a controlled opposition so leave comet out of the memes but "Pizza" MUST be included!!

            I agree! While these Hollywood perverts are being exposed and how the Podesta's are now under investigation, now is a great time to go full force again with memes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do NOT think we should use Pizzagate as a hashtag tho. Maybe pedogate. The term Pizzagate is just going to make us look like conspiracy theorists because of how the media has portrayed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What do you guys think of also using #ToldYouSo as well as #pedogate? So people get that what we've been saying has been real all along. Any other ideas?

             I posted in comments this morning that people love pizza and don't want us to make fun of it, but the word pedo is detested.  The elites do not want us putting the word out there.  They much rather us use pizza.  They know it is instantly perceived as CT.  It is sad, but they have made it into a joke.

             Excellent srayzie, cheers! I agree too, we should go for it! I don't know about hashtags, maybe we should just hijack the trending hashes so we're not in an echo chamber, tagging Hillary and Sessions and the MSM?

               Not trying to be mean because the info itself is great but something like this can't be on a cartoon-like pizza background. It makes it look invalid, less serious, pretty cheesy (no pun intended).
              </p>
              <p>
               This is also why the pizzagate hashtag never really worked or trended with normies, in the intended way and by the time it was changed to #pedogate it was far too late, the potential public's appeal and interests had already been diverted to something else.
              </p>
              <p>
               Simple white/black/gray backgrounds with bold prints and plain, AP style fonts work great. They have to look "in the box", for the masses who're still stuck, "thinking in the box".

              That makes a lot of sense. Hashtags are what makes things spread tho and get fellow pizzagaters there on board. I wish we could all come up with something so we can all find each other's tweets and retweet. Or Facebook. I'm not into that much but I am twitter. But, I agree, leave pizza out of it.

              It’s me! Haha I love you too! I was posting here quite frequently a year or so ago, but got tired of all the nasty people with nothing productive to offer. I’ve been just a lurker ever since, but this particular exchange prompted a response. I’m not sold on this Anon. She’s made quite a few major errors in her last few posts- namely that Lynch recused herself. That’s a pretty good screw up for someone supposedly so connected. This just stinks because she was literally telling us not to focus on “Pizza” and now all of a sudden it’s “FOCUS ON PIZZA!!”

              Thanks for your compliments. Means a lot to me.

             Hey Tracey :) good to see you! I disagree with you here though! She was saying that Hillary wouldn't GO DOWN for Pizza, but that she would go down.

              I think we are both right here- she made a point to BEG people not to focus on Pizza. This is a little bit of a shift. Don’t like it :(

               I asked your question to her in the /pol thread and she answered. Did you see? I feel that she's on our side or she wouldn't be asking us to meme Podesta / Pizza stuff, non? Imho we're all working with a dynamic situation and have to go with what we have to our best advantage. Here's what she said back then anyway ---

            Normies need a connection between Talmud, the Satanic Panic of the 80's and these people.  A lot of older generations will speak up if this connection is made and the Evangelicals who harassed citizen investigators back then can help rectify that mistake now
