            I actually liked the young pope and I'm catholic.  There was a very in your face over the top and unnecessary sex scene but other than that, it ended well.  I was very uneasy watching it abd thought fur sure they'd push an antiChrist agenda, but they actually didn't.  It was really interesting to watch how they "spun" it for lack of a better word.  My take away was that the young pope is the type of pope we need - back to the hard core teachings, yet loving at the same time.  So sick of these PC popes in cohoots with the globalists.  The young pope was not that.  For those that only saw the beginning episodes, he ends up being kind ;) (I'm not THAT pro fire and brimstone-- he ends up warm)

            Don't people know who runs Hollywood (CIA west) by now?

            Deicide is a tough act to follow but they really keep trying and it's not over yet.

            My rant: If anyone studies ecclesiology, they will learn that the Latin Church is a corrupt creation of early (((bankers))) culminating in their schism from the true church in 1054, so it is a very new "church". Since it dominates the west, people here are deceived. The original Christian Church still exists (and the gates of hell will not prevail against it). The Latin church was founded for the purpose of looting the Holy Land (sound familiar?), and the fourth crusade was against the Orthodox Christian Church and Constantinople was looted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The corruption, materialism, and vice in the Latin Church is so rife that people were sick of the money grabbing, wars, etc. even in the sixteenth century, so they invented the Protestant church which is just a heresy derived from a heresy--hardly even Christian at all. But I digress.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Remember, the Latin Church has a Rothschild bank, it's own currency, embassies (spies and traffickers) in many countries, it's own intelligence service and military. It is in a tiny extremely wealthy country of it's own and issues it's own passports--one way to protect their world wide pedo organization. They were castrating boys until the early 20th century, ostensibly so they could sing soprano in their churches. God only knows what else. They distorted the theology of the church Fathers, Changed the creed and reduced the Divine Liturgy to a fifteen minute parody. they distorted the theology of the Church Fathers, even to the point of turning Mary Magdalene into a prostitute (there is nothing whatever in the Bible which says that). They have an army of ignorant followers who do not even know that the true church still exists, so they defend the false one, or even become atheist. At least 1/3 of millenials are atheists, so the subject of the show is rather lost on them.

            There have been 150 Jewish popes (some popes were not even priests) and the one in this series is no exception. As a youth , John Paul II played soccer with the Jewish league against Catholics (his mother, a Polish Jew).

            One of his mistresses was a Polish woman who lived in VT and when he came to the US, he used to go camping with her. There are some photos of this in this article about his love letters:

            Marina Abramovic, the Satanist witch and leader of degenerates, is constantly promoted in all media, especially since her ethnicity was changed from "Jewish" to "Serbian" in her Wikipedia entry back in early November. There is no Serbian Christian who would have a last name that means "son of Abraham".
           </p>
           <p>
            After Wikileaks released emails involving Abramovic's apparently satanic rituals (which she calls "performance art") her Wikipedia article was edited. The segment "She herself is of Jewish ethnicity." was changed to "She herself is of Serbian ethnicity."
           </p>
           <p>
            Archived before the change:

            Well, for one thing there are people who spend their days changing Wikipedia entries to suit their agenda, and not just dual citizens either. The NYPD was caught editing Wikipedia entries of police brutality victims, including Eric Garner:

            It's like people believing the propaganda that Stalin was Georgian. He changed his name to Stalin (which means 'steel') from Djugashvilli, which in English is "son of a Jew", or like Jewison - as in Norman Jewison.

            I found that strange but i think it was merely coincidental.  The pope mentions banksy which is irrelevant to all this since banksy is subversive. Koons and abromobitch

            Not a bad video, but then the bitch slap of Trump and the pimping of George Webb ... not sure why that was included except that everyone has an agenda. Would really appreciate if videographers/pizzagate chroniclers/journalists/theorists would stick to the subjects they're addressing and not get into Dyncorp and Feinberg's relationship with the POTUS. It would have been more pertinent to establish Dyncorp's relationship with either Hollywood, the actors in this debacle, or the producers of this series given the context. Whatever. For what there was, an Upvoat.

             "Not a bad video, but then the bitch slap of Trump and the pimping of George Webb ... not sure why that was included except that everyone has an agenda."

             So glad you posted that, QK!  I had stopped watching the vid at the Keaton T-shirt scene.  After reading your post, I went back to watch the rest of it.

             Agreed; adherence to the topic at hand is necessary.  I had already written off the SGT Report after watching another video in which he states emphatically that the Knights Templars (Freemasons) are the "GOOD GUYS."  That guy most DEFINITELY has an agenda.

             The George Webb worship seems pandemic around PG.  It's like a disease.

            Crazy, I watched that episode and missed that Marina reference along with JEFF KOONS (Pedo artist).  The push of this crap makes me sick. I watched two episodes and was done. The entire show oozed an evil vibe. Those unfamiliar here's the website
