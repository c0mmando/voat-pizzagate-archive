            Good post.  The elite cult of sociopathy.  They believe that their sociopathic lack of empathy and compassion is what gives them the 'divine right to rule'.  Intelligent and high-achieving sociopaths in all sectors of industry/academia/government are actively sought out and recruited into this cult, which organizes itself and operates through hierarchies seperated into different "secret societys" such as skull and bones, bohemian grove, masonry, etc, etc.  It's like the compartmentalization of the cia or military, and is a very efficient structure.   The main thing to remember is they worship the owl and it's "far-sight" and cold stare.  They relate with it, because of their distance from their own humanity via their sociopathic lack of empathy and compassion for others.  They think of themselves as good people, just "different" or better equipped to make the "hard choices" that humanity must face in order to survive and thrive.  It's the same justification behind slavery, behind genocide, behind eugenics, behind instigating a "pre-emptive" war.   What they will never admit is that they aren't all knowing, that alot of the economic crisis they use to justify their evil acts, are a direct result from THEIR failed policies and THEIR personal flaws and shortcomings. But admitting imperfection, to these malignant narcissists (psych term), is akin to a personal hell for them.  Look at how Hillary and her cult re-acted to losing.  Blaming everyone but themselves, even though THEY made the mistake of cheating the PRIMARY, which is SUPPOSED to be a process to find the most MERITABLE candidate, aka the one most likely to win the general.  By cheating the primary they shot themselves in the foot, but they will never ever admit it, because "they are so wise and far-seeing and smart and intelligent", according to their own narcissism.

             Remember how they found the password protected page on Comet Ping Pong Pizza's website? Well it wasn't accessible through the main site, you need a specific URL for it or an understanding of how to navigate the page to find a hidden page, data etc. I believe that because the same person "Dave Flintstone" made both sites as well as the island distillery page that he would include the same general structure. Look at the Daveflintstone.com website and look at how pointless it would seem as there is nothing to access, unless of course, there is encrypted data or a hidden door. A backdoor is another way to access coded information at the same domain. I believe this is the case of drpong.net with its pedo-symbolism and the oddness of Mr. Potato picture at the first site. Im researching another lead on this that I'm getting ready to post soon. theres definitely something here.

              But there's a login thing you can click.. you don't think that we just need to crack a un/password for this? I'm not doubting you at all...I'm just wondering if it's a possibility that a specific un/password could be used to access everything... because yes, from the looks of the daveflintstone.com page, it does seem completely pointless- unless like you said, there's a backdoor or a specific set of info for people "in the know" to use to be able to gain access. Have you (or anyone else) tried to bruteforce either page?

               I have not run a brute force yet but i totally see what you're saying and I agree. Right now Im finishing writing up what I have on the connections and you guessed it... The Clinton Foundation.

              Just to play devils advocate, many webpages are now created using CMS (content management systems) which usually have a login page that takes you to a control panel.

             A backdoor in this context is a concealed login page that has some hidden content. Typically login pages are unlisted URLs that people manually type in, such as www.website.com/wp-admin.php (obviously, you as a site administrator wouldn't want every Joe Blow logging into your site and changing things).
