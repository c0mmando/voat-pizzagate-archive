            Well Alex Jones is still lying. That is clear, his recent videos show more lies. No doubt he's covering his tracks over the shooting. Seems that the guy who went and shot-up the comet-pizza was an Alex Jones listener. Remember when last week Alex Jones was crying about the "CHILDREN"?
           </p>
           <p>
            [ WHY do I say Alex-Jones is STILL LYING, well he just said today "10,000 mentions of pizza in podesta email", no Alex Jones, there are 18 mentions of pizza in the entire 55,000 emails, well a week ago Alex Jones said there were 100,000 references to pizza in podesta wikileaks dump, so Alex Jones is slowly coming to earth based reality. Hell  YES Alex Jones is responsible for the shooting in DC. ]
           </p>
           <p>
            Then 3 days ago A-Jones said "Pizzagate was all rumors", ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Then yesterday the gun-men, who said he went inside to find children, where he found none, well we all know this place is only open at night, there would have been no customers there at 3pm, just workers doing the prep. So of course there was no children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones knows he's in DEEP SHIT, A-JONES has been orchestrating the witch-hunt on James Alefantis all along,
           </p>
           <p>
            Bigg's probably quit because NOBODY WANTS TO BE ON THE TITANIC WHEN IT GOES DOWN.
           </p>
           <p>
            More interesting is why did MILO go silent? Me think's he's been offered his own show, ... watch to see if BIGGS joins MILO for their own CIA limited hang-out show, as most of the worst shills I have seen have been these smooth talking MI5 shills from the UK, the USA loves to bring them in something about the British accent hypnotizes the alt-right tards, and toss in the gay to boot, makes you want to vomit.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Has Alex Jones ever said anything other than the little people? Has he ever investigated on his show Andrew Kline? DOJ?
           </p>
           <p>
            We started this mention of SAUDI/DUBAI owning the PIZZAGATE franchise two days ago and all hell broke loose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones has lost the narrative, Bigg's is probably dead or hiding, he knows the deep state is coming in to 'damage control'. I think the reason MILO was silenced is they're taking two steps back to develop a new narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't be surprised to see MILO &amp; James Alefantis dating in public in the coming weeks, all this shit is circus and these players are laughing their ass off behind the Saudi owned curtain.

            Likely cease and dissist letters went out from the legal team.   They got the PR team on board yesterday as well.   This is the counter offensive.  MSM, legal system, threats.   Shut down the heat.
