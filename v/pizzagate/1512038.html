            This article took me 30 second, but really 5 seconds after I figured out how to get rid out the intrusive ads. 5 seconds to realize it was bullshit. Please bring facts not bulshit propaganda. I usually don't post comments like this but I feel this link is worth no more than an entry into the logs of weird hit pieces that later connections may explain. It's a MSM hit piece.

            This article is extremely disingenuous, from the same corporate whore media who have tried desperately to propagandise the last election with the most incredible one-sided sensationalist nonsense ever seen. The number of hit piece articles based on very dubious testimonies many of which later turned out to be patently false.
           </p>
           <p>
            The article makes out that Trump wishes to censor a free press to protect himself and the billionaire class. What bunk. It's an inversion of reality which is a common tool the Elites use. The MSM is the one who is pushing for mass censorship of social media and the alternative media, backing Obamas calls for (essentially) a state run Ministry of Truth, which is why they are pushing this Fake News narrative to justify it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What Trump wishes to do is to make journalists accountable for the articles they publish. If you are going to try and sway an election with stories with very little evidence to back them up, based on verbal testimonies of people who 'suddenly' come out of the woodwork and make allegations of events that supposedly happened 20-30 years ago (which had no witnesses, never made a police complaint at the time, and is completely verbal) - then you should be open to being sued for putting out unsubstantiated allegations which Could alter an election.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many of the stories which came out would never have been published if it was some random celeb and someone just came with some story. No. A proper journalist would say "I can never publish this unless you can give me some evidence, a witness, proof of times and dates.. my career is not worth it."
           </p>
           <p>
            What you saw during the last election is a complete abandonment of this principle, because the owners and heads of such media outlets had a vested political interest in the outcome of the election and abandoned all principles of journalistic integrity.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are not prepared to back your story up in a court of law then you shouldn't be running it, as it is reckless and potentially ruins lives and alters elections. To allow the "free press" (a laughable assertion since they are all Establishment / Globalist run) - complete carte blanche to publish any old rubbish is to give the MSM - unelected, unaccountable and often foreign owned - a level of power which is hard to quantify.

             Yeah it's ridiculous that people can live the opposite and still believe it when the MSM makes a case for the opposite of reality. Look at what is happening and who is pushing it. The people that are pointing fingers at trump are the very ones that are attacking free press. The only attacks trump have made on the press was because the press was electioneering. Trump supports a more free press one that is not all owned by the same group of people.

             Thiel didn't public support Trump, until this past July meeting he attended, and when he returned they told them they had picked Trump.
