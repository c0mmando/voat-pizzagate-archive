<p>Brad Pitt’s old flame Neri Oxman has become embroiled in the uncomfortable Jeffrey Epstein scandal, according to The Boston GlobeOpens a New Window.. Oxman, 43, an architect and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has admitted to speaking to Epstein — after which he donated thousands of dollars to her Media Lab...</p>
<p>..the Globe has reported that Oxman presented her research and discussed her work before potential benefactor Epstein in a secret MIT meeting in October 2015. The convicted sex offender visited then-MIT director Joi Ito’s office where well-known architect and designer Oxman, whose work has been featured at the Smithsonian Institution, said she was among those who spoke.</p>
<p>She discussed her research on how art, science, engineering, and design work together and brought small-scale models of her sculptures. Ito and another senior MIT professor were also present. ...Epstein clearly was convinced as her lab called Mediated Matter then received $125,000 from him over the years. Epstein’s donations to MIT were kept secret—until now. Oxman told The Globe in a statement, “This is the first and only time I met Epstein. Joi assured me that Epstein was an approved donor who wished to devote his fortune to science and technology, in part to make amends for wrongs he committed earlier in his life.”</p>
<p>After the meeting, Oxman said Ito twice asked her to write notes thanking Epstein for his contributions. Although also invited to dine with Epstein, Oxman said she declined. However, in 2017, Ito asked that Oxman’s design lab send Epstein a printed marble object as a gift...</p>

<p>Well, as we now know, when the CIA experimented with LSD and MKUltra techniques, they would film men interacting with prostitutes to observe  male behaviour. If Wexner and Charney were involved with the deep state they would have had access to that information.

            "Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell last month where he was awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking minors. His death was ruled a suicide." Is our "Free Press" required by law to include this line in every story? From Prince Andy and his mum, laughing hilariously on their way to church, down to the most ill-informed peasant, nobody believes that. Our Deep State and "Intelligence Community" are such known liars that if they said Epstein was in fact extracted and is sunning himself on the shore of the Dead Sea, we conspiracy theorists (or truth tellers) would go, "That's insane. Any reasonable person knows he committed suicide. They're just saying that to throw us off."

            The Institute was founded with a $125 million gift to Harvard from Hansjörg Wyss. In 2013, Hansjörg Wyss doubled his gift to $250 million and in 2019 he donated $131 million.
           </p>

            Yep, that same Hansjörg Wyss we have talked about frequently.

            Friendly reminder: Harvard also took Epstein's dirty money.
