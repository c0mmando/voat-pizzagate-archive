<hr />
<p>Now that we\'ve cleared away the worst of HLI\'s sockpuppets, we can discuss my project: What is the Clinton machine most afraid of, and how can I use their disinfo to trick them into exposing things?</p>
<p>I had three ideas that might get a reaction. The first was the video of Glenn Beck announcing a whistleblower who could bring the government down -- followed by him being bullied into silence. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1770744">I posted about this in April</a>, tying the mystery to elite child sex trafficking. I was not the first person to do that, as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1440917">this post</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/188495057">this video</a> show. But I thought I might expose more of the story.</p>
<p>If I provoked a reaction, it wouldn\'t be obvious. HLI wouldn\'t start telling people, &quot;Ignore those rumors about Glenn Beck.&quot; It would be subtle. But more than a month went by and I didn\'t see anything compelling.</p>
<p>So I tried different bait. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1856593">I posted about it here: the Wisconsin recount</a>. While the rest of the state showed no big discrepancies, the recount in Milwaukee was never finished. Each day there were thousands of additional votes in error between the machines and the hand count, and the machine total favored Hillary. The total gap was looking like around 50,000 votes. Then Milwaukee declared that it could not finish for various reasons, and by state rules, they certified the original machine count for Milwaukee.</p>
<p>As Bev Harris explained to Alex Jones, this was evidence of a last-minute panic. The Clinton camp hadn\'t rigged the vote, because they believed their own polls. Only on election night had they made the desperate choice to rig a jurisdiction with paper ballots. But the rural counties had already reported in, and they could only alter Milwaukee, and it wasn\'t enough.</p>
<p>Now, one obvious clue is that <a href="https://voat.co/user/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt">@Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt</a>, despite posting every day about freemasons and Rothschilds, has never said a word about the recount, Jill Stein, electronic voting machines, or Milwaukee. All of HLI\'s alts stayed away from that thread, except <a href="https://voat.co/user/fogdryer">@fogdryer</a>, a big supporter of <a href="https://voat.co/user/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt">@Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt</a>. He didn\'t mention this big Wisconsin news. Instead he helped derail the discussion by saying that it was &quot;all over the web&quot; that Mike Pence was a pedo.</p>
<p>HLI and Senate Anon have said that Trump was 20 or 30 points ahead. I won\'t list reasons why this can\'t be true. Just ask yourself why they\'d lie. Doesn\'t it hurt Hillary to say how unpopular she was? Yes. But it implies that they saw defeat coming a long way off. It diverts attention away from the rigging being last-minute. I posted about Milwaukee on May 13th. Then, lo and behold -- HLI joined Voat a week later, on May 20th, and started trying to steer the research effort. I had my reaction.</p>
<p>Next problem: Suppose HLI is running a bunch of sockpuppets. How can you prove that he\'s working for Brock? My third idea was that at some point I had to talk about James Alefantis\' crimes. The child porn on the Comet server; the death threats against Ryan O\'Neal and his family; the rape of his teenaged employee.</p>
<p>I wasn\'t sure how HLI would respond if I did that. He would have been smart not to. It\'s such a well-traveled topic by now. But I hoped that Jimmy Comet might get mad at me personally. The thing about a guy who sells children and rapes teenage boys is that he has predictable vulnerabilities, like poor impulse control and a need to punish people who disrespect him. The exchange he had with Ryan shows this clearly. </p>
<p>However, Internet traffic on these topics peaked in January, when his rape victim gave an AMA. There weren\'t many threads about it any more, and I couldn\'t address the topic without being too obvious. June went by with nothing suitable, and July. Then in early August I got lucky. For a few weeks, there had been a rise in discussions of Jimmy\'s crimes around the Web:</p>
<p>July 1: Alefantis (or someone posing as him) posts on /pol/ that he wants people to stop accusing him of rape.</p>
<p>July 4: The Liberty Columnist interviews Titus Frost about the Comet server</p>
<p>July 11: Jamie Dlux puts up a Pegasus Museum walkaround.</p>
<p>and so on. Meanwhile HLI was increasingly dissatisfied with his efforts to take control of the research effort here. He had made a dozen posts about the Jesters and Adams Morgan, but none of them had gotten much traction so far. So he killed two birds with one stone, posting<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2015969"> a big emotional attention-getting rant</a> on July 24th. This told me they were still watching.</p>
<p>Then on August 4, <a href="https://voat.co/user/AmyJames">@AmyJames</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2038598">posted about Alefantis\' &quot;Freudian slip,&quot;</a> and I could get in and make my points. One point that people especially liked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while we\'re tediously sifting through LARPers and Sorcha Fail and endless clickbaity crap ... guess what? <strong>Alefantis is doing the same thing. He\'s reading all those false leads because there\'s nobody he can trust to do it for him.</strong> And he\'s not actually very good at it. This is way outside his skill set, even when he isn\'t drunk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was about doing things in the right order. Clearly Jimmy can\'t read every post about him by Pizzagaters. Even if he did read mine, he might still not respond. But if I was already under close watch by Brock\'s guy HLI, then Jimmy would likely be told about me dissing his Internet skills. That would upset him far more than if I was some random anon. So I had to make sure that they were watching me before trying it, yet make it seem that I was not deliberately pushing the topic.</p>
<p>Clearly, it was not a foolproof plan. But Jimmy did show up eventually. </p>
<p>First, though, they got even more impatient. By now I had ignored the year-old ROJ/SOBIB clues they were dangling for about three months. On 9/11 HLI created Senate Anon, who launched his first visit to /pol/ by declaring that Mike Pence and Paul Ryan are traitors. Toward the end of that visit, after much pleading by anons, he shared the ever-so-secret ROJ/SOBIB info. He also said, &quot;keep digging on Racine&quot;.</p>
<p>The same day, HLI\'s sockpuppet <a href="https://voat.co/user/ababcb">@ababcb</a> posted that Senate Anon was &quot;risking his life&quot; to bring us this info. As that stirred excitement here, I pitched in with a couple of posts. But then I went back to working on NCMEC and other things. So at that point, they decided to add the Sarasota airport connection and see if that motivated me to move back to SOBIB. Unfortunately, as I said in my Day 4 post, HLI screwed up the execution on that. In his 9/18 post, sockpuppet <a href="https://voat.co/user/ababcb">@ababcb</a> didn\'t credit either HLI or Senate Anon, he just blurted out that John Stafford runs Sarasota airport. HLI had also neglected to make Senate Anon say anything about Sarasota. This was the sort of blunder I had been hoping to generate all along.</p>
<p>I went to work on Sarasota, and actually did find stuff. It seems clear that HLI then reported to Brock that I had taken the bait, and Brock told Jimmy; or maybe HLI told Jimmy directly. I know it was one or the other, because a few days later (9/28), <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2140225">Jimmy Comet got good and stoned and came to razz me about it</a>, in my latest Sarasota thread.</p>
<p>Oh, Jimmy. HLI makes mistakes when he\'s tired and in a hurry. He has thousands of investigators to try and outwit, and he was bound to stumble somewhere. But you had one job, and it was <strong>to keep your whore mouth shut!</strong> Here\'s the text of Jimmy\'s posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sobib is a <strong>masonic</strong> order</p>
<p>into whatever it goes</p>
<p><strong>clap clap</strong></p>
<p>remove this submission mods and insult op for stepping in blood..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey guys friendly reminder that if you want to have even a sugar coated discussion of a private mens luxury community then prepare to have this submission deleted as we have made sure a-la rule number one has been arranged. No more discussion.</p>
<p>yay a little airplane good for you keep it to human trafficking not the richest charity in the world. My dad is a shriner and he will get the call of duty guys to stop this fake news bullshit. I love when the little people try and explain pure excellence and tip toe around themselves like furniture! Alas we have seen the nimble profane. Good for you get back to digging on tavistock and such you nothings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So many clues here! I had mocked him for not knowing what &quot;mods&quot; are, so Jimmy made sure to use the word correctly in a sentence. He figured out <strong>how to use the boldface type</strong>, too! He can\'t help showing his arrogance, calling us &quot;little people&quot; and &quot;nothings&quot;. (That\'s not really a clue, except to his identity.) There\'s a hint at how nervous they were about my skills, and how relieved to have diverted me. That\'s what he means when he says, &quot;Alas we have seen the nimble profane.&quot; </p>
<p>But <strong>the big giveaway is how pleased he is to find me working hard on Sarasota. &quot;Good for you,&quot; he says. &quot;Good for you.&quot;</strong> Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, stoned-out slave auctioneer Jimmy Comet. You are a cartoon villain.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear: Jimmy\'s blunder doesn\'t change the main thrust of my investigation. We still haven\'t gotten to the really big stuff yet. But it does draw a thick, black line connecting HLI to Brock. This is an important secondary goal. And because Jimmy didn\'t inform HLI of this little indiscretion, he also gave me something good to mess with HLI\'s head in a crucial moment on Day 3. </p>
<p>Plus it\'s freaking hilarious. I\'m still laughing a month later.</p>
<p>Tomorrow\'s topic will be a surprise. No teaser.</p>',

           So many clues here! I had mocked him for not knowing what "mods" are, so Jimmy made sure to use the word correctly in a sentence. He figured out
           <strong>
            how to use the boldface type
           </strong>
           , too! He can't help showing his arrogance, calling us "little people" and "nothings". (That's not really a clue, except to his identity.) There's a hint at how nervous they were about my skills, and how relieved to have diverted me. That's what he means when he says, "Alas we have seen the nimble profane."
          </p>
          <p>
           But
           <strong>
            the big giveaway is how pleased he is to find me working hard on Sarasota. "Good for you," he says. "Good for you."
           </strong>
           Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, stoned-out slave auctioneer Jimmy Comet. You are a cartoon villain.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, to be clear: Jimmy's blunder doesn't change the main thrust of my investigation. We still haven't gotten to the really big stuff yet. But it does draw a thick, black line connecting HLI to Brock. This is an important secondary goal. And because Jimmy didn't inform HLI of this little indiscretion, he also gave me something good to mess with HLI's head in a crucial moment on Day 3.

            Why does it matter if Senate Anon passed information off as their own or not? This is what I mean when I say nothing you say makes sense and that nobody can figure out what your point is. Seriously, WHAT IS YOUR POINT when you say that he "passed off information as insider stuff"? How is this negative and how does this discredit the idea that shady stuff is going on in Racine, Adams Morgan, Sarasota, etc.?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is classic gaslighting. Your posts are designed to distract and confuse, nothing else. You are trying to stop citizen investigations into Racine, Adams Morgan, and Sarasota. Why?

            The amount of effort going into discrediting Senate Anon/HLI is remarkable, especially given how the Senate Anon threads are not very well known outside of the Voat community. Most people I see who know about pizzagate have never heard of Senate Anon, so to see this much effort put into gaslighting makes me believe Senate Anon when he said "3. Arrests have been made based on threads like this and HTG. Many good cops are now posting in these threads."

             And of course you're not explaining how you came up with the fact that the head of SOBIB runs the Sarasota airport, while Senate Anon has never so much as mentioned Sarasota. Still nothing from you on that. Are you an insider too? Did you forget to tell us that part?

             My surmise an hour ago was right on the money, wasn't it? Brock the paranoid's paranoid compartmentalizes his operation ... so he never told you precisely what secret you were protecting. That explains a lot. So our relationship is evolving. I've been giving you too much credit. Now apparently you're going to have to rely on hints from me to figure out what is going on.

              ever did was copy and paste information back and forth between Voat and 8chan. Secondly, I do not believe it is true that Senate Anon has never mentioned Sarasota. After people began investigating the SOBIB directory a random anon using TOR pointed out that the head of SOBIB ran the Sarasota airport. Here is that post:

              Here are the posts in that thread that are presumed to be Senate Anon because Senate Anon was posting in that thread with TOR.

              This poster may not be Senate Anon, but he is using TOR. Either way, it's irrelevant because it's true that  illegal things are going on in Sarasota.

               , HLI, and Senate Anon (plus minor walk-on characters). That's not the least bit confusing. It's either true or it's not, but nobody is confused about what I said.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are still plenty of people reading this thread who are on the fence ... they want to believe I'm the real deal and that we've finally had a big breakthrough. But they have been manipulated so much, been disappointed so often, that they're having trouble trusting anything they read. That's not quite the same as being confused. They're being properly cautious.
              </p>
              <p>
               And yes, for several days I certainly have been trying to confuse
               <em>
                you
               </em>
               , or more precisely, to prod you into making revealing mistakes. I kind of thought we were done with that phase, as I remarked to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/oftotc">
                @oftotc
               </a>
               a few hours ago. But I've been forced to re-evaluate that idea, because you (meaning
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt">
                @Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt
               </a>
               ) have stuck so doggedly and single-mindedly to the Racine story.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, there was bound to be a bit of a problem in my mocking your/WIC's constant refrain of Racine and Paul Ryan, because we haven't gotten to that aspect of the story yet. That was going to be Day 8 material. I was mocking you for it in anticipation of a big reveal later, and trusting that readers would be willing to wait a little while for the full story. But you/WIC have been so clueless in your responses, it made me wonder out loud if I had been assuming more knowledge on your part than you really have. And minutes after I said that, suddenly I was no longer arguing with WIC, I was arguing with
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ababcb">
                @ababcb
               </a>
               , who has been missing for two days. It's kind of revealing to those who are still on the fence.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I'll say this now: Paul Ryan is the actual target of WIC's constant Racine-Racine-Racine babble. The goal is to discredit him, to isolate him from potential allies, to cast doubt on anything he says or does, to fill the Internet with second-hand and third-hand references to Paul Ryan being a traitor. All the things that WIC says about the Rothschilds, the Council of 13, and so on, are side plays designed to draw in his conspiracy-minded audience and make his true intention harder to spot. While Ryan is WIC's target, Ryan is not the only target, and I will explain why he was made a target on Day 8.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I guess if Brock really does compartmentalize his disinfo function, then you'll be finding out why on Day 8 along with everyone else.

              <p>
               Oh, no, it isn't irrelevant. The original charge I made was that HLI borrows the work of real researchers and passes it off as "insider" stuff. No matter how you rationalize on their behalf, HLI and Senate Anon both blatantly misrepresented the info they were sharing. They conned us. But when I said that, you came at me with a blizzard of wild accusations, that I wanted people to stop real-life investigations altogether (false), or that I wanted people to stop investigating Adams Morgan (also false), that I wanted to divert attention from Sarasota (really false as I did high-quality research on it), that I was shilling for the pedos, and so on. Then I put you in the hotseat for claiming that Senate Anon "risked his life" and for claiming that Senate Anon "came back" with the Sarasota info, when neither claim was true. You then vanished for two days, and didn't come back until moments after I pointed out your absence.
              </p>
              <p>
               And now your defense is that a random anon generated the Sarasota lead, and that you knew it was really Senate Anon in disguise because he was using TOR.

               Dude, you just don't act like a guy who has been accidentally swept up in a sockpuppet hunt. You're massively over-invested in defending these phony "insiders" and casting doubt on my arguments. There are other people who raise reasonable questions about one aspect or another of what I've said, and when they do, I address them. But you're in a class by yourself.

               </p>
               <p>
                So then if you are here to Save everyone, what is the real agenda if not global enslavement, and who is really involved if not the Council of 13 and others we have listed continuously?
               </p>
               <p>
                We have been crystal clear from the beginning and we only post the Truth. You are not a credible source on Racine or anything elae we have posted about.
               </p>
               <p>
                Start over with our Truth about Racine as the basis for a real investigation. We do not vouch for HLI. We disagree with much of what US Senate Anon claimed, but he know that he recognizes the Truth we have been telling about Racine, Wisconsin and the real agenda.
               </p>
               <p>
                What is your objective and motive? Ours is the Truth and working with anyone else who is interested in Saving the world from criminal corruption and eternal enslavement.

                Again, you have not provided any evidence and everyone is confused by your longwinded and disorganized posts. As I pointed out, the ONLY thing people can gather from any of your posts is that HLI is "working for David Brock" which you have provided both 0 evidence and no reasoning for. You just claim that it's true and then go on a long, gaslighting tangent.

                 Oh, no, it isn't irrelevant. The original charge I made was that HLI borrows the work of real researchers and passes it off as "insider" stuff. No matter how you rationalize on their behalf, HLI and Senate Anon both blatantly misrepresented the info they were sharing. They conned us.

               <p>
                So what? Who cares and why does it matter if they passed the information off as their own or not? This is what I mean when I say nothing you say makes sense and that nobody can figure out what your point is. Seriously, WHAT IS YOUR POINT when you say that he "passed off information as insider stuff"? How is this negative and how does this discredit the idea that shady stuff is going on in Racine, Adams Morgan, Sarasota, etc.?
               </p>
               <p>
                This is classic gaslighting. Your posts are designed to distract and confuse, nothing else.

               <p>
                I am not even close to being as invested in this as you are, lol. You plan on making long winded posts for at least eight days straight and one little reply from me sets you off on a post like this? You've got your work cut out for you if that's the case. I'll be poking you with short statements in every single thread you make, forcing you to write out extremely long posts like this one. You WILL respond, exactly like this, every single time, because you're paid for it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, you make wild speculation and accusation, refuse to ever back them up with concrete facts and are extremely invested in getting people to stop looking at anything and everything Senate Anon tells us to look at. What possible reason could there be for it to be such a big deal if someone is researching info they obtained from Senate Anon/HLI?

                 So I'll say this now: Paul Ryan is the actual target of WIC's constant Racine-Racine-Racine babble. The goal is to discredit him, to isolate him from potential allies, to cast doubt on anything he says or does, to fill the Internet with second-hand and third-hand references to Paul Ryan being a traitor.

                Why is this a bad thing? I think you're a shill who works for Paul Ryan, not David Brock.

                 For anyone who has not noticed it's all about him. We do not tell the Truth for our own credit. We feel an absolute obligation to the world to share the Truth that we know, because everyone's lives and souls are at stake.

                <p>
                 Anyone who says "don't look into Racine" or other legitimate leads should be questioned with a high degree of skepticism, particularly when they are not a credible source on the topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Paul Ryan is a criminal and traitor and should be treated as such. David Brock is also a criminal. They are middle men to a much bigger and more powerful network.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Does anyone really trust Paul Ryan or David Brock? Even James Alefantis doesn't trust David Brock.

               Paul Ryan is never getting arrested. Timothy Dolan is never getting arrested. Reince Priebus is not getting arrested. Tom DeLonge is not getting arrested. Evan McMullin is not getting arrested. Message us when any big arrests happen in Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               The swamp cannot and will not be drained in our corrupt system. Paul Ryan is guarding the swamp, and those at the top are working above and beyond the reach of any effective justice.

               For the record anything we posted about Sarasota is from research based on leads from sources. We do know for certain however the Royal Order of Jesters in Wisconsin is connected along with the Knights of Pythias among many more groups involved. We also know Rotary is involved, Freemasons are involved, and a long list of other groups including Paul Ryan and Scott Walker's close ties with Jesuit institutions including Marquette and Georgetown as two of the most prominent.
              </p>
              <p>
               What do you want is to clarify to prove we are not following a controlled narrative, and that we are not connected in any way to High Level Insider?
              </p>
              <p>
               Your premise of us being disinformation insiders is flawed. Consider changing it and find the real Truth and the "root" to the agenda in Racine.

            I found this...I discovered something...that's how you usually hear posts start out about PIZZAGATE. Not How I baited....Nor does one typically read about Tomorrow Surprises. This is getting gross. When a person can totally 100% personalize grave tragedy (child sexual spiritual enslavement) and make it about themselves for recognition validation. Reputation. at the stake. Same time having very shallow emotion.

              I surely do have the right, and Voat has a 10,000 character limit that I bump up against. But that's not the reason I'm dragging this out. I want maximum eyeballs. As I said in my post on Day 4, I want /pol/ and Reddit and everyone everywhere to know about this series. I want volunteers to go post links there, I want everyone to tell their friends.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I'm definitely a dude. I occasionally misdirect on certain topics, to keep the pedosadists guessing. Standard procedure since they wouldn't hesitate to kill me if they could. But I don't see any advantage to hiding that.

            I think it's weird to post about how you're setting people up,  and saying all these people are phake,  convoluded by the fact that it's good to remind people Alefantis amyjames communication, its not the same as prooving people ( the accounts you name) on Voat being full of shit. Especially wonder what you mean by now that you cleared out the sock puppets as you yesterday called me one. I'll let that go for the sake of communication, but you also called me CIA. Which is just dumb and unproductive wondering why attack people who are talking about child sex trafficking/ exploitation in their home state. ? I think we need more members.

             I think it's strange that you keep spelling common words wrong and doing your punctuations wrong. You are trying too hard. You obviously aren't stupid so it makes no sense.

              Btw I never said I'm stupid. Calling myself dumb yes...not too smart. But not stupid. My feeling from the stupidness of the last couple posts, is that it's quite possible

              but it's just not likely and it sounds really paranoid. As soon as I say that I'm now classified as a sockpuppet too. Hence the stupidity. Well, its incredibly boring and sad.

                Wow.  I just caught on to that.  I used to make sock puppets with kids many years ago, but I don't even look like one either.  I've had men chase after me so unless they are blind as bats (which they could be) I don't think I am a sock puppet.  I am going to take this as a joke.  All I have to say about this is that just because you don't believe something and someone else does, does not mean they are sock puppets.  It as called agreeing to disagree.  I am going to stop trying to defend myself because I don't think I should have to. Thanks srayzie

                 has been talking about thinking High Level Insider (HLI) , Senate Anon, Wisconsin is Corrupt (WIC) etc... is all the same person?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Well the one that called you a sock puppet is also one that could really be the same person playing the other alts. What he is saying is that WIC, HLI, and YOU could all be the same person. Nobody would believe that. It's absolutely ridiculous that he said that.

                        I am somewhat close but not quite.  So it would be a short path.  My sister in law went blonde once and she never looked better, now she is back to dark brown.  I think she was more fun then too.  I think when you do something so very opposite and daring, it makes you like that too.  Daring to do something exciting.

              I think you are strange being this distracted from a conversation about say child exploitation at the hands of...whom...and slavery and blood let, and kidnapping in Haiti, uh Luara Silsby VP at Alertsense. Really that's what I was talking about. Trying to make paper flyers, get a template fashioned. Get people on board. Possibly a waste of time on Voat, or just talking about Senate Anon. Who the fuck cares!?

               It matters if someone is giving disinfo here and leading people in the wrong direction. The fact that you try so hard to not appear as the same person by using such obvious grammar errors, and the fact that you try so hard to act like it's no big deal if people posting here are frauds, makes you look more and more guilty. You would be smarter to just not respond.

              Nope. Not tryna  act different than I am. It seems to me like anonism may create mental break down for some. Sockpuppets!!! Laugh out loud. U doubt me cause I'm not a typer, can't type. Cause I never learned to type now I write on a phone. Sad.

             The amount of effort he is putting in to shutting down anything and everything related to Senate Anon, yet gives no real reason, is strange. Especially because he also admits that both ROJ and SOBIB are "dirty". All of his posts are very long winded and confusing and after reading them I can't figure out what he was trying to say, other than "Senate Anon is working with David Brock" in some bizarre and elaborate reverse psychology shill campaign.

            Thank you for all of this work. The patience it must have taken all this time to put this together is impressive and admirable.

            I think you have a great idea with the Beck angle. I remember watching that episode and waiting for the earth shattering news, then nothing. He went crazy, lost a lot of subscribers and his network tanked. The people I know who were big Beck followers completely forgot about that big announcement that never came. He talked a lot about  being harassed by the IRS and the typical stuff everyone who is or wants to appear relevant claims, but he really wasn't one to over exaggerate the importance of what he had to say like Alex Jones who  claims "earth shattering" about every thing. It never added up and I think a lot of his subscribers  (and he had a lot) never put those pieces together - his big claim and then falling apart shortly thereafter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hell - if he gets enough questions on Twitter - maybe he'll think now is a good time to talk.

            Funny how everyone has their panties in a twist over fatass Harvey Jewsteinberg, but when you bring up THIS kind of sexual abuse, the sickest and most twisted kind imaginable, you get laughed at and ridiculed. Are people so stupid that they honestly think true evil doesn't exist? Or does it just make it easier for them to go through life if they pretend that no one can be THAT bad? I've never understood why people's brains completely shut down as soon as terms like "child porn" and "trafficking ring" come up. I assume its part of the mass brainwashing techniques used by our lovely (((leaders))) to get people to shut down when certain topics arise in conversation. It prevents a dialogue from forming between autists and normies. Yes I'm using 4chan terms, fuck off.

             Totally agree. There's a panic over "rape culture" on university campuses, and when you actually get into the numbers, we're talking about a few thousand women per year who have unwanted touching or at worst, get actually raped once.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile we're trying to rescue kids who will be raped thousands of times EACH before they are killed.
            </p>

             I'm a proud goat. Lots of you may be kooks and fascists and racists, but you're all on the side of pure righteousness when it comes to this.

               I was 17 when I started college and naive to the max.  I had a blind date with a fraternity guy to a frat party.  I was not a drinker, had one cherry slo gin and stopped.  My date said oh please, just one more, I made this especially for you.  He sure did, it knocked me flat on my ass/still don't know what drug it was.  He raped me even as I begged others to save me.  I was not dressing like I wanted to be screwed/was pretty much naive in that respect also.  And I did not act like a bimbo.  Rape is a real issue on campus.  I was propositioned by more than one professor.  In those days the term date rape didn't even exist.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please don't generalize about campus rape.  I cannot begin to tell you how horrified and guilty I felt bc even when raped for some weird reason the victim feels guilty.

              Kind words man, thanks. I know I can be abrasive and I have that 4chan /pol/ humor thing going, but everyone here can agree one one thing: pedos are a menace to society, a far bigger problem than anyone realized, and they must be fucking stopped.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be honest with you it really pisses me off that we can't get people to talk about kids getting raped multiple times and murdered by these elitists, but people will get into a big tizzy over famous ADULT women getting their butts grabbed. Oh no, Rose McGowan sucked Harvery Jewsteinberg's sweaty cock and now she feels gross about it? Fuck off bitch, you made your choice, and now you want to come out and act like you're the only victim here? When one of these celebrities comes out and actually talks about the real problem--pedophilia--then I'll be supportive of this #MeToo bullshit. People are literally so brainwashed and under MK Ultra that they live in a reality where an actress sucking a cock or getting her butt slapped is the most heinous thing that could possibly ever happen. People don't even think that organized pedophilia is real, or if they do, they imagine it as a "poor people/trailer park" problem, and they never think of doctors, lawyers, priests, and people in positions of power being pedos. It fucking pisses me off.

                Exactly. Fuck this "ease them into it" shit, we don't have time for that. People need to fucking accept and understand this shit, and fast. The pedos are making their biggest moves yet, and if the Sheeple don't wake up, then we're fucking fucked.

                 Yeah I mean the whole "the public can't handle the truth" is such nonsensical garbage. I am a member of that same "public" these subhumans look down on. You are as well. It was a shock (well not entirely, I had always suspected that the elite could theoretically get away with acts of murder and rape long before I heard of it actually being a thing in today's society). We are not lambs or sheep bleeting about in the wind. We are not children. We can accept the truth and gain strength from this knowledge. Shitty government agents looking down on us when they've done FUCK ALL until now. Probably because they know their time is up and now are suddenly "da good gaiz". I don't trust anyone who says the public cannot handle the truth; its just elitism, typical of an elite part of an obscure secret society. We are created to handle it. Humanity exists for the purpose of finding the Truth. All sentient beings with an evolved consciousness do.

            helped me find out about the two guys that saw the 2 boys picked up by an Uber.  BUT, then they showed how behind CPP there are woods.  In the woods is a hatch in the ground that they think leads to a dried up Creek.  Rock Creeek.  Possibly it comes up behind Koloroma.  We know who lives there.  I wish I could give you a K UPVoats.  Alas I only have one. I will be waiting.

             Wake up. Racine is not disinformation, and there is no topic we avoid. Jill Stein is a controlled dingbat. She is not going to expose the real Truth or the real Agenda. All she cares about is the green party which will never go anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             The election system is rigged and the political system is absolutely corrupt. Wisconsin are prime examples of both, and Racine is one of 13 Bellwether districts n the nation. Whining about the election process is a distraction. The system is beyond repair.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is the Clinton machine most afraid of? The world finding out the Truth and the real agenda of global enslavement that leads to their masters, the Johnsons, Rockefellers and Rothschilds in particular.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is the key to unraveling the entire system. Anyone who tells you otherwise is disinformation. Racine is the Ultimate Truth.

              Don't worry W_I_C, I'm still around, been doing a lot of work in a lot of realms, making some seriously interesting connections! I will absolutely be able to explain how fuckery in Racine, WI, is connected to millennia-spanning corruption in the USA and indeed, across the globe.

               Those involved are getting increasingly desperate and agitated, and they also just got another $8 Billion.

               Eventually everyone will find out the Truth, but in this case more than ever timing is truly everything, and we are forever grateful for your help and the help of anyone who cares about the Truth or wants to avoid eternal enslavement.

              <p>
               We know the Truth but we do not have all the answers. We can only shine the light on the Truth together.

               No, you apologized to one person. You sure didn't apologize to me. It's one thing to be frustrated. It's another to be straight up rude. Especially to someone who always put up with you. After writing a nice message to you, you twisted everything I said. Unless you apologize to me personally, then I don't give a fuck what you have to say.

                Well, the apology was broad-scope and open to anyone reading it(which you seem to have), honestly, I appreciate every bit of your support but I'm not coming back here to suck up to anyone.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't expect your forgiveness or understanding. You're welcome to drop your support for me, it certainly won't change my course nor the validity of my info.
               </p>
               <p>
                I offer peace, truth and balance, no more, no less.

              I just want to make sure I understand you clearly:
              <br/>
              You are saying that the best way to investigate the information from WL about potential crimes originating from a DC pizza place with a list of powerful suspects in and around the DC area is to stop looking at all of them and the things they do and look into a list of convoluted corporate relationships centered on SCJ inc. and Racine, Wisconsin. Is that a fair tl;dr?

               HLI made it very clear that you should be looking at Adams Morgan, which is in DC and employs former Comet Ping Pong employees. It just so happens to be ASoberSecondThought who is telling you "Don't look at Adams Morgan!!".
              </p>
              <p>
               Just because someone says "Keep digging on Wisconsin" does NOT mean "Stop digging on DC", especially when they just told you one place to dig in DC. This is obvious, of course, but there is a massive gaslighting campaign going on right now to keep people from looking into both DC and Wisconsin.

                ) is calling out HLI (and you).  I was working to understand WIC's connection (if any) to all of this. Yet you answer on behalf of WIC with your second pp.  OP has made a case why the invitation to AM is likely a honeypot. You're supporting his assertions with careless commenting or, maybe he's onto something.

               Potential crimes originating from a DC pizza place? Stop looking at DC? Who is the most powerful man in American politics? It is Paul Ryan. What is his district? Racine, Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your premise is severely flawed.
              </p>
              <p>
               DC is one arm. Hollywood is another. The system of global criminal corruption has spread to many places through many methods. Racine is the weak link of the entire system that is much, much bigger than brownstone operations, pedophilia, and human trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is about systemic global corruption and global enslavement through the great deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability) and Agenda 2030 with the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing.

                <p>
                 I'm beginning to wonder if HLI / WIC was ever actually told the full story, because this is just agonizingly dumb as a response. I have been assuming that HLI really is a full "insider" and knows exactly what secrets he is tasked with defending. However, it's possible that Brock runs things in a more compartmentalized way, giving HLI specific scripts without explaining what their true purpose is. In which case, ha! I delight in your additional misfortune, HLI, you poor bastard.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Stay tuned in any case. Several days of revelations still to come.

                  We do not have any connection to High Level Insider or FBI Anon or US Senate Anon or Mega Anon. US Senate Anon was the only of those who said keep digging into Racine. We did not agree with many of his other assumptions such as trusting Donald Trump to "drain the swamp".

                 <p>
                  Your core assumption on us being HLI is absolutely incorrect.

                  Why not look into what we have posted such as the Clintons and Johnsons creating the system and model for Sustainable development, or the Johnsons involvement in creating Art in Embassies?

                 We are glad to know that you understand the Truth. We do not fall for fake investigators and limited hangouts, yet we do not care how people eventually discover the real Truth beyond the veil of partial Truths and disinformation.

               Ah ... I see that I read you a little bit wrong. No, I'm actually not baiting JA again. I'm trolling him, certainly. I want all of them to be pissed off and miserable, just on general principles. But the next few days really aren't about provoking a reaction. Their part in this is already over, they just don't know it yet.

                Well, you are either writing on caliber with
                <em>
                 Game o'Thrones
                </em>
                or you're one of voat's well hidden gems.  And while I lean toward the latter, I know you would not have me surrender my skepticism.  Tomorrow awaits.

            The bigger picture, in all of what you are saying, is that other "crazy talk ideas" don't get the kind of push back that pizzagate does. What does that say? That its both real and these perpetrating it have resources.

             I have bee looking at this for two hrs.  Read the old post as well, amazing.  The two boys that happen to be picked up by an Uber outside of CPP and the hatch found in the woods behind Ping Pong as well.  That really knocked me for a loop.  I think it could possibly go to Kolorama.  Where high level pols, bankers etc. live.  Obama, Tony P and I think JP.  Rock Creek runs right up behind Kolorama.

            Comet Ping Pong and Pizza is a showroom and an auction site.  Kids are paraded there, not molested.  Who are the kids? A variety, for sure. Members of the Pedocult bring their own kids ( Jake Tapper ) and Jimmy's associates and connections to local orphanages and foster homes bring others. It is a location for bidding and transactions. After a bid is won, members head up to Jimmy's shitty art gallery to launder money and arrange delivery.  There is a even more sinister aspect, and that has to do with Pegasus. It's designed to be a location of human sacrifice and only the most Elite ( gold key ) members would be aware of its function.  All the while, every customer was being Brownstoned for blackmail.

             You sound like you are very sure of what you write.  I have always believed what you just said (except no clue about Tapper bringing his kiddos.). I remember looking at pics of Pegasus and he had a huge iron ring placed in the 2nd story ceiling. I knew that could only be for one thing, hanging something heavy from it. Also the 2nd floor that could roll to the other end of the room. Almost like a viewing stand or conducting something to a hanging object.  What else can you shine light on?

             This is certainly a plausible hypothesis. Jimmy was obviously not afraid of anyone finding anything on the Comet premises, and he was very upset about anyone going to, or talking about, Pegasus. I honestly don't know how much human sacrifice is involved, as opposed to simple murder. HLI tends to exaggerate the power and scope of the networks, as a subtle way of demoralizing investigators. He would say 80 percent of public figures are blackmailed. I think the blackmailed percentage is likely smaller, and that many people are controlled through bribery, or by simple threats. This setup is more fragile and vulnerable than HLI lets on.
            </p>

             One other point: Titus Frost's hacker found hundreds of client accounts with Bitcoin transactions on Jimmy's server. That doesn't mean they don't also launder money through the art gallery. Just saying, remember the Bitcoin.

             Also if one is versed into the occult numerology would have noted that GQ's placeent of JA as the 49 th most powerful man in DC is simply a code - it's a hidden 77 for 7x7=49. It was a way of telling us that Jimmy is very, very high up - head of the Brownstone operation (and possibly a Rotchild) I will never forget his cocky denenour when Megyn Smelly soft balled him.

              My understanding the numerology of the #49 is 4+9=13....none the less, the fact that JA shows up at all on a "DC most powerful list", is highly suspect.  Speaking of which, I think every name on that top 50 most powerful DC list, should be extensively scrutinized!
