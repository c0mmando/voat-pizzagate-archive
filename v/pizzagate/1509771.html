   Reminder that in 2001 Snopes claimed what is quite clearly an ACTUAL FETUS to be a "plastic doll's head on a duck's corpse", and effectively shut down all investigation into the matter.

<p>Snopes claims &quot;Zhu Yu acted out a performance in which he appeared to eat a stillborn or aborted child (likely constructed by placing a doll\'s head on a duck\'s carcass)&quot;</p>
<h1>DO THOSE PICTURES LOOK LIKE A FUCKING PLASTIC DOLL\'S HEAD ON A DEAD DUCK\'S CORPSE TO YOU?</h1>
<p>Wikipedia\'s article on Yu has <strong>15</strong> sources in a row peddling the doll/duck narrative: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Ynmook.png">https://i.sli.mg/Ynmook.png</a></p>
<p>In addition, here is what Zhu himself said about his &quot;art&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No religion forbids cannibalism, nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even better, here are some of Yu\'s other &quot;works&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Foundation of All Epistemology</strong>: This work appeared in the 1998 group exhibition It’s All Right in Shanghai. For this piece, Zhu Yu cut and boiled five human brains which were purchased from a local hospital. He placed them in neatly labeled jars that he then signed with his own name. Zhu put these jars of brains up for sale in a market that sponsored the exhibit. He ended up selling 15 bottles each for the price of 98 yuans.</li>
<li><strong>Pocket Theology</strong>: Appearing in the 1999 group exhibition Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion in Beijing, curated by Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling rope was gripped by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook. This display was held in a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organize the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.</li>
<li><strong>Skin Graft</strong>: This performance art installation appeared in the 2000 exhibition Infatuation with Injury organized by Li Xianting. In the exhibit, Zhu uses his own flesh as a canvas. Photos were shown of trunk of a quartered pig lying on a hospital bed. Zhu grafted a piece of his own skin onto a section of damaged skin from the pig. Two photos of this process appeared in the exhibit; one that showed the surgical process, and another which featured the artist sewing his own skin onto the pig carcass. Zhu stood by the exhibit and lifted his shirt to show the scar which stood as evidence of the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single search into this weird man\'s antics always sends me to some useful idiot copy-pasting Snopes. The only site on the whole internet that I could find that questions it <strong>at all</strong> is fucking STORMFRONT of all sites. It\'s pretty goddamn sad when the only site that dares to challenge the Snopes narrative is a forum for White Supremacists.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, China has had an actual confirmed booming fetus trade for years, the <em>real</em> news says so: <a href="http://archive.is/DEiYh">http://archive.is/DEiYh</a></p>',

            Because in their eyes, Snopes is infallible. If it looks like a baby, crawls like a baby and cries like a baby but Snopes says it's a duck, then it's a duck. They do not understand that Snopes isn't the ultimate authority on internet rumors and occasionally they do get things wrong from time to time, something they have done much more frequently as of late.

            I am far, far, far from being a sheltered person in this life.  Seen more evil than I would have cared to.
           </p>
           <p>
            But all of the shit being exposed through pizzagate makes me question everything.  I am Christian but will no longer participate in communion. Body and blood of Christ....  I'll pass on that now.  I believe in God.  Mans religion's are a corruption of God's law.

              fetus looks to be about 19 weeks old...I work in emergency medicine and have seen many, many fetus'(miscarriages)  and lots of traumas from GSW, auto accidents and many other tragic happenings. Yes it does give you PTSD when you see these things in realtime...at least any normal person it does

            "Eating People: In his performance art piece Eating People, Zhu photographs himself cooking and eating a human fetus that he divided into five parts. Zhu says that “I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind’s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.” [28] In further response to Zhu’s bold performance, The Ministry of Culture cited a menace to social order and the spiritual health of the Chinese people, and banned exhibitions involving culture, animal abuse, corpses, and overt violence and sexuality.[26][29] However, this piece did not even appear at the exhibit; The night before the exhibition, Ai Weiwei collaborated with Zhu and the photographs were removed from the gallery. This piece was thought particularly controversial, and organizers did not want to risk government censorship for the rest of the exhibit. The response to this work stemmed from its appearance on the internet shortly after. Eating People appeared in Malaysia's Perdan Weekly without caption and generated the question of whether eating babies was accepted in Asia on various myth-debunking websites."

            Addendum, paraphrased from Wikipedia which I opted not to include in the OP.:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Yu's most famous piece of conceptual art, titled "Eating People," was performed at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. It consisted of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. The picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the FBI and Scotland Yard. It was intended as "shock art"..."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Other images from another art exhibit were falsely circulated along with Zhu Yu's photos and claimed to be evidence of fetus soup. The piece's cannibalistic theme caused a stir in Britain when Yu's work was featured on a Channel 4 documentary exploring Chinese Contemporary Art in 2003..."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Yu has claimed that he used an actual fetus which was stolen from a medical school. He was prosecuted for his deeds."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Make of this what you will.
