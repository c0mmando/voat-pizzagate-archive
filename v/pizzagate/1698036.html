<h2>100 CHILDREN UNDER-REPORTED BY FRIENDS OF THE ORPHANS, BEFORE PASSING OVER TO LAURA SILSBY, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1591337">thread</a></h2>
<p>100 children were under-reported by Friends of the Orphans between 13th and 18th of January 2010. Considering this number matched Laura Silsby\'s plan to gather 100 children, if this mismatch was a result of a premeditated exchange this could be a hint to a staged earthquake. After all, Laura Silsby also visited a couple of orphanages in Haiti during late December 2010, a few weeks prior to the earthquake.</p>
<h2>FRIENDS OF THE ORPHANS FR WASSON LOCATION IN HAITI BOMBED? <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1601423">thread</a></h2>
<p>There was an interesting point that the Friends of the Orphans building that collapsed in Petionville after the Haitian earthquake appeared to be unnatural in comparison to its surroundings, and could have been bombed. It was convenient that the volunteers who worked for the orphanage died inside that building, being unable to witness any shady trafficking operations conducted by their orphanage.</p>
<h2>MOST DISASTERS ARE &quot;MAN-MADE&quot;, SAYS THE MANAGER OF FRIENDS OF THE ORPHANS, <a href="https://archive.fo/yZrqa#selection-1973.0-1975.117">article</a></h2>
<p>Gena Heraty, the manager of Friends of the Orphans, who would have been first to notice the discrepancy of 100 children, stated that <strong>most disasters are man-made</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the horrific disasters that have occurred in Haiti during her time in the country, Gena has never once questioned her faith. In fact, it has been a huge factor in what keeps her positioned there. “I have a very strong faith, I know God is there, no question about it. Death is part of life. I have no idea what the next life might be like, but I believe there is one and that the kids are fine now wherever they are.”</p>
<p>She adds that <strong>‘most disasters are man-made’ and that it can be convenient to blame God for the badness in the world.</strong></p>

            , have you got any links to support the primary claim of your headline that manufacturing a massive earthquake is even possible? Because without it, this sure looks a lot like a disinfo post designed to make investigators look like crazy, gullible idiots.

            wow .... nice work. very very interesting. i got the idea for man made earthquakes that cause tsunamis and so forth when i was listening to some telsa technology and tesla actually said that he knew his ultrasonic waves could easily destroy large buildings thats when i realised the cia could have been harbouring and exploring that technology to use for their evil purposes which are almost all pedophile related. the man who started the cia was a cross dressing homosexual paedophile. its not rocket science is it .
