            You can look at city records and see when buildings are built and these buildings were not all built at the same time.

            Downvoats show this is hitting a nerve. The deleted post should be posted in the comments. It shows the pic of the basement windows.  Am on cell and can’t do.

            There was a series of events by the UK Labour party during the 2015 election campaign called "politics and pizza" which aimed to get more young people involved in politics.

            You are the one that’s posted a pic yesterday of the basement window? Repost it again under discuss and you should be ok.  I am very interested in what else you have to say and also hearing from others about the picture of the basement window.
