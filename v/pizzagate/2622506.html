<p>The statistics are grim. Young girls in the United States are usually recruited into commercial sex trafficking between the ages of 12-14 years old. The vast majority of sex trafficking victims, 70-90 percent, were sexually abused prior to being trafficked. Runaways, throwaways, youth with a background of abuse or neglect and foster care youth living in group homes are all vulnerable to human trafficking. There are typically four types of traffickers that recruit young girls from the street into commercial sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>Loverboy</p>
<p>Traffickers tend to prey on young girls in malls, group homes and online in Internet chat rooms—places where kids in groups tend to accumulate with little to no adult supervision. Then the traffickers befriend the young girls, buy them gifts and make them feel special to have someone care about them. Also called Romeo Pimps, the men go out of their way to pay attention and make the girls feel special before they suddenly demand that the girl have sex with other men to pay back all the gifts he bought for her.</p>
<p>The Enabler</p>
<p>Other traffickers also befriend young girls but instead of courting the them, become their friends offering to buy the underage girls alcohol and drugs. Once the girls are addicted to drugs or alcohol, it becomes easier for the traffickers to force them into prostitution. Sometimes it’s as easy as the traffickers asking the girls to a party with the goal of getting them addicted. Many pimps are also drug dealers and may initially attract and lure girls with free drugs before forcing them into sex trafficking.</p>
<p>Peer Pressured</p>
<p>Traffickers often send out their top girl (known as the bottom bitch) to recruit other young girls into sex trafficking. The majority of victims, almost 71 percent are recruited into sex trafficking by someone they know. The top girl flaunts her new clothes and lures the young girl into sex trafficking by telling her how daddy pays to get her hair and nails done. Then she introduces the new girl to her trafficker and she also becomes part of the trafficker’s harem.</p>
<p>Gorilla Pimp</p>
<p>The most violent and cruel traffickers are known as gorilla pimps. They use abuse and intimidation to control the girls, often not allowing them to look other men in the eye or speak unless spoken to. These types of traffickers ambush young girls walking alone and beat them into submission until they agree to have sex with men for money. The traffickers may also tattoo their names on the girls, beat them with bats and inflict humiliating and painful punishments for girls who do not meet their $500 to 1,000 nightly quota.</p>
<p>Traffickers are manipulative and cruel and will use any and all forms of force, fraud and coercion to get young girls into the lucrative sex trafficking industry. Though there are different methods of recruiting young girls into sex trafficking, they all lead to a path of rape and violence.

<p>Planned Parenthood’s Continued Failure to Report Evidence of Child-Sex Trafficking</p>
<p>The abortion giant appears more concerned with its image than with protecting its clients.</p>
<p>A new investigation conducted by the pro-life organization Live Action has revealed that Planned Parenthood failed to disclose suspected child-sex trafficking to authorities and did not follow through on promises to train staff members in properly reporting instances of such abuse.</p>
<p>In 2011, a Live Action undercover investigation gathered evidence of eight Planned Parenthood staffers in seven abortion clinics who appeared willing to aid and abet the trafficking of minors. Posing as child-sex traffickers, Live Action investigators visited Planned Parenthood facilities in New York, Arizona, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., inquiring about obtaining abortions, contraception, and STI tests for underage girls.</p>
<p>The investigation footage shows Planned Parenthood employees assisting these supposed traffickers, outlining the best ways to get abortions and birth control for 14- and 15-year-old victims. The staffers said that Planned Parenthood clinics would always ignore parental-consent laws and perform abortions for underage girls involved in sex work, and they explained illegal methods of obtaining from clinics both birth control and abortions for minors without health insurance.</p>
<p>After Live Action released the evidence from its initial investigation, Planned Parenthood told the media that it would train all clinic workers to detect and disclose suspected sexual abuse of minors. In a letter to then–attorney general Eric Holder, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards claimed that her group had looked into the trafficking claims and reported them to the relevant law-enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>But the letter named just four of the five jurisdictions targeted by Live Action’s original sting, suggesting that Planned Parenthood took the allegations less seriously than it claimed. And Live Action’s newest investigation, released yesterday, reveals that Planned Parenthood never followed through on Richards’s promise that it would report the trafficking claims, or on its previous public promises to train clinic workers to detect and report such crimes</p>
<p>And in an interview with Live Action, former Planned Parenthood clinic manager Ramona Treviño said that instead of training employees to help trafficking victims, the organization held sessions on how to determine whether they were being secretly recorded. “That experience for me left me so disgusted that I couldn’t see how Planned Parenthood could ever redeem themselves after that,” Treviño said.</p>
<p>In Treviño’s meeting, Planned Parenthood officials played all of the undercover footage from the Live Action investigation in order to illustrate how clinic managers could better identify undercover journalists.

<p>When the “pimp” tells Ms. Woodruff the girls are around 14 and 15 years old and speak no English, the clinic manager is shown saying “so long as they just lie … we just kind of play it stupid.”</p>
<p>Later in the video, Ms. Woodruff said they look past this because these girls still need the help, even if they are underage.

<p>56 lawmakers demand Planned Parenthood be investigated for covering-up child sex-abuse </p>
<p>Members of Congress gathered outside the U.S. Capitol today to call attention to an important investigative report and video series exposing Planned Parenthood’s repeated failure to notify law enforcement of suspected human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and girls.</p>
<p>“Abuse cover-up is systemic to the abortion industry,”</p>
<p>“What these abusers do––what sexual traffickers do––to their victims is take them or threaten to send them by force to an abortion facility, which can become a key place for that abuse to be covered up,”</p>
<p>“And Planned Parenthood, instead of reporting the abuse as they’re mandated to do in virtually all fifty states by law––instead of reporting abuse, instead of being that person who can encounter a girl in a situation of extreme distress and be that moment of intervention for her––does a secret abortion, has a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell policy,’ and sends this vulnerable young girl back into the arms of sex abusers.”</p>
<p>“Abortion is not family planning; It is family destruction,” said Rep. Diane Black (R-TN).</p>
<p>“The lies that are coming from the Big Abortion Industry are just heartbreaking,” Black continued.  “Live Action’s findings show us that these same lies are used to willfully neglect reporting these horrific cases of abuse, rape, and sex trafficking.</p>
<p>Sometimes these young teenage girls plead with Planned Parenthood staff to them help them escape their abusers, but their pleas go unheeded.</p>
<p>“It’s come to light that Planned Parenthood performs abortions on girls as young as 12 years old, and then sends them right back into the arms of their abusers without alerting the authorities,” noted Black.  “It is shameful.” </p>
<p>“Planned Parenthood’s failure to report these heinous crimes does not empower women or our children;  It empowers their abusers,” said the Congresswoman.  “The despicable cycle of these facilities, turning a blind eye to sexual abuse and exploitation of our children must end.”</p>
<p>“Are these lives not important to Planned Parenthood?  Or is the greater abortion industry more important than protecting these young innocent lives?” wondered Walker.<br />

            “Abuse cover-up is systemic to the abortion industry,”  Abortion clinics report abuse? They aren't even required to report the number of abortions themselves. Guttmacher calls clinics up for stats , not all clinics cooperate, then Guttmacher extrapolates figures. California doesn't report abortion stats yet a chunk of them are paid by MediCal so there's a paper trail somewhere in the billing dept.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abortion clinics are harvesting babies and want the supply to continue, that's why they don't help these girls. And Congress only gives them lipservice because the Israeli/Jewis  lobby that controls Congress probably has a financial interest in the proceeds. Someone should check the Israeli pharmaceutical research companies for possible ties to abortion baby sales.

            Minor red pill for normies...if PP is about “women’s rights/health” then why can’t you find any locations in the suburbs? Why never in non-descript medical clinic? Why not a 90’s rave line... cloak and dagger passwords?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the ladies in Scottsdale not “women” don’t need medical attention?
 If I could “ruin” a poor woman’s life with an unwanted pregnancy, how much damage could unwanted pregnancy do to an heiress?
 Look at locations, it’s about killing poor babies and selling their remains. It’s eugenics masquerading as “women’s rights” 
Margaret Sanger openly a eugenicist and lol- of course, one of Hillary’s “heroes”

            There are so many wrong things perpetrated on these girls.  But this one just upset me so.

           <p>
            “It’s come to light that Planned Parenthood performs abortions on girls as young as 12 years old, and then sends them right back into the arms of their abusers without alerting the authorities,” noted Black. “It is shameful.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this not against the law?  A 12 yr old?  It just can't be legal.  If it is then it must stop.  I remember the coverage of Live Action as well.  The MSM had a Field Day with it.
