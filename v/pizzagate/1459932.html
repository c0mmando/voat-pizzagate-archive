            www.murha.info is similar forum as websleuths. People discuss there mostly about crimes and current topics. There are policemen, ex-prisoners, lawyers, criminals, writers, journalists, housewives, trolls etc. You need to register before you can write there. I cannot write there because they don't accept alters and I have forgotten my account's password. So I am kind of banned from there until I can change my ip-address which I cannot do at the moment.
Here is the register page

            The correct answer to confirmation code is AhruM
They also say that they don't give any information about users' identities to the police in case they happen to ask. However, some people claim that the site is administrated by the police but there are no evidence of this.

            You should send this to murha.info and ask them to verify it. There are lots of ex-prisoners and guards too. It would be interesting to find out the other names.
I hope you are posting behind seven proxys.
