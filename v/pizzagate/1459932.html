<p>If I were Finnish police I would investigate every company and person in Finland who donates money to the Clinton Foundation and the so called charities and orphanages that work through it and all of their other businesses, especially pizzerias. </p>
<p>Because a big Finnish firm Cargotec whose owners belong to one of the richest families in Finland the Herlin\'s and Ilkka Herlin donate altogether something like 100 000 dollars a year to the Clinton Foundation. Why? Are these Finnish businesses too involved in global criminal activities?</p>
<p>A prison guard from one of Helsinki\'s biggest prisons said that it is public knowledge among the prisoners that the richest and most powerful man at his time Aatos Erkko a freemason who owned the biggest newspaper group Helsingin Sanomat in Finland was a sexual predator of little boys and belonged to some Eyes Wide Shutesque shadow group. Erkko was also visiting Washington in the 1970s according to the Wikileaks and his brother-in-law Rafael Sepp채l채 was the US Ambassaor.</p>
<p>I don\'t know if there is anything here but I just thought I\'d bring this up for further investigation if somebody finds more connections. I haven\'t been able to do anything else since finding out about all of this and fuck I hope the people involved are caught. </p>

            www.murha.info is similar forum as websleuths. People discuss there mostly about crimes and current topics. There are policemen, ex-prisoners, lawyers, criminals, writers, journalists, housewives, trolls etc. You need to register before you can write there. I cannot write there because they don't accept alters and I have forgotten my account's password. So I am kind of banned from there until I can change my ip-address which I cannot do at the moment.
Here is the register page

            The correct answer to confirmation code is AhruM
They also say that they don't give any information about users' identities to the police in case they happen to ask. However, some people claim that the site is administrated by the police but there are no evidence of this.

            You should send this to murha.info and ask them to verify it. There are lots of ex-prisoners and guards too. It would be interesting to find out the other names.
I hope you are posting behind seven proxys.
