<p>This chapter follows a hunch I had connecting the Bronfman Mafia to the Velvet Mafia and hits paydirt.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2000/03/06/bronfman-adrift-from-diller-geffen/">https://nypost.com/2000/03/06/bronfman-adrift-from-diller-geffen/</a> David Geffen (Velvet Mafia) was a confidant of Edgar Bronfman Jr for many years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/19/business/one-deal-off-one-deal-on-well-that-s-entertainment.html">https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/19/business/one-deal-off-one-deal-on-well-that-s-entertainment.html</a> Bronfman is connected to Dreamworks via a distribution deal. He has also had business dealings with Michael Ovitz (CAA). </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2016/4/lost-horizons">https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2016/4/lost-horizons</a> The top dogs of CAA are connected to A LOT of people, including Michael Eisner. </p>
<p><a href="https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1989/eirv16n34-19890825/eirv16n34-19890825_050-the_bronfmans_a_crime_family_tur.pdf">https://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1989/eirv16n34-19890825/eirv16n34-19890825_050-the_bronfmans_a_crime_family_tur.pdf</a> Basically, the Bronfmans are the true puppet masters of Israel. Have their fingers deep in the Mossad pie. I’m presuming it is via the Bronfmans that Mega has access to Mossad assets. </p>
<p><a href="https://larrynoodles.com/clare-bronfman-connected-to-the-jewish-mafia/">https://larrynoodles.com/clare-bronfman-connected-to-the-jewish-mafia/</a> Some emails from Claire Bronfman pointing out the Bronfman mafia connections to people like Eric Holder and even members of congress and the Clintons (used as a threat against NXIVM victims).</p>
<p><a href="https://socrates-wellness-institute.com/way-beyond-epstein-2/">https://socrates-wellness-institute.com/way-beyond-epstein-2/</a> The Bronfmans are part of Mega alongside Jeffery Epstein’s mentor.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=21s&amp;v=Xx9AmT3NhGI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=21s&amp;v=Xx9AmT3NhGI</a> Steven Spielberg via his father is connected to Bill Gates. Also to Warren Buffet. No wonder Enty doesn’t name Spielberg. Due to his vast mob and deep state connections, he’s just as “protected” as Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith\'s mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LAPD, the media, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were moved post morteum. The culprits doused gasoline throughout the house starting from Judith’s room and ending at the garage. Since the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Ie, incendiary bomb involving gasoline, fumes and an ignition source set to go off at a specific time (even an egg timer could be wired as such). Of course the fire destroys the evidence. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           Basically, the Bronfmans are the true puppet masters of Israel. Have their fingers deep in the Mossad pie. I’m presuming it is via the Bronfmans that Mega has access to Mossad assets.

           Steven Spielberg via his father is connected to Bill Gates. Also to Warren Buffet. No wonder Enty doesn’t name Spielberg. Due to his vast mob and deep state connections, he’s just as “protected” as Hillary Clinton.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith's mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans), Danny Kapon. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LAPD, the media, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were moved post morteum. The culprits doused gasoline throughout the house starting from Judith’s room and ending at the garage. Since the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Ie, incendiary bomb involving gasoline, fumes and an ignition source set to go off at a specific time (even an egg timer could be wired as such). Of course the fire destroys the evidence. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?

            Latter is redundant. You wouldn't use anything

           <p>
            That aside, "octopus" is a far more relevant descriptor rather than "hydra". Why? Look into "The Octopus" and you'll find out. No attempt to distract or be too cryptic, but, what you're outlining wrt hollywood/jewish mafia is tied to "The Octopus".
