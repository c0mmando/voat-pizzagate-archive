<h2>More than half of the Netherlands’ senior clerics were involved in covering up sexual assault of children between 1945 and 2010, a press report by the Dutch daily NRC said on Saturday, further engulfing the Catholic Church in a global abuse scandal.</h2>
<h1>“Four abused children and 16 others allowed the transfer of paedophile priests who could have caused new victims in other parishes,” the Dutch newspaper added.</h1>

<p><em>What is she trying to say? That the other parts of the report are not accurate?</em></p>
<p>Other elements were based on anonymous information provided by a victims’ assistance unit set up by the church.</p>
<p>“The names of several bishops correspond to those named in a report commissioned by the church in 2010,” van Roosendaal said.</p>
