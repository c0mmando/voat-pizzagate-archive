<h2>More than half of the Netherlands’ senior clerics were involved in covering up sexual assault of children between 1945 and 2010, a press report by the Dutch daily NRC said on Saturday, further engulfing the Catholic Church in a global abuse scandal.</h2>
<h1>“Four abused children and 16 others allowed the transfer of paedophile priests who could have caused new victims in other parishes,” the Dutch newspaper added.</h1>
<p><strong>Church spokeswoman Daphne van Roosendaal said the church could “confirm a part” of the report.</strong></p>
<p><em>What is she trying to say? That the other parts of the report are not accurate?</em></p>
<p>Other elements were based on anonymous information provided by a victims’ assistance unit set up by the church.</p>
<p>“The names of several bishops correspond to those named in a report commissioned by the church in 2010,” van Roosendaal said.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the accused clerics have since died, and the statute of limitations has expired in all cases, she added.</strong> </p>
<p><em>How convenient.... /s</em></p>
<p><strong>Those still alive declined to comment</strong>, NRC said.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Meanwhile in France, a priest has been charged with sexually abusing four brothers, now aged from three to 17, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>The family brought the complaint against the 64-year-old priest, whose parish is in the central Cantal region. All four boys were said to be in the church choir.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Komine Bocoum, did not say when the alleged offences were said to have taken place.</p>
<p>Local bishop Bruno Grua said his diocese was “shocked by these unspeakable acts”.</p>
<p>They are the latest in a slew of assault allegations against the Catholic church spanning several continents.</p>
<p>People in Australia, Europe, and North and South America have charged they were sexually abused by clergymen and lay people, in what German Archbishop Georg Gaenswein has called the church’s “own 9/11”.</p>
<p><em>Yes, and Gaenswein was in on it, as former Private Secretary of Pope Benedict XVI.</em></p>
<p>In August, Pope Francis declined to comment on a claim that he ignored sexual abuse allegations against a senior clergyman in the US.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the German Catholic church said it was it was “dismayed and ashamed” by decades of alleged child sex abuse by priests.\' </p>
