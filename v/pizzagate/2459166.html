<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the previous year, a UK political activist ‘pressure group’ called Atlantic Bridge was garnering a lot of press for all the wrong reasons. Fronted by then-Defence Secretary Liam Fox, after being founded in 1997 by Fox and Reagan BFF/ex-UK-PM Margaret Thatcher, its stated goal was to protect the 80’s holdover concept of the US &amp; UK’s military and cultural ‘special relationship’ from “the European integrationists who would like to pull Britain away from its relationship with the United States.”</p>
<p>One of those affected was yet another powerful hedge fund manager, ex-Goldman Sachs head trader, climate-change denier &amp; funder, and longtime Tory/Conservative donor named <strong>Michael Hintze</strong> who provided the majority of those donations and lent his private jet to Fox for schmoozy jaunts to meet with D.C. defence contractors. With a strong interest in geopolitical wargames, a habit of supporting Defence Secretaries, and a predilection for hiring senior military officials at his powerful firm Convertible &amp; Quantitative Strategies, it’s small wonder Hintze sought to establish a Western security superhighway before the Bridge collapsed.</p>
<p>Turnbull had previously worked for the tremendously influential public relations and strategic communications firm <strong>Bell Pottinger</strong> — co-founded by infamous PR guru Lord Timothy Bell </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prince Andrew was one of the well-known figures to whom Bell Pottinger claimed to have access in a video covertly recorded by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.</p>
<p>David Wilson, managing director of Bell Pottinger Group, told reporters posing as potential clients: \'We have links there\'.</p>
<p>He added: \'There have been suggestions in the media - if you do a background check - that he [Prince Andrew] is liable to follow where the chequebook is, i.e. people will pay him to go to a certain country.\'</p>

            I'm wary of a lying article that pushes "climate" change" lies no climate has changed ever, anyone who says that is a moron who thinks tree ring precipitation core samples(the crucial number of which were admittedly hoaxed with better studies discrediting the lies) have anything to due with temperature. The "climates" arctic, sub arctic, humid continental etc. are all the same require a vast flux to "change" and never have. Sorry peeps people inventing things in their heads about an "ice age" and insane batshit garbled lies about boogeyman "carbon" cause me to puke on site. That is all Rothschild economic warfare on the poor propaganda. I will have none of it.

            Hey, that comedian, however funny he is, Ricky Gervais, is bragging about living in Hampstead on his new special. He's dogged on twitter and hell bent on another anti-religiously themed show. He's a living dichotomy.

            <p>
             To that end, a string of public-relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive.[ Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was unprecedented.
The first was Sheree Dodd, a former Daily Mirror journalist, then Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information.

             To bring things full circle, Bell Pottinger was revealed to work for Michael Hintze - the hedge fund manager who was Atlantic Bridge’s major backer.

            <p>
             The likes of Lord Bell, in perhaps the quickest route to Godwin’s Law yet devised, will tell you that everyone deserves representation. It’s an argument that goes back to Sigmund Freud’s nephew, Edward Bernays, who in the early twentieth century pioneered the use of psychology in PR to help market the likes of  Procter &amp; Gamble, Cartier and Best Foods. For Bernays, democracy required the manipulation of the mass mind by media and advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
             And when you wonder why so few are asking questions about all this, consider the fact that a sizeable minority of Tory and Labour MPs come from lobbying, among them Priti Patel, who was at Weber Shandwick; Tracey Crouch, who worked for Westminster Strategy; and George Eustice and Charlotte Leslie - both of whom were at Portland – not to mention, of course, our prime minister. Consider also the fact that the Evening Standard is a Brown Lloyd James contract, as is the Telegraph Media Group.
            </p>
            <p>
             The PR men might have their own reputations to worry about now – but from what we’ve seen, they’ll manage them – either through influence, or darker arts.

             <p>
              Thanks to Newsnight’s Kirsty Wark, when she interviewed Tim Bell about the disgracing of his former PR agency, we have enjoyed a glimpse of the charms that still captivate politicians and celebrities, long after he nurtured the reputations of, among many others, Mrs Thatcher, Ernest Saunders, David Mellor,
              <strong>
               Rolf Harris
              </strong>
              and Neil and Christine Hamilton. Mr Hamilton, who now identifies as Ukip, took envelopes of cash from Mohamed Al Fayed, in exchange for covert lobbying duties, then lied about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe Bell was right, given the number of rivals who would have happily taken on his clients, to complain of tall poppy martyrdom. “It’s much more fun to attack me,” he has said, “or the Saatchi brothers, or Matthew Freud, or Max Clifford.” Obviously that was before Clifford was sentenced to eight years for indecent assaults and Charles Saatchi was photographed with his then wife, “holding her head by the neck to make her focus”.

                     Right after editing, the view counts and upvotes stopped. When Q posts, I have to make a lot of edits so this sucks. I also keep having Voat go down and it says Voat is bad.

             Yeah Double Wow.  What I want to know is why Trump leaves DeVos in power if he is so interested in our children.  Her being related to her brother is enough of a Red Flag.  What most people don't realize is that Blackwater was not a govt. org.  It was an independent contractor that got a very lucrative contract from our govt.  DeVos is connected, I believe, with her brother to this horrid dismantling of our public schools, as we now see in the UK.  All this talk about home schooling is another take down attempt.  It is very obvious what is going on here.  If we can see it, there is obvious ignoring of the facts.

               Nope.  I have always said that I did not vote for him, but was willing to give him a chance since he is the President, but now I am losing hope.  I hate to see it happen, I too was hopeful, but having been burned by the Hopium Phase, I am afraid it does not look good.

             DeVos is Erik Prince's brother ( more family ties ! ) who was in the news last week about a meeting in the Seychelles, which was blown out of the water when the contact turned out to be a child porn trafficker.
            </p>

             Are we on the cusp of something BIG and is DeVos a trigger signal for action by the QAnon team?

             The lessons of Atlantic Bridge
            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Understanding this agenda helps us understand the agendas of other Atlantic Bridge members in the cabinet, especially chancellor George Osborne and education secretary Michael Gove. Osborne has always denied his cuts programme is ideological, despite his commitment to small government.
             <strong>
              Those who want to know more about Gove's agenda should look to ALEC, which has campaigned to privatise US schools and marginalise teaching unions.

              This ALEC state report card speaks volumes about Betsy DeVos’s education agenda
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Quoting from the late British Prime Minister Margaret “Iron Lady” Thatcher, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recently said that there is “no such thing” as society, trashed the federal government and hailed the spread of school “choice.”
             </p>
             <p>
              If you don’t know about ALEC, you should. It is a member organization of corporate lobbyists and conservative state legislators who craft “model legislation” on issues important to them and then help shepherd it through legislatures.

            <p>
             For those who may be unaware, the CFR is a primary member of the circle of Washington think-tanks promoting endless war. As former Army Major Todd Pierce describes, this groups act from the shadows as
             <em>
              “primary provocateurs” manipulatively using “psychological suggestiveness to create a false narrative of danger from some foreign entity with the objective being to create the paranoia idea within the U.S. population that it is under imminent threat of attack or takeover”
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             To highlight just how much control over the media the CFR wields we need only look at the fact that they criminally operate – in broad daylight – and receive nearly no media coverage.

             , World Bank president, and an adviser to a total of nine US presidents, John J. McCloy actually bragged publicly about the CFR hand picking US politicians.
