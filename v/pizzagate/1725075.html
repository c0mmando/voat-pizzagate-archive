            Some will say what they want about Able Danger and Field McConnell but he happens to be the ONLY one that has been able to nail down this conspiracy in a way that makes it applicable to how the government actually works. There has to be, even in the black ops area of clandestine intelligence, a PROCESS and a chain of command that has to operate in existing ways for efficiency. Able Danger is the only one who has been able to nail down HOW they are able to complete some of their black ops, by communicating through the 'underground' tor network and military comms.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is also the ONLY one pointing out the HUGE shadowy alliances between CONTRACT COMPANIES like SERCO, who are involved in EVERY ASPECT of the governance and policing of HUMAN BEINGS, THAT ARE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN TO THE PUBLIC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Able Danger is also THE ONLY ONE, that has been able to PINPOINT that HILLARY CLINTON, while an attorney for the ROSE LAW FIRM in ARKANSAS, was THE PRINCIPLE ARCHITECT of a PATENT for a DEVICE that was installed on ALL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES that could be USED TO REMOTELY TAKE OVER AN ENTIRE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE. This is the ONE COG in the wheel that shows the TWIN TOWERS EVENT WAS A LONG STANDING, WELL ORCHESTRATED PLAN.

            Redditers' evaluation of "Abel Danger"
           </p>
           <p>
            Our organization is Abel Danger and we chose our name years ago when we saw the United States Department of Defense entity known as Able Danger reduced in the run-up to 9/11 — which has all the indicators of a global False Flag, a cancer it shares with the recent incident involving Malaysia’s flight MH370.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh boy...here we go.
           </p>
           <p>
            I continued my activism in safety and truth issues and watched as Adam Air 574, Kenya Airways 507, Air France 447 and Sukhoi Superjet were destroyed in a manner consistent with BUAP remote control.
           </p>
           <p>
            What? So, you think Boeing designed this "secret" system which can remote control all airplanes including Airbus and Sukhoi even though they all have wildly different proprietary avionic systems?
           </p>
           <p>
            the Truth of MH370 be known globally. First MH370, then 9/11 follows immediately.
           </p>
           <p>
            God damn that was hard to read. Well OP, you managed to find quite a nutjob there. BTW, he says that BUAP is a super secret system that Boeing designed with the US government in order to carry out False Flag attacks. So, I don't think anyone's going to be able to tell you more (because it's an imaginary system...)

            I agree with you that Field McConnell has a very strange style and mixes some possible things (like an autonomous remote control) with strange theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            But surely he had quite some experience as a pilot (also with Delta) and seems Boeing itself confirmed (after a lawsuit from this guy) officially that this BUAP technology existed and was to be installed in all its airplanes by 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I would like to hear are some hard facts related to this technology and its installation status on current commercial airplanes.

            You have a source for that? I'm still looking. I looked up his lawsuit v. ALPA. McConnell was fired from NWA for refusing to undergo a psychological evaluation (probably because he's a nutter) after he took over a 60 day medical leave. He filed suit against ALPA for failing to represent his grievance and his suit was dismissed for failure to provide sufficient evidence of claim. Also, McConnell fired 2 different attorneys in this suit.

            Couldn't find much on the case 3:07 CV-49 Hawks Cafe v. Global Guardians other than:
           </p>
           <p>
            The suit claims that "Global Guardians" is a secret collection of powerful persons and corporations who engage in international racketeering, sabotage, assassinations, etc. The suit claims Boeing belongs to this "group" and that they use Iridium satellites to remotely connect to secret computer chips embedded in Boeing's FMS, and that these chips were installed under the direction of Hilary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just going to stop there, I don't see a need to go any further as this claim just continues to spiral downward from there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did all the digging I could. Seems Boeing was granted a patent for the concept of the uninterrupted autopilot, but it has not yet been developed or installed on any Boeing model to date. There has not been any STC's granted for a system of this nature that I could find. Probably one of those things that Boeing thought was a good idea at the time, which is why they got a patent on the concept, but then realized that no pilot would ever fly with a system like that onboard. Boeing probably canned the idea after they realized it would have been brand suicide.

            It turns out that others have busted "Abel Danger" as being a disinfo outlet as well.  (Thankfully, I stopped listening to their bogus crap years ago ['06] when the subscribers to my list researched their claims.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Some guys at the Prison Planet forum were highly skieptical.  Here is one such comment (p.1).

Field McConnell &amp; David Hawkins: February 2010

            I have been following these guys for a while and I think they are disinfo.  They have some of the usual suspects and then mix in new ones with some striking omissions.  Where is Cheney or the Bushs -- buddy says that Bush senior is just a pawn who is easily manipulated because he is being extorted.  No I disagree and think the bushies rank up a little higher on the totem pole.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was checking out other stuff from them I came across a Project Camelot interview and she was holding one of them to the fire and he had great difficulty weaseling out of the line of question.  Project Camelot has to be taken with a degree of skepticism and his interview didnt boost his credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            He does sound good though but upon further scrutiny things dont add up quite right.  I question this escrow account betting scenario, corralling competitive interests in the towers for gassing pre-demolition, this enhanced involvement of women, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus I dont trust anyone who tells me how amazed they are with their own intelligence.

            "I want to know why they think that Michelle Obama is a greater threat to liberty than Queen Elizabeth II or Queen Beatrix. Anyway, more and more I suspect they are a new version of the fake left/right as they really go full steam against Dems and then somehow minimize any issues with GOP psychopaths.  I still think that they drop a lot of information that needs to be followed up. And they only give the good information when confronted like when project camelot confronted them about the vaccines which are obviously a trojan horse for more powerful genocidal projects. I do have to hand it to project camelot for never letting people just rattle on with their agenda. Project camelot was also instrumental in exposing benjamin fulford as an NWO sympathizer. So in any case, these guys definitely fit the bill as the Noam Chomskies of the right as far as their military backgrounds and intelligence backgrounds. What that means is that they must provide some useful information to keep their cover and through those pieces, follow up may reveal some good stuff."

            Field McConnell's sister. Who's he? He's been bird dogging this mother fucker since pretty much the beginning. When this is all said and done he'll be one of the select few who get monuments named after them and shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a good place to start, it deals with a Marine Colonel who might be the first to get their own monument when this is over:

            Interesting! I'm subscribed to Abel Danger's YT channel, but this is news to me. I've watched a few of his videos, but lately haven't had the time to watch because they're usually an hour or so long. I love his style, so I'm going to try to make time to watch more of his uploads in their entirety. I feel so bad for him that his sister is this putrid creature.

            Presidential Field McConnell has linked his sister Kristine Marcy to Michelle Obama through their joint sponsorship of black-market organ trade in blood and body parts allegedly taken from ‘assets under management' by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and SOS Children’s Villages Illinois.  This is from Abel Danger.  The truth is coming out.  Drip.  Drip. Drip.

can you back this up instead of just mentioning Abel Danger's history.
What are your concerns with his "history"

               I'm not sure how much research you've done on the Jon Benet case, but this makes a lot of sense. John Benet worked for a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.

                Comey was also at the head of Lockheed at one point and I bet he is still involved in some way.  There is a lawyer in Ohio named Cliff Arnebeck that claims someone arranged a plane accident and a guy got killed (have forgotten name).  The NTSB never delved into it because the plane was taken to Lockheed in Ohio and who knows, there it remains.  There is a lot of kooky stuff with Lockheed. These are evil people that have gotten themselves in so deep they cannot get out, even if they wanted to. Also I remember at one point after the murder, it was reported on the news that a guy in Thailand (a teacher) was picked up and escorted back to the U.S. by the CIA.   There are so many ifs and whats to this story.

             Wait?!!  Really??? Kristine Marcy is his sister???  If that's the case then some of this stuff has to be true.  He wouldn't say this stuff about his sister unless she is a truly evil disgusting monster-  what it's looking like is the case

             Wow.  At the end of the video it gives advice to join the Organ Donor Program.  Sen. Ted Kennedy of Conn. just proposed a bill to automatically enroll people, so if you do not want to give your organs, you will have to know to opt out.  Many will not know and their organs will be given when they do not want to.  This is an FYI.

              It takes awhile to get into their shows. I'm not saying it's bad, actually I like it, but, as someone who likes it, I can fairly say it's basically two older guys who don't care about their production quality. That's mainly because they care only about the content. And Field McConnell has a strange sense of humor.  Having said all that, I feel much more informed after listening to them for awhile.
