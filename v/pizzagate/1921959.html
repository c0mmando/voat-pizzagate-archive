<p>The religious organization has sold numerous Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO properties to the Kushner Cos., which Jared Kushner headed until he stepped aside to serve as senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Trump.</p>
<p>Kushner Cos. and its investment partners paid $340 million for the Watchtower\'s Brooklyn Heights headquarters complex at 25-30 Columbia Heights — which has an iconic red neon sign that says “Watchtower” on it.</p>
<p>In DUMBO, Kushner Cos. and its investment partners paid $345 million for 85 Jay St., a parking lot with about 1 million square feet of development rights. And the company and its investment partners paid $375 million for a complex with former Bible-printing plants on Prospect, Adams, Sands and Pearl streets that it has turned into a techie-friendly office campus called DUMBO Heights.</p>
<p>The Watchtower, which has sold off many of its Brooklyn Heights properties, is starting to shut down the tunnels that connect them. Last week, the Jehovah\'s Witnesses deactivated one of the tunnels that connect their big Brooklyn Heights residential buildings by filling it with concrete.</p>
<p>The Watchtower\'s pedestrian passageways form an underground network extending from 124 Columbia Heights, which overlooks the Promenade, to The Towers, a former hotel on the corner of Clark and Willow streets.</p>
<p>The Watchtower closed off part of this underground network on Monday, April 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Andrew Porter, who has lived in Brooklyn Heights since 1968, saw a truck outside 124 Columbia Heights pouring concrete into the tunnel “through a raised access hatch” that day, he told the Brooklyn Eagle.</p>
<p>The concrete-filled tunnel stretches between 124 Columbia Heights and 107 Columbia Heights, which is a gated 11-story residential property with a landscaped courtyard.</p>
<p>City Department of Transportation permits indicate that both a concrete truck and “cellular concrete” pumping equipment were needed for the tunnel deactivation.</p>
<p>Cellular concrete, which is also called Foamcrete, is a lightweight cement-based material with lots of gas bubbles in it.</p>
<p>According to the Transportation Department permits, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York was in charge of the job.</p>

            I think they are supposed to be cute, but I also think they are supposed to represent human types or emotions.  I mean a guy with a moneybag for a head is obviously a greedy, possibly sinister character.   In fact, he stole that image from an old Thomas Nast cartoon about Boss Tweed.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I didn't know that.  That's interesting.  Do you agree that your article says in 2009 the JW signed an agreement with the DOT to fill in the tunnels and that this plan to fill these tunnels was years before we knew there would be any presidential campaign headquarted in Brooklyn in 2015 and 2016?
           </p>

             As to why it's a legitimate question.....because of questions about whether John Podesta was involved in a pedophile/child trafficking enterprise.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            OK. I see where you are at.  The tunnels are several steps down from the beginning of this case.  And you looks like you seem to believe that John Podesta is involved in such activities.  Is that accurate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I have not seen any evidence that John Podesta is involved in such activities and the chain of steps that builds on this original premise is unsupported speculation and that speculation is far from proven.  So to me I see this as a layering of doubtful thing on top of doubtful thing which increases the unlikelihood of the final step.  Mathematically, this means you are getting further and futher away from 1 aka 100% and getting closer to zero % which each step.  Metaphorically, it's building a house of cards where the slightest stressing the evidence brings the whole structure down.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why I kept asking you about the Brooklyn tunnels......because it's far from proven they used tunnels in DC, it's just speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            To respond to your points.
1.  I think GW is pretty dubious.  How does he connect the Awan Brothers to stolen cars?  I can't find reliable info on this.

             EAC .........an office a stone's throw from One Pierrepont Plaza is another red flag that nefarious activities may be afoot.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            So you are speculating a connection simply based on proximity, correct?  Is there anything else that raise a red flag for you?

            <p>
             INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana on Thursday cleared Planned Parenthood facilities that perform abortions in the state of any wrongdoing in the handling of fetal tissue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, on July 16 ordered an investigation of Planned Parenthood facilities in Indianapolis, Bloomington and Merrillville to see if organs from aborted fetuses were being sold. He was among a number of conservative lawmakers around the country who have called for investigations after an anti-abortion group circulated a video it made secretly showing some of its national officials discussing how they obtain organs from aborted fetuses for research. Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest provider of abortions, has said its donations of fetal tissue for research are legal.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Indiana Department of Health said in a statement Thursday that an investigation found no evidence of any laws being broken. Health department inspectors investigated the Indiana facilities on July 21.
            </p>

             Letters from the health department to the three Indiana facilities dated Tuesday and released to the media by Planned Parenthood said the agency had completed its investigation into the Planned Parenthood facilities that perform abortions in Indiana. The letters said the agency was “unable to find any non-compliance with state regulations. Therefore, no deficiencies were cited.” The letters say the complaint is closed.

             Anyway, that's the line of reasoning. I don't doubt that it's faulty and full of holes, and I very much welcome your efforts to debunk new discoveries. I hope, in the end, that you are proven entirely correct and there is absolutely nothing to see here, **but it seems like every time I'm tempted to think that, something new pops up. **

            I'll try to talk about both the reasoning and the thinking because both work together.   As I have mentioned a few times.  All people are prone to conspiratorial thinking. We are simply less rational than we think.  Our brain has some cognitive glitches and logic reasoning is something that needs to be studied and practiced or else we can trick ourselves

            When Trump built Trump Tower, he chose to use more concrete than steel. It was considered odd at the time, due to the mob running the concrete businesses; you wanted it, you bought it from them (and only them).

             While it's always good to have the details for arguing purposes, this is COMMON SENSE.  How could ANYONE believe that a billionaire whose home base is JEW YORK does not have criminal/mafia connections?

            If there's anything nefarious going on in these tunnels, it's probably not happening on the first underground level, but rather further down to the lower levels. If these underground tunnels are used to traffic and move children, organs, slaves, et al, they probably connect from the East Coast to the West and from South Mexico all the way up North to Canada and so, pouring cement in won't do anything except block access from the ground level to the first underground floor. The tunnels can still be accessed through the next connecting city or some other tunnel entry nearby.

              Your chance for promotion is imginary. You don't even know how to shill correctly. You should have built up trust by admitting to some of the research, and then go against the things you feared were the biggest threat. You even admitted you are a shill when you took such a stupid screen name. You suck at what you do. Nothing worse than a clumsy shill that just says "No it isn't", "No it doesn't", "This is stupid", "You are crazy", "You have no proof". You put the time in, but your effort sucks.

            So the Clinton campaign was working with Jared Kushner on this scheme?  Or were they working with Jehovah's Witnesses?
The backstory to this is as the fortunes of New York and Brooklyn changed and as the generations changed, the movement of people from the city to the surburbs changed to the kids who grew up in the surburbs flooding back into cities.  New York's population went back back over 8 million and that became a really desirable neighborhood.  DUMBO was industrial and is now very chic.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the Jehovah's Witness realized they were sitting over a billion dollars of valuable real estate and using it to print newspapers and for office space.   All these buildings they bought from the 1920s (and then connected with tunnels) could make them a giant profit.   So since 2004 they have been selling things off.  Check out this list of about $2 billion in sales
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Tower_Bible_and_Tract_Society_of_Pennsylvania#Brooklyn_property_sales">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Tower_Bible_and_Tract_Society_of_Pennsylvania#Brooklyn_property_sales
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Since some of these buildings were connected by tunnels they had to figure out what to do with them.  If you do any construction under city streets like a tunnel, you need an agreement with the city.  As the article Gilderoy links to says, the agreement to fill in these the tunnels is from 2009.  This has long been planned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Serious question on this.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             is legitimate question of whether John Podesta and Huma Abedin whose HQ in Brooklyn Heights may have had been involved in any subterranean activity in the area.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Why does this very unlikely scenario feel legitimate to you?  can you trace the steps to how we got here?  I ask because this will illustrate several issues that are well known to cognitive scientist that make us believe the the stories we tell ourselves even if those stories are not real.

            I am so with you on this.  It is so highly intriguing.  Maybe there will be more filling of tunnels.  Maybe this is one way to stop their moving of the trafficked people all over the country.  These are their underground rat lines.

            What do you suppose is behind such a shut down of tunnels? Watchtower was a free paper the JW would hand out at doors or on the street.  In a way it is sad to see them filled in, the could be put to good use if we did not have so many bad actors willing to put them to bad use.  I read your article
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Gilderoy">
             @Gilderoy
            </a>
            about the Bar/Restaurant and it was a magnificent idea.  Artist Colonies would also find a home there as well.

             I suspect the plan to shut down the tunnels made the buildings easier to sell.  The tunnels were built to connect properties that the JW owned.  Now they are selling them off one at a time.  If I buy a building, I would not want the risk it was connected to some property that is not mine.

Get out of here and get a real job at the Human Rights Campaign or some other non-profit where you can canvas (aka stand on the side of the street and ask people for their credit card numbers) instead of SHILLING for a living. NO ONE TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY.
