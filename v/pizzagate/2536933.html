<p>Wyss, who contributes millions to many high-profile liberal causes, is a financial donor to Harvard, the Clinton Foundation and Podesta’s Center for American Progress. Last fall, prosecutors in Morris Township, New Jersey, opened an investigation into an alleged brutal 2011 sexual assault of Jacqueline Long, then an employee of Wyss’ foundation.</p>
<p>No charges have been filed, but prosecutors did not respond to a DCNF inquiry in the last week about progress in the case.
Advocates for sexual victims criticized the total silence from each of these high-profile liberal institutions.</p>
<p>“The silence can actually send a loud scream to other survivors. It sounds like they are saying, ‘The money is more important than the survivor,’” Karen Baker told The Daily Caller News Foundation. She is the CEO of both the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. For decades, Wyss lived in West Chester, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Saying nothing always sends a bad message,” added Kirsten Houser, the chief public affairs officer at the center. “That’s not the message that instills principles of prevention, of caring about the well-being of the full community.”</p>
<p>“Many are saying this is a societal issue with far reaching implications, and we want to see companies and other institutions more aggressively address this to take a stand,” Houser told TheDCNF in an interview. “We want to see them live by those priorities, and when people don’t, you can be risking the support of your base,” Houser said.</p>
<p>The Swiss billionaire uses his private Wyss Foundation — with total assets of nearly $2.2 billion — to spread his money around to large institutions and to liberal political groups, according to his Form 990 reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>In the 2016 election, Wyss also was the architect for a liberal $100 million “Democracy Program,” which sought to create a “surge of registration” to win future elections, according to a memo obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. The billionaire has never become a U.S. citizen and remains a citizen of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Harvard accepted two Wyss gifts of $125 million each — in 2009 and 2013 — totaling $250 million. It led to the establishment of the Wyss Institute of Biologically Inspired Engineering. The institute continues to bear his name.</p>
<p>TheDCNF asked if the Harvard institute would distance itself from Wyss or temporarily take his name off until he is cleared of an alleged crime. Benjamin Boettner, the institutes’s spokesman replied, “That’s not going to happen.”</p>
<p>J. Robert Flores, the former administrator of the Department of Justice’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which he led from 2002 to 2009, told TheDCNF he saw Harvard’s reaction as a classic response from an “insular” institution.</p>
<p>“Harvard is an insular community,” he said. “Your faculty, your donors, the companies that do business with Harvard. I think what you’ll see is a lot of secrecy at Harvard. You will see a tremendous amount of pressure to ‘go along’ with decisions that people have made to protect the institution.”</p>
<p>“What they’re showing right now by not taking any action is what you would expect from an insular community: ‘We don’t have to explain ourselves to anyone.’ The world will not allow you to do that anymore. Now, they have to explain themselves,” he said.</p>
<p>Flores is a former prosecutor with expertise in internet crime, child abuse and exploitation, and juvenile justice issues.</p>
<p>Matthew Vadum, the senior vice president of the conservative Capital Research Center, agreed with Flores.</p>
<p>“Harvard wants to hang onto the money and wants to keep the spigot open so it can get more money in the future,” he told TheDCNF. “I gather that’s why they’re not even interested in discussing Wyss’ behavior.”</p>
<p>Flores also made the connection to Harvard and former President Bill Clinton. “This is kind of like Bill Clinton 20 years ago where there was just an assumption: ‘The rules don’t apply to me.’ And I think Harvard is basically taking the same approach. They don’t apply to us.”</p>
<p>Students, faculty and alumni have expressed concern over Harvard’s dedication to confront sexual harassment and assault. Only this month, Harvard named a new director for its small Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. The director’s post had been vacant for nearly year and the office had been operating with about half of its allotted staffers, who are there to prevent and assist sexual assault victims.</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation itself accepted a $5 million donation from Wyss in 2013 for its “Open Ceilings” project, which the foundation describes as an effort to “chart the path forward to accelerate full participation for women and girls in the 21st century.” The foundation did not respond to a DCNF inquiry about the status of Wyss and his gift.</p>
<p>Vadum adds that he is not surprised by the Clinton Foundation’s silence about Wyss. “The ‘hide under a rock’ Clinton strategy worked a lot of the time for them. I’m not surprised that they’re trying to blow smoke here,” he said.</p>
<p>The Center for American Progress, founded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential chairman John Podesta, also has a close relationship with the Swiss billionaire, whose net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $6.85 billion. Podesta awarded Wyss a board seat at CAP, which he still enjoys today.</p>
<p>Over the years, CAP received at least $4 million in funds from Wyss. Podesta also served on the board of Wyss’s HJW Foundation from 2009 to 2013, according to his White House financial disclosure form. In 2012, before he joined the Obama White House as a “counselor to the president,” Podesta also revealed in his form he personally accepted $87,000 for delivering unspecified “consultation” services to Wyss and his foundation.</p>
<p>CAP and former Sen. Tom Daschle, the group’s current chairman of the board, did not reply to repeated DCNF inquiries about the status of Wyss on the group’s governing board. From 1995 to 2001, Daschle served as the Democrat’s Senate Majority Leader. The high-profile Democrat had to withdraw his name in 2009 as President Barack Obama’s proposed secretary of Health and Human Services after it was discovered he failed to pay $140,000 in taxes.</p>
<p>On its website, CAP claims to identify with women who have faced sexual harassment. Sexual harassment, the liberal think-tank states, “has persisted in workplaces across industries and occupations for decades. For years, victims have unfortunately stood on unsteady ground in an environment that has been too lax about and too dismissive of sexual harassment allegations.”</p>
<p>But in the Hansjorg Wyss case, neither the organization nor Daschle voiced support for the victim, publicly commented on the case or suggested any action pertaining to Wyss’ place on the board. They’ve simply remained silent.</p>
<p>Vadum, who has followed both CAP and Wyss, charged the group’s stand reeks of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>“They lecture us about how to behave,” he told TheDCNF in an interview. “They stress the finer, more esoteric points of ‘political correctness’ while at the same time, shaming all those who fail to adhere to those standards. You would think they would at least take it seriously with someone that close to their organization who’s accused of Wyss’ sexual improprieties.”</p>
<p>Flores added the CAP board has a duty to confront Wyss. “The board ought to confront Wyss and say, ‘Did you do this?’ And if you don’t answer the question fully for our satisfaction then we’ll take that to the full board, and we will ask to have you removed.’”</p>
<p>Wyss’s history of allegedly aberrant sexual behavior was cataloged by Ryan DiMaria, a previous attorney for Long, in a May 8, 2013, memo sent to Wyss’ lawyers and obtained by TheDCNF. “Ms. Long’s position is and will always be that she is suing for damages on account of the personal physical injuries and physical sickness she suffered literally at the hands of Mr. Wyss,” DiMaria charged.</p>
<p>“The sexual behavior that Mr. Wyss required Ms. Long to participate in ran the full gamut of rather perverse sex acts,” her lawyer wrote, graphically outlining eight sex acts Wyss allegedly forced Long to endure.</p>

Wyss’ lawyers stated the agreement with Long “acknowledged that the agreement’s confidentiality was of the utmost importance and that without plaintiff’s unequivocal commitment to keep the settlement agreement and its terms confidential, defendant would not have entered into the agreement.”</p>
<p>The earlier settlement did not address wrongdoing, but it does not preclude authorities from independently bringing criminal charges.</p>
<p>In January, TheDCNF reported Morris Township prosecutors had opened a new case, “State vs. Hansjorg Wyss,” concerning the alleged brutal sexual assault by Wyss at the Governor Morris Inn in nearby Morristown, New Jersey.</p>
<p>The prosecutor’s document confirmed the receipt of sexual paraphernalia from Long, including a “purple vibrator.” She alleged in the complaint the device was used by Wyss as a weapon during the assault against her.</p>

            Very well documented and written. Wyss is getting his, as I hope many others will. Keep in mind that we here at Voat Pizzagate are on the front lines. Some dirt bag like Wyss being investigated should give all of us here hope. We are, whether we see it or not, causing some huge ripples in this 3rd dimension time warp and the evil is finding it harder and harder to hide. Yes, the waves of justice are starting to wash up the truth on the beaches inside our hourglass. Time is running out!! We are in a fight to the finish, trying to expose all of it before the A.I. technology finally takes over.The fight is for humanity. believe me or don't believe me, this is a spiritual war and for whatever reason, many of us here, regardless of the ridicule and frustration, are on the front lines. I hope there are recruitments coming, but for now it is just us. Wyss being exposed is a little nugget of hope that all will exposed. The scum like Robert Lantos will have no place to hide. NO Black Cube to do their dirty work, no agency to murder and destroy the whistle blowers. Stand tall, we are winning!!!!!

            More #FIGHTING BACK.  That's great.  Glad to see the Daily Caller is following this part of the Wyss story, but there's a lot more:

            Can someone list the horrid charges here.  Are they in the Daily Caller?  As much as I will hate reading them, we need to know.  Evidently Wyss is an alleged Sexual Pervert.  Also I tried to find the email reminding JP of the date with Wyss.  It seems there is a lot of playing with promises on the internet, but it is not listed. Games the internet plays.

              http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/29/wyss-sexual-assault-investigation/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             From the article:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The 2011 assault allegedly occurred when Long had a personal relationship with Wyss. But in April, she told Wyss she wanted to end the relationship due to mounting abuse, according to the handwritten complaint Long filed with the Morris Township Police Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             In her complaint to Morris Township police, obtained years ago by TheDCNF, Long said, “I told him I wanted out of any relationship and just continue to do my work.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Long was allegedly enticed to quit a job in Aspen, Colorado, in 2009 to join Wyss as a marketing manager to the billionaire’s winery along with his HJW Foundation. Later, she left both entities and joined the Wyss Foundation also as an employee. At both foundations she tried to fund programs for underprivileged and abused women and children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long helped to establish and fund a Colorado-state sex and human trafficking task force led by the Denver Police Department when Wyss made the job offer. She continued with the task force and still works with it today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long previously told TheDCNF Wyss also promised her he would cover costs for her daughter Callie, who was entering the Betty Ford Center. She was suffering from prescription and substance-abuse problems.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over time, however, Long’s relationship allegedly devolved into a “pattern” that ran “the full gamut of rather perverse sex acts,” according to a May 8, 2013 letter by Ryan DiMaria, a previous Long lawyer, to Carolyn Short, one Wyss’s top lawyers.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Wyss had a pattern and practice of carefully executed grooming and victimization of women,” DiMaria charged.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Ms. Long felt she had no choice but to acquiesce to most of his demands and fell victims to his deviancy due to her financial dependency on him and the well-being of her daughter,” DiMaria alleges.
            </p>
            <p>
             DiMaria detailed “bizarre fetish demands,” including “a fetish for sadomasochism and introduced the aspect of pain and physical injury into the sexual acts.”
            </p>
            <p>
             At the New Jersey hotel, Wyss assaulted Long physically and sexually, according to her police complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Me screaming, ‘No stop it,'” she wrote in her own handwriting to police. “He grabbed my teeth with his left hand and ripped my mouth open. He inserted a vibrator into my vagina and almost suffocated me by putting his fist into my mouth. I struggled and pushed. I thought for sure he was going to kill me,” she wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I left that hotel room sick and in pain,” she told police in the statement. She returned to Boulder and “stayed in bed for weeks. The physical sickness of this event was devastating,” she told police.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wyss also allegedly threatened to stop his financial support for her daughter if she broke up with him, according to Long.
            </p>
            <p>
             “She’s probably one of the first who took on powerful men over sexual misconduct,” recalled Boulder Police Chief Tom Koby in an interview with TheDCNF. He personally knew the Boulder resident and counseled her about her relationship with Wyss.
            </p>
            <p>
             “After the attack, I had breakfast with Jackie at the Hotel Boulderado. She broke down during breakfast. This thing had happened and it was terrible. She was quite shaken and Jackie doesn’t shake too easily,” Koby said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Hans had her in a bind in terms of helping Jackie heal her daughter, who had some serious health addiction issues,” Kolby added. “That was what was keeping Jackie in the relationship and she didn’t have a lot of money. She was still clinging to the hope she could save her daughter. And that she had these things she wanted to do with these organizations working on detention homes and shelters in Boulder and in Denver,” Koby recalled.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Although the alleged assault occurred in 2011, Long instead focused on her daughter’s condition after the incident. Callie died on Dec. 12, 2013. Long traveled to Morris Township three months later and filed her handwritten complaint. Long told the police her daughter had died. “That is why I am free now to report this incident,” she wrote in her March 12, 2014 complaint." "

              Is Wyss possibly another NXIVM cult member?  He is very close to JP and sits on the Board of CAP.  Hmm.  Anything is possible.  Masochism is what stood out for me.
