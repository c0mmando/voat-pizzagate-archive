<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rN5Hemo.png">https://i.imgur.com/rN5Hemo.png</a> - &quot;Women with conviction, and young women especially are the most terrifying thing to men, and anyone in general.&quot; No.. just... no. That does not even make any list of the most terrifying things to men, or anyone in general. What a ludicrous thing to say and believe.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/boW8BHY.png">https://i.imgur.com/boW8BHY.png</a> - &quot;Blah blah genitals is the photo series proving masculinity is evolving beyond stereotypical notions of what it means to &quot;be a man&quot;. Tap the link in bio to see this and more beautiful portraits of boys trying on make-up and dresses for the first time. Comment calls them out for sexualizing images of young boys. Don\'t think I need to add to that comment... but I want to add this: WTF</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ip07uYk.png">https://i.imgur.com/Ip07uYk.png</a> - Lila Moss is Kate Moss daughter. 16 at the time this is taken. There she is pictured with a naked barbie doll on her head. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/VJg7hpm.png">https://i.imgur.com/VJg7hpm.png</a> - Chloe Sevigny has been featured a lot in this series. She was of course a star of the sick film &quot;Kids&quot; about young guys who go are trying to take even younger girls virginities. The director Larry Clark is a creep who has shot some disturbing photographs but that would be a bit of a detour to go into. Chloe also did a scene in one movie where she gives the director of the film, Vincent Gallo an actual  blow job. #girlpower #womenwithconvictions</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/eSB6O3x.png">https://i.imgur.com/eSB6O3x.png</a> - Pop star Zara Larsson is apparently their sex and relationship columnist.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7yUemtq.png">https://i.imgur.com/7yUemtq.png</a> - The new face of indie horror is this girl who is apparently 16 at the time but looks about 12. Star of show &quot;hereditary&quot; which I\'m fortunately not familiar with.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/aoqKJwJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/aoqKJwJ.png</a> - One eye symbolism</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zd4cMOp.png">https://i.imgur.com/zd4cMOp.png</a> - Just some more twisted bs &quot;The Ultimate Fantasy&quot;... This is some weird video I took two screenshots from</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/wRIf0vQ.png">https://i.imgur.com/wRIf0vQ.png</a> - Second one &quot;Love comes in many different disguises and doesn\'t follow any written rules&quot; I disagree. Here is one rule. Leave kids out your sick fantasies and twisted propaganda. There. That is a rule. It is written now. Please oblige Dazed magazine.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Nazn0jI.png">https://i.imgur.com/Nazn0jI.png</a> - &quot;Complicit - A reminder that desire has no age-limit&quot; Of course they pretend they just mean because these guys are on the older side but I think we know that philosophy of theirs works both ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/unOJJ33.png">https://i.imgur.com/unOJJ33.png</a> - They just love Marina Abramovic</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/h67vJgG.png">https://i.imgur.com/h67vJgG.png</a> - Their favourite summer movies.. including &quot;lesbian teen dramas&quot; which I\'m genuinely hoping is not the film from which that screenshot is taken.</p>

           This is research into Rachel Chandler's friends, as requested by Qanon. A lot of connections arise from this as promised by Q, including: Epstein, Clinton, Chloe Sevigny, Biden, Marina Abramovic, Terry Richardson, Downtown Standard Hotel, Dazed magazine (heavily involved) and many more. The themes include some very nsfw material, lots of nudity and semi nudity or suggestive content with young and young looking models (ages unknown in most cases). The usual TDS propaganda and deep state talking points are promoted heavily throughout which should come as little surprise, abolish ice, anti gun control, climate fearmongering etc. There is a lot of tedious work and screenshotting included in this and more help would be useful.

Tap the link in bio to see this and more beautiful portraits of boys trying on make-up and dresses for the first time. Comment calls them out for sexualizing images of young boys.

           - Chloe Sevigny has been featured a lot in this series. She was of course a star of the sick film "Kids" about young guys who go are trying to take even younger girls virginities. The director Larry Clark is a creep who has shot some disturbing photographs but that would be a bit of a detour to go into. Chloe also did a scene in one movie where she gives the director of the film, Vincent Gallo an actual  blow job. #girlpower #womenwithconvictions

            Kofiannan, you might want to consider adding hyperlinks to all of the different submissions you've done in this series, at that end of each submission so people can easily hop from one to the next. That will be particularly handy for future researchers.
