            For me, the censorship is the most telling. The theory really never had a smoking gun, just a couple of socially undeveloped folks looking at Instagram posts the wrong way (sorry, just being honest, those posts are jokes). A couple of interesting things here and there like email content, the Madeline McCann mugshots, hotdog stand, etc. but nothing that could push a non-believer really over the edge. You know what's pushed me over the edge? The 1984-level overreactions.

            If there was nothing to worry about, it should have been swept under the rug just like the flat earth theory, with just a small blip in the news once the incredibly irrelevant B.o.B brought it a bit more to the mainstream.  It should not be getting the attention of the media, the Pope, Congress, etc. etc. etc. if there's nothing to it. Maybe some help getting Comet Ping Pong some higher security if his DC buddies thought he was in danger and a couple of fluff pieces, but all this? Nah, something is up.
