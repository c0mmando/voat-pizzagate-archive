            Thats what iv said in another post. They will focus on other countries first so eventually Americans will start to see a pattern and believe its possible in theirs. Then demand a real investigation. A psyops i can actually get behind!

            This kind of thing has been happening for decades, the taking down of individuals and small groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me it just seems like a necessary culling to appease the public that the government is hard on organized child exploitation/abuse when in reality the people in these power positions are involved or atleast blackmailed into offering protection.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is similar to drug trafficking/dealing in the USA. There are power players involved and they just sacrifice/cull the low level players in order to keep their cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know DEA/CIA has ties to trafficking and ATF has ties to gun running. What else is going on?
           </p>
           <p>
            From the outside looking in, it appears to be like mafioso organized crime in hierarchy where once you get to a certain level you are "made" and protected, to a certain extent.

             bullseye. Start with pizzagate as the pyramid cap. List known associates and keep working outwards. Need to assume the heirarchy then fill in the names.

            <p>
             I wonder if finding who killed all these officials, reporters, medical examiners, low-level flunkies and kids (Clinton body trail) could provide some leads to who hired them, who paid for it and who benefited most. Start targeting heavy-weights.  (see Finanical Sector as well as Political and Foreign associates) I suspect the deaths were for more than just maintaining political control.

              /v/scientology
             </a>
             and post a negative on scientology the mod's will delete you, all of voat is this way the assholes(wolves) in this case real pedophiles are the mod's, there game here on

              v/pizzagate

             is to normalize pedophilia, and they're trying to steer people in that direction
            </p>
            <p>
             The only narrative that mod's allow is the the NYT narrative that CPP is center, and that its HQ for clinton to fuck children at satanic party's. This narrative is bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is about 8 million missing children worldwide and investigating where did they go.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most children in DC that dissapear go to Saudi to be fucked and become household pets (slaves) then post 14 they're shipped to ISRAEL whore houses. Then their organs are harvest after they're warn out the Organs passed back to the world via Tel-Aviv.

            Hardly a surprise that CIA is claiming fake news when they've been creating fake news since it began. FBI can gather evidence but it can't prosecute. Does NSA have the authority do do anything? All they do is collect data right? does NSA have the authority to arrest and prosecute? Would they be able to arrest civilians and charge them in a military court?
