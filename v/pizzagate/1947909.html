           I think this ties into Pizzagate and the Seth Rich murder, because everything Webb is doing is going to undermine these investigations and discredit "citizen journalists", among a lot more. Not to mention that they are now getting more attention and going mainstream, which could really screw us up.

             Completely agree with Monty.  He's one of the few people on YT talking about this with any sense. Crowdsourcing for information was actually started by the citizen pizzagate investigation.  The concept has now been hijacked and the gullible just can't see that.

            I Wouldn't trust either of them. In order for this investigation to make any progress, we should all avoid both of these disinfo schmucks. Too many lies. Too much misdirection.

            I think George might be starting to worry the establishment... Everyday he makes links but all people care about is attacking his character.. Can some of you obsessive haters pleas point to some of the lies you say he is spreading??
           </p>
           <p>
            At best he is a super investigator at worst he is a  good reporter..  If he is crazy he will go to far and the police will deal with..  If he is CIA/Mossad trying to destroy Youtube us brainwashed cult members will make this judgement call when he starts down this path..  If he is getting close to the truth we will continue to ask the attackers for evidence of mis-direction and lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just chill and see what he uncovers.. I have been following for a long time and I don't see WTF all these trolls are on about...  We know people like the UK ambassador to US Murray knows and been watching him... So to those who are not familiar with Webb please don't rush to judgement.

             Think about this, if he was arrested the other day and then questioned by the FBI over the dirty bomb scare, don't you think he would not be allowed to, or be advised to not discuss more of this on the news and on live stream? He's being allowed to continue this by someone.

              what's a bomb scare?.. Try and prove some of the links he is making as wrong.  He obviously has sources as again and again he beats the media to stories... Why don't you ever mention the Awan brothers? so if he received information about radio-active material on the ship - he should report it..  Again the media is ignoring the Awan story along with the shill army on Voat..

            Dave does delete all his videos quickly and he did threaten George's kids in another video in great detail, and then sort of apologized, but it definitely all seemed staged. Neither of them can truly be trusted due to some of the statements made along the way, but George does unveil truthful information along with some false theories and many glaring omissions. He is very selective about his scope, however he cannot be fully dismissed. Dave may be a way to victimize or humanize George, and there are in-depth games at play, that much is certain.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether David Seaman, Robert David Steele, Alex Jones, Roger Stone, George Webb, Dave Acton, Jason Goodman, Trish, Defango, the Rabbit, or any of the others, it doesn't matter. We support them all as a gateway to finding the real truth, and we continue to offer up the challenge to anyone that will investigate Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tonight's lead from George about Karachi brings up many more links to Racine and Chicago. They are tied at the hip. Does anyone out there even want to solve Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption? How long has Alex Jones been "exposing corruption"? How many days did it take to find Eric Braverman openly speaking at a conference? Is it more profitable to render ongoing care than to cure the root problem?
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether George will admit it or anyone else, some day you will all learn that a main "root" of the problem was in Racine, Wisconsin all along. It's not just Karachi as a global hub, and it's not just the Awans. This same model is everywhere. Ghana, Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Brazil, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Panama, Mexico, Canada, and all over the U.S. - Pennsylvania, Denver, DC, Chicago, Hollywood, and Arizona are a few. Both major parties and many major industries are involved. They use real actors like Ashton Kutcher (see affiliations with Kabbalah, freemasonry, Clintons, McCain, etc.), and fake actors like YouTube "citizen investigators".
           </p>
           <p>
            What they are trying to do is diminish revelations from a real person in a real community with the real truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It's not just us, but if they are using Racine as a model, then so should we. One could see these videos as a way to offer up the Clintons, Awans, DWS, and a few others as a sacrifice and a way to keep people thinking justice is around the corner, but never really arriving. What cannot happen is a Viral Global Awakening about the real truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            The working theory is that those involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption have a rule. Everything is out in the open. It can be obfuscated, it can be in movies, or music, or art, or business, or philanthropy. The more out in the open, the better. This seems to be a key component. It is like the mafia going legit or partially legit, while also letting everyone know if you mess with them you will pay for it. This never went away, and it is more out in the open then ever. Why do you think there are so many pizza shops in Wisconsin?
           </p>
           <p>
            In everything you see, there is some level of truth. Some information either included or excluded. Over time it becomes easier to filter as you correlate with what are known truths and your own working theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know Racine is a major hub for Human Trafficking. We know Racine is the birthplace of community policing and sustainable development with the Bushes and Clintons. It is a Bellwether district of great political importance. It is home to the Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society, freemasons, Rotary, and mafia with links to Committee of 300, Club of Rome, Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations, and many foundations and PACs. It also has one of the most valuable resources in the world (Lake Michigan). We know Racine is an experimental model for mass incarceration, infant mortality, education reform, viruses and vaccines, dialysis, education reform, local and regional government control, social surveillance, fake news, social justice, and racketeering.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is being setup. Who will knock it down?

             Wisconsin, have you seen any of Dave Begotka's videos. He started making YT vids in response to the Steve Avery doc series. He's said some pretty interesting things about occultism in Wisconsin. His take definitely changed my prospective of the Avery case. This is his first video about the "Club".

              Yes we have seen his videos, and while he is not the most credible of people with his own set of problems, he is absolutely correct about some of his observations. Manitowoc is a small isolated community controlled by the same groups, satanic cults, and secret societies linked throughout Wisconsin. The entire state is a cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Many involved in lower levels do not realize what they are a part of, but play a significant role in the control mechanisms.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no place to turn for justice in Wisconsin, that much is apparent. Locals are easily bought off and controlled, the state is run by corrupt freemasons and the Marquette mafia, and the Milwaukee FBI office is a revolving door of corruption and incompetence.

              Please ask us about anything specific and we can get you more details either here or in a private message. Ask others who have contacted us. We try to oblige. It is a massive puzzle, but we know what we know. And we know that Racine is a major hub of massive Global Criminal Corruption, as well as a center for Human Trafficking (see The Fight to End Exploitation, a cover-up organization and who is behind it).
             </p>
             <p>
              Many different groups provided a range of evidence to the corrupt District Attorneys (look up the drunk hit and run case for fun to see why Rich Chiapete never did anything about corruption in his jurisdiction), then to the old and new corrupt police chief, then to the corrupt Sheriff, then to the corrupt Attorney General, and finally to the corrupt FBI and DOJ where it stopped with direct interference by Loretta Lynch. We had direct connections to Loretta Lynch, and as soon as she found out who was involved and how it linked to the Clinton Foundation and others, she immediately stopped the RICO investigations into Racine, which were only the tip of the enormous iceberg in such a small midwestern community. Even Paul Ryan was made personally aware of the criminal corruption involving the mayors, city administrators, city and county attorneys, and their network of corrupt associates. What do you think Paul did about it?
             </p>
             <p>
              We are still making new connections daily, while the bigger picture is being organized in a way that is easier for the masses to understand. We need people's help, not apathetic skepticism or blind ignorance. This is a very complex and dangerous web. Murders are not out of the ordinary, and we are not protected by Mossad or any other groups involved. Also, not that it really matters, but for the record, we are neither Jewish nor anti-semitic. We also don't believe that no one should go to jail. We don't think Obama is a nice innocent guy. We don't think they should go back to the old ways of trafficking and criminal corruption. We don't think this ends with the Clintons and Awans, and we don't think Pizzagate is not important.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is that our legislative, judicial and executive branches are broken. There is no fixing it through those slow archaic and corrupt avenues. Soon YouTube, Google, Facebook and other platforms will be broken. Chaffetz was right to a degree. It is too broken to fix. The only way is through the real truth and that window is closing. If anyone has a better path, we will support it, but Racine may be that path to show everyone how the world really works. Ronald Bernard is also revealing many truths, and what he says connects to Racine as well. Banking is a key component, and Racine has many ties to the World Bank and the system of using foundations for fraud, extortion, embezzlement, racketeering, and other crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              To anyone who has watched George Webb since the beginning, it is nearly identical to following Alex Jones. If you pay too close attention, you can see what they aren't saying. The closest George got to covering Racine so far was when he was covering dialysis. Why would dialysis be so important in Racine? Why did a dialysis clinic get a corrupt development deal recently in Racine? Look up DaVita Dialysis in Racine. George mentioned that before. That is just one small piece. We have evidence of direct racketeering, extortion, bribery, embezzlement, illegal campaign contributions and more tied to that one development deal alone. There is witness testimony including the mayor of Racine committing perjury about that very property, and one of the mayor's best friends pleading the 5th on over 100 related questions in the federal RICO case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now ask what major Racine company does business In Karachi, and who was arrested for pedo crimes in Racine? There is a start for you. Figure that out and then start asking questions.

                 You keep saying research this, research that.  If you have noticed when someone here has information they post it/they don't tell everyone to research it so they can know what the op knows.  I have read a number of Racine Wi post, references to 'we' and I've seen Racine Wi post elsewhere on other forums from a search last night.  If 'we' have so much information then make a post or start a Racine voat and list what all you know.  You (or 'we') said a lot of pizza places in Racine.  Well, what do you have on them?  Do you even have anything on them?  If you do then post and if you don't then ask for help with specifics.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Re dialysis...perhaps you are referring to keeping bodies in proper condition until organs and blood can be harvested.  Fine, if that's the case just say it.  This mystery 'research it' is getting old.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You ('we') either have hunches about what is going on in Racine and want help or intentionally taking ppl down another blind alley.  It is no surprise that corruption, extortion etc goes on in some city govt.  Look at Flint Mi.  Look at St. Louis, Houston, Dallas...the list goes on and on.  New flash, they all have lots of pizza places and they all have dialysis companies.  And lets not forget they all have corrupt legal systems, CPS...the whole gamut.  I looked up the DUI case you mentioned/anything more than incompetence then say so...none of this cloak and dagger stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you want help then say there is this pizza place (fill in the blank) that you want help with.  If you know what is going on at p place then share the information.  Same with anything else going on in Racine.  Be specific.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As it looks presently which of course is speculation, you've come here, make goading post for researchers to start picking apart Racine with somewhat of a superior attitude and for some strange reason expect everyone here to start putting Racine under a microscope with the promise it will bring down the house of cards.  Frankly I don't see that and you offer nothing more than false hope.  It would however, if ppl took the bait, shift their attentions from what's going on in DC and surrounding areas that ppl do have specifics on and send them in the opposite direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Oh, and the Bellwether issue...lots of cities and towns have signed on to Agenda 21 Model Communities Programme (MCP).  Is there corruption in the foundation...absolutely.  At first when I became aware of your posts here thought they were well written and perhaps you would start posting more of what you have found.  Now it's looking like a convenient diversion from where eyes are focused.  If you are disinfo/or diversion basically, I'll give you this...you write in a more professional manner than the ones who sound like functional illiterates and use every cuss word in their limited vocabulary.  Tell your boss I said give you ('we') a raise lol.

                  Well did you research any of it? We aren't going to cite every single sentence, and many comments, messages and posts have already provided many links. We are not going to repeat everything in every comment. Hopefully you realize by now this is the biggest network of criminal corruption in the history of the world. It cannot be summed up in one page.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pizza places - look into the name Infusino for one example. Infusinos have deep ties to the mafia including Bonanno, Madrigrano and Balistrieri families. Look into the Dennis Troha case in Kenosha also, or the Russian mafia case in Milwaukee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Dialysis - we provided more details on this. The major dialysis development in Racine was a study in racketeering. The local healthcare system is extremely corrupt and connected to the mafia. The elite come to Racine for blood transfusions, dialysis treatment and organ transplants. Racine is also a sanctuary city, a hub for opioid abuse, and one of the most highly trafficked areas in the country. Again look at The Fight to End Exploitation as one group pretending to address the issue while controlling the narrative.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The DA Case - do you really not see any significance to this? The person who is the highest local enforcement authority is a drunken fool who parties with corrupt officials, and among many other acts of corruption including refusal to investigate criminal corruption, after partying with corrupt officials he sped drunk down Main street, took out a light pole and nearly killed pedestrians, before running from the scene of the crime, meeting up with the corrupt city attorney to fabricate a story, going home to clean up, lying and obstructing the police, getting his wife to lie and obstruct the police, abusing the system by denying a breath test, getting a ride to the hospital and denying more tests, getting a ride back home that evening to his wife, avoiding all obstruction charges, and getting a cover up of all officials involved through the corrupt police chief. Is it just a coincidence that the state Attorney General is friends with the local corrupt DA and they are all freemasons? Is it just a coincidence that Loretta Lynch knew about RICO cases in Racine and stonewalled the entire investigation?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  How many Bellwether communities in the nation are there? Only 13, and Racine is a key district among those 13. Racine is directly linked to many of the other Bellwether communities through corrupt networks. Sure other cities have massive corruption and have signed on to Agenda 21, but Sustainable Development was officially created in Racine, Wisconsin with the Clintons. Racine is the global home to the lie of sustainability.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Racine is directly connected to the criminal corruption in both parties. Racine is directly connected to global criminal corruption through Sustainability and secret societies, most notably the Pilgrims Society and Knights of Pythias among many others.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Racine means Root, and it is indeed a main root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is not a "diversion" or a "hunch". Racine is directly linked to DC and many other hubs for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The point is that Racine is a weak link, and has deep connections that a city of this size would not normally have. If you are skeptical of anything, follow the money. Look at PACs and Foundations in Racine County.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What major Racine company works hand in hand with DuPont? Who was arrested for Pedo crimes in Racine? Why would a small city like Racine be so powerful on the global scale?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Please help shine the light on Racine, and see what happens. You will not be disappointed.

                   Personally I have not seen the information in all of your other posts.  I see some but I don't read everything everyday here and this is not uncommon for others here as well.  What I have seen tho is others asking you to make a specific Racine thread lining out all that you know.  Commentators have asked this a number of times.  In an investigation information is posted, not the cryptic research it.  Racine will get lost in the shuffle as others have so kindly pointed out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Your reply post is filled with information but how many will actually see it buried under the original post?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If indeed Racine is the weak link that you say then it is imperative that you post everything in an original Racine thread, update as necessary and give the ppl here something to dig into instead of digging around piecing together what you have said under other threads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Agreed, the DA case is a travesty but it's not that uncommon.  We had a local sheriff for years who was connected to the local brand of mafia who literally got away with murder.  He murdered his non white pg girlfriend/everyone knew/nothing happen.  He was a very popular sheriff, had all the right ppl in his bag and would probably still be sheriff today had he not crossed the wrong mafia guy so the sheriff was found drowned in his squad car listed as unfortunate accident. For Christ's sake, this is Arkansas, the Clintons have been killing off ppl right and left including children/everyone knows (that have eyes to see).  That's my point, corruption is rampant.  I was raised in Houston, don't even get me started.  Everyone with eyes knew Johnson was in on killing Kennedy and word traveled via the beauty shop grapevine of suicided witnesses, freak accidents and just plain disappearances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   None of this is new...and ppl have become accustomed to corruption/which of course was the intention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If Racine is indeed a weak link and could start the dominoes then why not heed the request of others here and start a Racine thread.  If you want to get the word out there is a more effective way to do it than cryptic comments here and there.  Post it here, maybe also r/ conspiracy and keep bumping it.  It takes awhile sometimes for something to take hold.  Consider the average attention span and the deluge of sensational stories that divert attention.  If you are persistent in Racine threads, not comments, the word will get out.  Show how it is the weak link.  Post everything you know and what is speculation post that too with the disclaimer it is speculation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That is my very best advice and it's been given by others before.  Take the good advice or not...ball is in your court.

                    Your sincere and honest feedback is appreciated. This is much too complex to be summarized in a few Voat submissions, and others have created threads about Racine here and in other places, but certainly more submissions would not hurt. We have also been monitoring and communicating with groups here and on other places to determine who is credible and who is not. Both leads and attacks come from all sides, whether links and details are provided or not. It is a working process with some very specific strategies, but you are right the ultimate goal is truth and exposure, and we do have something bigger in the works being developed that goes far beyond your standard voat thread.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Take the time to read more comments if you can. Message us for more specific details. Some information cannot be shared publicly. Most comments are posted very quickly as it relates to certain topics. Some original posts were created on Reddit which is when that entire sub was shut down. Your points are well taken, however and we will post more original submissions very soon. It is an ongoing investigation and extremely extensive.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You are right about other areas of corruption, and Arkansas certainly has its share. We know all too well about the Dixie Mafia which is also linked in Wisconsin. The point about Racine is that it is not a few corrupt people involved. It is much more, and the entire community is controlled. They also have no problem murdering people to cover up their crimes, which makes revealing some information especially dangerous.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Honestly we don't want the ball in our court. We never did. You won't find us on YouTube trying to get paid subscribers. The FBI and DOJ should have done their job, and as the cases escalated up the chain, we realized how deep the corruption went and how it linked back to Racine. We don't want to tell everyone exactly how it all works, because we want to use Racine as a litmus test to determine the truthfulness of other "investigators". We want others to start investigating for themselves who may not be in such peril. We want people to ask questions. We want people to try to disprove any of it. After 1000 or so comments posted here, none have been disproven. Everytime sometimes tries to cast doubt, we reply with additional information. We do not have time to cite every single statement, but we do have the supporting evidence.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Racine also needs a lot more of a spotlight than what a few posts on Voat will generate. We will heed your advice as we move forward with greater detail and intensity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    While the skepticism is certainly understandable, we have yet to see anyone else on here posting 1000 comments all linking back to a town under 80,000 population. The closest we have seen link to St. Louis and Pennsylvania, which both have significant ties to Racine as well. Look into Timothy Dolan (coincidentally moved from St. Louis to Milwaukee to New York -

                    ) and Bellwether districts (
                    <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/11/07/500379215/the-13-bellwether-counties-that-could-decide-the-election">

                    ) for some more connections on those.

                   <p>
                    Everything is connected. This is a global system. These are not isolated incidents of corruption and abuse, and it just so happens that an unusually significant number of connections all circle back to Racine, Wisconsin.

               Thanks for your response. I know that the NWO is a supra-national government made up of international bankers and intellectual elite using pedophilia as a control mechanism. The question is what to do about it.

                That is one of many forms of control. Murder is another, and money is one of the simplest forms of control, such as loan schemes and control through employment. They use any angle they can to control and hedge all sides of every person and issue. They have unlimited resources.

                What we can do is shine the light on places like Racine, Wisconsin to awaken the world to the real truth. Laws are selective. Rights are selective. Our government is corrupt. Our industries are corrupt.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only answer is a Viral Global Awakening through a real example like Racine. Once the lights are on, we will take action and unveil plans to restore balance to the world.

            The thing with George is that he comes off so kind, charming and confident. So, that sways people to trust him more. Especially women that like the strong alpha male type.

             You are correct except we don't believe that George is the alpha in the group. Obviously neither is Jason or RDS or HA Goodman or David Seaman or Defango or any of them. We do not think we have met the alpha yet. If it is anyone so far it is Dave Acton. Our guess is we may meet the alpha when we get closer to exposing the real truth. This isn't all happening organically on its own.

              I don't mean it that way. Its not about "which one". I'm a woman. I can see being weakened by his intelligence, power and take charge attitude, but especially his confidence and charm.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know I'll get haters over saying that but oh well. I'm not saying all women are attracted to that. But he's smooth and good at getting the ladies. That attracts many women. Where Dave, he has the intelligence and power but acts like a cocky prick. 5 minutes with him and he'd be considered a douche.
             </p>
             <p>
              My point is that the qualities that George has can really sway a lot of people to like him, trust him and follow him.

               No, I am the one who get hate for pointing out that women are naive and unfit for serious decision-making.  You also seem mildly retarded in the way you repeat yourself.  HOW CAN YOU SAY HES INTELLIGENT WHEN HES BEEN SPINNING LIES TO DISTRACT YOU, AND WHY WOULD A CON MAN NOT LIE WITH CONFIDENCE.

                Hey listen- We all know how hard it is to be a gay man in today's society what with the transgender community taking all your attention, but you need to calm the f down. The only thing worse than a hysterical woman is a hysterical bottom.

                           LOL I know of at least one comment that helped you personally break the Jewish media brainwashing.  Is that an exaggeration or a slur? It is a fact that all 8 original Hollywood studios were started by men born within 200 miles of each other in Eastern Europe.

                  First of all, he's not stupid or else he couldn't pull this off. 2nd, he doesn't have me fooled. That's why I posted this.

                  Yeah, usually men with little dicks with no self esteem are the ones that get jealous and out of control the way you did over my comment. Your obvious hatred for females and thinking they are stupid only shows your ignorance and insecurity issues. Not mine. I never stated my preference. I can see by your constant outbursts over these type of conversations, that you have issues of feeling manly and attractive. Have you thought about seeing a therapist sir? 🤔

                   I love women -- from traditional cultures.  White women are the worst of God's creatures: an organism with ZERO WILL TO PROCREATE, AN ABOMINATION​.

                    So you not only disrespect women. But now white women! You don't even know what I am. I may look like a beautiful black African princess for all you know. You gave me a good laugh tho. Say something else. This is fun.

                     I probably shouldnt.  As your biological instincts kick in enjoying being dominated by an alpha who puts you in your place, you will keep goading me into sending a dick pic, fall irresistibly in love with me, and you will end up pregnant.

                           Are you black? Lately I've remarked to dudes that black chicks are by far the nicest when you compliment them.  Then "Find Ebony Women Near you" ads start appearing in my browser even though i don't use internet dating or porn sites, which is lame and also foolish for a PG researcher to do.

                             This is your folly. Do you know what a "pattern" is, beyond the fabrics you love so much? Any race can be nice or pedos, the NUMBERS SAY black chicks and Jews are SIGNIFICANTLY OVER-REPRESENTED.  Then you make conscious and subconscious judgments based on this fact.

                             IF YOU CANT RECOGNIZE JEWISH NAMES YOURE A SHITTY PIZZAGATOR.  IF YOU CANT RECOGNIZE OCCULT NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS YOURE A SHITTY PIZZAGATOR.

                             I didn't know any of that shit either a few months ago.  Luckily, no doubt due to some Jewish blood, I am a genius and can internalize facts with the same rapidity with which your panties would drop, sodden as they no doubt ALREADY ARE just from this digital manhandling.

                              As I stated earlier, your PATTERN of woman bashing, and in general just being mean to others, shows an immature, insecure and bitter personality. Your low self esteem causes you to view others as lower than yourself. That's how your mind copes. But, my comment about an alpha male triggered you and brought out your insecurities. You lost it. You called me names and told me how stupid I was. You don't know me so it didn't hurt me. I actually enjoyed seeing you flip out like a bratty kid. But, all that you accomplished was making yourself look ridiculous and showing everyone here that you are weak.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              A little birdy told me that you were smart. I don't think it's very smart to be so narrow minded that you judge something by NUMBERS and close your mind to reality. Not everything is black or white. It's very immature to always comment nothing but mean things because mentally you can't cope knowing that others can be right too. It's unhealthy that you can't control your emotions.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I feel bad being mean even saying all this to you. I actually have a good heart. I know underneath that you do too. I'm not sure why you act out the way you do. Maybe you don't understand yourself. But, earlier you went off on someone that an extremely nice person. I was told about it. People had a hard time holding back. If you care about being a Pizzagate researcher, you should care about being a team. We're working for the same cause. It makes no sense attacking people over everything.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              You even twisted my words. I made the point that George can sway people more easily using his qualities. That makes him more dangerous. More likely for people to get sucked in. My point was that he's not fooling me!

                               Sorry i "went off" on someone and made them cry, I thought we were adults here.  Psyche, not sorry, y'all deserve to cry in shame for wasting MONTHS.

                               "As I stated earlier, your PATTERN of woman bashing, and in general just being mean to others, shows an immature, insecure and bitter personality. Your low self esteem causes you to view others as lower than yourself."

                               Fucking adorable, LMAO.  If it's a pattern clearly you didn't trigger it with dick jokes, dummy, and sorry if you spent 100k on a psyche degree, but calling people faggots and dipshits and getting under their skin with nonPC FACTS IS FUNNY.  MEN TALK LIKE THIS IN PERSON IN EVERY COUNTRY.  It's a form of solidarity like when blacks call each other niggas.

                                There are 2 things that stood out to me.
                               </p>

                                  There's no use in trying to reason with someone like you. You may become unhinged. You probably live in your parents basement and don't know how to socialize.
                                 </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                 <p>
                                  You obviously did care what people thought of you, because you kept coming back. I got under your skin and you hated it.
                                 </p>
                                </li>

                               <p>
                                Well hell, let me just add one more thing that stood out while I'm at it. I've studied psychology for years on my own. So, thank you for the compliment on my psyche degree!  You will be disappointed to know that I didn't spend a dime. Maybe I'm not so stupid after all. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you're mentally ill. Does that hurt coming from a woman? Poor baby. If you need a hug or advice, just come to mama!

                                  It doesn't have to be provable. It's obvious. Just like you can't prove any of the foolish opinions you have about everyone here. lol I got tricked by saying that Webb has qualities that people could fall for? Even tho I have been warning people about him for weeks and am not fooled? You make no sense. I'm sorry you don't have the ability to get the ladies. Maybe it's because you're a jerk.

                                   Weeks, eh? Impressive.  Here's some psycho babble for YOU, CUNT: you instinctively react by using vaginas and my ability to access them because apparently you realize that's all you're good for.  I am a jerk, but only for saying socially unacceptable facts. Like women being naive and having on average a lower IQ than me.  OOPS

               Cannot disagree, except that after watching 1000 videos, many of his weaknesses and untrustworthiness begin to show. With George, it's not what he investigates or says, it's what he does not investigate or say that is most important.

              <p>
               He is a likable person, and if you don't pay very close attention it would be easy to trust him. Trust only what you can verify.

            I think he's had far too many jobs with the US government, and is still working for them. I don't trust him as far as i could throw him. I wouldn't trust anyone with a temper like that, to begin with.

              Yep. And he can't pretend to be a friend to truthers if he's insisting on continuing this play, instead of taking care of George Webb in a more discreet way. If we're to believe he can't handle his brother, then why would anyone follow him for any reason anyway? If was a friend to truthers, he would leave us to do our research and stop littering the web with his drama and bullshit.

              (But thanks for keeping us posted. And by the way, i've just discovered that if you post about Webb too many times, you will earn yourself a group of haters who will follow you everywhere

            I think his "white paper" is very interesting. The demographics of George's cult members are most probably unfamiliar with "LARPING" and to be honest, I'd never heard of it until pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave is definitely the intelligent brother and I've changed my position on him - I don't think he's working with George. In saying that, I'm not investing much energy with either of them.

              I'm not going to defend Dave but he gave his reasons for doing that. George Webb triggers my anger too, and he's not even related.
             </p>
             <p>
              You either believe Dave or you don't.  I have no direct experience of what it's like to have a brother who truly believes that he's being targeted by Andrew McCabe and the FBI then have that brother be directly responsible for shutting down a US port.

                You know that Pakistani ISI was created by Robert Cawthome, an Australian-born British Army general officer and an officer of the Indian Army who later later served in the Pakistan Army, don't you?

               <p>
                The name Awan, or A1 as Americans like to pronounce it, is the equivalent of Kim in Korea or Lee in China. They were chosen because they are disposable patsies.
