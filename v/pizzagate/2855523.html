           <p>
            A directed-energy weapon (DEW) is a ranged weapon system that inflicts damage at a target by emission of highly focused energy, including laser, microwaves and particle beams. Potential applications of this technology include anti-personnel weapon systems, missile defense system, and the disabling of lightly armored vehicles or mounted optical devices.[1][2]
           </p>
           <p>
            In the United States, the Pentagon, DARPA, the Air Force Research Laboratory, United States Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center, and the Naval Research Laboratory are researching technologies like directed-energy weapons and railguns to counter maturing threats posed by fast missiles such as ballistic missiles, hypersonic cruise missiles, and hypersonic glide vehicles. These systems of missile defense are expected to come online in the mid to late-2020s[3] or later. Russia,[4][5][6][7][8][9] China,[10][11][12][13] India,[14] and the United Kingdom[15][16] are also developing directed-energy weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            After decades of R&amp;D, directed-energy weapons are still very much at the experimental stage and it remains to be seen if or when they will be deployed as practical, high-performance military weapons.[17][18]

              So nice to see you.  Yes, this is a bunch of baloney again they are trying to pull over on us.  It was so obvious even at the beginning.  We have researched this before on here. Thanks for the links.

            Ha! You read my mind! The High Speed Rail and the California cabal have been on my thoughts since I woke up this morning.

            DID DiFi/Blum have connections with the bidding on the high speed rail?
Answer: YES

            Sen. Diane Feinstein’s husband wins CA rail contract:
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Perini-Zachary-Parsons bid was the lowest received from the five consortia participating in the bidding process, but “low” is a relative term,” the Laer Pearce, author of Crazifornia wrote. “The firms bid $985,142,530 to build the wildly anticipated first section of high speed rail track that will tie the megopolis of Madera to the global finance center of Fresno. Do the division, and you find that the low bid came in at a mere $35 million per mile.”

            "• Feinstein's husband had financial interests in the railroad property adjacent to the Tesla and Solyndra buildings. Feinstein later got him the entire California high speed rail contract • The Feinstein family owned the construction company which Tesla and Solyndra, used. They were given no-bid contracts"

            "Feinstein associate: Roger Boas, was arrested for involvement in a child prostitution ring for political pedophiles, and for embezzling money for the Moscone Convention Center construction"

            "In 1958, together with future Mayor and US Senator Dianne Feinstein and Ron Pelosi, Boas was a key figure in the 1958 campaign that elected Clair Engle to the US Senate.[6] Four years later, Boas was himself elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, on which he served until 1973. An avowed liberal, he was quoted in 1968 (when he also chaired the California Democratic Party)"
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 1987, Boas ran to succeed Feinstein as Mayor, but was defeated by Art Agnos. His campaign posters still "dotted the city" the following year when, during a police sting operation that broke up a widespread teenage prostitution ring, Boas' face was recognized by one of the prostitutes as "a man who had been soliciting the ring for three years".
           </p>
           <p>
            Boas pleaded guilty on October 22, 1988, to seven counts of statutory rape involving teenage girls, with twelve more counts dismissed in exchange for his guilty plea. On November 19, 1988, he was fined $100,000 and sentenced to six months of community service."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Boas became Chief Administrative Officer of San Francisco under Mayors George Moscone and Dianne Feinstein from 1977 to 1986."
