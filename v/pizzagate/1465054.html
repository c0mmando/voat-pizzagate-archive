            Please, no more jerkoff posts like this. You don't need to announce what you are doing. Talk is cheap, so just do it and then talk about it. You are not telling anything new here.

             Sorry, but my investigation is being jeopardized by the children on message boards like these that want to shout "HEY, LOOK AT THIS" every time they see something, and then it tips off the suspects and then it prevents me and others from collecting it for evidence in our ongoing investigative research.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, no, this wasn't a stupid topic. I even mentioned I'll attach the info dump to this topic when it is ready.

              Yeah, but you just sound like you are jerking yourself off for attention. You don't have any substantial posts either. I'll wait for your evidence, but I wont hold my breath.

            Kudos to you sir! Surely there has to be a picture or video, somewhere out there someone has a picture or video that will make this legit, these people are sickos so they would have a treasure trove of that sick shit to watch later or blackmail with. Who's going to do the right thing and release it?
