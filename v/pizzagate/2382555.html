            This group will not investigate besta pizza...it is closer to the rot than comet pizza...also becuase there is an arab connection that is off limits...arabia ..seems to be the mecca controlling the logistics of the supply chain from thirld world countries..to encouraging psycopathy in the west to create the demand..
they sell a corrupted form of islam to create a brainwashed supply chain army..

            Google : aga khan afghanistan hotels
Why would they run high cost businesses that operate in war torn areas ..
           </p>
           <p>
            Agha khan is the successor to the ismailis that have created a false war with the templars for the merchants of this world..in 1099 it was for the merchants of amalfi and other city states ..now it is the freemasonic merchant networks..

             It's not that we won't investigate Besta, because we have done already. The problem with the Besta lead was that it seemed to come to a bit of a roadblock and it wasn't obvious where to go from there. It also doesn't have the same 'appeal' to it as the Alefantis lead due to ties to lobbyists and political figures. The heat of the matter seems to lie in that direction, but that doesn't mean that there sin't anything to the Besta thing, we maybe just need a little something to help us out.

              If u look at the time line of comet pizza leads...both of them were being investigated..but when besta leads were heating up..alefantis was pushed in front of the camera..too me that was to amplify the signal towards comet pizza..away from besta...i believe one of the leads pointed to shipping companies with connections to the ismaili underground..saudi since 1780s is a british psyop..with the aga khans as running the undeground cabling systems..
They dont want any investigatiins into the logistics..comet pizza does not have a shipping company lead..and being in washington where  investigations and media can be controlled ..they diverted attension away from the logistics lead..
The contrast of the  reaction of the front players in the game
is revealing..comet pizzas was controlled and calm..while the besta pizza guys were full of anger..its because the besta pizza was closer to day to day operations most probably..
If someone gets overtly angry ..that is a desperate sign from psychos that they are hiding something that is very dear to them..its animal instinct.. 
Listen to the speech aga khan gave to the canadian parliament ..and he gives a sneer when he talks about educating children in his foundations from a young age..he couldnt hide his pleasure..
I still believe besta is not touched because this group has been coopted ir is set up by the same forces.
