<p>I am in direct contact with Marianne Barnard, the lady who came out in October 2017 and accused fugitive director Roman Polanski of also sexually assaulting her when she was underage.

             For Roman Polanski, the holidays just weren't the same without fellow miscreant Harvey Weinstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             The pervy "Repulsion" director told friends at the Palace Hotel in Gstaad in Switzerland that he was bummed Weinstein didn't make the trip this year.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Polanski was having dinner at the hotel and expressed that he was 'disappointed' Harvey wouldn't be there," according to a vacationer who chatted with the 84-year-old filmmaker.
            </p>
            <p>
             Weinstein, who's under investigation for multiple counts of sexual assault, has been a New Year's fixture at the Palace for nearly a decade, we're told.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Every year Harvey used to give private screenings at the Alpina Hotel," according to our international spy. "He had reserved the theater last year for a (2018) screening. Everyone was disappointed that was cancelled this year."
            </p>
            <p>
             We're also told that Weinstein and Polanski would get together for "dinner or a drink" when the movie mogul was in town. Polanski has a home in Gstaad.

             In 2014, Weinstein hosted a screening of "Big Eyes" at the Alpina, where Polanski surprised guests by showing up...

We will never stop fighting for people like you, people who have to put the pieces back together after being broken by monsters. We will never stop fighting these monsters until they all go down.
