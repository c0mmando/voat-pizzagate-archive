This time I’m digging into JEANNE ALLERT and her associate CHRISTOPHER SPOONIRE, Chair of The Samaritan Women. Since the organization is alleged to aid in rehabilitating victims of human trafficking, this directly links to Peet-Za-Gate! I’m making like the humble gopher and digging into some things mentioned in Part 2. And, yes, this third part is dedicated to the FUCK YOU JAMES ALEFANTIS MONTH of June. </p>
<p>Part I: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1930700">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1930700</a> 
Part II: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1939012">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1939012</a> </p>
<p>First a couple things about THE SAMARITAN WOMEN, the organization Ms. Allert created. JEANNE ALLERT is mentioned in the following article on human trafficking. I almost fell over when the article made reference to PANDA, an underage trafficking victim: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.archbalt.org/least-helping-victims-modern-slavery-become-survivors/">http://www.archbalt.org/least-helping-victims-modern-slavery-become-survivors/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pepper spoke at a Samaritan Women home alongside two other survivors using pseudonyms, one just 17 years old.</p>
<p>Panda might apply herself as a tattoo artist, disguising the gang brands placed on people against their will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting pseudonym.  I mean, what are the chances? </p>
<p>The other interesting thing is that the article is written in 2017 and says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>explained Jeanne Allert, executive director of The Samaritan Women, which has harbored Pepper and 59 other women from 19 states since 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>59 women? That’s approximately ten women a year? That stat is consistent with what an article in 2016 quotes: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.naasca.org/2016-NAASCA-news/09Sep16-3-NAASCAnews.htm">http://www.naasca.org/2016-NAASCA-news/09Sep16-3-NAASCAnews.htm</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Samaritan Women in Maryland, which has helped 53 women through its two-year residential program since 2011. (Courtesy of The Samaritan Women)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something is not right with those numbers. Ten women per year? On a 2.5 acre land spread? Perhaps the reason is financial? If it is, she has this to say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, the Department of Justice released $14.7 million in funds for organizations that support victims — part of a $44 million anti-trafficking grant, according to a DOJ press release. The money went to dozens of organizations, including at least four offering adult residential services. 
There are few pools of available private funds, Allert said, describing how she knows of only two major foundations that have made sex trafficking a key part of their funding agenda. However, with clever grant writing, organizations can sometimes tap into sexual assault and domestic violence-focused funds, she said. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wonder if she was a recipient of those funds due to “clever grant writing”  
</p>
<p>Onto Mr. Spoonire: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.intelius.com/people/Jeanne-Allert/Baltimore-MD/0NPJEEKKKME">https://www.intelius.com/people/Jeanne-Allert/Baltimore-MD/0NPJEEKKKME</a></p>
<p>Please note the description of The Samaritan Women. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) offering a vocational program in culinary arts with an innovative &quot;from seed to table&quot; curriculum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, from the previous post, Part II. we know this “vocational” program means putting these traumatized victims in the fields and having them work for the privilege of learning a “vocation”. What vocation would that be? Migrant farmer? Oh, and also please note that he’s lived in Baltimore, MD and Colorado Springs, CO. He attended Colorado Technical University for three years. Phone numbers associated with him are from Maryland and FRESNO, California. Got that? MARYLAND, COLORADO and CALIFORNIA. It’ll come into play later on.  
</p>
<p>Like any good Chair of a human trafficker needs , Mr. Spoonire has acting as part of his credentials. </p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.exploretalent.com/chrisspoonire">https://www.exploretalent.com/chrisspoonire</a> </p>
<p>Then there’s Mr. Spoonire and Ms. Allert inevitably turning up on the Slumlord Watch list for completing renovations without a permit … and damaging a neighbor’s home in the process. </p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/tag/christopher-spoonire/">https://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/tag/christopher-spoonire/</a> </p>
<p>And the equally inevitable charge of driving with a suspended license: </p>
<p><a href="http://atlaspublicrecords.com/name/christopher-l-spoonire/baltimore-md/91da8d4477">http://atlaspublicrecords.com/name/christopher-l-spoonire/baltimore-md/91da8d4477</a></p>
<p>But where things start to go weird is on a forum he signed up for. It’s a site for actors, and yet he chooses to use a very, very strange picture that sends chills up and down my spine. </p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.stage32.com/profile/139078/photos">https://www.stage32.com/profile/139078/photos</a>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/1k7NM">http://imgur.com/a/1k7NM</a> </p>
<p>You can see that the other actors choose more traditional style photos to represent themselves. The pics deal with, well, ACTING! His? It’s a WTF moment! And he repeats it on his Instagram account that is set to PRIVATE. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/x1CgL">http://archive.is/x1CgL</a> </p>
<p>What is it with white people putting their hands all over disadvantaged youth? It’s not like any disenfranchised group has ever asked white people to do that—nor have they ever been made better for it! So I’ll just leave it there and let you draw your own conclusions as to why in hell he’d do that. It’s why I specifically included the description of THE SAMARITAN WOMEN. Nowhere in the description does it mention traipsing all over the world. Nonetheless, in Part II, they did mention going to Kenya as an “act of charity”. </p>
<p>Now let’s veer to something brought up in Part II, and it’s the registering of Ellipsis Partners LLC in New Canaan and a land transfer. First, David Prill appears to be more connected to the business than simply registering it. </p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.juralindex.com/prill-construction-group-llc.html">https://www.juralindex.com/prill-construction-group-llc.html</a> </p>
<p>As you can see, he and his wife are listed with Ellipsis Partners and it explains the land transfer. It was a foreclosure. Not sure what went on there, but the complainant were Imian Properties. Here’s a link about them: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.imianpartners.com/independence-beer-garden/">http://www.imianpartners.com/independence-beer-garden/</a> </p>
<p>Now we turn to the wedding of Katherine Abbey, Derek Prill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/fashion/weddings/katherine-abbey-derek-prill.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/fashion/weddings/katherine-abbey-derek-prill.html?_r=0</a> </p>
<p>First Derek Prill is a HUGE fan of Camp Lanakila part of Aloha Camps: </p>
<p><a href="http://surveyor-usmfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/phpWzMVSr/lanalog-2015.pdf">http://surveyor-usmfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/phpWzMVSr/lanalog-2015.pdf</a></p>
<p>Next, Derek wife’s father is Douglas D. Abbey, and Douglas D. Abbey was (quote taken from above NYT wedding announcement): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her father was a founder of AMB Property Corporation, a real estate investment management firm based in San Francisco, and is a lecturer at the graduate school of business at Stanford.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what happened to AMB Property Corporation in 2011? Why this: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703439504576115793342259946">https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703439504576115793342259946</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warehouse Giants AMB Property, ProLogis to Merge
By Anton Troianovski
Updated Jan. 31, 2011 4:23 p.m. ET</p>
<p>Two U.S.-based global warehouse landlords said Monday that they had agreed to merge, in one of the biggest real-estate deals since the recession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, isn’t that special? As we all know, warehouses can be used for so many things: </p>
<p><a href="https://stophumantraffickingny.wordpress.com/a-survivors-story/">https://stophumantraffickingny.wordpress.com/a-survivors-story/</a>
<a href="http://myfox8.com/2014/06/09/nc-man-charged-with-human-trafficking-held-woman-captive-in-warehouse-more-than-1-month/">http://myfox8.com/2014/06/09/nc-man-charged-with-human-trafficking-held-woman-captive-in-warehouse-more-than-1-month/</a></p>
<p>There’s no evidence anything like that is going on, but isn’t it interesting that AMB Properties is in CA (SF), and ProLogis is in CO, and Prill is linked to MD through Ellipsis Partners and Jeanne Allert, and that Christopher Spoonire is linked to those exact three states. </p>
<p>Like everything else, probably one big coincidence!</p>',

           And what happened to AMB Property Corporation in 2011? Why this:

            Warehouse Giants AMB Property, ProLogis to Merge

            Two U.S.-based global warehouse landlords said Monday that they had agreed to merge, in one of the biggest real-estate deals since the recession.

          <p>
           Well, isn’t that special? As we all know, warehouses can be used for so many things:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           There’s no evidence anything like that is going on, but isn’t it interesting that AMB Properties is in CA (SF), and ProLogis is in CO, and Prill is linked to MD through Ellipsis Partners and Jeanne Allert, and that Christopher Spoonire is linked to those exact three states.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like everything else, probably one big coincidence!

            That name Laura Lederer sounds familiar. Like I stumbled over name before in my research.  Also, I see she works in all the "usual" places and a lot with women and girls with disabilities. Sound familiar? I remember somebody had posted long time back pics of young boys all in wheelchairs and I believe Podesta being involved taking them places. I think the pics came up from Wikileaks.

            Great post/research as usual and I am going to dig on this.  It really doesn't feel right.  These groups are like onions.  You start peeling away the layers one at a time and finally get to the end.

             Thanks and I agree. If this were a straight out charity with none of these strange, weird, bizarre connections that always seem to pop up, I'd leave it alone. But I mean, come on! This is just pleading for someone dig into it.

            There is a twitter account associated w/THE SAMARITAN WOMAN. I wanted to search her tweets from just before the election (when pizzagate just caught fire) until after the election. Even though it says she joined Sept 2016....no tweets show up until Jan 1 2017.
