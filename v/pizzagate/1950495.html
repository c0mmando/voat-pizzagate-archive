            The point is why was Seth talking to his girlfriend. The entire testimony of the gang at Lou's is that he was depressed as hell over the break up with this girlfriend. He was drinking .... the same as he usually did .... and working on his computer ... but then he winds up "unusually" drunk. Then he disappears for two hours and reappears talking to his girlfriend on the phone?

             He did not break up with his girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was thinking of taking the job in Brooklyn and that was causing stress. He looked like he was having to make a decision between his career and his relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were still together AFAIK, which makes the depression and long phone calls more understandable.

              It doesn't really. He disappeared for two hours and then called her at 4 in the morning? If I were an investigator, the first thing I'd ask is if that was a pattern of his ... to call in the early morning hours.

              <p>
               No.  I'm not disputing the argument, I'm disputing your claim they had broken up.  They hadn't.  They were still a couple, but arguing/stressing about what came next.  He wanted to go Brooklyn and join the Clinton campaign.  She didn't want to leave DC is I think what the argument was.

               No.  For about 90 minutes of those two hours he was one the phone with her over two separate calls.

               This apparently was the case.  He called other people and not just her.  He called his Dad in Omaha at what would have been about 12:45 am there.  His cell phone records have been reported.
              </p>
              <p>
               He supposedly didn't get cell reception in his house and would often return calls like this.
              </p>
              <p>
               From an interview with his father
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                'He had just found out they wanted him and he was probably going to be moving up to Brooklyn through the election. He was really excited about that.'
               </p>
               <p>
                Seth Rich was director of voter expansion for the DNC – and often called his father to have him try out new software he was developing. He was known to keep a night-owl schedule and also for his quirky sense of humor in the office
               </p>
               <p>
                'It was not uncommon for Seth when he was going home to talk on the phone. He'd call us a lot of times and this time he was talking to Kelsey.
               </p>
               <p>
                She had gone out of town to visit her parents for Fourth of July weekend.
Rich said: 'The cellphone service in his apartment is horrible, so it would not be unlikely for him to be walking around the neighborhood if they were talking.
'He was probably at the bar until it closed and then was walking home. It wasn't out of pattern for his friends to do the same kind of thing.'

            Seth said, "I'm gonna eat" or "I've gotta eat."
           </p>
           <p>
            If he had said "I've got heat!", and it was so critical/important, why did Pops stumble over it?  He should have enunciated very clearly to emphasize it, not stumble over it and ruck it all up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are we hearing this secondhand from Pops and not firsthand from Kelsey?  Where is the audio of the call?  With a "murdered boyfriend," Kelsey should have saved it.  Where is it?  Where is the transcript of what Kelsey claims?

             What network head tried to scrub out what he was saying. They don't want any reason to investigate a possible murder.
