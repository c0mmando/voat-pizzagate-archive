<p>&quot;“I believe there are tens of thousands of men that are now going into chatrooms and forums with a view to grooming children,” he added. “Technology has afforded an access to children that people who have a sexual interest in children never had before.”</p>
<p>Bailey said police did not have enough officers to successfully pursue all child sex abusers and even thousands more detectives would not bring every offender to justice, even though the law was sufficiently robust to allow for prosecutions in most cases. “There are hundreds of officers tackling this now,” he said. “Thousands and thousands still would not be enough.</p>
<p>“This is one of those wicked problems we simply cannot arrest our way out of.”</p>
<p>The police chief said the children being targeted were not just those from homes where the parents or the adults in charge were neglectful. “The victims have included children of very capable and very caring parents. It does not recognise social status. The victims include children of middle-class, educated parents who think they are internet-savvy,” he said.</p>

<p>Cases of UK child sexual abuse up 31%:  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/18/cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-up-31-says-nspcc">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/18/cases-of-child-sexual-abuse-up-31-says-nspcc</a></p>
<p>&quot;The number of reported cases of child sexual abuse in the UK rose by almost a third last year, according to NSPCC figures that the charity described as “deeply worrying” but said showed a greater public willingness to report the problem.</p>
<p>The charity said it referred an average of 90 calls a week to police and social services over concerns that a young person had been sexually assaulted. This was an increase of 31% on the year before.</p>
<p>The NSPCC said it made a total of 4,677 referrals UK-wide last year, up from 3,578 in 2015-16. NSPCC Scotland reported the biggest year-on-year increase in referrals from 78 to 265 cases last year.&quot;</p>',

            20,000 is a ridiculous figure. It's probably not even possible to give an accurate estimate because the problem is so widespread, but I'd say you could safely add another zero without being presumptuous.

            I admit some of this is going on, but I can not really believe the words of the guardian anymore.  I don't know when they are telling the truth or stretching it or out and out lying.  We just had an article or post on here discussing this yesterday.  Notice how they include the "good" children that behave and come from "good" homes.  That is meant to scare us.  Fear Mongering is their Goal.  They are like the NYT now.  Controlled Journalism.  Thanks for bringing this up for discussion.

            Only 20000? I bet there are 20000 in the British government alone. Plus the hundreds of thousands of camel fuckers whose prophet was a pedophile.

            Another Kinsey Report statistic - demographic, creepos at shady pizza parlors I bet. All men I grew up with have ZERO interest in anything other than mature women. The ones who do, majority of them have homosexual tendencies. Hetero men are into women - period. Made up statistic - with the aim to normalize pedophilia. Again, look at the Kinsey report - for decades this was the go to statistic until it was exposed for what it was (Kinsey took polls from prison inmates, homosexuals, pedophiles and the mentally ill) So of course we get 31% in this survey. Actual statistic = 0.1% and I am being generous)

              Read Kinsey report. Bogus. No man (in the western world) has anything to do with anything other than women (unless we are talking about homosexual men. Was that poll taken aningst gays and perverts? That's how Kinsey got his stats that are sighted to this day)

             They are trying to shirk their duties.  They also are getting paid of by the elite pedos and the ones under their care.  Remember the Constable or Chief that said a couple mos. ago that the problem is so bad they cannot house them all.  Really?  Bull-oney.

               I think what the truth is, they filled the country with some everyday Muslim pedos on purpose, for that is their goal. And then they exaggerate the numbers.  For us to hate them.  But what they never talk or write  about is the Elite Pedos. Now Idk if that is true, but it sure seems like their MO.  Yes, raping the younger boys at Eton has been going on for a long time.  It is the Culture of the Elites and they are not Muslims.
