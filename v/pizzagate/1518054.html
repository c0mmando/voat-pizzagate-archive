</p>
<p>Summary: Yunus started Grameen Bank and is the father of microlending. He was accused of embezzling Norwegian aide money, but Norway backed him up, and the charges were dropped. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus#Allegations_of_embezzlement">Check out Wikipedia</a> stressing that the allegations were false but quickly spread through the media- they all but call the accusations #fakenews©.      
</p>
<p>Either way, with these allegations haunting him, in March 2011 the Bangladeshi government enforced their retirement age law and ousted him as head of Grameen.    
</p>
<p>As I dug through the OPs research in that post,   I saw that Yunus was in frequent contact with Secretary Clinton during her tenure. You can find quite a few refrences in wikileaks.  His name also came up in news stories of Sec. Clinton\'s tendency to meet mostly with CF donors. He donated <a href="https://archive.is/8iCkV">$100,000-250,000 +</a> (link via original post), met with Clinton a handful of times, and would email requests for favors via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanne_Verveer">Melanne Verveer</a>.     
</p>
<p>Verveer was the first United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women\'s Issues. Microfinance is in part a women\'s issue: impoverished women supposedly benefit by the easy-to-get loans. So perhaps it makes sense that the women\'s issue ambassador would be Yunus\'s liaison with Clinton, but I found it a little random.    
</p>
<p>Of note: Verveer has been imbedded in the Clinton machine for some time. She was Bill\'s assistant and Hillary\'s Chief of Staff when she was first lady. She founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_Voices">Vital Voices</a> with Hillary in \'97. Their focus: Human trafficking. Veveer is also credited with having a hand in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victims_of_Trafficking_and_Violence_Protection_Act_of_2000">Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000</a>. A criticism of that act: in order to receive benefits,           
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a victim of trafficking must prove/admit to being a victim of a severe form of trafficking and second must be a part of the prosecution of his or her trafficker.    <br />
....Since the law requires the applicant to become part of the prosecution of his or her trafficker, trafficked persons may be fearful of retaliation upon the self or the family and thus serves as a major deterrent to individuals even considering application.      
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act also created the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.      
</p>
<p>So, I think there is a lot worth digging through here-Veveer, Yunus\'s pay to play with CF, and LOTS more info in the original post.  FBIanon did say be careful about Yunus- I hope the author of the original post on this wasn\'t spooked or something! ;) FYI, this post (and poster) is not suicidal.</p>',

            Yeah, I wondered too why that submission was deleted. I know it says that the poster deleted it, but why would she delete it so quickly after she'd posted it.   Yunus looks really dodgy.   The Bangladesh government found that he'd misappropriated funds from the bank he created, Grameen.  For some reason, the US government and the mainstream meda got involved to attack the Bangladesh government.   He was awarded a Nobel prize after strong lobbying by the US.   Abdus Sattar was named as a henchman for Grameen in strong-arming people who had taken loans into selling their organs.  These people selling their kidneys are promised amounts which they never received.   One of Grameen's logos includes hearts with small hands in them and other pedo symbols like the swirl.

            Someone needs to look into the Bangledash NGO-  Center for Mass Education in Science (CMES) in particular the program Adolescent Girls Program (AGP). This was created by Yunus' brother Muhammad Ibrahim and is connected to Yunus. Please, I would but I have no computer skills.

            Yes, this was an important lead and i was also wondering why it was deleted by the OP.

            I posted this to the comments in the original post but here it is again.
According to reports, Yunus received $13 MILLION in State Department grants!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clinton’s aid to Yunus also included 18 grants, contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations, the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America, according to USASpending.gov.
            </p>
            <p>
             The awards, totaling $13 million, were issued by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the development arm of the State Department, beginning when Clinton became secretary of state. Another $11 million in federal funds went to organizations allied with Yunus.
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked to explain the Yunus grants and loans, USAID Spokesman Raphael Cook said the agency didn’t have the “manpower” to respond to questions about the transactions.

             Just to be clear- you are saying it was deleted because it was a great lead? Does a mod delete a thread? I have been here a bit but not clear how that works. It looks like a great bunch of leads to me. Why was it deleted and who deleted it who can explain?
