<p>EDIT: <a href="https://voat.co/user/kestrel9">@kestrel9</a> found some questionable information about O.U.R. 4 months ago. And this thorough investigation into O.U.R. was linked in the comments: <a href="http://lyingforthelord.com/uploads/43._Rambo_Reyes_Saves_Child_Sex_Slaves_1_Apr_15.pdf">http://lyingforthelord.com/uploads/43._Rambo_Reyes_Saves_Child_Sex_Slaves_1_Apr_15.pdf</a>  At the very least, they are not a clean-hands, only for the children organization.  
</p>
<p><strong>Operation Underground Railroad</strong> (O.U.R.) <a href="https://ourrescue.org">https://ourrescue.org</a> got its start three years ago, in Haiti:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guesno believed that his missing son, Gardy, had gone through an illicit orphanage. His hunch was the only lead there was – and with the devastating earthquake that broke Port Au Prince, Haiti, his son’s case was lost in the sea of hundreds of missing kids. Gardy could be anywhere.</p>
<p>Tim Ballard, while still a government agent, heard of this story through the press. Gardy was technically a U.S. citizen because he was born when his parents were visiting the U.S. from Haiti on a fundraising mission. Ballard opened a case for him, but soon found out that the case had been handed to the Haitian National Police. There were two problems: Ballard couldn’t step over lines of jurisdiction, and there were absolutely no leads.</p>
<p>But Ballard couldn’t get Gardy’s case out of his mind. He started to think…what if we started an organization that could bring the necessary resources to countries around the world and rescue kids like Gardy?</p>
<p>Ballard had worked with the government for twelve years. Many people discouraged him from leaving his secure job to start a nonprofit group. But he had a vision that others could not grasp – and the pieces started coming together.</p>
<p>“We recognized that we could tap into that fundamental desire to free other people, to serve other people, and that was the premise of our endeavor. We tapped into it, and people responded. People wanted to be a part of it.” – Tim Ballard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How O.U.R. made at least one area in Columbia &quot;too dangerous for traffickers&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As O.U.R. started gaining traction, our reach expanded quickly – we had opportunity to perform three operations in one day in Colombia. It was part of an idea that Ballard had. Would hitting the same region over and over again create enough of a deterrent for child traffickers? Would it be enough to completely halt the business in its dirty tracks?</p>
<p>Yes. <strong>When the O.U.R. team went back undercover for the fifth or sixth time after Operation Triple Take, no one would sell kids to them. “They referenced all of these hits that were going on,” Ballard said. The traffickers said, “It’s too dangerous to be in the child trafficking business in this region at this time.</strong>”</p>
<p>That was the moment that Tim Ballard and his team realized that the eradication of child sex trafficking was indeed possible – the deterrent effect worked.</p>
<p>Operation Triple Take resulted in the rescue of 123 victims and the arrest of twelve traffickers. For the time being, O.U.R. slammed the door shut on child traffickers in Colombia.</p>

<p>The other organization, <strong>Vets 4 Child Rescue</strong> (<a href="https://vets4childrescue.org">https://vets4childrescue.org)</a>) is months-old. I\'ve seen it mentioned several times in passing, but when I watched the interviews <a href="https://voat.co/user/ESOTERICshade">@ESOTERICshade</a> posted last night I learned they\'re really starting to roll. They\'re partnering with other individuals and organizations that have been working on child trafficking from many different angles. You can see the video interviews with Vets 4 Child Rescue founder, Craig Sawyer, and the trailer for their upcoming documentary on <a href="https://voat.co/user/newworldahead">@newworldahead</a>\'s post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2289633">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2289633</a></p>

            Thanks for sharing. Hope helps where nothing else does we cant unknow the evil we now know exists all we do is keep faith that the end is near and the evil will be defeated. We must keep telling everyone we know and pray for the children.

            How They're Being Awesome
After decades of being shunned by polite society, bikers have hit back ... by protecting the hell out of some abused children.
Bikers Against Child Abuse, a volunteer group with chapters in 36 states, has been using its epic beard power for good since 1995. When the family of an abused kid requests BACA's help via a therapist or government agency, a group of bikers head over to the child's house and present themselves at his or her service. From that point on, if the kid's abuser bothers him or her in any way, a group of goddamn bikers will show up outside the house and stand guard. They'll come over even if the kid had a nightmare and is feeling scared.
The idea behind child-abuse-fighting biker gangs is that children are usually incredibly intimidated by their abusers, who are of course bigger and stronger than them. But fuck that, bikers are more intimidating, and it turns out the tough guys who abuse children aren't quite so tough when their alleged victims are surrounded by huge wooly mammoths in human form.
This intimidation-for-good can also help children during the legal process. Testifying against an abuser is bad enough for adults, let alone for a frightened kid. So BACA bikers often accompany children to court or parole hearings and then sit down where they're clearly visible to the abuser. If you haven't had your daily dose of schadenfreude yet, imagine the look on some asshole's face when he's expecting a kid to show up with nothing but a scrawny lawyer, and instead sees a fucking biker gang file in.

            Bikers Against Child Abuse make abuse victims feel safe
           </p>
           <p>
            These tough bikers have a soft spot: aiding child-abuse victims. Anytime, anywhere, for as long as it takes the child to feel safe, these leather-clad guardians will stand tall and strong against the dark, and the fear, and those who seek to harm.

               Take a look at that article. I don't agree with everything Lynn says, he is kinda dick too, but look specifically at the comments from those in the their field about their operation and the parts about  OUR's financial relationship with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. Also, Shurtlef is quite corrupt, look him up, and remember Mormon country is Mason country.

                 That being said, of course make your own conclusions. It could be legit, just not IMO. Lynn Packer (the controversial, not liked too much by LDS brass, nephew journalist of a well known gen authority) seems to have an axe to grind on this one and I don't think he should have hinged his essay on the unreliability of the numbers. For me though, I know all these names, that UT is a mecca for white collar crime, and that if these guys wanted to make a difference they could and should start by shutting down the FLDS in their own backyard. I mean, Ballard's lived in happy valley and knows damn well how many Sterling Allen types live there. Reyes it not a pillar of morality himself and sure as hell never bothered the Kingstons.  Doesn't mean that it's in fact a trafficking op itself like  a certain wine drinking  YT lush was claiming last season, but there are certainly enough eyebrow raising red flags to make to make one think something might not be quite right about OUR. Also, I could go on and on, and hv here, about the oddities of the ES abduction and the foundation.

              Truckers have a unique perspective, not just from getting around and seeing trends in society, but from a physical standpoint. My stepdad was hauling septic tanks when he looked down at a car only to notice that the driver was not wearing anything but a shirt. then, of course, there is he trafficking at truck stops.

               Truckersagainsttrafficking seems to be a great organization. That video gave me  some ideas.  I could sit  in my car at a truck stop and  use a CB radio to  listen to the truckers talk to each other. If I see or hear anything suspicious I can call the number in the video. I don't think I would alert the local PD. That would be a waste of time.  They're lazy. They'll do just about anything to get out of writing a police report.

            funnily, costs were listed first, something like 5k per child depending on the location.

                   I'm sure its a fake account. Of course probably instigated by Greg. I get his little "joke" though. Richard and dick are the same. Dick is short for Richard. And "Dick es son" is probably something like "Dick his son" meaninging fucking kids and "fuck Jesus" because Jesus is the Son of God.

                   I don't know if Baph is still in business over at 8chan or not. If they are they might dox this person and trace down where the threats are coming from. They don't do personal army stuff but maybe they hate pedos. Anonymous might dox them but who knows how to get hold of them? There are two other groups who work on stuff like this on the dark web but I don't remember their names.

                   He is trying to scare you. I wish our law enforcement was not so corrupt. If they were half ass legit their cyber teams would be looking into all this pedo stuff and busting pervs. I pinged darkknight111 maybe dark knows some of those dox teams.

            I wonder how we can vet these people to make sure they are legit? Their ops are classified, which does not necessarily mean anything bad, because if they do this work it is highly dangerous. If enough groups got together and took solid action it would be a real chink in the armor of child traffickers. When you bust one there is often several more busts to follow because these people seldom, if ever, work alone.

            That is my goal but the urge to cheer for a favorite is so strong it is hard convince people not to think in dualistic terms. People are being tricked into thinking there are only two options. The less of two evils. Humanity will have the collective power to shake off the parasite when it learns to say "neither." There is a third way and it does not include either of their dualistic choices. How is the third way accomplished? Collective education known as redpilling. Things did not get this way in a short time frame and it will not unravel in one.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Most human beings think in terms of goals that can be accomplished within their lifetimes and that is the distinct disadvantage humanity has. The cult thinks in terms of decades and centuries and works its plan accordingly. They are organized like a hive of bees all working toward one purpose.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            At one time in pizzagate's history pizzagaters considered themselves part of a hive and sometimes used that terminology. Their big claim to fame was "we are hive without a leader." Decentralization. The hivers know the goal and everybody does what they do best.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Right now pizzagate is in the process of forsaking that model in favor of the Savior model. Unfortunately the Savior comes from the beast itself. Sure recipe for hive death. People then say "well if not the Republicans then who? because they are the only people that can do it."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I say they are the only people that will refuse to destroy their own lucrative and powerful system. No system of that nature has ever voluntarily committed system suicide. The third way is to just say NO and refuse to comply in any way possible which I admit is limited at this point but it is amazing what happens when enough people say NO to something. The PTB will always usually take two steps backwards, step back, and let things settle down. After that the NO has to stick through hive reinforcement, also known as "red pilling", also known as constant meme warfare. Also known as education.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The Freemasons work on the "implied consent" model and if we do not educate people about duality and people ramain unaware, and say nothing, they take that as our consent and think "if they are dumb enough to consent then to hell with those stupid animals, I would not consent to that, they deserve what they get."
           </p>
           <p>
            People do not understand that they are being governed under "implied consent." It is a very real system to the Freemasons. It is also real here where we are right now. If nobody says anything about how our communication platforms are run and managed they will be run any way the controllers choose. It is why "mutiny" is a dirty world.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The only way to make the PTB back down is to red pill enough people that are also vocal. Nothing that comes from the mainstream media is dangerous to those people.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The D.C. Ass Grab Distraction will not be dangerous to them either because THEY ARE GENERATING IT. They are not generating news about pedophliia but they could do thousands of stories on it continually if anybody had any inclination. That is why it is up to us to never let that subject die because IT IS THE ONE subject that crosses all boundries. It crosses race, ethnicity, social class, geography, religion (at our level), and all else.

            Child abuse is the one hill that all decent humans will collectively fight on. It is THE HILL. There is no other hill that powerfjul and all hive members should be educated to think that way.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That is Donkeyhole's job. His job is to keep a small hill from becoming a mountain. That seems to be one thing pizzagaters do understand because they are smart enough not to fall for a losing strategy and if there ever was a losing strategy racial conflict is it.

             This is essential awareness -- and you're right, people do not understand this. Every time we look the other way, or say "that's just how this world is," or "no one's effort can make a difference" or any of the hundreds of other excuses we make, we are
             <em>
              giving our consent

             for the world

             This. The alternative to the Savior model is forming intelligent, responsive groups who can identify and act on threats and opportunities. This has to happen in real life, because it is impossible to form even small trusted groups online.

            <p>
             I'm hoping (a) that both the organizations mentioned in this post are of this nature (b) that their model is effective, and (c) if effective -- that the model itself becomes viral.

                Remember  Underground Railroad?    We all got taken in at first.  Turned up to be quite the opposite.  It's easy  want something good because all we pretty much read on here is horrid.  Be glad you found out today, the same day.  Thanks for letting us know!

            Good News is exactly what I need today.  Saw about 4 things about children on the news this morning and it was not good.  This is wonderful news and I hope that especially Newbies on here will seek these places out.  There are so many of us that have been afraid to contribute to Charities anymore.  Now You Can Still Give From the Heart.

             Thank you!! Yes! There are good people on this!! I'm looking more into how I might get involved. Researching can feel empowering
             <em>
              and
             </em>
             frustrating.

             Just watching Craig Sawyer's youtube from a couple of months ago:
             <strong>
              Americans Be Encouraged
             </strong>
             -- talking about how we just need to stand up and stand together to protect the children.
