            For years Michael Jackson entourage would visit public grade schools, and Michael personally would pick out children he found attractive to stay over the night at "Neverland". Parents who objected were given 1,000's of dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously Jackson was working with the highest level politicians of the LA school system to gain access.
           </p>
           <p>
            As years passed Jackson became more brazen, and eventually forced himself on children who didn't want to go, and those parents went to the cops and forced lawsuits that went public.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is the Public Education System is DEEPLY involved in pedophilia.
