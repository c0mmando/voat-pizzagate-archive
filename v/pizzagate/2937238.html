<p>I have introduced you to Bob Schlenker and Aaron Hermann\'s <a href="http://theopenscroll.blogspot.com/">The OpenScroll Blog</a> <strong>Pizzagate Esoterica series</strong> in my <strong>Voat thread</strong>  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2473695">Esoteric Pizzagate: When The Moon Hits Your Eye Like A Big Pizza Pie; Signs and Symbols - Why Pizza is the Symbol For Intn\'l Pedophilia</a> which gives you an overview of how long <strong>FOOD REFERENCES</strong> have been <em>code for the proclivities of the rich and famous for a very long time.</em></p>

(*I cannot impress upon you enough how important understanding this series is. In it you will discover that every \'beloved\' Hollywood classic from the Goonies, E.T., Back To The Future, has within it embedded subconscious ques that only certain parts of the brain can assemble and that those ques are <strong>sodomite</strong>(the cult) in nature. The entire concept of <strong>PIZZA</strong> as an <em>occult food</em> is that it <strong>RESEMBLES THE DETRITUS THAT CAN RESULT FROM ANAL SEX</strong> and the joke for them is the consumption of it as pizza)</p>
<p>So... This Tuesday , this Christmas Kaptain Kangol, <strong>Seth Rogan</strong>, James Franco\'s b(utt)est bud, either intentionally or unintentionally brought some attention to <strong>McCauley Culkin\'s Home Alone Series</strong> on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>Seth Rogen Learns the Gangster Movie from Home Alone Is Fake, Blows Celebrity Friends\' Minds</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://people.com/movies/seth-rogen-learns-home-alone-gangster-movie-fake-twitter-reacts/">https://people.com/movies/seth-rogen-learns-home-alone-gangster-movie-fake-twitter-reacts/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1077642186638802945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">The Tweet</a></p>
<p>As it turned out looking into this <strong>Gangster film for Home Alone Series</strong> proved to be an interesting conspiratorial journey. Of course we all know about the energy surrounding <strong>Culkin</strong> and his band <strong><em>Pizza Underground</em></strong> and how he and his movies fit around the <strong>Pizzagate Saga</strong>, <em>there are degrees of separation everywhere</em>, even Culkin\'s recent odd behavior isn\'t helping anything. </p>
<p>In fact <strong><a href="http://www.liederschatz.net/occult/images/skull.gif">Room 233</a></strong> of the <strong>Plaza Hotel</strong> that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> purchased in 1988 was where <strong>Roy Cohn</strong> admitted to special agents was where <em>he ran a child sexual extortion ring from</em>. Parts of <strong>Home Alone 2 was filmed in Trumps Plaza Hotel</strong>. </p>

<p>But I digress, let me get back to the <strong>Gangster Film in Home Alone I and II</strong> that were <em>specifically created for these films</em>. The film in question was called <strong>Angels With Filthy Souls</strong>, a <em>parody</em> of the 1938  <strong>James Cagney</strong> <em>classic</em> <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4190%2BF2-BoL.jpg">Angels With Dirty Faces</a>*</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the segment Kevin watched, Johnny, a gangster sitting behind a desk in an office, was met by Snakes, a gangster sent by Acey, the head gangster. Snakes(The Serpent) asked for the money Johnny owed for &quot;the stuff&quot;. Johnny said, &quot;Too bad Acey ain\'t in charge no more&quot; and implied he was not about to give Snakes any money. Snakes showed discomfort when Johnny said that Acey was upstairs taking a bath, and that he would call Snakes once he got out. Almost immediately, Johnny remarked &quot;I tell ya what I\'m gonna give you, Snakes&quot;, and got up from his desk while picking up his Tommy gun. Johnny told Snakes to get out before he counted to ten to get his &quot;Ugly, yellow NO GOOD KEISTER&quot; off his property &quot;Before I PUMP YOUR GUTS full of lead&quot;. However, Johnny cut the count short, counting to two, then jumping straight to ten (&quot;One, two...TEN!&quot;), and, while laughing maniacally, shot rapid bullets at Snakes, killing him. Johnny stared at the corpse and said, &quot;Keep the change, ya filthy animal!&quot;. Kevin then paused the video and shouted for his mom.</p>
<p>Later, Kevin utilized the tape to play tricks on a pizza man and thwart burglar Marvin Murchins.

<ul>
<li>Snakes -(The Serpent) phallus</li>
<li>Johnny -Toilet reference</li>
<li>&quot;the stuff&quot; -drug reference</li>
<li>Acey was upstairs taking a bath -strange for a gangster but was inserted for use in the movie</li>
<li>he would call Snakes once he got out -ominous, invoking nudity</li>
<li>I tell ya what I\'m gonna give you, Snakes -going to give him his \'snake\'</li>
<li>to ten to get your &quot;Ugly, yellow NO GOOD KEISTER&quot; off his property -anal reference</li>
<li>&quot;Before I PUMP YOUR GUTS full of lead&quot; -self explanatory</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is the <strong><em>SECOND</em></strong> <strong>Home Alone</strong> film that the <strong>sodomite programming</strong> is even <strong><em>MORE</em></strong> <strong>evident</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tufjfFOYLq0">Home Alone 2: Angels With Even Filthier Souls</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tufjfFOYLq0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tufjfFOYLq0</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Angels with Even Filthier Souls</em></strong> is a fictional gangster film that Kevin watches and uses in <strong>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</strong>, and is a <em>sequel</em> to <strong>Angels with Filthy Souls</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The film starts with the gangsters moll Carlotta, wearing a 1930\'s satin evening gown and fur stole, as she walks into gangster Johnny\'s apartment. Johnny is sitting there next to a Christmas tree, wearing a tuxedo and smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>The film is about Johnny accusing his girlfriend Carlotta that she was smooching with his brother and many others. She denies it, and he grabs a Tommy Gun from under the Christmas tree and makes her beg for her life on her knees. She tells him he is the only one for her and he gives her 3 seconds to escape. At the count of two he riddles her with bullets, wishing her a merry Christmas and a happy new year.</p>
<p>The film is used by Kevin to escape from the hotel room. He plays only the dialogue of Johnny from the film, and accuses the concierge Mr. Hector of being in the hotel room before, smooching with his brother and a number of other people. One of them is called Cliff, who by coincidence happens to be one of the guards. The staff ends up crawling out of the room shouting that there is an insane guest with a gun.

</blockquote>
<p>In the film clip, however, we have <strong>Tim Curry</strong> (Rocky Horror; the Clown from Stephen King\'s IT) and <strong>Dan Schneider</strong> (Duece Bigelow) among others disheveled and frantic about finding young Kevin as he once again uses clips from the Gangster movie to keep his pursuers at bay so he can once again <strong>ESCAPE</strong> from their grasp. Curry is accused of &quot;smooching with his brothers and everybody&quot;, even Cliff, the Doorman - a gay reference way out of place for a children\'s Christmas movie. Then we are once again shocked with the head Gangster Johnny pulling out his Tommy-Gun again and ordering everyone to their knees to prove their <strong>LOVE</strong> for Johnny. Ironic how Kevin starts the segment once again, <strong>eating ice cream</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>smooching with his brother and many others -and even the doorman Cliff</li>
<li>accuses the concierge Mr. Hector of being in the hotel room before -before? for what?</li>
<li>makes her beg for her life on her knees -what else is done on the knees</li>
<li>At the count of two -he fills herguts full(of lead)</li>
<li>The staff ends up crawling out of the room shouting that there is an insane guest with a gun -reminiscent of Las Vegas?</li>
</ul>
<p>These things might not make much sense to the untrained eye or some might think that it is nothing and innocuous. But what I am suggesting is that these sequences are shot and directed in such a way as to where it is not automatically perceived by the conscious brain and are only pieces and parts until the conscious brain can put together the correct references from empirical EVIDENCE and EXPERIENCE from life. They do not make sense until it &quot;clicks&quot; in your brain at a much later date in the future when the &quot;joke&quot; is finally understood. This contributes to rapid moral degradation due to synaptic correlation through societal regression. The programming is received as a child but is not activated or understood until adulthood and acts as an anchor for regressive behaviors.</p>
<p>Remember, this is an MK-ULTRA process, information extracted from the psychological and physical TORTURE of hundreds of thousands of concentration camp victims and then on medical patients at hospitals all over the United States of America through the Project Paperclip Nazi doctors that America helped save after Hitler was done dismantling the first great fleecing of a nations resources before the globalists turned their eye on America. Like A Clockwork Orange, scientists, psychologists, mafia and jewish owned Hollywood teamed up with Hitlers PROPAGANDA men and transformed the entire genre into a brainwashing MACHINE the subtly, through CONSTANT REPETITION (remembers Madonna songs clearly don\'t you because of this) and CONSTANT PLACEMENT of SODOMITE references, themes, ques, peripheral and DIRECT references and a TON of psychological knowledge of HOW YOU WORK inside made it possible to TRANSFORM ENTIRE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE INTO NON-THINKING <strong>GOLUM</strong> PROGRAMMABLE TO A T- YOU, AND ME.</p>
<p>Don\'t take MY word for it, read four or five article by a REAL EX Black-Panther <a href="https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/">Rayford Bullock </a>and he will SHOW you how our ENTIRE apparatus was replaced with a regime that literally CREATED an entire nation of highly volatile, confused and irrational non-thinking violent human beings - The United States of America. Look at South America RIGHT NOW, where did the nazi\'s go first in the ratlines before they came to America. yep, they want America to look like their version of HELL and it\'s coming very, very soon.</p>',

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            In the segment Kevin watched, Johnny, a gangster sitting behind a desk in an office, was met by Snakes, a gangster sent by Acey, the head gangster. Snakes(The Serpent) asked for the money Johnny owed for "the stuff". Johnny said, "Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more" and implied he was not about to give Snakes any money. Snakes showed discomfort when Johnny said that Acey was upstairs taking a bath, and that he would call Snakes once he got out. Almost immediately, Johnny remarked "I tell ya what I'm gonna give you, Snakes", and got up from his desk while picking up his Tommy gun. Johnny told Snakes to get out before he counted to ten to get his "Ugly, yellow NO GOOD KEISTER" off his property "Before I PUMP YOUR GUTS full of lead". However, Johnny cut the count short, counting to two, then jumping straight to ten ("One, two...TEN!"), and, while laughing maniacally, shot rapid bullets at Snakes, killing him. Johnny stared at the corpse and said, "Keep the change, ya filthy animal!". Kevin then paused the video and shouted for his mom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, Kevin utilized the tape to play tricks on a pizza man and thwart burglar Marvin Murchins.

            The film starts with the gangsters moll Carlotta, wearing a 1930's satin evening gown and fur stole, as she walks into gangster Johnny's apartment. Johnny is sitting there next to a Christmas tree, wearing a tuxedo and smoking a cigarette.
           </p>
           <p>
            The film is about Johnny accusing his girlfriend Carlotta that she was smooching with his brother and many others. She denies it, and he grabs a Tommy Gun from under the Christmas tree and makes her beg for her life on her knees. She tells him he is the only one for her and he gives her 3 seconds to escape. At the count of two he riddles her with bullets, wishing her a merry Christmas and a happy new year.
           </p>
           <p>
            The film is used by Kevin to escape from the hotel room. He plays only the dialogue of Johnny from the film, and accuses the concierge Mr. Hector of being in the hotel room before, smooching with his brother and a number of other people. One of them is called Cliff, who by coincidence happens to be one of the guards. The staff ends up crawling out of the room shouting that there is an insane guest with a gun.

           In the film clip, however, we have

            Tim Curry
           </strong>
           (Rocky Horror; the Clown from Stephen King's IT) and

            Dan Schneider

           (Duece Bigelow) among others disheveled and frantic about finding young Kevin as he once again uses clips from the Gangster movie to keep his pursuers at bay so he can once again
           <strong>
            ESCAPE
           </strong>
           from their grasp. Curry is accused of "smooching with his brothers and everybody", even Cliff, the Doorman - a gay reference way out of place for a children's Christmas movie. Then we are once again shocked with the head Gangster Johnny pulling out his Tommy-Gun again and ordering everyone to their knees to prove their
           <strong>
            LOVE
           </strong>
           for Johnny. Ironic how Kevin starts the segment once again,

           These things might not make much sense to the untrained eye or some might think that it is nothing and innocuous. But what I am suggesting is that these sequences are shot and directed in such a way as to where it is not automatically perceived by the conscious brain and are only pieces and parts until the conscious brain can put together the correct references from empirical EVIDENCE and EXPERIENCE from life. They do not make sense until it "clicks" in your brain at a much later date in the future when the "joke" is finally understood. This contributes to rapid moral degradation due to synaptic correlation through societal regression. The programming is received as a child but is not activated or understood until adulthood and acts as an anchor for regressive behaviors.

           Remember, this is an MK-ULTRA process, information extracted from the psychological and physical TORTURE of hundreds of thousands of concentration camp victims and then on medical patients at hospitals all over the United States of America through the Project Paperclip Nazi doctors that America helped save after Hitler was done dismantling the first great fleecing of a nations resources before the globalists turned their eye on America. Like A Clockwork Orange, scientists, psychologists, mafia and jewish owned Hollywood teamed up with Hitlers PROPAGANDA men and transformed the entire genre into a brainwashing MACHINE the subtly, through CONSTANT REPETITION (remembers Madonna songs clearly don't you because of this) and CONSTANT PLACEMENT of SODOMITE references, themes, ques, peripheral and DIRECT references and a TON of psychological knowledge of HOW YOU WORK inside made it possible to TRANSFORM ENTIRE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE INTO NON-THINKING

           and he will SHOW you how our ENTIRE apparatus was replaced with a regime that literally CREATED an entire nation of highly volatile, confused and irrational non-thinking violent human beings - The United States of America. Look at South America RIGHT NOW, where did the nazi's go first in the ratlines before they came to America. yep, they want America to look like their version of HELL and it's coming very, very soon.

            I watched all them movies. Goonies was an especial favorite. First time I saw it, I was five. By the time I was ten, probably dozens of times. By this theory, I should have a huge hankering for some ass pounding about now. Yet, I don't. Hm.

            It's not that I don't believe in intentional programming. I do. But the leaps in logic people make...it smacks of hysteria.

             Well. Ain't you special. Someone thinks theys untouchable. Sure, you don't crave dicks, that's all this programming does to y'all lol. Love it when ppl pop up that think they know better but their words glow from ego and betray so much about who you are. I can tell just by the way you write you have a very specific kind of dysfunction. You wanna come here and tell me your life is perfect and not guided by unseen motivations that have made a mess of your life and if you say it's perfect as it is I know your lying because no one's is. You have a myriad of cycles that roll around in your head everyday that makes you compensate in antiproductive ways. You're lying if you say it is any different.

              I'm not male. I'm female. I like dicks fine, if in their proper place. My butt is not that place. As for the rest of what you said, it was laughable drivel and I'm ignoring it.

              What YOU have revealed about YOUR ego is that you can't handle constructive criticism. A lot of conspiracy theorists can't. Now don't mistake me, i believe conspiracies exist. But you have to recognize that their is a class of beings (you?) that sees a conspiracy in every spiral logo, in every pizza joint. UNDER EVERY DAMN ROCK. People like that make me mad because they hurt the cause and are generally fools.

               You are so convoluted you don't even understand that you proved my point triple fold. You see, I knew there was a chance you were female, but I figured, eh, if it is the way she talks she could make a sailor blush than her conditioning has her vocabulary to a degree that it is equal to a male with the same morality (I'm not saying youre not moral I'm saying that you feel free enough to describe a consequence to the conditioning as having a "huge hankering for some ass pounding" that your moral gauge is further down the scale then say an 1860's Mormon housewife who would think someone was severely possessed if those words were uttered in her presence).
              </p>
              <p>
               Meaning, how was I supposed to know because chic, ya talk like a dude.
              </p>
              <p>
               Really, all you did was dance around my supposition and ignored the crux of what real consequences to this conditioning creates, which is dysfunction. Just because I guessed your sex incorrectly for the reasons above doesn't mean I can't see the dysfunction in the way you speak.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have still disproved nothing and have wasted a BUNCH of time being a skeptic when if you watch the Pizzagate Esoterica series you would probably not be here disagreeing. So not ONLY are you egotistical and selfish for wasting my time on YOUR doubt, you are also LAZY because you didn't do the research before you confronted me. Just disappointing.

                Being skeptical is not wasteful. It protects you from being a damned nut. You really should try it. I've a fair knowledge of esoteric lore myself, owing to a time I was interested in it as a teen. (Never dabbled per se, but was sort of fascinated) I just think you're making huge leaps of logic. Look, God is good to us, and while we are frail, it's going to take a lot more than hearing a few purported double entendres in movies as kids to turn us into raging queers. No, for that you need to be interfered with at a delicate stage in your development. Aka molested. I think getting hung up on this stuff about movies is a diversion. There's plenty of blatant conditioning going on, such that worrying about some so-subtle-you-are-probably-imagining-it phraseology from movies 20+ years ago seems out of place in a forum expressly designated to expose crimes against children. That's why I get so annoyed with people who show up saying "look i found a spiral shape on this sign! Pedos omgzzzzz!!!!!111" Everyone's caught up in getting credit for discovering some new angle. That's not the point, damn it. The point is children are being trafficked.
               </p>
               <p>
                And your post smacks of that, to me. Add to that how you upset and emotional you're being (the true sign of an ego in distress) and I think the argument could be made that you are deflecting.

                 You tried to straighten it up and cleaned your mouth up a little and almost made some sense. Look, I'm not picking random things out of thin air. The breadth of research I'd have to cover for it to make sense to you would take so long when the simple fact of the matter is that if you can't logically see that this is happening through the examples provided you're hopelessly lost and there's nothing but frustration left in me for you. It's sad but what are you going to do?  You can try to say that I'm seeing things where they don't exist but the proof way overwhelms any personal theory you might enjoy. Thanks for the banter but you have still, convinced noone and only convinced me how daft you are that you continually come here without even reviewing the material. You act like a retard continually walking into a wall with your lopsided argument.

            Combine the above MASS MIND CONTROL experiment (AMBIENT MK-ULTRA) with the Rockefeller/Carnegie funded Frankfurt Model (tavistock) Prison Public School System and their conditioning, culling and sorting and you will understand how your ENTIRE life is force fed and very few of your decisions are really your own. There is a paradigm for everyone and noone escapes, everything from religion to science has a built in backdoor that leads right to luciferianism, even the peace loving hippies were a cia experiment. Public schools and their standardized tests advanced or held back students not based totally on grades but pedigree and psychological profile. Emotional and artistic people were groomed to stay in lower echelons of society while dirty, pathologically sociopathic were groomed toward Ivy League schools and Administration/Government and trained to be easily compromisable.

             Children from  Generation X were told that by the time they were 7 they would see over 1000 murders on television. We were then trained into believing that this material DIDN'T present any harm to the children watching it. This was also a lie. Anything consumed by the human organism especially between the ages of 3 and 7 records everything like a computer. Through various repetitive memes through an entire childhood of repeated symbols, sights and sounds they were able to embed certain triggers that would cause chaos and breakdown later in life from a lifetime of watching dysfunction and sodomite ques.

Video games have taught certain children that guns are a short route to taking care of your problems at school. Disney Princesses and the resulting toy industry have a litany of mental disorders that they cultivate into their viewers and masonic skull and bones for Pirate loving boys. Even the COLORS of a Barbie doll alone might be enough to trigger some people into a regression period.

              If you'll notice we live in a TOTALLY regressed society. We have judges selling children off for profit, doctors sucking down their own drugs, the ubiquity of sexual imagery is everywhere. I could go on and on about how so called alleged "grown ass" adults at worse than CHILDREN,CLASSIC REGRESSION. The entire country is a MASS of contradiction and CONFUSION because of the AMBIENT Mk-Ultra and programming I have been describing in most of my material.

            Too bad Rayford has not made another post in MONTHS. Ive enjoyed his work. As far as I know, from a women who actually stays I'm touch with him, he's fine, and giving her info as he can, which he hasnt still yet. Don't know what happened, of coarse from his blog you can think up some clear ideas what could have happened. At least he is hunkered down a d safe.

             Right, totally. I have been trying to keep tabs on him as well and have run across some of the same information. I guess he has intentions of firing up another website but that has been months as well. Good to know he is safe though and willing to keep producing his material.

             Not sure what is happening on your end, ASolo. The YouTube links are there and working for me. You embedded some of them (click the edit button to view your source formatting).

                I really don't know V what it is I've checked settings and everything but can't figure it out. It just chooses not to show up on the finished page even though it's in the template. I'm computer literate but this one has me stumped.

             I would like for this issue to get rectified so that readers can see the links to the Youtube clips of  Home Alone I and II. I guess folks please if you are interested just google the clips mentioned and watch. Sorry for the inconvenience.

             For all of those that might be as confused as I am about where my links went here is a quick link to The OpenScroll Pizzagate Esoterica Series by Bob Schlenker and Aaron Hermann on their site that isn't a Youtube URL

             This post doesn't make much sense without beng bale to watch the clips and I don't see the links to the clips that i posted in the thread. Do I have an incorrect setting on and thats why I'm not seeing them or is VOAT banning them from their script?
