<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/Mad_as_hell">@Mad_as_hell</a> shared that Sherriff Israel also handled the airport shooting in 2017! 5 people were killed. The shooter here also &quot;heard voices&quot; and claimed he was under government mind control. Over the years, he was the subject of 10 internal affairs complaints. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article125938829.html">After Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, Broward Sheriff Scott Israel in spotlight</a></p>
<p>Surprise surprise. He’s for gun control. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mass shooting puts Israel in an unusual position: The shooting has given him a bully pulpit to speak about gun control, but he’s a Democrat, politically at odds with the Republican leaders in Tallahassee and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“All I’m going to do is speak my mind,” Israel said. “If I’m on an island, I’m on an island. I’m not going to worry about who is with me or who is not.”</p>
<p>Israel criticized a recent proposal by two state legislators to allow holders of permits to carry concealed firearms in airport passenger terminals.</p>
<p>“It’s bizarre and unsafe,” Israel said. “There are so many problems. If there is a gun fight in an airport, how would law enforcement know who are the good guys?”</p>
<p>He previously advocated for stricter gun control, calling for reinstatement of an assault-gun ban, closing the so-called “gun show loophole,” and fighting an “open carry” proposal. He has also advocated for more mental health treatment, including requiring healthcare workers to report threats to public safety.</p>

<p>The school system administrators wanted to &quot;improve their statistics&quot; and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein. So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement (Sheriff and Police Chiefs), entered into a plan.</p>
<p>I discovered an untold story of massive scale and consequence as a result of initial research into Trayvon Martin and his High School life.</p>
<p>What I stumbled upon was a Broward County law enforcement system in a state of conflict. The Broward County School Board and District Superintendent, entered into a political agreement with Broward County Law enforcement officials to stop arresting students for crimes.</p>
<p>The motive was simple. The school system administrators wanted to &quot;improve their statistics&quot; and gain state and federal grant money for improvements therein.</p>
<p>So police officials, the very highest officials of law enforcement (Sheriff and Police Chiefs), entered into a plan.</p>
<p>Initially the police were excusing misdemeanor behaviors. However, it didn\'t take long until felonies, even violent felonies (armed robberies, assaults and worse) were being excused.</p>
<p>The need to continue lowering the arrests year-over-year meant that increasingly more severe unlawful behavior had to be ignored. Over time even the most severe of unlawful conduct was being filtered by responding police.</p>
<p>We found out about it, when six cops blew the whistle on severe criminal conduct they were being instructed to hide. The sheriff and police Chiefs were telling street cops and school cops to ignore ever worsening criminal conduct.</p>
<p>Understanding the risk behind the scheme, it became increasingly important to put the best corrupt cops in the schools. <em>BEST</em> as in <em>SMARTEST</em>. Those SRO\'s became the ones who were best at hiding the unlawful conduct.</p>
<p>Again, over time, the most corrupt police officers within the system became the police inside the schools. These officers were those who are best skilled at identifying the political objectives and instructions.</p>
<p>Those &quot;School Cops&quot; also have special privileges. It\'s a great gig. They get free &quot;on campus&quot; housing close to the schools they are assigned to etc. They\'re crooked as hell and the criminal kids how just how to play them. It\'s a game. Also an open secret.</p>
<p>A lot of it came out during an earlier <em>internal affairs</em> investigation. Unfortunately the behavior never changed because the politics never changed. It\'s still going on.</p>

            Again, over time, the most corrupt police officers within the system became the police inside the schools. These officers were those who are best skilled at identifying the political objectives and instructions.

           <p>
            Those "School Cops" also have special privileges. It's a great gig. They get free "on campus" housing close to the schools they are assigned to etc. They're crooked as hell and the criminal kids how just how to play them. It's a game. Also an open secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of it came out during an earlier

            investigation. Unfortunately the behavior never changed because the politics never changed. It's still going on.

           <p>
            Authorities in Florida are investigating the death of a Miami federal prosecutor and father of three after his body was found on a beach in Hollywood, Florida, on Wednesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            The body was identified by local police as Beranton Whisenant Jr., 37, and his cause of death is currently being investigated as a crime. Police say he suffered a head wound.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whisenant worked in the major crimes unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami.

             And a couple trained at Venice airport where I was living at the time. Meanwhile, Dubyah was reading the friendly goat to little kids at Sarasota's own most black school, which he had never done before or after. Pictures show him reading the book upside down, but that may be him telling jokes or listening to an earpiece because he can't read. I imagine he fled out of SRQ since that is the closest airway that can go anywhere if the plan messed up.

             Oh that’s brilliant. Just make a post but don’t look any further? Just so you know you scrawny little faggot, I’ve been posting about the suspicious inconsistencies I have found about the school shooting and about the crisis actors for a few days now in the GreatAwakening sub. When it comes to the Sherriff, I made a post about him BEFORE I even found out about the girls allegations. I found that later and added it. Because of that and him being a crooked Sherriff in an area where human trafficking runs rampant, and how it was Wasserman Shultz district, I decided that maybe I should post it here too. If people disagreed and thought there was nothing to it, then they could move to the next post.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, people disagree with you because it got 165 upvotes. It wouldn’t have gotten even near that much if I didn’t list everything else that I found and added other people’s findings to the post. Why don’t you try making a post instead of policing everyone else’s? That just screams of shill. Why do you go thru so much trouble and research things only to try to dispute someone’s post? You are dull and depressing and are paid. I could never be paid to shill groups that are trying to make a difference.

                   Has to be a made up name. Whatever happened to Rickety Rocket? He changed his name to Supa. Anyone can do it with a written form to the S.S. office. Took about a week or two in the mail in the old days.

                  Exactly. You know another one that has a home on the key? Stephen (the writer) King. I've been to that area 2 or 3 times. Closest I got to Longboat was St Armands Circle. That whole area smells like money.

                   King has a pad on Casey Key. That is just south of there. He thought he was in Maine and was walking in the road, reading a book to steal ideas for his next book, when someone almost killed him with a vehicle. They had brakes, and he survived. His book flew straight up and hit him square in the forehead. He said that the book hurt him more than the car accident. Instant Karma. We locals call his resort Castlevania. Oprah was right up the street also living on Bird Key for a while right next to Jerry Springer, Hulk Hogan and across from lead singer of AC/DC Brian Johnson. I worked for Brian Johnson's wife and that might need a new thread.  Money? Naples was the most concentrated area of millionaires in the late 80's when a millionaire still meant something in monetary talk. Think huge cell phones. Sarasota County took that over long ago for many reasons.

                    That's funny about the karma with the book smacking him. I remember reading about him writing his book, The Dunes(?) while he was recovering from the accident. He seems like a blood sucker, so the Castlevania fits perfect. Lol. I love the Sarasota area, so beautiful. Saw a shark out in the bay on the Ringling Expressway bridge. There was a guy out in his canoe right by it and I was hoping I wasn't about to see my own version of Jaws. I imagine you saw a lot of juicy stuff while working for Johnson's wife. You should make your own thread if it can pass the mods rules.

                     No thanks. We call it Castlevania because of the old video game. Sarasota is a shit hole now thanks those stupid yankees in their kayaks, jetskis, pleasure boats, sailboats, and yachts. Message to the rest of the World is we hate you all with every fiber of our being and we wish you harm! Oh, and don't come here.

                       Just so you know the real rules. Yes Sir, and Yes Maam. Yes'm if your not sure. We still hold doors open for people. Know your route, and do not set out in rush hour traffic in any tourist town in the world. You will do just fine, but a real Florida experience is not had here anymore. We natives vacation out of town.

                        I saw some of "old" Florida when I was a kid.  My dad was in a car accident in Key West. I was like 8 or so. The memories of the roadside fruit stands and being pulled around in a raft by dolphins have stayed with me. The naval base with the ships in the harbor too. Can understand why you would vacation elsewhere. When I said I knew I wouldn't fit in there is I could see you need to be worth millions to be accepted there.

                         Easy. Get any one of these many Satanic bastards on pic/tape for months and make backups. Could be minor things. Could look like nothing, but put a time and a date attached?  Election time is closer than you think because the price goes up in the last year. You could afford a round the world trip.

               Amazing really. And very strange. All the fuss over a sheriff? You should make a post. I had heard about the Aerosmith guitarist helping the sheriff but Tyler himself. Shaking my head. I don't know if others even know about this.

                Another one about the dear sheriff. He should step down just for this. I saw him on CNNN with Fake Tapper today stating he wasn't going anywhere. I will have to say Fake did hit him pretty bad. I was really shocked by that alone.

                 I was too, and I think Tapper was being sincere, he was quite frustrated, no honor among thieves and whatever is going on, it's fun to watch ... I think there is a breakdown in communications between the media and the other players.

                  I enjoyed it too. Are they seeing him as a liability now? And what the crap was that he was doing with his mouth? I thought he was going to lick his lips off.

                   Haha, I don't remember his mouth I'd have to watch again, I probably am trying to do too much at once. Yeah I think the sheriff is toast now. Remember the young Kennedy thing w/ the chapstick problem? Don't feel obligated.

                    Lol, I remember the young Kennedy with his lips looking shiny white. He looked like he had rabies, haha. What a distraction for anyone watching. Bet he doesn't do that again.

                          I was looking at an old thread about the ? basement in the Viper room because of a post by Viperguy on preview Voat recently. Viperguy hadn't really posted since that time. He was stating why he thought Voat was shut down. I will link it to you if you want to see it. Anyway, I was glancing through comments and saw one you had about some of the old rock bands, including Joe Walsh. I thought I would leave this for you just for fun. This was a great stoner song. It was much better that way, lol.

                              I hate it for young people today. So many of them have no idea how to interact with someone one on one, in person. It really did change so much. That's why we see what we see today. That and so many feel entitled to whatever they want without having to earn it.

                                Oh, that would have been so boring, but you don't miss what you have never known. My kids and I talked recently about our days of picking out movies at the Blockbuster stores. They enjoyed just walking around looking at them. Malls will be a thing of the past soon too.

                      Saw where you posted today, so thought I would show you one connection I made. I couldn't find anything else about Pereira and if the hedge fund wire fraud guy was the same as the sheriff's friend, but I did find this. Pereira is a Portuguese name that was often changed to Perry upon immigration. So Joe Perry that was once part of Aerosmith must be related to the sherrif's friend Pereira.

                       Wow, that's fascinating. Yes they probably are related, that would explain the connection. Weird, saw your other comment too.

                          I'm sure they want something out of that deal, esp. with that area being so corrupt. Drugs? Who knows, but I'm sure they didn't do it out of the goodness of their heart. Lol. As far as Q goes I'm not a believer. Wish it was true, but usually things that are to good to be true are not true.

                            I believe everyone is entitled to their opinion, so no problem here either. Iv'e been looking into this creepy commercial that I saw recently. I found it on Youtube and by the comments I'm not alone about the creep factor. The company is out of San Fran. Seems some believe the company is not legit. Complaints about delivery dates, returns. Trying to found out who owns it. The only people who would REALLY enjoy this commercial are pedos or the adult diaper fetish types.

                                I looked on their Facebook, but didn't sign in. I hate knowing they track us. I don't really use it because of that. That's where I saw the comments with complaints.

                                  So many people are so deep into it they miss everything else going on in the world. Several people I know are this way. They can't go a day without looking at it.  Yeah, you never know what you will see on the TV tube now. I was watching some of The Divided States the other day... Episode on Portland and the protests. They were displaying The Patriot Prayer group as an alt- right white supremacy group. It pissed me off so much. Iv'e seem videos of these guys. They are just mainly a veterans group standing up for freedom of speech. They always group and attach names to people. Just tired of it.

                                      Me too. Have seen Gen Z may be Libertarians which would be a good balance. I don't believe the Republicans will ever survive and the Dems are going so far to the left. This country could use a Libertarian president. I know or think you are a Republican, but that party needs to merge more to the Libertarian side. That way the Dems would have a harder time winning.  I changed over to Independent from Dem.  Dems are cray cray now.

                                       I would have liked having Ron Paul tho he wasn't perfect. You may remember Ross Perot, I liked him cause he was an outsider. Yeah I'm conservative but these repubs, none are any good, I liked Trump cause I want him to go kick some butt lol, so tired of it all. The Dems are indeed wacko, radical left. Back in the day my folks were democrats cause they were in unions. I may log off soon. I'm in Texas right now.

                                        Yes, none on the left or right are worth it anymore. Yes, I know of both Ron and Ross. Ross was a little whacko. I just say that because my father in law was a big fan, and he was whacko, lol.  See you later on the forum.

                                         Lol, Perot was a trip, so funny. There's a video of a guy named Chip Tatum saying Bush asked him to "neutralize" Perot and that's why Perot quit. Not kill him, just threaten. Same guy that was involved in bringing down Gary Hart via honeypot. Okay, catch you later.

             The above reason is why I am posting this in pizzagate. Add in all the other criminal activity and Debbie Wasserman Shultz, I think it’s likely there is child trafficking going in there too.

            They are opting to tear down the school and rebuild fresh to wipe away the memory of the shoot shooting. Given the extreme lax given to the school by the police department and the amount of gangs operating out of there. I don't doubt something more is at play.

             The sheriff and police chief could always deny the violent acts (assaults, rapes, beatings etc.) were being ignored; that's why the good guys in the police dept gave the evidence of the stolen merchandise. That physical evidence couldn't be ignored and proved the scheme.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I bet there is probably some damning evidence stored on the school grounds itself.

              Sure it does, if the contractor is already set up. Remember, this is the East Coast. Not so easy on the West, but I have noticed these guys moving in, in the same pattern.

           <blockquote>

             Peterson is mentioned as part of a 2016 social services agency investigation into Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old identified by police as the gunman. According to a Florida Department of Children and Families report detailing that investigation, Peterson was approached by investigators and "refused to share any information . . . regarding [an] incident that took place with" the teenager.

            There could be a procedural reason for refusing to share this information. The kid was a minor. There are probably privacy laws. It could have been illegal to share the information. This is not damning by itself, but it's more info to consider.

            I think the shootings are real in a sense that people will die and the shooter will go to the prison. Now here is the question: how do they make the shooter to think "it's better to spend the rest of my life in prison than oppose these guys"? Will the shooters get eventually bailed out? Did they get tricked?

             Mk ultra. I've read somewhere that these shooters are on psychoactive drugs. they all claimed to hear voices in their heads. There's also a conspiracy theory that correlates to this which is a mild radio wave via cell phone that mixed with these drugs can alter your brain waves and make you controllable. But this is all conspiracy theory.

              Cruz went to 5 or 6 different schools.  They love handing out pills like candy for ADHD. Some schools get money for each kid they get to take these pills.  It 's disgusting.  Also that 's why he fell through the cracks as well, LE as we now know, were ignoring crimes committed by them, to gain state and federal funds. Letting children get away when young will only make matters worse.  Giving them pills they don't need only intensifies the mental issues.  Broward is a Cesspool and it's DWS's fault.

              Yes, I believe there is a link with mental illness, even depression, anxiety and ADHD. Some people are thinking it's the SSRI's causing these people to become violent.  I have one article about it, but also saw something on CBS the other day about a young gunman stopped by a friend that was going to shoot up a school. Guess what same problems with mental illness. I will see if I can find that one too.

            I know someone that works there, or did a few years ago, now she is a paralegal, not sure about then. I am just going to say I realized after some time, she knew all the white collar crimes, they couldn't be arrested for and prosecuted for, and the only way for a company to go after them, was in civil court.   Well well versed scammer makes lots of money, works as a team to. With a whole rack of lawyers on call.

            Dade and Broward county are like America's sodom and gomorrah. Honestly, I believe Florida's system is the worst in the country, when talking about pedophilia and false flags.

              I did not realise you had posted this about the police father giving his son a bullet proof vest.  I just mentioned it in a different post.  There is so much to catch up on, I had friends over for a long weekend and there is soooo much news!  Thanks for all the pings, I am going through them now :)

              Remember the Finders, and the Children of God cult?  Pretty sure I was approached by the latter last year. Older woman with a 12/14 Year old girl in a Publix. Old lady was her pimp/handler. Young girl made eye contact and smiled,. I smiled back. They waited right outside the door until I left. I smiled again and walked right past both of them. The young girl seemed confused and the old lady said maybe he doesn't like Punta in French, like she was consoling her. They got into a fancy car and drove away. That lady did not know I took French in H.S.

                That is the impression I got. They hurriedly walked off in front of me straight to the vehicle, like I might be a cop. I initially thought French prostitution ring, but then I quickly remembered that Canucks speak that language. I ruled out Cajuns immediately because of the accent and ... well, they just kill people that do that with or without LEO support.

                  Well, yes, but not really, all we need is a few coon asses to round this marais up real quick. Just like as an experienced English speaker in America, I can do different accents, so can a Cajun, in Francois. They are great at hand to hand combat and munitions too.

              I would have to wholeheartedly disagree with you on that.  Sheriff association, LE groups, conferences, all tie them together.  95 is a massive traffic route as is I-4.  Human traffickers have to coordinate their shipments with each other, passing through multiple jusrisdictions.  Israel is in DWS district.  I'm sure she hooks up her fellow pedopols when the visit the Sunshine State.

                I'm not sure where Broward fits in. Timothy's case includes people from several different jurisdictions and states I think. After looking, oddly enough, Broward may have made an injunction letting him enter some evidence or something, which would be odd for Broward because that is Wasserman's district and we know she is a snake.

                   Here it is. It looks like Broward is suppressing Timothy's evidence and saying that he cannot publish it. Right? Which means Broward is hindering his investigation?
