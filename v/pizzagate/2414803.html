<h1>Murder on the ski slopes: The mysterious death of Sonny Bono</h1>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY –  The recent shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and others, including Federal Justice John Roll, got me to thinking about the threats that often face public figures like members of Congress.</p>
<p>While attending a press conference with U.S. Reps. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma City) and Tom Cole (R-Moore), Red Dirt Report could hardly ignore the Oklahoma County deputies on hand as part of a newly-formed “Dignitary Protection Unit.” It was formed in the wake of the Giffords assassination attempt.</p>
<p>These are certainly strange times. Uncertain times.</p>
<p>Giffords, thankfully, is on the mend, despite the horrific nature of the gunshot wound she received to the head.</p>
<p>Someone who also received serious injury to the head was U.S. Rep. Sonny Bono (R-Calif.), back in January 1998. I thought of Bono today as I watched an old clip from 1965 of Sonny and Cher performing their hit “I Got You Babe.” And even though Sonny and Cher divorced, they did become successful at these later stages of their lives – Cher in a hugely successful solo pop career and Sonny as a Republican congressman. ....</p>
<p>Officially, it was reported that Bono died after skiing into a tree at on a run called “Orion” at the Heavenly ski resort at Lake Tahoe, along the California-Nevada state line.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s son Michael Kennedy had a fatal skiing accident in Colorado just days before Sonny Bono. And Sonny’s pal and fellow folk-pop-singer-turned-TV-personality John Denver died in that curious experimental aircraft crash off the California coast a few months earlier. I think there is more to this – and the death of New Age guitarist and Enid, Okla. native Michael Hedges right at that same time, in late ’97 – that I will get into at a later time.</p>
<p>Bono, an experienced skier, was on the Nevada side when his “accident” took place. Over the years there have been reports that punch holes in the official story.</p>
<p>Former FBI Agent Ted Gunderson reported some years after Bono’s death that he believed the pop-star-turned-politician was bumped off on the ski slopes as part of an “evil plot” conducted by “ruthless assassins.”</p>
<p>“It’s nonsense for anyone to now try to suggest that Bono died after crashing into a tree,” Gunderson said in an a piece posted in Australia’s Daily Telegraph newspaper on April 4, 2008.</p>
<p>Said Gunderson:  “There’s zero evidence in this autopsy report to show such an accident happened. Instead, there’s powerful proof he was assassinated.”</p>
<p>But who would want to harm Sonny Bono?</p>
<p>In a report posted on April 6, 2008 at DCDave.com and titled “The Cover-up of Sonny Bono’s Murder,” writer David Martin lambastes the American press for failing to report the huge discrepancies surrounding Bono’s death.</p>
<p>Martin writes that Bono had been approached by an investigator named Bob Fletcher and had approached Congressman Bono about “the activities of high-ranking U.S. military and government officials he claims were raking in millions from arms and drug deals in Central America and Southeast Asia.&quot; ...</p>
<p>How compelling is the new evidence? The five-page autopsy report prepared by Dr. David E. Palosaari, official pathologist for Washoe County at the time, concluded that the death was caused by &quot;craniocerebral injuries due to blunt force trauma (skiing accident).&quot;</p>
<p>But the Globe reports further:</p>
<p>Other injuries detailed in the document included a black eye, swollen lips, bloody nose, bruised jaw, and two upper teeth knocked out, all on the right side of the head.</p>
<p>But the pathologist also noted a series of small fractures in a &quot;central depressed region&quot; on the right side of Bono\'s skull and found &quot;some of the fractured bone pieces have a curved configuration.&quot;</p>
<p>Fletcher consulted a panel of experts and performed a re-creation to determine how these wounds were caused.</p>
<p>He concludes the depressed area was due to blows from a rounded-edged weapon wielded by a man taller than the 5-foot-nine, 165-pound politician and the killer was left-handed since the wounds are on the right side of Bono\'s face and head.</p>
<p>He also believes there was a second man who held Bono from behind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing about a skiing accident like this is that there is only one impact. All injuries revolve around the head/face slamming into the tree. If there are more areas of impact found, then the tree didn\'t do it ... someone else did and the accident was staged.  
</p>
<p>One of the comments caught my attention. It\'s from a John Carman and addresses border security: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it was a cover up....!(Excuse me if I did not respond earlier. It seems I am NOT getting notified of any responses. This is serious stuff. Remember, I knew these other men and they all died of suspicious circumstances as well. I was in touch with Sonny Bono 10 days BEFORE his death as I had sent him a copy of my VHS tape &quot;Corruption At The Border&quot;(now on DVD) and I was to be called as a witness to the Congress and Senate committees on National and Border Security etc....I have not been called. They all know about me. www.customscorruption.com </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I clicked on the link and found it still operable. It contains too much information to reprint. Things like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.customscorruption.com/">http://www.customscorruption.com/</a></p>
<p>It has been &quot;rumored&quot; for years in Customs Internal Affairs that certain Mexicans in Mexico had &quot;full&quot; access to the restricted government United States Customs Service Treasury Enforcement Computer System or TECS II since the early 1990\'s.  (According to an internal affairs source, former Assistant Customs Commissioner Mike Lane was in charge of &quot;communications&quot; during that time and &quot;may&quot; have been responsible for this &quot;set up&quot; in Mexico through U.S. Customs District Director Alan J. Rappoport who has special contacts in Tijuana, Mexico)</p>
<p>The reports were that there were FIVE &quot;unaccountable&quot; and &quot;untraceable&quot; computer lines with direct access, which were utilized in Mexico. One of which was just south of San Ysidro California in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If this were true, then ALL the information could be accessed by drug cartels for a &quot;price&quot; and they could access the various law enforcement links with DEA, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. State Department, DEA-NADDIS, C.L.E.T.S, N.L.E.T.S., Canadian Law Enforcement,  INS, INTERPOL, etc....That also means that everything that was input into the TECS lookout systems were &quot;compromised&quot;. This information is also shared with ALL U.S. Treasury Departments like the U.S. Secret Service as well as other important agencies like the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. as well.
Note: In one other case a former Latin American U.S. Customs Supervisor here in San Diego (Initials F.F.) allegedly &quot;gave&quot; Mexican authorities a specially &quot;encrypted&quot; Treasury radio transceiver with ALL Treasury frequencies so they could communicate with U.S. Customs. It was also common knowledge that this particular Latin Supervisor as well as others in Customs would give &quot;restricted&quot; information to the Mexican authorities which would confirm or deny that certain information on U.S. licensed vehicles were stolen or not. How do you think that happened??? </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is exceedingly curious that all those deaths happened in the same period of time. And as we know, Bill Clinton\'s impeachment hearings started up later in the year. Believe Bono\'s wife voted \'yes\' to impeach him, but it would have been Sonny Bono to do it had he lived. </p>
<p>Whether this has to do with Meno or not, I\'m not sure. Also, was there human trafficking involved? Again, not sure what was told to Bono. But he was in Vegas a lot and this accident took place there. And it wasn\'t as f Republicans were being targeted. As pointed out in the article, a Kennedy died in a similar accident. </p>
<p>Were they questioning why the border wasn\'t being secured? Were they going to fight the tide and begin blabbing? Quite possibly. My theory? </p>
<p>It\'s all a cabal.</p>',

            Bono, an experienced skier, was on the Nevada side when his “accident” took place. Over the years there have been reports that punch holes in the official story.

               If this were true, then ALL the information could be accessed by drug cartels for a "price" and they could access the various law enforcement links with DEA, U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. State Department, DEA-NADDIS, C.L.E.T.S, N.L.E.T.S., Canadian Law Enforcement,  INS, INTERPOL, etc....That also means that everything that was input into the TECS lookout systems were "compromised". This information is also shared with ALL U.S. Treasury Departments like the U.S. Secret Service as well as other important agencies like the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. as well.
Note: In one other case a former Latin American U.S. Customs Supervisor here in San Diego (Initials F.F.) allegedly "gave" Mexican authorities a specially "encrypted" Treasury radio transceiver with ALL Treasury frequencies so they could communicate with U.S. Customs. It was also common knowledge that this particular Latin Supervisor as well as others in Customs would give "restricted" information to the Mexican authorities which would confirm or deny that certain information on U.S. licensed vehicles were stolen or not. How do you think that happened???

           It is exceedingly curious that all those deaths happened in the same period of time. And as we know, Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings started up later in the year. Believe Bono's wife voted 'yes' to impeach him, but it would have been Sonny Bono to do it had he lived.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whether this has to do with Meno or not, I'm not sure. Also, was there human trafficking involved? Again, not sure what was told to Bono. But he was in Vegas a lot and this accident took place there. And it wasn't as f Republicans were being targeted. As pointed out in the article, a Kennedy died in a similar accident.

           Were they questioning why the border wasn't being secured? Were they going to fight the tide and begin blabbing? Quite possibly. My theory?
          </p>
          <p>
           It's all a cabal.

             These types of alleged murders that are made to look like accidents are that.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have to rely on forensic evidence/autopsies and usually they have to be interpreted b experts ... and experts lie all the time so ... ??? Yeah, we're screwed unless we happen to be a  coroner.
            </p>
            <p>
             The totality of the evidence is peculiar ... all those accidents befalling diverse people in that short period of time. Again, we'd have to revisit history to find out what each of those victims was working on ... whether they we were working together ... or giving someone trouble ... or just not agreeing with the agenda being pushed.

            Geffen also paid to have Tom King murdered after King wrote that book about Geffen titled The Operator. King died mysteriously from poison and Geffen hired the hit man to do this job.

              I think it was a poison that acted like natural causes of death but those poisons are what hitmen like to use. Tom King was young and healthy there was no reason for him to drop dead naturally the coroner covered up real cause of death if you are Geffen you are smart enough and rich enough to make sure a hired hit is covered up all the way.

             And it's more reason to question Cher and what role she played. She's still being promoted. Believe she made an appearance on The Voice. Doubtful that the coaches pick these people. Probably the executives decide who gets to be dragged out into the light after they're cleaned up and made presentable. I just keep thinking about Chastity. That poor kid. She was right at that age. Hitting three means it's all over for these kid's psyches. Bye-bye being whole and wonderful. Bye-bye innocence.

            Read the reddit report and found it amazing.  Makes a lot of sense.  I also agree that he had to have been offed.  GB is my guess.  Btw, the comments are Super Interesting.  Someone in comments claims to know Gunderson and knows a lot.  I almost always read the comments. DG as well has his hands all over this with Cher.  He donated $100M to the UCLA Med. Ctr.  which I am sure is working on cutting edge MK Ultra operations and transgender. He has evidently figured out which sex he is and likes.
