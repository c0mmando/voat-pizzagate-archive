            Why was this deleted?  No explaining how it is connected to pizzagate?  Well MK Ultra is related.  They use this on the elite pedos to keep them in check. etc.  This was one of the most red pilling posts ever.  They are brain washing us too.  Not anymore for me.  Glad I saw this. Please re-post it and find a way to connect it.  It is a service to all members and others.

            Wow, very interesting. I had no idea about Holmes' background... very sad that he snapped. I met the mom and dad of one of the girls that was killed in that shooting. It was after the gun rally -right to carry, and Alex Jones was the speaker. They had an anti gun moms against guns or some such counter event at the same time. We actually witnessed AJ confront this couple verbally as they confronted him. Very surreal. We ended up havin a few beers afterwards with that couple and she talked about that shooting and her daughters death and gun control the whole time. Again very surreal because she was very political and very adamant about gun control. She became an activist and her husband too. It was really terrible because it was their only child and she was a beautiful young lady. I can't even imagine that pain. I wonder if Holmes was a part of some mind control... Denver is strange. That underground base at airport etc...so who knows.

            Oh good, some ties are being made between "pizzagate" and the sciences.  Same twisted bunch....and yeah, they are liars, big time liars.  When it comes to science, often the only science being practiced is the science of deception.

             Well probably because people were woken up about Holmes and about fluoride.  This is huge for me.  I have long felt I should pull it out of my life.  Now I will.  No more fluoride.

            The Jews have subverted our country since it's creation. They use immigration and homosexuality to curtail the population growth. I have pity for those willing to give up their culture, Indians, and Chinese, for our bullshit goy international culture created by the Jew. I also have pity for those willing to subject themselves to homosexuality. It does not infringe upon my rights, but I feel bad because it is correlated with many health complications.

            They use purposefully use/used untested organo-mercury compounds (thimerosal) in vaccines, flouride in the water (99.9% of which is found in your pineal gland in flouroappatite crystals), and aerosols in the air to keep the people stupid. We are viewed cattle-like, just as the name for non-Jews, "Goyim", means.

             I agree with you on many things, but I'm sorry you're going to have to re-evaluate your world view here. My friend who is homosexual is one of the greatest people I know and has helped me MANY MANY times when there was nobody else. He is non-judgmental and a loving person and the world is better for him existing.

              I have no personal (human to human) judgments on people that are homosexual. Your friend is probably a great person, from what you have to say. I would have no problem being a friend with him, and I wouldn't be a dick about him being homosexual. I still hold the opinion that if he is engaging in anal sex, he is putting himself at a much elevated risks of sexually transmitted diseases, and he is much less likely to have a long lasting relationship, regardless of the political climate. 15% of homosexuals have 1000+ sexual partners in their lifetime, 79% of which are with strangers the first time. However, 15% of straight people have more than 8+ partners in their lifetime. It was weeded out of our populations a long time ago. I am not advocating the persecution of gays. I am just saying that it's normalization is directly due to Jewish influence, always with the goal of depopulation.

             A few years ago, the editor of the Lancet exclaimed how fluoride is a neurotoxin and thus isn't safe for human consumption.  There are also numerous papers on this subject.  Fluoride is a key component of some poisons used on vermin and was also administered in a more concentrated form than today on POW's in WW2 German camps to keep them docile and obedient.  I for one will do my best to shield myself and my family from this poison.

              And don't go overboard. It can be easy to poison yourself trying too hard to get rid of the fluoride. Biggest thing you can do is not get fluoridation at the dentist, or use fluoridated toothpaste. Stop intake, as your body does naturally excrete fluoride (at very low concentrations).

              I would recommend taking fresh coriander and then having a sauna session, repeat and consume high doses of water.  Glass bottled mineral water.  If you are able to get a massage, do this prior to the sauna but after the ingestion of coriander.  Coriander helps to remove mercury also.

              I am a biomolecular and materials science PhD. I am working to make an enzymatic chelator for fluoride via random mutagenesis (make billions of different random enzymes, and then test which one can bind to fluoride, and perfect the ones that bind). I would not take any of the things that people recommend, such as high doses of iodine or borax to flush out the fluoride. I would simply stop ingesting fluoride. Don't use fluoride toothpaste, and when you go to the dentist, skip out on the fluoridation of your teeth. I just don't recommend the homeopathic stuff because it is not tested in a scientific environment which I trust, just like the consumption of fluoride in the first place. So basically:

               buy a water distiller for 70 bucks off of amazon and use citric acid to clean it if you need to
              </li>
              <li>
               don't use fluoridated toothpaste again in your life
              </li>
              <li>
               keep your eyes peeled for organic fluoride chelators/something thoroughly tested to pull F- out of your body

                You can use coconut oil mixed with bicarbonate of soda.
                <br/>
                Consumption of garlic keeps bacteria at bay also.  Cocoa contains theobromine which is strengthening for the teeth, as does pineapple.  Green tea strengthens the gums.

                I use Xyli White off of Amazon (made by NOW solutions). It is cheap, and it's basically just Xylitol (a sugar alcohol) paste, with some Papain (an moderately large enzyme that breaks peptide bonds- a cysteine protease, and thus kills organic matter in your mouth). It also interferes with urine canniboid tests in some people.
               </p>
               <p>
                The biggest concern is the possibility that you could have an allergy of Papain, which goes hand in hand with a latex allergy.

                The rest of the ingredients are, glycerin, sorbitol (more sugar), hydrated silica (reduces GI intake of aluminum), sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, various plant derivatives such as leaf oil and spearmint oil, and potassium sorbate.

                This is a tough one. You might want to actually consider the large doses of iodine/iodide solution if you know that you are for sure in a radioactive environment.. Lugols 5% is cheap. Have what you buy tested for radiation, if it is not made in Germany  (they are required to test). Test the air if you have the resources. There isn't much that any of us can do about anything other than high iodine 131 levels. The PTB destroyed the planet with Fukishima in a planned meltdown (all American companies). It's only a matter of time before the radiation really starts to effect the population.

                Many bottled water companies have the same fluoride concentration as your tap water if you live in the United States. I highly recommend a water distiller. If you live anywhere else in the world, in Europe, or China, fluoridation of the water is illegal unconsented medication.

                I am a student/teacher in science at a University which you would know by name. I LARP a lot so that TPTB couldn't figure out who I am through a biography from my page. It is very dangerous to dox yourself, and they want you to. That's why all of those google threads with the google group pages were going around.

              Oh no. These are Jews. Not Judaism. Specific Jews. Freemasons are the "favored slave" club of these trillionaire Jews. Freemasonic traditions are Kabbalah traditions.

               Wouldn't they be Zionists? Even REAL Jews hate Zionists. Zionists hide behind the "safety" of anit-semitisim but are not true Jews.

                There are many Jewish people who are absolutely chill. The only qualm that I have with them is they don't give their infant boys a decision in whether or not they they skin their penis of the most sensitive flesh you possess. It's actually stem cells when they scissor it off of the kid.

                Jews and Muslims scissor off parts of their kids' dicks. That's fucked up and always will be. I don't really have any problem with the rest of the two religions. As long as people respect each other, and the human rights of their own people, I have no issues.
