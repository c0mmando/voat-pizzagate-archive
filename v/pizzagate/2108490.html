<p>So what is this you say? Ponies? Is this another code word and WTH is she trying to say with this? We\'re used to hidden messages, so you tell me? Is there something buried in this? If you say, &quot;No,&quot; think again. This dialogue is from &quot;Something About Mary&quot;, and it\'s a conversation between Ben Stiller (who plays the taxi driver) and The Hitchhiker who\'s really a serial killer. This is immortalized by another tweet: </p>

<p>She\'s comparing Sanders in the debates to the workout idea from the serial killer from There\'s Something About Mary. </p>

<p>Is that what she\'s doing? Just likening him in debates to the serial killer? Or is she likening him TO the serial killer? Help me out here. I think there\'s a larger undercurrent here. </p>
<p>Remember, this was started by Huma &quot;I Married a Perv&quot; Abedin. While I wouldn\'t trust Abedin as far as I could throw her (and throwing would involve touching her so none of that would happen), she does have a &quot;unique&quot; insight into the major players. Whether it was because she ever viewed any of them horizontally is debatable. What is not is this intriguing clue.</p>

            Also I think you are wrong about hidden meanings.  This is internal communications among Clinton's team.

           <p>
            I know you are wrong that "Huma Abedin Likens Sanders Debating to a Fictional Serial Killer" because when you look at the image of the page in that tweet, it clearly identifies Jake Sullivan as the person making the Something About Mary reference.
           </p>
           <p>
            and given that nobody knows that killer's name would he be the reference you would use if you wanted people to think of him as a killer?

Anyone  know what 'bfg' is because I looked it up on urban dictionary and it comes up:- BigF..kingGun lol hopefully its not that.  If it is we need to see who was killed around 10/11/2011 haha  (to me, in english,  this is Nov, but probably Oct)

              What the heck? I just went onto google to check if I could see the dates, and it says:- Quote   'JIMMY COMET OWNER OF COMET PIZZA ASKED ABOUT PICS OF KIDS ON HIS INSTAGRAM'  AND  'YouTube Privacy Warning
YouTube (owned by Google) does not let you watch videos anonymously. As such, watching YouTube videos here will be tracked by YouTube/Google'.
SO IF I CLICK ON IT THEY ARE GOING TO TRACK ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - ACTUALLY THIS MEANS THAT THEY DO HAVE ALL THE DETAILS OF THESE SICK PERVERTS THEN - IF THE VIEWER HAS NO PRIVACY AND THEY TRACK USERS!!!

               Amazing how they're using the info to harass people trying to do something about this. Meanwhile, JA and his crew are given a pass.

            Was she posting these during the debates then? Or she's just now posting them? I have no clue. It would have to be code for something. Not random. I hope they didn't drug him and video him performing some beastiality act or something. It sounds crazy. But these freaks ARE CRAZY.

             I swear this passed through my goddamn head. It is crazy and I dismissed it, but is this what she was hinting at?
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of the first question, my understanding is that she just did this. If this is a correct assumption, it means that Huma and HRC are still majorly pissed at him! But for what? An infraction? Remember, he was roughed up. What went on? What does this mean? Why are they so angry?

              Well since Assange recently put out a tweet saying that Mook threatened Bernie Sanders, maybe it's a warning for Bernie to keep his trap shut. What do you think? It's just too weird to be a random thing someone would post. It has to be a message to him somehow.

               It HAS to be? Do you read tea leaves too, wench?  I could totally imagine you do.  I cant help but notice you women are much more interested in reading twatter and speculating and watching Jewtubers than getting down to actual new research.  But the latter is so very easy -- surely even you are capable. Does it just bore you, all the reading? Do you not know how to use search engines effectively?

                What research do you do besides research on JEWS? I do a lot of reading on psychology. That's how I know you have such low self esteem that you come online to act like a big bad bully behind your computer screen you insecure scrawny little coward.

                I proved the other day that you're a fag who's been engaged twice. To men! You also like to go to the transvestigation sub. No wonder you don't like women. You want to be one!
               </p>
               <p>
                You're a narcissistic asshole who has to always be right. Guess what? You aren't in control of this board fairy boy. You definitely don't control me. So stop being jealous over my comments about alpha males. Stop thinking that I must like you. I don't go for ugly narcissistic little bitches that like to be bent over. If I were looking for a man, he'd be manly. Definitely not a fag.

                 A lot of reading on psychology you say, LOL!
Does it take a lot? Cuz it seems pretty simple: everything is the opposite, aggressivity is really insecuirity, neat and easy for your kindergarten brain.

                  That's your answer for EVERYONE. Practically everyone here is dumb in your eyes. There's no need to speculate on your manhood. It was proven in your own words in a post you left on another site.

                  Stop avoiding the question. What research do you do besides research one Jews?

                   CLICK "submissions" YOU STUPID BITCH! My posts have run the entire gamut and there arent any for the first several months about Jews whatsoever.

                   Your only response to any counterfacts will be that i simply laid all that evidence long in advance -- but guess what, stupid? At a certain point of effort required on my part NORMAL PEOPLE will begin to doubt.  Suppose i have 100 DMs from equine -- supposedly me writing to myself.  How about 300?

                   DO YOU UNDERSTAND, STUPID?  You are not NORMAL. You are BELOW AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE, so watch that confirmation bias of yours, because your ENTIRE CASE depends on SUSPECTED PUNS LOL

                        You're dillusional. Almost everyone here can't stand you and you get on our nerves. However people feel about Jews is up to them. But, you go way too far. What I find funny is that you AND your alt, Equineluvr, are both extreme Jew haters. But both alts admit to being Jew 🤣 Now THAT IS RETARDED! Lmao!

                         Have you ever read a book cover-to-cover? One without pictures i mean? It's "DELUSIONAL" and your inability to reconcile   a part-Jew exposing Jewish crimes proves your mental handicap.  Seriously, your family should apply for a tax break from the state, if youre even a taxpayer, which i doubt.

                        <p>
                         Every Jew mentioned here validates me further, but I have no doubt you will ALWAYS  resist and think youre spiting someone. Just as youll never admit I'm not equine even though it is TOTALLY ILLOGICAL ON ITS FACE if you think for one minute.  Just get your self-esteem from something more within your reach, like a puzzle. But not a crossword, i mean like a 20-piece puzzle.

               It could well be a follow up. In other words Assange is asking what the leverage was, and Huma is reminding him that they know where the bodies are buried?

               Makes sense, but is it the truth.

                Huma did not say the thing about the serial Killer in There's Something about Mary.  Jake Sullivan did and he didn't do it this week, it was back during the campaign.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason this is coming out is it's from Hillary's new book.
               </p>
               <p>
                The official publish date is next Tuesday, but independent bookstores have got copies already....there are not supposed to sell any until the publish date, but obviously reporters have got there hands on them.

            Found this:
            <a href="http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2013/06/04/what-is-pony-play/">
             http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2013/06/04/what-is-pony-play/
            </a>
            When Pony Play was brought to my attention for this segment I wasn’t quite sure what it was and what to expect. Once I saw pictures, I assumed this was just some kinky sexual activity. I had no knowledge of anything in the BDSM world and in fact I had to look up the definition of BDSM. Before meeting Persephone, I assumed she would be a handful being that she was a dominatrix and the trainer of her ponies. Upon meeting Persephone my view of her changed immediately, she welcomed us in her home and was very nice to us and even bragged to us about her herb garden.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once Persephone fully explained and showed us what pony play was, I quickly realized that everything I thought this was going to be was actually not the case. While some people do engage in sexual acts during pony play, that is not a necessity. I learned that pony play is actually more of a role-play and that Persephone’s Pony Play was not sexual at all. Both Persephone and her pony Ivy both have committed boyfriends and they do not engage in any sexual acts outside of their relationships.
           </p>
           <p>
            While some pony players play for the sexual stimulation they get from it, Mistress Persephone and Ivy Red do not do it for that reason at all. Mistress Persephone enjoys the power she has over a person and dominating them rather than “getting off on it.” Persephone’s pony does not play for any sexual reasons either, but likes to be dominated and be the center of attention which is why her costume is so detailed. The more intricate the costume, the better the experience they get out of it. The entire payoff for these ladies is for the pony to act like a real pony.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our shoot was about three days long, and in those days I ended up being a part of that lifestyle—not to say I dressed up and participated, but just the impact of the people I met. Even though Persephone was the person I was filming, I mentally became a part of her world. When anyone would stare or say something under their breath, I found myself defending her and pony play. Being a non-fetish heterosexual African American male never in a million years would I think I would feel and care about someone like Persephone and pony play, but along the way she became my friend and I did for her what I would do for any my friends or family. In short, I learned acceptance. I walked away from this experience knowing 1.) There is nothing that can shock me. And 2.) It’s not what you do behind closed doors that shapes who you are.

             You are stupendous for ferreting out this. Never even saw it.

             Yup, she could be riffing off of that. But in terms of his home state, has anyone even done a cursory sniff around to maybe child care advocates disappearing? Or opponents being eliminated? Has there been a hint of scandal, and the person raising the stink about Sanders maybe ending up in the river? Never occurred to me to even look.

            if it helps, I think that Huma met Weiner through the Clintons (arena of the ny political scene) and WJC officiated their wedding. What is going on in the tweet, I have no idea.

             She met Weiner through Democratic politics, but not necessarily through the Clintons.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In a new interview with Vogue, Hillary Clinton‘s right-hand woman opens up about the moment she first met her husband, at a Democratic National Committee retreat on Martha’s Vineyard in 2001. “It didn’t go so well,” Abedin recalls. “A friend of mine came up to me and said, ‘He’d like to meet you.’ ”

              This "shill" has expanded the codeword list substantially by FINDING FRONT ENTITIES -- thats verifiable because you can FIND OTHER EXAMPLES.

             A pony is a stereotypical gift for a spoiled child ---&gt; Bernie will spoil Americans with expensive handouts. Abs is something people want quickly with less effort
 TSAMary is one of the most famous comedy films ever.

              This is exactly what this is about. The pony refers to Bernie promising single payer/expanded Medicare for all, something Hillary said would never happen and to promise it to his supporters, Bernie was promising something, "a fairy tale," that would never happen. THATS IT!!

              As harsh as your comments may be, you definitely bring a good viewpoint to the table. Appreciate your calling out of a lot of the obvious confirmation bias that I see here. Your approach, well, it's unique ;)
