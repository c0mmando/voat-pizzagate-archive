            Well  if  you  are  sincere  and not  just  using this to promote yourself for  financial  gain (which would be a  heinous  crime  to  GOD, which is  in  part  I think  what  Seaman  has  done) this is  just  what  needs  to  be  done-force the issue  before  mainstream citizens; however the  important  point  is  what  your  message is  designed  to  do-nudge  people  to  become  awake and  come together, or  incite  people  to  violence  without thinking through their  actions-if  this is  allowed  to  go  down  that  path  it  will  be exactly what  the  SUB-HUMANS want, an excuse  to  declare  martial  law

             Absolutely not. I agree DS has made it quite a sensational topic for himself just to make money.  I don't care about money or glory in this sport, this is a means to help those that need it most. I appreciate your support. God bless.

            We need to talk. You have your head on straight and you are honest. yes, the horror of discovering all this is debilitating and many, myself included, did not initially go looking for it, it found us. After all is said and done this is a spiritual war. I have been in it for 21 years after discovering my children were involved. I found myself being attacked and harassed. Funny thing though, once you go down the rabbit hole it just gets more and more convoluted and crazy. God is the answer, and perhaps, us that have found ourselves in this 'war'  were maybe chosen for it. It is not for the weak but it can weaken us, this disgusting reality that people are abusing children, for a number of different reasons and yes, there is a ritual abuse-satanic element for sure. I know. Let me know how I can reach you

            I recommend posting a link to what it was that red pilled you. That way this thread doesn't get deleted under submission guidelines. In terms of rule 1, creating an organization dedicated to exposing the cover up of global pedophilia would be sufficient.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems to me your awakening experience nearly caused you to "black pill". My awakening experience in 2012 wasn't very pretty either, so I know how you feel. I was at a low point in life, my faith already on the rocks. I was lucky in terms of the timing of my awakening process. During this process a very specific quote got through to me. To be honest, if it weren't for that line, I would have certainly "black pilled" and completely fell to despair. That quote is now like a mantra to me to preserve my sanity. I do say this A LOY, so others know what I'm refering too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, ignore our local trouble maker. He's a massive asshole who actively tries to "black pill" people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mods, if this doesn't cut the mustard, move this thread instead of axing it for this is actually a VERY good idea to help red pill people.

            <p>
             You think if I made it to a platform like the UFC that a riot for a UFC fighter fighting for child exploitation awareness wouldnt just bring MORE attention to the issue?
I mean, who else is doing it? It would be pretty dumb for them to show the very hand I'm trying to expose. They'd have to kill me before I got to the biig stage, and to that I say - game on.

              I think it could only work AFTER mass exposure to the public, because any organization you can isolate is potential for false flags. Remember the entire problem with PG is that pedophiles run organizations pretending to be in support of children, which makes it an easy target for the global elite. It's better to wait until trials are under way before proceeding.

            Your real purpose is to reinvigorate young men, especially white men, to be fit and actively defend their communities.  Professional sports is just another tool of control and distraction.  PG is not just elite pedophiles dude, that doesnt make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            You wouldnt care so much, naturally, about some 3rd world society where they fuck children.  Your passion is defending your own countrymen. If PG ended tomorrow we would still be fucked.

            Basically you need to set your sights higher.  And remember: we aim to protect the legacy of our forefathers and we dont need to justify it any more than Japanese need to justify remaining Japanese -- though if Japan had 7,000 Jewish organizations as we do here you can bet your last dollar they'd be criticized for maintaining their Japanese majority and culture.

             You seem to have not understood the fact I'm aware this is a global atrocity and I care just as much about an asian child or a Haitian child(like the kind Hillary and Silsby were trying to traffic).  This has zero percent to do with race.  You might be right about pro sports being a tool of distraction but you can't pass up that many possible red pills.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd argue debating the amount of melanin present in your skin is the REAL distraction considering we all bleed one color with varities of blood types across all races.
            </p>
            <p>
             You didnt read this cause it clearly states ending elite pedophilia and child exploitation which falls under the sub niche of human trafficking. When you take into consideration how many politicians would fall over this, its major.  Will it fix the entire world? No.  but I will have done my duty to protect innocence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I'm hispanic. So stop telling me what my cause is or isnt.  Shill.

              For an athlete you are very ignorant about race. Havent you heard of blacks having more fast-twitch muscle fibers? Race can be determined from a skeleton or a hair follicle. The idea that melanin is what determines what societies people build is ridiculous.  But iron in blood reacts to oxygen in the air by turning red, so race is meaningless? LOL.
             </p>
             <p>
              The POINT is that PG is not about Satanists who love raping kids because that DOESNT MAKE SENSE.  So your little project is ultimately meaningless if it doesnt attack the root of the problem.

              Id love to go to your Hispanic country to which you can always flee and be welcomed -- and bring my extended family telling the locals how ignorant they are cuz race affects only skin color.
