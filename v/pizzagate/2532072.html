            That's a pretty good summary article you've linked to. We need more like that. It's too bad it isn't loaded with links to all of primary sources! That would make for a powerful share.

            As she is linked to UK government I googled her name with David Axelrod. He and Jim Messina were placed by the Obama admin in the two major UK parties in the 2011 UK general election to make sure Cameron got elected.
           </p>
           <p>
            When pizzagate broke I searched Axelrod's twitter and he had deleted all his tweets where he had used pizzacode. I could tell he had done this because the replies were of couse still on twitter and they were replying with pizza coded comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll have a search of her twitter.

             Who the heck is this Axelrod? Do we have even one thread devoted to doxxing this POI? How common is the last name Messina? I hate to admit that I wikid this, but I did. English crime gang from Sicily. The father of the five Maltese Messina brothers was Giuseppe from Linguaglossa in Sicily. In late 1890 he came to Malta and worked in a brothel in the notorious Strait Street (Triq Strada Stretta) in Valletta. He married a Maltese woman from Zejtun with the surname Debono and had two sons Salvatore (born 20 August 1898, Hamrun) and Alfredo ( born 6 February 1901, Hamrun) He then moved to Alexandria in Egypt in 1905 where there was a thriving Maltese community and built a chain of brothels. The other three sons Eugenio (born 1908 Alexandria, Egypt) , Attillo (born 1910 Alexandria) and Carmelo ( born 1915 Alexandria) were born in Egypt. All the five brothers joined their father in running brothels and prostitution. In 1932 the Egyptian authorities expelled Giuseppe and his sons. The family returned to Malta as Giuseppe had Maltese citizenship. In 1934 Eugenio the third son of Giuseppe, born in 1908 moved to London with his French prostitute wife Colette. She helped establish the sex trade in London. The other Messina brothers followed Eugenio and established themselves in Soho, London.

              She's had everything prior to the 2016 presidential election scrubbed from her twitter - probably with the aid of twitter. This is her second tweet after the scrub from 14 October 2016 and it is a mention of lobster risotto.

              Originally I stopped searching after I couldn't find mentions of pizza or David Axelrod, but since you were interested I did a date search. I'm afraid you'll have to go through the NSA if you want to access her twitter history.

            She was mentioned in the Feb. 2013 issue of Washington Life magazine as co-hosting an intimate reception for PeacePlayers International, an organization that brings kids from cultural groups that hate each other together via playing basketball.  They have what they call a "Twinning Program." One of the guests was

            None of them show Latham (unless she's in the background).  In fact, it's almost like someone scrubbed photos of her from the internet intelligence operative style.  Or she avoids the camera, but really it seems like there would be some pics of a person in the public positions she's held.

             So Sara Latham has a job to do. **Podesta’s Girl Friday is a Rothschild watchdog **
Now get this: Matthew’s former ace at Freud Communications, Sara Latham was on the White House staff of Bill Clinton, a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and Microsoft, and she is the Chief of Staff for Podesta Associates and his liaison staffer to the Hillary for America campaign. Latham is the Rothschild watchdog over Podesta, the Clintons and the Democratic Party leadership. She is also a mentor to Chelsea Clinton.

             Was that little girl (McCaan) a sacrifice to put them all in power? Is that why these people are all “sick”? They sacrifice people to stay in power? Is that why they need Haiti? Are they not meeting a sacrificial quota and that’s why people are “waking up”?

              The McCann case does seem to have struck right at the heart of something evil that required extraordinary coverup tactics.  It's highly suspiciouos that people in high places dropped everything to focus on "finding" the perp who took one little girl from a supposedly ordinary family while other kids are snatched, raped, tortured and killed by the hundreds and thousands without seeming to cause a ripple.

              If you are checking into Ghislaine Maxwell, you may want to track down the other computer- generated images that were made of persons of interest surrounding Medelaine McCann's abduction.
The 2 that closely resemble the Podestas are well known, but there are maybe a half dozen others.
One seemed to have a strong resemblance to Maxwell.

               The people tweeting to her are amazing.  Podesta, Dan Pfieffer.  Dan Rather, Marc E Elias.  She def is not some ordinary sec'y. 
There is much more to her than has been made of.  Is she one of those people hiding in plain sight?  Under the radar too. Her connections to Podesta, Clintons,  Freud seems to be a place the Podestas dropped as well.  These people are always connected because they can trust no one else.  They can't bring in new people. Very rare.  Usually the same old same old.

                     On her twitter there are 3 pictures Is she in one of them, like the first one.  It may be.  Why the secrecy about what she looks like?  Something is off about that.  Very weird.  Could she know there are incriminating pics out there of her.  She would have had to have them scrubbed or how odd there just are not any of her.

                      I think that's Chelsea and that Sara took the picture.  Yes, the lack of photos is odd.  It's like what is done for intelligence operatives.

                       I mean, did she commit some crimes and there may be pictures that put her at the scene of the crime, or something similar?  Really, the absence of photos really casts suspicion on her.  Hmm. Makes you wonder.  It makes it obvious actually.   I think she may be much more important than many of us suspect.

                 I noticed I could not find anything either.  Also notice there is not one on her Twitter either.  Evidently she and others don't want us to know what she looks like.  For a reason.
