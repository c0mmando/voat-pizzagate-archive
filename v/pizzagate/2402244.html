<p>&quot;• Cedric Cuthbert, the night shift custodial manager at Disney\'s Port Orleans resort, who was downloading child porn last year on his work computer while writing a sermon for his church, where he was the pastor, according to police. Cuthbert pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to six years in prison.</p>
<p>• Paul Fazio, who worked in an Animal Kingdom Lodge gift shop. Fazio was convicted of downloading videos showing &quot;multiple scenes of nude prepubescent children engaging in sexual activity with adults and other children,&quot; the police report said.</p>
<p>• William Marrero-Maldonado, who worked for Disney security. He was arrested in April after an Osceola County Sheriff\'s Office investigation claimed that he was downloading child porn videos. He has pleaded not guilty.
In the February sting by the Lake County Sheriff\'s Office, police also arrested 32-year-old Patrick Holgerson, another Disney employee. Holgerson sent nude photos and engaged in explicit sexual chats online with someone he thought was a 13-year-old boy and his uncle, according to police records. After he showed up to meet the boy, Holgerson ran from police.&quot;</p>

             I've heard that the park itself, every bit of it, is just one big ritual site. So by simply
             <em>
              being at
             </em>
             Disneyworld/land, you are participating in whatever ritual is happening at that moment. I imagine they do the sacrifices and whatnot in the underground tunnel system, which 100% exists and you can see the entrances to it throughout the parks if you know what to look for.

             Thanks! Disney always seems to come into play in the sick thread of things somehow. When I was there a few months ago I debated mentioning it to my girlfriend who was having her Disney dream so to speak and is ignorant to PG and I ended up staying quiet. I saw that symbol straight away on that ride. I'm sure Human Trafficking still occurs there as well as the other major theme parks.

              I have the same problem. My girlfriend is sound asleep when it comes to Disney, she loves their movies and wants to show them to our kids in the future. All I had to do was
              <em>
               mention
              </em>
              that I didn't want to show Disney films to our children, and the reaction I got from her, you'd think I had just told her something absolutely vile. She literally had a look of
              <em>
               hatred
              </em>
              on her face when I said that. THAT is how strong the Disney mind control is, and I know for a fact that I'm not the only PG person who has probably had to deal with that with a spouse or family member.

            I believe Fritz Speingmeier's source(s) that told him:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Disneyland has been a favorite ritual and programming site for the Illuminati
             <strong>
              in its off hours,
             </strong>
             and many of Disney’s staff are into the occult."
            </p>
            <p>
             page 11 in his "Ezekiel" book:
             <a href="https://ia600206.us.archive.org/19/items/SpringmeierFritzEzekial63_201603/Springmeier_Fritz_-_Ezekial_6_3.pdf">

            Because I recently remembered something from Disneyland or Disney World, in close proximity to the It's a Small World Ride.  It was in my younger days, I can't remember my age in these limited memories for the most part, but it was probably the 1970's, so in my older childhood or teens.  I was walking in the dark near that ride in a fake stone tunnel along a sidewalk with a man with a flashlight.  I remember him a lot, as my "partner" as though we were undercover -- even though we were young - he was about 10 years older than me.   (And in my normal life I do not do any espionage or anything like that, for gosh sakes. )  We stopped and were talking, I was procrastinating.  He finally said to me, kindly but under pressure, "They're never going to believe you're taking this long to go to the bathroom!"  I acknowledged that and we walked a ways to a door.  When it was opened it was brightly lit in there.  All I remember is once I began to walk into that room (I only remember seeing adults as I entered) my whole demeanor changed and I became very authoritative, not an "alter," but an act I was putting on.  I can't explain to you what that was all about, because I don't remember.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I think I was used by TPTB for some ability to "work with energy" -- which in normal life I don't know how to do, so I assume there was some kind of ritual to be performed.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might not have been after hours, I really don't know.  But anyway, I thought I'd share that.

              I don't know how to edit down my background to a comment because I just tried summarizing it for you here and it actually went over the character limit.  Ugh.  This sounds ridiculous without a lengthy explanation, but I think my parents were involved in Pedogate IC black ops, both through my dad's employer's parent company, and, through maybe belonging to some kind of Illuminati energy manipulation-natural ability bloodline.  Wow, terrible explanation, sorry.  One day I'll post my story here, but I want some evidence first.
