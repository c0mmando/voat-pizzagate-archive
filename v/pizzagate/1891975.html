            I wonder about that cruise ship connection myself.  I particularly wonder about it because Norwegian Cruise was one of the words that was Googled to get to a pedophile chatroom on the deep web that was reported to FBI and I am assuming led to some kind of breakthrough.  I have Googled a lot of cruise related things looking into that avenue and there is just a lot of weird random stuff there.  Nothing one hundred percent solid.  But weird random chatrooms and comments left there.  Now I have a whole lot more searching to do.  If anyone else happens to look into that, I know that those strange pedophile chatrooms have, in the past, been hidden on hotel websites in other languages like Chinese.  But when you scroll further it is all in English or Norwegian.  I am going to look into that further.  It could be nothing, but my instincts are saying there could be a lot more going on out there in international waters or wherever.  Cruise ships could be like a pedo paradise.  Yuck!

             It's interesting how the prison system "doesn't work all the time" and isn't perfect when you're rich, but for us poor folks, it's just fine as it is.

            This is big and we need to use it as best we can.  I wonder if he is part of the ring in NY or involved with some pedo parties on the Celebrity Infinity Cruise Ships.  I have long wondered about the Cruise Ships.  There is a Pedo Gold Mine there.
