            So here's a new angle: after asking them if they think sex trafficking is real, ask them if they've ever heard of Lydia Cacho. Tell them that she pretty well documents the message that pizzagate is trying to convey. Get a blurb bio of who Lydia Cacho is and some quotes handy on what Lydia has uncovered. Include the name of her book and make absolutely sure you say she's testified in court and that there were convictions based on what she's said. Here's the link to who she is in case someone didn't see it on Voat:

            People are still claiming there's a basement there and underground tunnels used for trafficking.  Still claiming the liquor storage shelving are cages intended for children.   Still claiming a video shows a child screaming within Comet.  Still claiming many other businesses on that block are involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is both a massive shifting of the goalposts and an acknowledgement of how weak the investigation has been.

            Pizzagate involves the Podesta emails.  It's dishonest to say otherwise.  Pizzagaters beleieve there is evidence of pedophilia in them.  The other stuff you mention has nothing to do with

              People are still claiming there's a basement there and underground tunnels used for trafficking. Still claiming the liquor storage shelving are cages intended for children. Still claiming a video shows a child screaming within Comet. Still claiming many other businesses on that block are involved.

            <p>
             Are those "people" you? Is that what you believe? That there is a basement at Comet Ping Pong with underground tunnels used to traffic children who had been locked in cages in a liquor store on a block of businesses also covering for the operation?

              Pizzagate involves the Podesta emails. It's dishonest to say otherwise. Pizzagaters beleieve there is evidence of pedophilia in them. The other stuff you mention has nothing to do with.

             "Pizzagate" is a hashtag. It is an all-encompassing header intended to cover everything related to [INSERT YOUR BELIEF HERE]. While it may have become popular in relation to the Podesta emails and alleged code words (which, for the record, I do believe are real), the actual CRIMINAL part of this whole investigation pre-dates Podesta and his emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Pizzagate" is the new "
             <strong>
              Franklin Cover-Up
             </strong>
             ." The notion that human trafficking, particularly of children, began with Wikileaks or somehow only came to light because of them is near-sighted and does a disservice to the decades of documented abuse already on record. Worse yet, since the only people to "define" what "pizzagate" is publicly are those in the media wishing to dismiss it, to ask someone if they think Pizzagate is real shows a lack of understanding of the facts.

              I'm a complete pizzagate skeptic.  Shall we make a thread to try to define this.
             </p>
             <p>
              But at its core pizzagate starts with the claim that there is evidence in John Podesta's emails of pedophilia and child trafficking and Podesta is part of a pedophile ring involving Hillary Clinton, Podesta's brother and James Alefantis.  A supporting claim is that Clinton is connected to Laura Silsby's arrest in Haiti and Clinton knew who she was before she was arrested.  This claim is false.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is this your full definition?

I disagree with this entirely.  Pizzagate came out of pol on 4chan and thedonald on Reddit and a couple of twitter accounts.  The denizens there adopted this term and defined the investigation.

            pizzagate describes to me truthseekers trying to expose the paedophile ring running the world. and this encompasses politicians, churches, businesses and world governments. the cia is at the heart of it because they are paedophiles using paedophilia to blackmail powerful people to do what they want. it also involves satanism and luciferianism. whistleblowing can result in death and we all being surveilled and censored.

            I think that It's important to see the NCMEC for what it is: A private organization that has a monopoly on the data that our own government chooses not to track. One of my "Do you believe in Pizzagate?" questions is: "Why do we outsource the protection of vulnerable children to a private organization, with no real oversight? Doesn't it strike you odd that we accept that the NSA makes recordings of us while we take a shit (under the guise of protecting us), but the same government can't manage to build a database of these children?"

             NCMEC was founded on the heels of the Adam Walsh "kidnapping."

             The Adam Walsh case was used to usher in TONS of new federal laws, many of which had NOTHING to do with the actual Walsh case.

            There is a lot of out there stuff that spans pizzagate and I can honestly say I find a lot of it unbelievable and am often conflicted about it being a massive conspiracy vs. a small cabal of bad actors...
           </p>
           <p>
            Whichever version you believe, to avoid turning people off just say that you believe there is some truth to it and start small.  I find a light pill for others to swallow, is bringing up the Clinton/Epstein connection and Hassart, and is a good way to get others to start to put their foot in the door.  I had that conversation with someone, and now everytime we watch the news, they always point out that so and so looks like hes a kiddie-diddler.

            wait does this sub not believe that anymore? That the Podesta's, Clinton and her people were running a child sex ring out of Comet Ping Pong with the help of Alefantis. That would be a huge step forward I think because those things are obviously not true.

             I would not say obviously not true or obviously true.  We don't know.  However, the symbology, in related Instagram pictures, FBI info, menus are noteworthy.  It is more than horrendous illegal activity, it is a cult.  I think that is what is maybe newer in this discussion vs. Franklin.  Its the use of the term pizza and the kind of discussion that was illuminated in the Podesta e-mails.  Sometimes a pizza is just a pizza and sometimes it is not.

             Most legit researchers left these parts months ago. Those of us who remain have and always will understand that the reality of the situation is far darker than the "sub" culture references, though not nearly as entertaining to read.

             That is an excellent choice since it seems everyone is ready to fight over that. And it is actually true the wealthy elite sit back and have the chosen children brought to then in their castles for pleasure just prior to sacrifice. That is the real truth. Take a forklift and bulldozer to Jersey Island you will find hundreds if not thousands of children's &amp; infant bones in mass graves and in Lime for disentigration.

             Jersey privately owned by the Crown (Queen) with over 300 billion in deposits in  numerous private banks for the Ultra wealthy tax havens. Life of luxury on the Island life of horror for the sea cadets and other children (orphans) brought to service them and their friends like Jimmy Saville before being killed in rituals.

            Brilliant post, indeed talking politics is many steps down from this level of woke. Any smart, intuitive person knows without even having any evidence that all political leaders are in cahoots. It's a huge charade. They're actors. Next up, what enables these kidnappers, kid farmers to do what they do? Money. Where does money come from? BIS. Follow the money. Follow the violence (false flags) blah i can't redpill slept people.

             Yes, JEWISH actors.  There's a reason that Hollyweird is 100% Jewish, and there's a reason there's a revolving door between Hollywood and Washington.  (see Ronald Reagan, Fred Thompson, Donald Trump, et al)

              It's becoming clearer and clearer. Jews and cryptos deflecting, fear mongering and playing the antisemitism card. Mostly it's the deflecting, is it not? They want us to play the game that they created. Jews own fucking everything. They even technically own Christianity and Islam... it's the parent religion... QUESTION: is Satanism good or bad? They spend so much time demonizing Satanism but I feel like Satanism is actually the answer, it's the ultimate antiestablishment potential. Or is Satanism just crypto jewry? What about Canaanites? Are these all dead ends? Could it really be as simple as... the Jews are the true evil period? Is there nothing else? What about Knight's Templars worshipping baphomet and headquarters in Switzerland controlling the BIS? I just want to know the truth...

            I know it's real but this website makes it seem so fucked up I wouldn't know what to call it if you start from the 1st day to the present.  Following this site is like taking a good hit of acid that doesn't stop peaking lol.... At the end of the day, the same mind of people who fuck with the air, the food, the land etc.... are the same kind that would fuck with human life.  They are destined for a lake of fire.

             Our criminal justice system -- or at least the one that used to exist -- was based on one fundamental principle: the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. In my experience, I can tell you most investigators (professional and amateurs alike) do the opposite.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              They begin with a theory, a notion, an assumption that the person being investigated must have done something wrong and then begin to gather evidence to support that opinion. Most refer to this as
              <strong>
               confirmation bias
              </strong>
              .
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Guilty parties know this all too well, and when covering tracks will feed false information to distract and deceive others, leading people down dark rabbit holes without an end in sight. Reddit, Voat, whatever you use to follow the storyline is no different. This is their attempt at making ALL those who are following the breadcrumbs look like the loose screws.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              In fact, that again is confirmation bias...People hear a theory that's just too crazy to be true, do a little digging and find that other people who believe it are racist, hateful or just plain nuts...and then in turn (because they don't want to identify with those same qualities) assume the theory is just that -- crazy. Case closed.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The good news is some of us wear our tin foils with pride. Some of us wear them with honor. Because some of us know the truth. And only time reveals all...

              of course I don't want to be only one wearing tinfoil, I'm not the Henny Penny type, but there is a War for Souls going on right now and it's not just the souls of children

              Yes indeed. If we don't get justice in this realm, so will it not be dispensed in more esoteric/spiritual realms. "As above, so below" and all that.

              I think we are making some progress already in the real world. They are definitely stressed and running scared. Just because we haven't seen Pedosta frog marched (yet) doesn't mean he's not suffering consequences already. It's better to drag it out so that when they are arrested, the cases are rock-solid. Make 'em sweat.

            Not to make it political, but the fact is a good many people not willing to accept evidence that "pizzagate" needs investigating are Hillary drones. A big first step to redpilling them is to get them to accept that Clinton is shady. So having a succinct argument, pointing out that her email server was more than a "nothingburger" and not ok, and there's a mountain of evidence of pay-to-play, is useful.

             Do you believe that there are organized circles of people involved in human trafficking? Could and have law enforcement and government agencies helped in some way to allow these crime syndicates to continue?

           <p>
            We all know the CIA has trafficked drugs. Is it that great a leap to think the government hasn't dealt in human trafficking? And that slimy politicians wouldn't be getting their grubby little hands on some of the money?

              As a recovering Democrat,
             </strong>
             I find leaving politics out of the conversation is the only way to make sense of this. That said, of course, I believe Clinton and her associates are very heavily involved in criminal activities, up to and likely including human trafficking in some form. At what level is yet to be determined.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are correct, historical evidence suggests that government agencies have in the past trafficked drugs, weapons and money, and I would agree it isn't a far leap to traffic human flesh...
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact of the matter is, however, that "pizzagate" -- ie child exploitation -- has occurred under a lot of different Presidents, on both sides.

              No, the political one isn't an approach for everyone. It's an idea for those people we all know that would immediately jump to "this is another example of Hillary being demonized boo hoo." You may need to take a slow approach that gently reminds them that the many examples of government corruption we all know of includes their dear leaders.

              I think most of us here know Democrat and Republican are two sides of the same coin. But if you are dealing with someone that thinks this is still "alt-right trumpers" going after Hillary, the discussion may need to get a little political. 
I supported neither Trump nor Clinton, but am saying from experience that I've had this discussion with a "she's my President" tard (dear friend, but, yeah), and step one was, can you grasp Clinton is shady? They'll fall back on what they say when backed in a corner- "maybe a little but what politician isn't?" Next step: becoming aware of sweeping government corruption.

               I agree, sadly. The trouble is the opposition has done a marvelous job at subconscious suggestion -- as in, if you're against HER, you're for HIM, etc. Their system shuts down immediately.

               Agreed. The trouble is -- as it was predicted in 1984 -- when all the information is controlled online, it is easy to control the narrative facts...leading the research away from the right source.

             I believe it wAS  a conduit of some kind . Every business there is connected (both physically and figuratively) tunnels and politics provide those connections. also, the computer  drive shot up, the private area on the website---killroom. the threats alefantis made to that researcher…..yeah it's circumstantial but it's pretty suspicious and at some level----and don't forget the "artwork" that was all taken down drink the height of the accusations being thrown around.

             No. Facts cannot be "most likely true." You are confusing evidence with theory. Let's take killroom tweets for example -- This would imply people are being murdered, correct? There is a difference between sex slavery and human sacrifice. I'm not saying they are not related, nor am I denying the existence of both, but there are different questions you need to ask to successfully land on the truth with that leap in logic.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what is "more likely" is the theory that we are dealing with a collection of sick people who have (likely) gotten away with many crimes -- not excluding murder -- and that a pizza joint was, like the tunnels, the tweets, the artwork, the performers and whatever is covered by your "etc." another piece of the puzzle ... not the picture itself.

              True. And they'll always be trolls to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for your post, I would suggest memorizing something specific, and bizarre, and ask them what they think it meant. They might try to explain it away, but the wheels may keep spinning.

               Thank you MF. Will update my original post with that figure and explain it better. The 1 in 6 figure is out of 18,500 reported runaways in 2016 (which comes out to roughly 3080 children PER YEAR) -- Below is the
               <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/KeyFacts">

               :
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2016 NCMEC [National Center for Missing and Endangered Children] assisted law enforcement and families with more than 20,500 cases of missing children. Case type:

              <ul>
               <li>
                90 percent endangered runaways.
               </li>
               <li>
                6 percent family abductions.
               </li>
               <li>
                1 percent lost, injured or otherwise missing children.
               </li>
               <li>
                1 percent nonfamily abductions.
               </li>
               <li>
                2 percent critically missing young adults, ages 18 to 20.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Of the more than 18,500 endangered runaways reported to NCMEC in 2016, one in six were likely victims of child sex trafficking

               .
               <strong>
                Of those, 86 percent were in the care of social services when they went missing.
