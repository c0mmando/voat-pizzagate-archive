<p>....The president’s legal team said Saturday they believe the entire meeting may have been part of a larger election-year opposition effort aimed at creating the appearance of improper connections between Trump family members and Russia that also included a now-discredited intelligence dossier produced by a former British intelligence agent named Christopher Steele who worked for a U.S. political firm known as Fusion GPS.</p>
<p>“We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump’s legal team. “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner,” Corallo said.....</p>

             In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: “It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.”

            Obviously Donald Trump Jr. Wanted to reopen Russian adoption for his family's pedophile ring. Why else would they even care about a Russian adoption program. But this is the FIRST meeting they have post-election? Please.

             Right, but since revelations of the meeting hasn't come out sooner maybe there was an angle that was also fishing for the other side. A little sniffing around to see how open the Trumps would be to running a family international pedo ring.

            Thanks for doing a follow up to this. That's what I was objecting to the first time around. Rather than speculate and hang our hats on nothing more than air, now we know that Trump didn't seek out any information on international adoptions or bans, and that the meeting was attended by people that misrepresented themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, of course, the NYT seizes on this to prove what? That people lie to get meetings? The mediia outlets are so losing credibility.

             yes, notice that the meeting happened after the election and during the transition. So you can't really claim that the meeting affected the election and yet it is supposedly proof of Russia "meddling"

               I'm not sure we are both reading the same thing. Trumps are claiming that the meeting was requested under false pretenses. People around here from are both (and no) parties and equally sickened by all pedos. Try defending Denny Hastert here.
