            Allen is not part of the official Limited Hangout of #MeToo
           </p>
           <h1>
            MeToo (a movement started by Tarana Burke) was co-opted by the "White Women Attention Grabber Psy-Op Machine" (WWAGPOM) in October 2017. Since then, the IFTTT bots manned by Media Matters / Share Blue / Etc. into promoting this hashtag. A campaign that continues today [0]. This is an attention-grabbing scheme to keep Hillary's base looking away from politics and at Hollywood based news but it doesn't mean the work product is untrue, or that we don't need to clean house (isn't this why we are all here?).
           </h1>
           <p>
            As an example of convenient timing, Maureen Dowd's [2] piece on Uma Thurman came out a few days after Standard Hotel senior execs Joseph Anthony Tena, 60, of Newport Beach, Kimberly Lynne Watzman, 45, of Santa Monica, died in a Helicopter crash. [4] Standard Hotel founder Andre Balazs was engaged to actress Uma Thurman between 2004 and 2007, and the couple again dated in 2015/16!
           </p>
           <p>
            What is absolutely astounding is that it is Hillary's boy wonder Ronan Farrow [1] who has been spearheading this psy-op! Because his own grievances about how his father abused his sister are not being addressed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have stepped away from here to develop relationships with people on the inside. I am astounded about how many people report not being able to do their job because of the obstructionism of the Obama administration but of Hillary in particular. "IT'S ALL ABOUT HILLARY!!!" is a comment I keep hearing from people who have come up against her. Some got into trouble for trying to protect corporate / consumer data from her grabby hands. Another almost shot one of her puppets (a hugely important politician currently under the mire of QAnon) while trying to protect a strategic safe house. Guy just showed up one day?! Because this person is a member of one of those limited well-know teams, I can't even share the details of this astounding tale because these people are so dangerous.

            [0] These bots are specifically made to target attention of young white middle-class women and always worded in a way to represent conservatives in a bad light, often using association to #pizzagate. This is 100% the recipe of Media Matters to this very day.

            [1] In 2011, Farrow was appointed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues[22] and
            <strong>
             Director of the State Department's Office of Global Youth Issues
            </strong>
            . The office's creation was the outcome of a multi-year task-force appointed by Clinton to review the
            <strong>
             United States' economic and social policies on youth
            </strong>
            , for which Farrow co-chaired the working group with senior United States Agency for International Development staff member David Barth beginning in 2010. Farrow's appointment and the creation of the office were announced by Clinton as part of a refocusing on youth following the Arab Spring revolutions. Farrow was responsible for
            <strong>
             US youth policy and programming
            </strong>
            [10] with an aim toward "empower[ing] young people as economic and civic actors." Farrow concluded his term as Special Adviser in 2012, with his policies and programs continuing under his successor."

             This article is just edgy provocation. It is almost in favor of Allen, but you are right.
Your POV is reasonable. I only have one other rubric to appl, myself. What does the victim gain by coming forward? The record shows that she has consistently been denied an justice or satisfaction, but she doesn’t give up.
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO, the victims claims still have weight, and should be respected.

              Nobody is disrespecting the victim by saying we don't know the truth. It is simply stating a fact. If we can't even quietly state that one simple thing without people becoming hysterical, it's a wonder justice is ever served anywhere to anyone. Law of averages I guess.

                And what research would that be? I'm not buying that for a second. Children have moms. Moms have boyfriends. Mom gets pissed at boyfriend. Mom coaches child to accuse boyfriend. Extremely common tale. Which isn't to say men don't date women for the express purpose of getting access to their children, but c'mon. Women can be vindictive as @#$%. Let's not lie to ourselves. I'm not trying to say that's what happened in this case. But you can bet your ass it happens.

            The comparison to the UVA hoax is shit.  The UVA accusations were against hated white "toxic masculinity" frat boys which Rolling Stone reviled.  That is why they interviewed none of Jackies friends, didn't check that a party never occured on the night of the supposed rape, didn't mention rhat the name of the fictitious rapist was Haven Monahan which does not belong to anyone in the U.S.  They also ignored that Jackie claimed to have a beer bottle broken over her head (which is common in movies but next to impossible with how they are made in reality)  and had no injuries even though she claimed to have been raped over broken glass.

            Eveyone in Hollywood loved Woody for being a minority (Jewish) liberal and having the expected views.  None of Dylan's testimony is anywhere near as inconsistent or crazy as that but because Woody is protected they are making the comparison.

            Me Soon hornYi. Don’t bother with the article. That’s all you need to know about this midget neurotic jewish pedophile. Wonder if he has her convinced that he can” be in love “ with their children like he was with her?  God I hope not.

            This is the third pro child rape article from the degenerate New York Times that I am aware of.  It is of note that Mark Thompson, prior to becoming CEO of the New York Times Company, was Director General of the BBC (which has the distinction of being the world's only publicly funded paedophile ring; indeed, it has been remarked that 'BBC' at this point stands for 'Buggering British Children') protected and covered for the paedophile/necrophiliac/Satanic monster Jimmy Savile for years, going so far as to pull a documentary exposing Savile's litany of crimes so that a glowing tribute to the piece of filth might air in its stead.  The BBC even gave former employee/music mogul/convicted child rapist Jonathan King a part in a documentary on the British band Genesis (in fairness, this was after Thompson had already stepped down as Director General, but he had previously personally written to King apologising to him for the BBC removing him from old content and assuring him it would never happen again).  So Thompson's credentials as a paedo protector/cover up artist cannot be impugned at this point.  It is small wonder then, that the already reprobate New York Times, under Thompson's leadership, should immediately dismiss Pizzagate as "fake news" without any kind of investigation and then publish articles attempting to normalise paedophilia and defending paedophiles like Anthony Weiner and Woody Allen.  They want shooting, the whole fucking lot of them!

            The writer is very worried about journalistic integrity and "basic rules" of journalism. Why don't journalist remember about their high standards when they are smearing Trump with false claims based on falsified evidence?

             Woody Allen married the woman that he first met when she was 21 years old, and he never was her father,never adopted her, but it was his exwife and her other man that adopted her. Woody and Soon-Yi have been married for over 25 years and have two children together. Doesnt sound like abuse or incest or any other atrocity.

              He did not first meet her when she was 21.   The affair began has an adult, but she was Mia's Farrow and Andre Previn's daughter and Woody met her shortly after he began dating Mia Farrow in 1979. Their relationship was from 1979 to 1992.  Soon Yi was 21 in 1991.  (We don't exact the year Soon Yi was born as she was an orphan, but Wikipedia lists her as being born in 1970, I think this was based on bone tests when she was younger, so I will go with 1970.)

              How could he just meet her when she was 21 if she was adopted prior to Dylan? 
Also how was it proven that he took naked photos of Soon-Yi as a teen if he never met her until she was 21?

               C'mon man, do you really think that picture is of Soon Yi on his lap?  It would have been taken in the 70s!  Can't you see how old woody is here?  It's their daughter.  Moron.

               Fta : Well the whole article actually:
              </p>
              <p>
               The following are some facts that always seem to get lost in this debate:
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Allen and Soon-Yi have been together for 25 years, married for 20, and have two children.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 In a 60 year career, no one (other than Dylan) has ever accused of Allen of acting inappropriately in any way.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Dylan is Allen’s sole accuser.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Child molesters are notorious repeat offenders.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 The criminal justice system in New York and Connecticut investigated Allen for months and there was not enough evidence to even pursue an indictment.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Allen’s estranged son Moses has reversed his earlier statements and now claims that the allegation against Allen is a lie. He not only says he was physically and emotionally abused by Mia Farrow, but that she invented the allegation as retribution. Moses was also in the house at the time the alleged molestation occurred:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course Woody did not molest my sister. She loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate toward him. The day in question, there were six or seven of us in the house. We were all in public rooms and no one, not my father or sister, was off in any private spaces… I don’t know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother. Pleasing my mother was very powerful motivation because to be on her wrong side was horrible.

               Both Dylan and Moses claim to be victims. Each should be given equal consideration.

                <p>
                 There was a detailed investigation that included both a physical examination and nine interviews of Dylan Farrow. Allen was cleared completely: [emphasis added]
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dr. John M. Leventhal, who interviewed Dylan nine times, said that one reason he doubted her story was that she changed important points from one interview to another, like whether Mr. Allen touched her vagina. Another reason, he said, was that the child’s accounts had “a rehearsed quality.” At one point, he said she told him, “I like to cheat on my stories.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dr. Leventhal said: “We had two hypotheses: one, that these were statements that were made by an emotionally disturbed child and then became fixed in her mind. And the other hypothesis was that she was coached or influenced by her mother. We did not come to a firm conclusion. We think that it was probably a combination.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 …
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dr. Leventhal headed the hospital team that was asked by the Connecticut State Police to investigate the claim that Mr. Allen molested Dylan last August at Miss Farrow’s summer home in Connecticut. The team told Mr. Allen and Miss Farrow on March 18 that it had concluded that Dylan was not molested, but the transcript gives the first look at the thinking behind that finding.

              </ol>
              <p>
               This Yale-New Haven study was commission by Connecticut’s state prosecutor. After the  study unambiguously cleared Allen, the prosecutor declared their findings unreliable.
              </p>
              <p>
               (Before making any kind of judgment on Allen, it is imperative to read this and this, along with these rebuttals here and here – neither of which I find convincing

               <li>
                <p>
                 Allen passed a polygraph test: [emphasis original]
                </p>
                <p>
                 Allen fully passed the test. The results were submitted to the CT State police, with [Paul] Minor [the former-Chief of the Polygraph Office for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command who performed the test] flying in to answer questions. The State police concurred with Minor’s findings, which is probably why they never proposed administering their own test. Mia was then asked by Woody’s lawyers to take a reciprocal polygraph test. She wouldn’t. Maybe it’s not too late.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 The Connecticut prosecutor who claimed he had “probable cause” against Allen did not charge him, has never divulged what the probable cause is, and earned a “stern rebuke” by a review board:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “This amounts to a public reprimand, though they’re not calling it that,” said Kate Stith, a law professor at Yale University and a former Federal prosecutor. Though the decision was “quite damning,” she said she was not surprised that the panel did not punish Mr. Maco, because lawyers are rarely disciplined for their public statements.

              </ol>
              <p>
               It should be noted that a couple of years later the censure was overturned.

                 Allen was not the only one cheating. Mia Farrow has admitted that she too was unfaithful, specifically with ex-husband Frank Sinatra, well into the 1980s:
                </p>
                <p>
                 When asked point-blank if her biological son with Woody Allen, Ronan Farrow, may actually be the son of Frank Sinatra, Farrow answers, “Possibly.”
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               Ronan Farrow was born in 1987.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Dylan’s story was inconsistent:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dylan’s statements in interviews at the hospital contradicted each other and the story she told on a videotape made by Miss Farrow, Dr. Leventhal said. “Those were not minor inconsistencies,” he said. “She told us initially that she hadn’t been touched in the vaginal area, and she then told us that she had, then she told us that she hadn’t.” ‘Intense Relationship’
                </p>
                <p>
                 The doctor suggested a connection between Miss Farrow’s outrage over Mr. Allen’s affair with her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Farrow Previn, and the accusation made by Dylan, who he said was unusually protective of her mother. “It’s quite possible — as a matter of fact, we think it’s medically probable — that she stuck to that story over time because of the intense relationship she had with her mother,” he said.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Authorities believed Mia Farrow poisoned the family against Allen:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even before the claim of abuse was made last August, [Leventhal] said, “The view of Mr. Allen as an evil and awful and terrible man permeated the household. The view that he had molested Soon-Yi and was a potential molester of Dylan permeated the household.”
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 The prosecutor said he did not charge Allen in order to spare Dylan from an “exhausting trial.” But if the prosecutor did indeed have “probable cause” of a terrible crime, this makes no sense. Although Mia Farrow said she agreed with the persecutor, Dylan had already been through an exhausting process. Why give up at the very end?
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               Moreover, as Robert Weide points out, “If the concern was really about putting young Dylan Farrow through an exhausting trial, I’ve often wondered why Mia Farrow didn’t sue Woody Allen in civil court once Dylan was old enough to withstand the trial, before the statute of limitations ran out, with all parties being under oath.”
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                Allen is alleged to have molested Dylan AFTER he and Farrow broke up over the Soon-Yi incident: Weide explains:
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               If Mia’s account is true, it means that in the middle of custody and support negotiations, during which Woody needed to be on his best behavior, in a house belonging to his furious ex-girlfriend, and filled with people seething mad at him, Woody …decided this would be the ideal time and place to take his daughter into an attic and molest her, quickly, before a house full of children and nannies noticed they were both missing.
              </p>

               —
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite the facts, for 25 years these allegations have haunted Allen, and now the bandwagon of #MeToo has resulted in a blacklisting campaign against the Oscar-winner. Actors and producers are being pressured by the Farrows to repudiate Allen, to make him unemployable. So far, among others, Sorvino, Timothée Chalemet, Rebecca Hall, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, David Krumholtz, Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Kathleen Kennedy, America Ferrera, attorney Nina Shaw, Tracee Ellis Ross, Shonda Rhimes, and Griffin Newman have done so.
              </p>
              <p>
               So far only Alec Baldwin and Selena Gomez are refusing to join the mob.
              </p>
              <p>
               Worse still, using scandalous headlines and mindless innuendo, the left-wing Washington Post joined the witch hunt three weeks ago with Richard Morgan’s misleading piece titled “I read decades of Woody Allen’s private notes. He’s obsessed with teenage girls.”
              </p>
              <p>
               In 56 boxes of material, Morgan extrapolated a handful of notes written by Allen (all of them within the realm of story ideas and character creation) about older men attracted to women aged 17 and up. There is one example of 16-year-old described as “a flashy sexy blonde in a flaming red low cut evening gown with a long slit up the side” — which reveals nothing in an era that sees girls younger than that sexualized on the Disney Channel.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nonetheless, to argue that there is reasonable doubt in this case is an understatement, and no reasonable person can examine the facts and render a verdict that results in the personal destruction of Woody Allen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Without question, Allen (and Soon-Yi) are guilty of a terrible betrayal 25 years ago. Without question the entire situation was creepy. But at what point do we stop flogging a single incident in the otherwise unblemished life of an 83-year-old man, and move on?
