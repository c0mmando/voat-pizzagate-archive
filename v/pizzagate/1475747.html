<p>Anyway back to DC.  I believe the Franklin Scandal was Real and covered up by the government, so does most anybody even those that ridiculed the victims like the Washington Post and The New York Times (who had members that attended these private parties btw), yes I believe that there was a huge involvement in all areas of elites in Washington DC.  Maybe I should add The Bullying of the Victims by the FBI, the involvement of Officers who were actually involved in running of the underage escort agency, those that put children into care taken away from parents they probably would have been better staying with (not always though), the social workers/whatever the fuck they were that kept referring children who confided in him/her to a Pedophile doctor or therapist.  They certainly stopped confiding or speaking out about abuse they suffered after that.</p>
<p>Maybe we should touch on the loveable priests who were in charge of this American Ideal, a true symbol of a big hand reaching out and helping those little hands that cannot help themselves.  Yes what true gents these Pedos were.  You see it\'s not about religion, or god, or satan, or not knowning or believing in the old gods that were stolen from us by the foreign hordes of christians and jews (whoops, sorry there I got carried away with a bit of that alt-right I love Donald attitude we all seem to have even if politics doesn\'t mean shit when there are so many child trafficking networks within these 2nd and 3rd world countries that fill orphanages up with children from poor families either stolen from them or taken as payment of debt to the local mafia (see turkish, and eastern european mafia).</p>
<p>Should we even touch upon maybe Pedophilia that is said to be rampant in Hollywood, probably any type of modelling industry, pop music, yes all those funny stories that Corey Feldman and Corey Haim told, oh brother how we didn\'t laugh, probably because we do not think child abuse is funny.  Maybe &quot;An open secret&quot; may open your mind, it is on youtube you know along with &quot;Conspiracy of silence&quot;, or maybe get some MK Ultra really see what horrendous abuse at a young age does to a child to cause MPD and shatter a human beings mind and spirit, and we are, talking about human beings here, whether The Clintons just think another refugee snuck onto a truck like an extra sack of potatoes is just another dirty foreigner that would die otherwise with no family.</p>
<p>We could go on for hours about the Catholic church and the Billions, Billions, they are spending on victims of their abuse which rarely even touches the surface, hush, hush now don\'t want to be anti religious eh? Sport?  We could mention they even voted against a 3 strikes out rule within the catholic church based on being found out beyond all reasonable doubt thrice of abuse.  Has to be correct i learnt about it from a left wing hippy stoner comedian.</p>
<p>These kids trafficked from 3rd world and disaster areas that know one will know if a few hundred go missing, illegals have no records right?  Maybe even set up a nice little school there and teach the locals some good old religious morals whilst Father Jeffrey from Somerset, England gets his dream retirement bonus, a lifetime of brown boys in the Tropics (yeah I know geography aint my strong suit).</p>
<p>So I think You get what I am kinda saying here.  Yes there are some very stupid points, some very, very, very unbelievably dumb and naive people who think you can just walk in to Pizza Nut and ask for a &quot;Chheeeeeesssseeee Peeeeeesssssaaaaaaa&quot; and walk out with child bride straight from the congo under your arm, yes I know more right wing edgy anti sjw racism.</p>
<p>What about Jimmy Saville a man that was known as a sexual predator in the 1950\'s and got away with it for half a century because he donated to charity, which is also where he abused hundreds of young and ill people including dead bodies.</p>
<p>The British Parliment Pedo scandal, they even had there own government funded P.I.E. pedophile Information Exchange Network that ended up being more abuse to vulnerable young people and yet again covered up. </p>
<p>Then theres the real Dutroux pedophile network, all those young women in basements across the all the countries past and present undoubtably still holding out hope much like the Dutroux victims when they screamed and the neighbours ignored them, the police heard them but they sent the &quot;right&quot; policeman and he did not investigate and the stakeout was told to end every evening so the sick man was allowed to continue and he did because he had a client list to fill based on girls picked out during the day.</p>
<p>I hope you have read up and maybe even watched a well sourced documentary of credible nature or two, or more even and maybe come to the conclusion that yes these networks do exist, and have done for decades if not much longer.</p>
<p>There is no religion, there is no politics, no race, colour, creed, just people who know what was covered up in DC, American, UK, Ireland, Jersey, Belgium, all over Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, middle east, Australia and everywhere else in between.</p>
<p>So, in short, I would rather start off with being on the right track, than being on the wrong one.</p>',
