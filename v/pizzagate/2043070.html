I\'m sure people on this subverse know about the whole Laura Silsby case, where Silsby bizarrely got caught trying to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti after the earthquake, and apparently the Clintons intervened at a very high level to get the charges massively reduced. Silsby\'s lawyer at the time, Jorge Puello, was later arrested under suspicion for being the leader of a sex trafficking ring that trafficked children and women from all over Latin America. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 3 years in prison.</p>
<p>Well, <strong>on February 2nd,  2010,</strong> Fox New\'s Greta Van Susteren did a &quot;soft-ball&quot; type interview with Jorge Puello about the Silsby case. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2010/02/02/alleged-haitian-orphans-case-attempted-child-trafficking-or-big-misunderstanding.html">Link to interview</a>. In the very brief and strange interview, Van Susteren just asked very basic questions to Puello about how Silsby found the children, and what she intended to do with them after leaving Haiti. Jorge Puello said the children came from an orphanage that collapsed in the earthquake, and Silsby was trying to take the children &quot;to a temporary facility so they could be taken care of,&quot; providing no further details, and Van Susteren asked no follow-up. Van Susteren did not address any of the reports that at least some of the children actually were not orphans, and had families in Haiti. Jorge\'s final statement in the interview was <strong>&quot;There was no intention to do anything illegal.&quot;</strong> Van Susteren than replied &quot;Jorge, thank you, and keep us informed.&quot;, and the interview abruptly ended.</p>
<p><strong>Only 9 days after Van Susteran\'s interview with Puello, on February 9th, 2010,</strong> the New York Times reported that police in El Salvador were investigating Jorge Puello for leading a sex trafficking ring. <a href="http://archive.is/ph5w">Link to report</a>. On March 19th, 2010, Puello was arrested in the Dominican Republic on sex trafficking charges <a href="https://archive.is/ZMN5U">Link to report</a>. </p>
<p>The whole Laura Silsby/ Jorge Puello story has been well-documented here on Voat and elsewhere, but I don\'t know if people have looked into the really disturbing aspects of Greta Van Susteren\'s own personal history. The fact that Van Susteren did this weird little interview with Puello only days before news of his sex trafficking allegations got dropped in mainstream news, was a big red flag to me. </p>
<p><strong>Journalist and independent investigator Nick Bryant wrote a really important book based on his investigation of the &quot;Franklin Cover-up&quot; pedophile scandal in the \'80s called the &quot;Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal.</strong>&quot; For those who don\'t know about the Franklin Scandal, it was a huge scandal in the 80s involving major allegations that political and business powerbrokers in Washington DC and Omaha, Nebraska were systematically trafficking and abusing children, and using them in sexual blackmail operations to ensnare politicians  and other powerful figures. Watch Discovery Channels\' unaired documentary  &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; for more info <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY-F5JoHoho">link to youtube vid</a>. Nick Bryant also wrote a really important article on Gawker about Bill Clinton\'s connection to Jeff Epstein\'s child sex trafficking operation <a href="http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971">link to article</a></p>
<p><strong>Nick Bryant revealed in his investigation of the Franklin cover-up that Greta Van Susteren was the lawyer for Henry Vinson, who was a key figure in this whole scandal.</strong>  Henry Vinson is a West Virginia-based businessman who in the early 1990s was tried and convicted for operating a male prostitution ring in Washington DC, that supplied male prostitutes to powerful DC political figures. In his investigation of the Franklin scandal, Nick Bryant interviewed Henry Vinson, who revealed to him that his &quot;call-boy&quot; operation was financed and supported by Larry King and Craig Spence. <strong>As Nick Bryant thoroughly documented in his book, and as documented in many other sources, Larry King and Craig Spence were both accused by multiple underage children and teenagers of operating a major underage sex trafficking ring that supplied children to powerful figures and used them in blackmailing operations.</strong> Henry Vinson, in partnership with Nick Bryant, in 2015 wrote a follow-up book about his experiences, talked about in a Charleston Gazette-Mail article <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20150517/GZ05/150519640/1116">link to article</a></p>
<p>In &quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot; book, Henry Vinson told Nick Bryant that his operation only supplied adult-age male prostitutes, but as his prostitution ring grew, Larry King and Craig Spence got in touch with him, started financing his prostitution ring, and eventually tried to convince him to start pimping underage children as part of his operation. <strong>Larry King even told Vinson that he had clients who &quot;actually liked having sex with kids as they tortured or killed the kid.&quot;</strong> Henry Vinson said Craig and King demanded and then threatened him that he had to get involved in their child sex trafficking activities. When Vinson refused Craig\'s and King\'s demands, Craig sent men whom he claimed were CIA operatives over to Vinson\'s house, where they broke windows, busted up his house, and intimidated Vinson further. <strong>Apparently when this didn\'t work, a senior Justice Department official who was friends with Craig Spence, verbally intimidated Henry Vinson, telling him, &quot;I can withstand a background check. Can you?&quot;</strong> Soon after this in 1990, Henry Vinson\'s prostitution ring got raided, and he was indicted by a grand jury on 43 charges, including pimping, racketeering and credit card fraud, all related to his prostitution ring. </p>
<p><strong>This is where Greta Van Susteren all of a sudden comes into the picture</strong> As described in Bryant\'s book, <strong>Henry Vinson\'s mother &quot;received a phone call from someone claiming to be a reporter for the <em>Washington Post</em>, suggesting that her son hire DC attorney and future Fox News star Greta Van Susteren, whose services he promptly enlisted.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Once Greta Van Susteren mysteriously got set up as Henry Vinson\'s lawyer, she then steered him into accepting a plea agreement where Vinson got only 63 months in prison (he was initially facing nearly 300 years for all his charges). Vinson said Van Susteren allowed federal investigators to grill Vinson for hours on end about his pimping activities, and that Van Susteren was not even present during the interrogations. Vinson said federal prosecutors in his case <strong>&quot;explicitly told [him] not to talk to the media for that minimal sentence.&quot;</strong> <strong>There is therefore clear evidence that Van Susteren worked to negotiate a plea agreement for Henry Vinson, that was explicitly based on her client keeping his mouth shut about the powerful DC politicians he supplied prostitutes to, and also keeping his mouth shut about Larry King and Craig Spence\'s child sex trafficking activities.</strong> The federal government sealed all court documents related to the Vinson prostitution case. </p>
<p>To make matter even stranger, Henry Vinson\'s federal indictment happened in 1990. <strong>According to Van Susteren\'s IMDb page, right after her wonderful (cough, cough) work on Henry Vinson\'s case in 1990, in 1991 she got hired as a legal analyst on CNN,  thus beginning Van Susteren\'s very high-profile career as a TV show host and commentator that continues to this day</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1336063/bio">IMBd bio</a>. Did Greta Van Susteren &quot;make her bones&quot; to use the mafia lingo, on the Henry Vinson case? Was this some kind of &quot;deal with the devil&quot; Van Susteren made that massively advanced her career? Its speculative, but Van Susteren\'s active involvement in covering up DC sex trafficking in the 80s and early 90s definitely deserves much more serious research and scrutiny. <strong>And the fact that Van Susteren jumps out of the woodwork again in 2010 to do a soft-ball interview with now-convicted sex trafficker Jorge Puello, and &quot;lawyer&quot; for allegedly-Clinton-connected Laura Silsby, makes everything a million times stranger.</strong> Was Van Susteren running cover for the pedophiles yet again? Interesting question...</p>',

            Scalia liked boys around 10-11-12 years old.

            Great work, very interesting.  It's starting to look like every pedo case has something in common...CIA and CIA controlled media involvement.  The part about somebody from the WaPo calling and recommending Greta piqued my interest...Was WaPo CIA controlled back then as well?  And if so, how did they hook up with Greta?
           </p>
           <p>
            So I looked at her wikipedia page
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren
            </a>
            ....Georgetown Law graduate...Podesta's alma mater and rumored to be a CIA recruiting center/hangout.  Startpage it for tons of links, but here is one of the first
            <a href="http://georgetownvoice.com/2009/04/23/gu-profs-receive-secret-cia-funds/">
             http://georgetownvoice.com/2009/04/23/gu-profs-receive-secret-cia-funds/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I am doing a little digging in the Podesta email dump right now, but I used the search term Greta and interestingly enough, Greta Van Susteren was mentioned in the weird movie pitch email that could have been code for the Scalia hit.  Characters Alex and Inez appear on the GVS show  (about 2/3 of the way down the email).

Well, in my experience the government and the media work in tandem to prevent the American people from learning about the unbelievable debauchery (18:10?) sexcapades of our power elite in Washington, D.C. is essentially a present-day Babylon, but Americans are just naive about the depravity of their political and politicians who are endowed with a potent alchemy of power, arrogance, and lust, and I think that, they just don’t know because the media doesn’t report on a lot of it. I think Bill Clinton and Eliot Spitzer are merely two examples of a numerable politicians who put their careers and families on the line because of their sexual additions or compulsion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jason:
You were exposed to, you know, many amazing things, heavy drug use, orgies, pedophilia maybe. Tell us about that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry:
I was consistently pressured by D.C. power brokers to provide child prostitutes to their power broker cronies, but I refused to have anything to do with child prostitution and the federal government was aware of this fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jason:
I’m curious, what ages did these people ask for? That’s disgusting. What ages? I mean, they specifically requested that from you, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry:
They specifically requested it and Nick Bryant has written a book, The Franklin Scandal, which goes into great detail. He spent many years researching that and there were very young children 10, 12-years-old and many, many lives were destroyed with Lawrence King and Craig Spence. Craig Spence ran his own underage escort service, if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jason:
Wow. Unbelievable. Okay, so any of the more sinister things you were exposed to. So you talked about, was there more there? I kind of interrupted you, sorry. I want to make sure you finish.
            </p>
            <p>
             Henry:
That’s fine. The federal government is always saying with the interstate child prostitution, the federal government was aware of this fact, because I told my government (#20:04?) about an interstate pedophile network that was providing D.C. politicians and power brokers with children, but the Department of Justice and Secret Service and FBI, they covered up that pedophile network

            Vinson had government members who were his clients.  Greta filed a motion to release the names of Vinson's clients. Her motion was successful but its public disclosure was banned. Vinson said that Greta 'sold him out'. This is what Vinson said:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             I named several powerful and affluent men who either procured escorts through me or procured them through one of the architects of the blackmail operation. I also edified (enlightened?) her about the pedophile network that was organized by these architects. In addition, I mentioned the threat that had been parsed out to me by a member of George H.W. Bush’s cabinet.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            No doubt Greta was working for the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vinson said of Spence:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             I ended up providing escorts to a CIA asset named Craig Spence who was a preeminent blackmail artist. His upscale DC home was fitted with state-of-the-art blackmail equipment that he used to blackmail our country’s elite. Spence told me that he was blackmailing the rich and powerful for the CIA...
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            lol, Vinson calls himself a 'scapegoat'--yet another psychopathic criminal playing the victim.

             ALSO I decided to check the comments on the article and someone said that she and her husband had been helping FRANKLIN GRAHAM in the past.  We know that Franklin has been compromised.  There have been articles on here about him. In the article it says she is joining The Annenberg Center on Communications and Policy. This appointment is very telling.  Read the Article it tells what she will be doing there regarding Journalism.

            Interesting, especially since I was just reading excerpts from that interview while looking into some Haiti related topics.
This excerpt is from rense, I haven't looked to source every detail in it...
            <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/pizza10.htm">

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             At the subsequent trial of project organizers Laura Silsby (Gayler) and her church-based supporters, the Haitian prosecution showed that Jorge Puello (aka Torres-Orellana) was not a lawyer as claimed but instead a wanted criminal in El Salvador and Costa Rica on charges of international trafficking of women and underage girls for prostitution. Born in Yonkers, New York, to a Dominican mother and Puerto Rican father, he was previously arrested for people-smuggling into Canada. He had also been arrested the U.S. for handling money for drug smugglers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Puello-Torres asserted that he was the head of the 400-strong Sephardic Jewish community in the Dominican Republic, based on lineage from his mother, who was also implicated but not charged in the family business of human trafficking, but appears to be the matriarch of a larger crime family.
            </p>
            <p>
             Notably, Puello-Torres said that he had worked with U.S. Army military intelligence, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Why was this undercover agent involved in an attempt to transfer “orphans”, many of them children still with parents, transferred from Friends of the Orphans facilities to Laura Silsby’s operation across the border? Why did he serve only half of his prison sentence? Was the leniency toward this fraudster and pimp due to powerful patrons in the American political establishment?
            </p>

            I had also been reading an article by Chantal Laurent, "...a Haitian-American who blogs about Haiti, socio-economic, environmental and political issues at thehaitianblogger".  Laurent's name is connected to Monica Peterson according to this post
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1911134:">

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On January 3rd, 2016, Petersen shared with Robinson some of her findings based on her field work in Haiti up to that point. By this time she had already become aware of corruption by the Clintons in Haiti or as she put it, "start[ed] to connect the dots on what I already suspected". In fact, she was getting ready to dive in full time: Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ... This is the theory my master's thesis puts forth...
             <strong>
              this is modern structural slavery.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Robinson re-shared this post by Petersen to a Facebook group to which she belonged.
            </p>
            <p>
             In that same post,
             <strong>
              Petersen also links to a blog post discussing similar claims. The blog is written by Haitian native, Chantal Laurent, and the specific post Petersen provided is called Hillary Clinton's Scandalous Conduct in Haiti: Charity Begins at Home
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The day after, on January 4th, 2016, Petersen again shared with Robinson some more of her findings: But the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. I can't say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton's Caracol Complex.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Haiti is the scene of an ongoing international crime. It's to be expected that the worst sort of buzzards would be picking its bones clean. The NGOs supported by USAID are expected to return over 90% of the money spent in Haiti back to Washington.
            </p>
            <p>
             Haiti is under occupation. Period. There is no freedom, human rights, sovereignty, autonomy or decision making by Haiti's government. The U.S. and its "partners" are determined to keep real democracy out of the hands of the Haitian people as evidenced by their awareness and endorsement (according to Wikileaks) of the fraudulent nature of he last two major elections in Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...every upcoming or anticipated disaster, calamity and mismanagement of resources"etc, is the direct responsibility of those who have imposed detrimental trade policies that have robbed Haiti of the ability to feed its people, that have sponsored coups, fraudulent elections, brought disease, the entire globe's occupying armies to play their war games, the multinational exploiters of Haiti's wealth, and others who use Haiti as their piggy bank and dumping ground for all of their toxic hate, greed and depravity"
            </p>
            <p>
             **Speaking of depravity: they also share the responsibility for making Haiti the ground zero for sexual predators of every base/perverted sexual nature imaginable. **
