            A phenomena that may help others to discern between logo features designed by chance and those by intent is the "veneration of the vector." The video by Luna Cognita best explains it. Basically, NASA, many US agencies and most other nation's space programs and projects have logos or other graphical elements that all include the vector symbol in one way or another.
           </p>
           <p>
            A vector can look like the letter "v," a triangle or even the number 7. The NASA logo itself contains a vector-like shape. Most logos of countries with a space program of any kind do as well. The US Air Force and other military departments do. Most interesting, to me is all the mission patches from Apollo to the space shuttle have the symbol embedded.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, how can this be a coincidence? It's far too obvious that it isn't. I believe some people have inquired about the shape's meaning and origin and been given generic runaround.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's the rub. A simple misdirection was all that was needed to cover up the use of obvious symbology. It's something to look out for when inquiring about the pedo symbology.

            I think that at a place involving children the suspicious logos are probably intentional. as having done a lot of graphic design at one time, if a client asked for a spiral or butterfly for example, it would never have crossed my mind that those icons have an alternative meaning. Graphic designers are often given some kind of direction to start, either revise an old logo or some description of the look and feel to invoke. And the owner or director of the company has final approval.
