            I'm just going to stop in and say that NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming) is a real thing. It works, it's not all that difficult to utilize on another person, and I can certainly see why Lift the Veil is suggesting DS is using certain techniques like it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, I've used NLP on another person, and no I won't answer anymore questions about it. I'm don't meant to have a position on the issue, just to give credibility to the NLP process as I'm familiar with it.

            Here is my perception of Seaman's "shillness." Seaman may not be overtly hindering or overtly diverting the investigation on the surface, but he is a subtle shill. He is like the alternative news website that has some true "conspiracy theories" listed among outrageous ones like reptilian politicians, the goal being that people likely to suspect the "conspiracy theories" to be true will see the next article to be about reptilians, and therefore they will likely dismiss all news and theories on the site as absurd. Seaman's goal as a shill is to also become the face of "pizza/pedogate" and therefore hopefully prevent folks from digging deeper. This is similar to how the MSM works. Give people a blind emotional cause to rally behind, and they will forget the cause soon enough when the MSM invents a new one, like Russian hacking.

             Is Ramona's purpose here to do nothing other than berate David Seaman who was phenomenally successful in bringing mass attention to pizzagate? Isn't Ramona a little late? Seaman was highly successful in kick starting the pizzagate movement. Even if Seaman turns out to have some "ulterior motive"...so what...PIZZAGATE IS REAL.
Me thinks Ramona is very scared of something. He should scurry back under a rock. 
Isaiah 2:10 Enter the rock and hide in the dust from the terror of the LORD and from the splendor of His majesty.

              Listen I'm no fan of David Seaman. He does mostly cheer leading but that's ok. All that's important is his 80,000 views.

               DarkMath, based on your comments that I've read, I think you have a good logical mind, but I think you're off the mark here. Seaman may not be overtly hindering or overtly diverting the investigation on the surface, but he is a subtle shill. He is like the alternative news website that has some true "conspiracy theories" listed among outrageous ones like reptilian politicians, the goal being that people likely to suspect the "conspiracy theories" to be true will see the next article to be about reptilians, and therefore they will likely dismiss all news and theories on the site as absurd. Seaman's goal as a shill is to also become the face of "pizza/pedogate" and therefore hopefully prevent folks from digging deeper. This is similar to how the MSM works. Give people a blind emotional cause to rally behind, and they will forget the cause soon enough when the MSM invents a new one, like Russian hacking.

                I see your point about David Seaman. I definitely wouldn't put it past the CIA to do that.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only problem is why are so many people going after him? There's a concerted effort to take him down.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't think the CIA would go to that depth of realism to make their take-down more credible.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think we just call a spade a spade. He's got 80,000 views on his youtube videos. Kids all over America are listening to him put out the word on Pizzagate. That's very dangerous for TPTB. Kids are the future. And they're naturally rebellious and hate authority as it is. You could possibly see David Seaman being one of their standard bearers like Joan of Arc or the Kek frog etc etc.

                 I was contemplating whether to continue the "debate" with you (more a discussion), but I'm waiting for furniture stain to dry so... Perhaps we should let a spade be a spade, as you said. But I'm not convinced that is the right course of action. 
-So many people going after him
a. people like me who think he is a shill and are tired of the attention being on him, and his self-created melodrama, rather than where it needs to be, on the depths and reach of this investigation.
b. CIA/Soros groups who now want to discredit Seaman and therefore confuse and hopefully reduce/eliminate the shallow thinking people (sheeple) who followed and put their emotional trust in him.
-The CIA most certainly would go to such lengths, and has in the past.
-Call a spade a spade? Perhaps, but with reservation. The attention is good, of course, but perhaps legitimate pizzagate researchers should be using him as their shill, turning the psyop tables. 
-I would prefer to be done with dwelling on this guy and focus on more meaningful pursuits. I don't need his self-appointed cheerleading, and I think that the round earth would agree.

               I think the reason he's a shill is because of the fluid nature of his attachments to causes.  He goes only for viral content.  He used to be only against SOPA/PIPA, then for marijuana freedom, then bitcoin, now pizzagate.  He'll drop this story the second it doesn't bring in the page views.
              </p>
              <p>
               A carnival barker has more integrity than Seaman.  At least he's in it for the long haul.

                Who the fuck cares. I don't care. He's certainly not hindering the investigation. He's not lying about evidence or dragging red herrings across the trail.

                He's a cheer leader. Who the fuck cares. Good for him. I hope he makes some money so he can keep cheer leading.

            That Cernovich guy
            <em>
             openly
            </em>
            claims that he also uses Neuro Linguistic Programming. Both him and Seaman sort of came out of nowhere, and skyrocketed to fame unusually fast. This might explain how they did that. Very Interesting. IMHO, our work here is valuable on it's own, and we don't need some sensationalist publicity junkie assuming a role as our spokesman.
