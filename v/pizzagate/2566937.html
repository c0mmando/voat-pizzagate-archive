<p>Laura Biancolini began traveling on Khashoggi’s yacht, along with what is known in some circles as a bevy of lovelies, at the age of seventeen. She converted to Islam, changed her name to Lamia, and became Khashoggi’s second wife before giving birth to her only child and Adnan’s fifth son, Ali, now nine, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Marriage to a man like Adnan Khashoggi cannot have been easy for either of his wives. Women for hire were part and parcel of his everyday life, and he often sent girls as gifts to men with whom he was attempting to do business. </p>

           <p>
            Prince Alwaleed in June last year pledged his wealth to the foundation, $32 billion according to Princess Lamia, after signing the “Giving Pledge,” an initiative launched in 2010 by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett that urges wealthy individuals to give the majority of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes. Since its founding in 1980, Alwaleed Philanthropies has spent almost $4 billion.

            Laura Biancolini began traveling on Khashoggi’s yacht, along with what is known in some circles as a bevy of lovelies, at the age of seventeen. She converted to Islam, changed her name to Lamia, and became Khashoggi’s second wife before giving birth to her only child and Adnan’s fifth son, Ali, now nine, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Marriage to a man like Adnan Khashoggi cannot have been easy for either of his wives. Women for hire were part and parcel of his everyday life, and he often sent girls as gifts to men with whom he was attempting to do business.

            - You do some great research.  Unfortunately some of us (me) can't always read everything in full.  Would you mind doing a real simple BLUF with bullet points showing the very high-level stuff at the beginning of your posts?  I think it may make for a more compelling read.  My .02.

             Sure. Makes sense.  Sometimes I'm doing the research as I'm putting a post together and trying to save time , so makes it difficult for others. :)

              I feel it is necessary to speak out at this time about the shift that has occurred recently. Three years ago, when the first of us were asked to be initiated into the Rising Star Healing work, the cost was $10,000 and the initiation, which we were told was a "source to source" initiation and we could only receive it from Derek O'Neill in Ireland, who was the vehicle for source to come thru) however, we were told that we would be helping to heal the planet and people would be so drawn to this healing work we would within a short period of time recoup our investment. In the last few months Derek has changed his policy, which originally we were told "you cannot copy write God's work, it is here for all of us to take forward to the planet" to "As of June 1st, 2008 if you wish to practice the Rising Star Healing Modality or the Prema Birthing Healing Modality you must "join" a membership in Derek's new organization at $600 a year and pay 30% of each healing to this organization or they will take legal action against us for "copy write infringement" as Derek has now copywrited these healing modalities. ...

              Forty-eight-year-old Derek is not what you would expect in a man who was raised by an alcoholic widow and has braved poverty, sexual abuse and the perils of kung fu fighting. He is gentle, eloquent and has surprisingly small hands for a warrior. They look more suited to arts and crafts than the craft of martial arts. His neatly cropped hair is a reminder of his time in the army.

              "We lived close to the Iveagh Lodgings and there would often be 'dirty old men', destitutes, hanging around. When I was six, I went to the toilet in Patrick's Park and was sexually assaulted by one of them."
             </p>
             <p>
              His experience of sexual abuse didn't confine itself to St Patrick's Park. Derek's brother Brian was raped and beaten in the notorious Letterfrack Industrial School.
