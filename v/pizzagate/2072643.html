            Well done it is your citizen duty and christian duty to shine light on these despicable acts.  Smart to by archiving and reporting.  Despite the disappearance of excellent finds  (miss that historic posts bot) and the constant attacks voaters/webb/honeybee etc are all getting closer and taking on this filth bravely.  This will turn out to be a historic movement that changed the world for the better.   Dont be worried about "im strapping"   ... a big dildo? because hes got a tiny weiner?

            You know... at first I thought you were just a well intentioned idiot, but now I'm convinced that you're not even well intentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets break this down
           </p>
           <p>
            You took over the website of someone who for all we know is running a completely legal (though questionable) business. You stole money from him and the data from his website. You then apparently sent out emails to all the members trying to extort $4000+ from them.
           </p>
           <p>
            After looking over all your posts you've uncovered exactly no proof of illegal activity that has not already been alleged. You post links to unsubstantiated news articles in a language that you probably can't even read. And you can't even be completely sure that they are the same person!
           </p>
           <p>
            You make claims that he is producing child pornography, yet if you even took a second to look at the laws you would see that you are wrong. This is made even more obvious by doing a few minutes of research on Jimmy's business and that the courts ruled that this type of material is LEGAL.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end of the day, unless some huge revelation is made known, you've done nothing to put an end to his business. He will improve his security and users will take more caution in hiding their identities in the future. What you have done is commit extortion on a large scale. I guarantee you the feds have a much bigger reason to be interested in you than anyone buying legal content from Brent's website. At this point to even deny extortion is ridiculous based on the amount of people who have posted their emails. And from what I'm seeing there are definitely people here who are much better at doing what you do.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to the people here who are supporting karenrussell's efforts, you may not be sending emails, but you are still very much involved and are just as morally bereft as the people you're extorting.

            Damn son, so you're nothing but a thief! You were trying to work with a stealing cashier, who said he was in california. The mods even edited your comment because you put your email address or something worse. You are extremely retarded to use the same account everywhere.

            Thankfully more for the FBI to tie together. Maybe they already have a file on you, from you using the clearnet for things like that. Each time I look at something about you, you seem dumber and dumber.

             This actually explains a lot, you came on here to use members so you could have them go after anyone who doesn't pay into your scam. WOW, and some  people had defended you before when you've been stealing from people since before you joined this site. I hope others read this and realize what you are. Also, learn to fucking cover your tracks before trying shit like this, like I said, you left so many leads all over the place.

I'm compiling a list of each and every one of you and this list contains your first and last name, email, ip address, comments you made, records of every purchase you made. You may look here:

I will be releasing all records on several online public forums as well as sending your account information and purchase history to the United States FBI where you will be investigated and charged with the purchase and support of child pornography. I will find family members, your wife if you're married, kids if you have any, and will let them know about your activities as well. You will be exposed in 6 hours unless you pay 1 bitcoin:

I'll be going through and adding more and more of you to this list every day. Want some good news? Yes you messed up and yes you're now in a very bad spot, but there is a way out. If you don't see your name on there yet, you can pay 0.5 btc to ******* or you can go to

208 Fletcher Pl Mountain home, AR 72653 first... the fbi, or someone who's life you ruined... 
Speaking of,  I'm at the cedar wood lodge,  and can't seem to find my way across the damn river.  Do i have to go all the way back to 412?

             Ok,  I'll grab the torches. Can you call the police and let them know he paid money to look at 18yo girls in their bathing suits on the internet?  Also,  the ones that weren't 18 were under the supervision and consent of a parent/ guardian, which anyone with the ability to read could tell you. 
What Id really like to know is have we have evolved on the internet to the point that we now pay girls to keep their clothes on? That's impressive. A complete waste of money in my opinion but to each their own

                  Oh and I'm not "worried" about it.  I'm irritated that some toolbag thinks he can extort people by falsely labeling them as pedophiles.  I'm not nearly as upset as some people are.  He doesn't really have to worry about me, but he probably should worry about some of the others.

                  I had a reason for posting those exact comments even though they were lies, and it accomplished exactly what I needed.  It displayed alliances on voat while at the same time bolstering the extortion evidence.  You wouldn't really understand, so don't try.

                 No, but I've seen the rest of your comments trolling this thread. You've confirmed that the OP is sending out extortion emails, which tells me you got one, and you've defended the website. Aka you're one of them.

             Damn this is too easy, I was wondering what caused you to delete all of your domains or why you still had one and I Figured it out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back in January you were browsing 1and1.com and saw some sick deal for webhosting that inclueded a free domain! 
You were like sick, it also includes free privacy guard. You then pondered to yourself for a while thinking of an awesome domain name then decided pizzagate.pics would be rad. It cam with free privacy guard with the package. You were like huh? What's what?
            </p>
            <p>
             A few months later, you decide you want to switch it up a notch, you site was becoming hip and you wanted to look cool and have a bunch sweet domains, and use them all on the same pages, but linking to the same server, at least people would be jelly of all the cool domains you own. You rush, go to buy 1 year domain names, see the privacy guard (Maybe you can help tell your side of this) and say, ah no way, I got that privacy guard or whatever it is for free on my account already.
            </p>
            <p>
             3 months later, you've decided you wanted to be all cool and help in the hunt, you also have all that web cred because of all the domains you have. You start participating in the teenmodels4bitcoins or some thread related to that, and you notice people are posting that sites whois... suddenly it hit you? Oh shit, that's what that thing was.   You go and check all 6 of your domains and find the 5 new ones have your information. You crap your pants and try to make changes to fix it, (noticed this), then you deleted all 5 new ones, even though you still had like 8 or 9 months on those things. Assholes, but at least you still had 1 domain, which is the freeone you got with "Free Privacy Whois Guard"!
            </p>
            <p>
             Some assholes start attacking your webserver, which you received with a dedicated IP (Which explains why you would hand out urls with IP's on them). So now you've hidden your services to prevent the back guys from knowing who you are and still have the hosting service as the pizzagate.click domain is still registered to you and active.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, wtf you hosting websites on windows for? Only some old  person who is used to working with asp or crappier (That site looked like junk) would be doing that. So I'm guessing there is not James Jones Jr at the house, just your old self who spends hours a day browsing password dumps trying to find people who did not change their password or had the same password set on other accounts. You spend all day trying to find where they might also be registered and spin the wheel hoping they were careless. Then attribute it to mad hacker skills.

Someone just needs to find if James Jones and Jane Jones ever made love and birthed a child. Any one able to peek through a window? Hopefully the don't see this happening in action.

             You registered 5 or so domains with that address, even transferred one, not to mention you were also paying for hosting services for that website. Anyone of those guys that decides to open an extortion case against you, can notify them of sites you had. Then potentially request authorized payment information and logs. You should of made another Voat account before starting this to at least rid yourself of that.

              All keeps pointing back to the address of Mr James Tim Jones and Jane Cox Jones. 
I'm hoping I'm wrong and it's not that easy, and it's not the address everyone currently thinks you're at. Hopefully the FBI catches you first, and they see that we did not want any part of what you've done. Maybe they will then see we have moral's and start listening to us more. You can sleep safe tonight if that's not your address above, I will continue again soon and thankfully I have a pretty free week and a few other items on you to follow up on. Hopefully by tomorrow I wake up to some pleasant messages from you. Night!

              <strong>
               Just saw your update
              </strong>
              You stated "why would I use my email if it includes my first and last name" ,
I think James Johns thought the same thing when registering his domains, so he used admclark05 instead. Crazy how you two think so alike. But probably was not as smart as you because he put an address that actually listed him as the owner of said address. Public property tax receipts show he does indeed live there. He must of been prompted for his billing information when registering those domains and did not hit that pesky "not worth it" whois privacy protection. Probably thought that just putting a fake email address would do the trick.

                 Posting information on people is not that bad, extorting them for 4,000 dollars, which also qualifies as sexual extortion, would give them a justifiable reason to have authorities look into this, and request information from 3rd parties.

                   Is that supposed to be me? Ahaha, thankfully I'm not part of your extortion list, which is why I must send them any information found. But good try. I would of never joined in on this if there were not all the messages about you extorting people. Way to fail at being a hero.

                     Go right ahead, it's what you did before that is what bother's me. The more you post, the more emails I have to send to. The more of a chance someone will visit your home, start an investigation or do something worse. It's people like you that ruin good causes, not help them.

                       Just like a human body, if you have something rotten, sometimes you have to cut it off. Also, these dumb mistakes you make create more of a reason for police to actually go after this cause. If you had just dumped and not emailed all of those users, the police would not care. Now you have given all of these people a reason to come after us, not just for something like harassment, but for extortion.

                         Perhaps but not like this, you cannot dig lower then the people you are trying to bring down, that makes you the one who loses in the end.

                         Personal gains should not get in the way of a cause you are fully with, you should be happy gaining nothing but pleasure from moving forward and helping get it done. Instead you thought only of yourself when you drew a target on our backs. Do you know how hard the FBI and online service providers are going after sexual online extortion?  Not as bad as they need to go after these people but  you made us look like shit.

                           Can you just dump everything now? I don't want to wait around and have to pull these from comments. I know it's kinda of an odd way to go about going after you but these people will create what I need. You will be made an example of to hopefully deter anyone from trying to make money off of our cause and fuck us over. Thanks.

                             This is not about the normalization of pedophilia, this is about you creating this issue with you demanding money and giving them what they need to go after the people on this forum. You left them a link to our site in order to scare them into paying. You have put other people at risk because they are new to the cause and have not learned how to protect themselves, and giving them an extremely easy method to find us. Many on here are happy to help, but have left a trial of identifiable information. People from that site may target them as well. I'm not saying a lot of people would have ended up here after a while, I'm saying you gave those pedophiles an extremely easy way to look further into this.  You have not considered anyone else but yourself in this situation.

                        There's also no going back now, no matter if you stop or don't stop, so just keep doing whatever gives you that warm feeling of happiness till someone comes to shut it off. Many here have seen your stupidity, even if not everyone, but you have made quite a few people angry.

             How bad?  Did he say how beautiful a girl who is clearly over 18 was? (Which happens to be most of them. Just look at all the breast implants,  c section scars, tattoos,  and the fact that several of them are cam models.)  How dare he! What a pervy pervster. I bet he just needs to find Jesus,  lawd have mercy!

            Don't get me wrong, we all appreciate the impressive work you're doing, but sam_mas brings up many good points. Unfortunately the courts have found that websites like Brent's are completely legal regardless of what anyone thinks about the content. Brent produces the same kind of garbage that Jimmy did, and he was found innocent. There is a reason his website has been around so long. The only way forward is to pressure lawmakers to change the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, a word of caution... I hope the allegations of blackmail are not true because while viewing content on his website is legal, extortion/blackmail and defamation are very much illegal and can mean jailtime/lawsuits. I would imagine these people wouldn't have much problem reporting you to law enforcement knowing that they haven't technically broken any laws by using his website.  These people are not likely to be very happy about having their entire lives, careers, and family ruined over this. Please prepare yourself accordingly and stay safe!

              Because I add an unemotional, factual, and well reasoned contribution to the topic I'm suddenly one of the members? You're a lot less likely to get support from people when you're allegedly extorting people for $4000+. I haven't seen you deny it yet. What a joke...

             The allegations of extortion and blackmail are completely true. I totally understand trying to make the world a better place,  but for karenrussel to say "I'm going to do the right thing,  unless you give me 1btc ($4000)" really shows what their concern is: their personal gain
            </p>

             Edit: value of 1btc was way off

            Good work guys! I read the comments form those that are like, well he prob got spooked and moved, and that this isn't illegal. People are FED UP with waiting for these sick monsters to be incarcerated. People have been giving all sorts of evidence to letter agencies and the heads of this child trafficking are still not only free, but enjoying SS protection. I agree, out them all and shame them if we cannot get action from law enforcement. At least the humans that are paying attention can spread the word about these predators.

             per the site,  : All photography work has been done with authorization of and in the presence of a parent or appointed guardian. Release Forms have been signed by the model and parent/guardian and are on file in the agency office.
            </p>
            <p>
             So... something like that?  Maybe try reading the about us on a website before starting a witch hunt.

               You're right.  Don't seek out any truths for yourself.  Just make wild accusations and believe the lies you are fed. You must be some sort of Christian with that mentality

               This is on every site of his and has been for years: 
All artistic work contained on this website abides by US and International Laws and does not contain lewd, obscene, or lascivious poses nor anything sexually explicit.

            "I am the one who hacked TM4B and that means I have all of your info. Now I was just made aware of a newsletter posted by Brent, (owner of TM4B and wanted for murder). You are a fool if you think what you are doing isn't wrong and absolutely illegal. You're also a fool if you think I'm messing around when I say I will be reporting you to the FBI. I'm compiling a list of each and every one of you and this list contains your first and last name, email, ip address, comments you made, records of every purchase you made.
           </p>
           <p>

            to see your details once I uncover who you are and post it for the world to see. I will find your friends and family and make sure they see this as well. I'll be going through and adding more and more of you to this list every day.

            Want some good news? Yes you messed up and yes you're now in a very bad spot, but there is a way out. If you don't see your name on there yet, you can pay 1 btc to REMOVED or you can go to
            <a href="https://gocps.net/">
             https://gocps.net/
            </a>
            REMOVED to make payment. Do so quickly and I'll skip over you.
           </p>

            If you think 1 btc is to much then just consider how bad things can get for you if people knew who you really were.

              Maybe it's not a he. Karen could be a woman,  which could explain the witch hunt.  Luckily her period should be over soon,  since this was posted 5 days ago, and then she can go back to making her husband miserable instead of everyone else.  I just hope this is a period,  and not full blown mentalpause... or as we call it in the north: mad cow disease.

            I've lurked here for a while and I like the work put into this. I feel that this may be a case of the hurting more than helping though. You guys have done some good research on the guy running this site and his pedo buddy Jimmy.
 I'm sure you know that that Brent ran a site called latinaboopers. He had underage girls on that site just like his current one. He crossed the line on that site by selling webcam chats with the girls where the viewer paid extra money to become porn chats. Brent sucked a running a website as much as he does today and a hacker leaked his content online. As you can imagine the perv kept recordings of the porn chats. Brent closed up shop once he got wind of the leak and destroyed all the evidence. Some of you may know that there are watch groups that keep an eye on these sites. They helped his buddy Jimmy get arrested in 02 by reporting his site to law enforcement, the media, and politicians. Jimmy's arrests didn't stick  , because unfortunately these teen smut site are legal in the eyes of the courts. Brent was reported but that leak saved him. Later on his pedo buddy Jimmy taught him his ways and got Brent up and running again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like the ashleymadison site leak didn't kill that site this leak will not kill this one. Brent crossed the line before and it was only a matter of time before he did it again. He sounded like he was ready to cross the line once he moved to bitcoin. Watch groups also reported to payment processors to make it harder for these sites. His weak website made it easy to keep tabs on him. Law-enforcement wouldn't have had any trouble coming down on him. Now just like ashleymadison  did he will fix his security over time. He may have been scared enough to keep his pedo site legal like his pedo buddy Jimmy taught him. His members will claim they were hacked. Some will get smarter with how they operate online. Making it harder to catch them next time. Brent will continue exploiting these girls until he retires like Jimmy did.
           </p>
           <p>
            These type of pedo sites will keep moving to bitcoin. Reporting to payment processors just doesn't work there. The companies hosting the servers for these sites don't seem to care either. The other hope was that hackers would kill these sites since their content always gets leaked and members would stop paying. Fact is that laws must change to shut these sites down. They shouldn't be legal, but Jimmy winning his case gave way to more of them. Now that pedo is teaching others how to exploit these girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a shame that these sites are allowed in 2017. Pressure needs to put on law markers to shut them down.

            Alright, I literally made an account just to post here, so call me a shill all you want, but idc. I wanna do anything I can to help you guys. I spent a long time looking through the threads and browsed the TM4B website and i'm absolutely disgusted. those are children. fucking CHILDREN. that could be YOUR KID, YOUR SISTER, YOUR DAUGHTER. i'm horrified. I began just searching for anything I could find from the email addresses being posted. I didn't think I found anything super interesting but then I did, and I'm so sorry but I was on mobile, so I can't even find which email address I searched that got me this hit. but I found a website that tied with the TM4B one, its called JambaTeens.com..."Non-Nude Teen Model Fan Forums". So basically a pedo forum, from the looks of it. I'm currently on there looking around right now, even though I want to run out my front door and scream and cry because of how black and filthy my heart feels right now. anything I can do to protect myself while helping investigate is appreciated, i'm new to this. been lurking for a year or so, first time posting. thank you.

             "The next blog is more about business and legal experiences surrounding the pretty girl website business. Fakers that cause issues for us by pretending to be a TrueTeenBabes photographer, the massive piracy issues, real life stories using real names, links to documents and more. That blog can be found at JamesSGrady.com (yes, use the middle initial "S" please).
Note - As of September 2016 I haven't been able to post at this spot. Most of the damn legal shit, like lawsuit settlements, contain these silly "Non-Disparagement" clauses that prevent me from telling much of the crap some dingbats pull or at least try to pull. I'll try to et something entertaining up soon."

            Great job! This is how it's done!  No pre-announcement of announcement, no teasers, no self-publicity buzz. Just dump the ID of the pervs and the perpetrators, expose who they are - names, contact information, amounts paid, comments on the CP site... 
Outstanding investigation

            Whatever you do, Please make sure you have protection.  These people are dangerous and will seek you out if they can.  They have been know to stalk children, so why not adults.  Get Protection. Cameras are in order.

             This one is on the German Facebook, looks like the usual pedo from the profile pic. Started to work at Augsburg Airways in may 2016 even though the company went broke in late 2013. On August 5th, 2014 he went to "the school of life" in San Diego (?). I'll see if I can figure out how to report him to German authorities.

            why aren't you responding to the claims that you were trying to extort money the members that you have uncovered?  Were you?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have sent a tip to the FBI's internet crimes division to investigate TM4B, and I thank you for your work digging up this information.  I also included in that tip these accusations that have been made of blackmail/extortion of these people against you.  If you weren't then you have nothing to worry about and my apologies, and if you were trying to extort these people for your personal gain instead of doing it because it right then that makes you no better morally than them.  Using this type of information against people is an extremely common method of blackmail/extortion and is one that the FBI actively investigates.

            If you did not try to extort these people then thank you for your work.  Your lack of response to these allegations is however bothersome.
