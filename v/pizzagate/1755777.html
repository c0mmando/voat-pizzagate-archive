            There's more to this Joule Unlimited then what they are saying..... There are 3 Joule entities, Joule Unlimited, Joules Energy and Joules Stichting. Podesta was on the boards of all 3.
           </p>
           <p>
            The GAI investigative report says it’s unclear how much, if any, money Podesta made. The reason: Podesta was on the board of three Joule entities, but only listed two on his disclosure; the most important entity, Joule Stichting, he did not list. “Podesta’s compensation by Joule cannot be fully determined,” reads the report. “In his 2014 federal government disclosure filing, Podesta lists that he divested stock options from Joule. However, the disclosure does not cover the years 2011-2012.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “But the flows of funds from Russia during the ‘reset’ to Podesta-connected entities apparently didn’t end with Joule Energy,” the report states. According to the GAI report, Podesta’s far-left think tank, Center for American Progress (CAP), took in $5.25 million from the Sea Change Foundation between 2010-2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was funding Sea Change Foundation? According to tax records, Sea Change Foundation at the time was receiving a large infusion of funds from a mysterious Bermuda-based entity called ‘Klein, Ltd.’…Who owns Klein? It is impossible to say exactly, given corporate secrecy laws in Bermuda. But the registered agent and lawyers who set up the offshore entity are tied to a handful of Russian business entities including Troika Dialog, Ltd. Leadership includes Ruben Vardanyan, an ethnic Armenian who is a mega oligarch in Putin’s Russia. Vardanyan also served on the board of Joule Energy with John Podesta.

           </p>
           <p>

            Don't worry if they take the video down. There's more than enough evidence in "Clinton Cash" to warrant an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also it's examples like this where someone like John Podesta will flat out lie right to your face that we know these people are Sociopaths and may even be full blown Psychopaths.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Sociopath and/or Psychopath is incapable of many key emotions like empathy. As a result that can't understand how people are reacting to them because they literally can't get inside someone else's head.
           </p>
           <p>
            This results in these flat out over the top lies these people are constantly getting caught telling. They can't help it.
