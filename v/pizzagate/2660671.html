<p><strong>Ark of Hope for Children - its financials</strong></p>
<p>Ark of Hope for Children takes <a href="https://www.paypal.me/arkofhope">donations</a> from a variety of sources.</p>

<p>Ark of Hope also <a href="https://arkofhopeforchildren.org/support-us/allies">takes money via Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfilecom/business/Ark-of-Hope-For-Children-386-454-1280">This</a> indicates that is estimated to generate $20,000 in annual revenues,.</p>
<p>It appears that Ark of Hope for Children <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/viewPDF.aspx?PdfSource=0&amp;ein=59-3585457">declares not one cent on its financials</a>  That is the most recent of its financials that are available on GuideStar. They show nothing. You will notice that zero dollars and cents have been declared.  Also shown in its financials that zero dollars and cents have been spent on any outreach work, any charity work, any feeding or housing of trafficked children, any educational programs.  Also included in that report is its balance sheet, again all zeros. What is it doing with the money that is being given it??</p>
<p><strong>Ark of Hope for Children and its questionable ally NotInMyWorld.org with links to satanism</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/K7t2LpB">Here</a> is Ark of Hope for Children\'s \'Allies\' page listing notinmyworld.org.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/oUA8zeN">Here</a> is Robert Strongbow (who uses the name of Blackhorn33), CEO of notinmyworld.org confirming he is an \'Arkangel\' ambassador for Ark of Hope.  Please note Blackhorn language and the way he refers to an 11-year-old little girl as a \'young lady\'.  Eleven-year-olds are CHILDREN, not ladies.</p>
<p>The owl is a symbol for the occult and satan. <a href="https://imgur.com/qApQcAs">Here</a> is Notinmyworld\'s website  featuring an owl.</p>
<p>On that same screenshot, you will see one listed \'contributor\', who goes by the name NIMWOWL who stated that she attended Cathedral Catholic High School in Dallas, Texas. There is NO Cathedral Catholic High School in Dallas, Texas. It simply does not  exist.</p>
<p>Please note the name NIMWOWL. Nim are the first three letters of NIMROD. Here is some information about Nimrod:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nimrod, grandson of Noah, son of Cush, was the real founder of the Babylonian system .... Nimrod built the tower of Babel, the original Babylon, ancient Nineveh, and many other cities.
Nimrod was known as the god of the Chaldean Mysteries. In the Chaldean mysteries, the Babylonian dictator Nimrod was deified as Saturn. Satan and Saturn are the same words, one \'Early Latin\', and the other \'Late Latin\'... His birthday was celebrated on December 25th or the Saturnalia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blackhorn33 has a  Flicker account. <a href="https://imgur.com/Cf9d3UG">Many of the accounts he is following are hardcore porn</a>  Not exactly someone who defends children.</p>
<p>At the bottom of] <a href="https://notinmyworld.org/about_our_world/our-circle/">this page</a> is a link to NCMEC.</p>
<p>Notinmyworld \'contributors\' has one listed contributor, who goes by the name <a href="https://imgur.com/qApQcAs">NIMWOWL</a>  
</p>
<p>Her details state she attended Cathedral Catholic High School in Dallas, Texas, which appears not to exist. The only Cathedral Catholic High School I can find is in San Diego.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bunny. how did you like how I told the story, how we had to sacrifice somebody????</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notinmyworld advertising <a href="https://imgur.com/u7DxTOa">ArkofHope</a>  and the first article that comes up when you click on the contributor\'s articles</p>
<p>Notinmyworld\'s has a \'CIRCLE\', <a href="https://ideaprovoker.wordpress.com/2018/07/23/the-girl-who-was-undressed-by-evil-3/:">one of whose members</a>  is the author of this delightful piece about pedophilia, torture and grooming:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A stupendous ray of light and colours flashed strikingly towards her body as the walls of her cage dramatically broke the moment she screamed. She couldn’t grasp the idea of how she did it, but she was cognisant of the incredible power she has acquired from the torture she underwent last night. …  It’s lovely, isn’t it?” asked a male voice from behind that broke her beautiful reverie. … She hastily turned around and saw a naked man with a perfectly tanned skin that make him look so manly. She tried to ignore the warmth that electrified her skin but it was quite strong. She couldn’t help but to imagine something wild and predictably romantic, like two people stranded on an island-kind-of-story who ended up falling in love with each other and then having sex. Distracted by the hot view in front of her, it took her a while to realize she was supposed to respond to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the \'Ark of Hope\'</strong></p>
<p>The Ark of Hope is a chest fashioned on the biblical Ark of the Covenant, but rather than any refereneces to Christianity it displays occult and paganist symbols. Again, satan copying God.  The 96&quot; carrying poles are  horns to \'protect\' it. It contains the Earth Charter. It currently stands in the United Nations building in New York.  Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (Dutroux affair) presented the Telemos for the Ark of Hope.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theologisches.info/gesund7.htm">Here</a> is some information on the Ark of Hope</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Earth Charter is kept in the &quot;Ark of Hope&quot; alongside with holy Temenos and Gaia prayer books and Earth prayer masks. 
\'Masks\' should be raising some eyebrows. It continues:</p>
<p>... Gorbachev has launched  the Earth Charter , which he calls &quot;the 10 Commandments of our time&quot;!!- a project in collaboration  with Steven Rockefeller and  illuminist, Maurice Strong. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://americanpolicy.org/2013/04/15/connecting-the-dots-from-the-united-nations-to-your-state-government">Here</a>is another piece on the Ark of Hope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original copy of the Earth Charter has been placed in a specially constructed Ark of Hope, a 49 inch (124.5cm) by 32 inch (81.3cm) by 32″ (81.3cm) wooden chest that is built to resemble the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, but contains occult symbolism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crossroad.to/articles2/2002/ark.html">Another article</a> on the occult symbolism of the Ark of Hope.</p>
<p>This is what Ben Rast had to say about the Ark of Hope</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ark of Hope is a blatant and blasphemous affront to Jews and Christians alike.  It places a sacred status on the Earth Charter, and attempts to replace the divine law of Yahweh with man-made rules that will pave the way for the Antichrist. &quot;   <a href="http://hopetotheend.com/earth.html">http://hopetotheend.com/earth.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/Hk1PGYS">This</a> is a page taken from the book <em>Web of the Illuminati</em>. Those two paragraphs say that the Ark of Hope is made from a sycamore tree. Sycamores were considered to pagan religions. The tomb of Osiris was made out of sycamore.  Gorbachev said that he hoped that the Earth Charter would replace the ten commandments of the Bible.  Alice Bailey said that in the United Nations is a reflective group of people within whose hands lie the destiny of mankind. The United Nations are attempting to formulate a world plan and that three occult factors have governed the development of that plan.</p>
<p>My question is: why would a charity take its name from something so controversial and obviously tied to illuminism and the occult?</p>
<p><strong>What is Ark of Hope for Children doing now?</strong></p>
<p>It appears that Ark of Hope has attached its wagon to the pizzagate/pedogate train.  <a href="https://imgur.com/7V7LTz1">This</a> is Ark of Hope supporting a project  called \'A Child\'s Voice\' being produced by some people known to most of us.</p>
<p>People can draw their own conclusions.  Personally, I have lost trust in anyone who is asking for money, is taking money or is making a living out of their advocacy for children and pizzagate.  Once a person can be paid, they can be bought. Remember the old adage: whoever pays the piper calls the tune.</p>
<p>imho, people and organisations, some nefarious, have seen an opportunity for free publicity and have jumped on the pedogate bandwagon. People who do not know any better will give to some of these \'charities\' who offer no vision, no objective and no accountability. There\'s certainly no transparency and some very big red flags which point to affiliation with satanist groups.</p>

           <p>
            A stupendous ray of light and colours flashed strikingly towards her body as the walls of her cage dramatically broke the moment she screamed. She couldn’t grasp the idea of how she did it, but she was cognisant of the incredible power she has acquired from the torture she underwent last night. …  It’s lovely, isn’t it?” asked a male voice from behind that broke her beautiful reverie. … She hastily turned around and saw a naked man with a perfectly tanned skin that make him look so manly. She tried to ignore the warmth that electrified her skin but it was quite strong. She couldn’t help but to imagine something wild and predictably romantic, like two people stranded on an island-kind-of-story who ended up falling in love with each other and then having sex. Distracted by the hot view in front of her, it took her a while to realize she was supposed to respond to him.

            What is the 'Ark of Hope'
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Ark of Hope is a chest fashioned on the biblical Ark of the Covenant, but rather than any refereneces to Christianity it displays occult and paganist symbols. Again, satan copying God.  The 96" carrying poles are  horns to 'protect' it. It contains the Earth Charter. It currently stands in the United Nations building in New York.  Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (Dutroux affair) presented the Telemos for the Ark of Hope.

           is some information on the Ark of Hope
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The Earth Charter is kept in the "Ark of Hope" alongside with holy Temenos and Gaia prayer books and Earth prayer masks. 
'Masks' should be raising some eyebrows. It continues:
           </p>
           <p>
            ... Gorbachev has launched  the Earth Charter , which he calls "the 10 Commandments of our time"!!- a project in collaboration  with Steven Rockefeller and  illuminist, Maurice Strong.

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The original copy of the Earth Charter has been placed in a specially constructed Ark of Hope, a 49 inch (124.5cm) by 32 inch (81.3cm) by 32″ (81.3cm) wooden chest that is built to resemble the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, but contains occult symbolism.

          <p>
           This is what Ben Rast had to say about the Ark of Hope
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            The Ark of Hope is a blatant and blasphemous affront to Jews and Christians alike.  It places a sacred status on the Earth Charter, and attempts to replace the divine law of Yahweh with man-made rules that will pave the way for the Antichrist. "

            This
           </a>
           is a page taken from the book
           <em>
            Web of the Illuminati
           </em>
           . Those two paragraphs say that the Ark of Hope is made from a sycamore tree. Sycamores were considered to pagan religions. The tomb of Osiris was made out of sycamore.  Gorbachev said that he hoped that the Earth Charter would replace the ten commandments of the Bible.  Alice Bailey said that in the United Nations is a reflective group of people within whose hands lie the destiny of mankind. The United Nations are attempting to formulate a world plan and that three occult factors have governed the development of that plan.
          </p>
          <p>
           My question is: why would a charity take its name from something so controversial and obviously tied to illuminism and the occult?

            What is Ark of Hope for Children doing now?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           It appears that Ark of Hope has attached its wagon to the pizzagate/pedogate train.
           <a href="https://imgur.com/7V7LTz1">
            This
           </a>
           is Ark of Hope supporting a project  called 'A Child's Voice' being produced by some people known to most of us.
          </p>
          <p>
           People can draw their own conclusions.  Personally, I have lost trust in anyone who is asking for money, is taking money or is making a living out of their advocacy for children and pizzagate.  Once a person can be paid, they can be bought. Remember the old adage: whoever pays the piper calls the tune.
          </p>
          <p>
           imho, people and organisations, some nefarious, have seen an opportunity for free publicity and have jumped on the pedogate bandwagon. People who do not know any better will give to some of these 'charities' who offer no vision, no objective and no accountability. There's certainly no transparency and some very big red flags which point to affiliation with satanist groups.

            After 25 years moving up through retail, to retail management, to contract sales management, to Vice President, then owner of Lighting Unlimited, Inc in Barring ton, Illinois, Blair Corbett left the normal marketplace in his mid forties. He and wife Verna chose to use their own childhood experiences, and adult faith, to make a difference for hurting children. In 1999 the Corbett's began by adopting five children, to increase their total number of children in their home to ten. In 2000 they founded the nonprofit Ark of Hope for Children near Gainesville, Florida that would serve young child abuse victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            So they adopted 5 children and finally ended up with 10 all together.  I thought they took in children did not know they had their own adopted ones.  Hmm.

            More on the Ark of Hope
            <em>
             Earth Charter
            </em>
            meant to replace The Ten Commandments:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In place of the simple elegance of the rules for self-government and social stability expressed above, the Earth Charter calls for the imposition of a global tyranny over every aspect of human activity which becomes evident once you strip away the rhetorical devices and eco-socialist jargon. … The program calls for all individuals to be "guided and assessed" by an unspecifed group of managers and to accept a subsistence level existence, regardless of their individual aspirations. The hypocrisy of these billionaire globalists preaching about the virtues of universal poverty is mind boggling!

              Holy Moly!  What's up with that statement?  Are they no longer operating?  Seems somewhat strange if they have hung it up that others are singing their praises.   Suspended due to lack of funds?  Where did the money go? Well, the place did raise questions for me.  Hmm.

               A few other 'names' have lent their support too.
              </p>
              <p>
               The FBI and Homeland Security have worked with them?  Is this true ??  There are many issues here because Corbett's background is in retail and he claims to have been running programs for vulnerable children.  In the UK if you work with children you need a certain amount of specialist training, as well as background checks.  You also can't post images like the ones we've seen on his website (eg. child sitting on the lap of a pair of hairy male legs) and not have people question what's going on.  Is it not the same in America?

            , looking at the birthdates on the link you provided,  I think that Barry may be Blair's son.  They live at the same address.

            There are children in that place in the middle of the forest.  Those children have no means of escape.  They are not on a block in the city or a small town.  There is no where for them to run and that is the reason for the location, imo.  No amount of screaming will be heard. No one will come to their rescue.  Just as planned.  Frightening.
