<p>Ex-priest Fred Lenczycki, convicted of sexually abusing boys in DuPage County in 2004, faces similar charges in Missouri </p>
<p>Rev. Fred Lenczycki, a former Hinsdale priest who pleaded guilty to abusing three boys in the 1980s, was arrested on sex abuse charges in Missouri on Thursday. (DuPage County sheriff\'s office)</p>
<p>A former Catholic priest who has admitted sexually abusing as many as 30 youths in Chicago’s suburbs, California and Missouri over 25 years and who pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in DuPage County in 2004 faces new charges.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that 74-year-old Fred Lenczycki — the first priest in the country to be declared sexually violent — was charged Thursday in St. Louis County with two counts each of deviate sexual assault and sodomy.</p>
<p>Charging documents allege he repeatedly grabbed one boy\'s genitals and tried to force another boy to expose himself in the early 1990s in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton. The documents say the allegations fit &quot;within the pattern of abuse perpetrated by the defendant over many years,&quot; the Post-Dispatch reported.</p>
<p>Authorities said Lenczycki has not been taken into custody in Missouri. Bail in the case is set at $500,000 cash only.</p>
<p>According to the Post-Dispatch, Lenczycki currently lives in Berkeley, a west suburb of Chicago. A man who answered the phone at his home address in Berkeley declined to comment to The Associated Press on Friday.</p>
<p>Lenczycki was charged in 2002 with sexually abusing three boys from St. Isaac Jogues Parish in Hinsdale in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Victims told authorities that &quot;Father Fred&quot; repeatedly molested them, often using the pretense of swaddling them in &quot;Baby Jesus&quot; costumes for pageants that never took place.</p>
<p>After the parents of one of victim complained, Lenczycki was transferred to California and then Missouri.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to five years in prison in 2004 after pleading guilty in DuPage County court to aggravated sexual abuse of three boys.</p>
<p>Lenczycki was declared sexually violent by a DuPage County jury in 2008 at a hearing to determine if he should be released from prison. He remained in custody but was released in 2009.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Lenczycki admitted abusing as many as 30 youths in Hinsdale, Naperville and Romeoville and in California and Missouri.</p>
<p>&quot;We\'re deeply grateful to both the victim for having the courage to report and law enforcement for having the will to pursue charges,&quot; said David Clohessy with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. &quot;He\'s obviously a very dangerous man, and shame on every church official who knew of or suspected his crimes and ignored or hid them.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest charges against Lenczycki were filed as victims of clergy sexual abuse demand more accountability and transparency from the Catholic church. The Vatican convened a sexual abuse summit Thursday to hear the testimony of several victims.</p>
<p>I wouldn\'t know who Lenczycki was if not for one of our Best Researchers <a href="https://voat.co/u/Wolftrail7272">@Wolftrail7272</a>  We researched together for a few months.  One of his Submissions was this one on Ricky McCormick.  You may have heard of Ricky.  He was found dead with a cryptic note in his pocket.  The FBI to this day has not solved the message.  Within the Post there is info on Lenczycki.  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1587392">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1587392</a></p>
<p>Ricky McCormick fathered four children all with underage women, and served 11 months of a 3 year sentence for it. Light time, right? He may have made a deal with the FBI to entrap other predators. Here is why I believe this: Five days before he was found dead in a rural park, he went to Forest Park Hospital, formerly Deaconess Hospital, which was run at the time by Tenet Healthcare. (As an aside, &quot;Tenet&quot; is written in one of the NOTES. Haven\'t dug much into Tenet). This is significant because at the time, a violent sexual predator priest by the name of Fred Lenczycki was working at this hospital.</p>

<p>Fred Lenczycki would  crawl from the grave to rape again.  They never stop.</p>',

            TRUMP AND HILLARY BOTH MADE THE DEAL. SO DID MITT ROMNEY. SO DID PAUL RYAN. SO DID NANCY PELOSI, SO DID CHUCK SCHUMER. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON. THOSE INVOLVED WILL NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE CORRUPT SYSTEM THEY CONTROL.
