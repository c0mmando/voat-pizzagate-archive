            They have enough already.  They have the contents of Anthony Fucking Weiner's laptop!!  If they want to prosecute anyone, all the info needed is there.  We have to keep up the pressure so they will be forced to do the right thing.

             They also have the WikiLeaks from the Clinton Foundation, which  aren't public.    All the wikleaks have been proven true by computer forensic analysis, so I'm guessing the Clinton Foundation emails are loaded.

             Maybe the few good men and women are  waiting for the public to wake up and stand behind them.

            I didn't see the guy driving the car.   Driving the car doesn't  mean anything in my opinion.  I couldn't see the face of the person whom they claimed was Alefantis.  Why would it be suspicious for him to look out a door of his own restaurant?      The pic of the man running away with kids is cut and the camera is not stable footage;  all over the place.  Cutting back to the door doesn't prove that they came out of there because there's no sequence photo.   That pic could have been taken anywhere.    I'm just saying that there are a lot of people trying to get dis-information circulated in order to discredit the actual attention toward   WikiLeaks data and a public demand for investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think poorly done clips like this is actually a discredit and can harm public interpretation.

            My last post on this ridiculous conversation because you are absolutely right - I've extended far too much energy on your immature rambling.

            I'm not saying and never did say or imply that there is nothing to be seen. I am calling you on your very specific bullshit claims and suspicions. You sound like an idiot.

            PAY ATTENTION:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) NONE OF US, including you or the tweeters, saw enough of those kids or the circumstances to make ANY claims you're making as to the characterization of their behavior, demeanor, mood, listlessness, or health status.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) There is no way to tell what they might be thinking, how they are or or not communicating to each other or how to characterize their relationships with each other or anyone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) You cannot see enough about their clothing to make ANY determination of value of it or type or where it came from - you sure the hell can't determine they are homeless from their clothing or that anything came from Goodwill. All you can see is they are all wearing pants and tops/jackets and I believe some were carrying backpacks.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) WHAT FUCKING CONTAINER?
           </p>
           <p>
            5) You don't know which day the video was taken, you don't know what time of day the video was taken.
           </p>
           <p>
            6) You know nothing about the contextual activities of the kids -  whether they were on a holiday, siblings, where they were coming from or going. You damn well can't determine from anything in that video that they look like "trafficked, abused kids" - have you ever even seen what trafficked, abused kids look like?
           </p>
           <p>
            7) I'm pretty sure there was a girl among them but w/out queues in the hair or clothing, you don't see faces. I'm not going to go find the video again - this is already wasting too much of my time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason it got buried is that your claims are absolutely ridiculous. You're part of the problem with the lack of critical thinking here and this will get attacked. Not only do I and others DISAGREE with your "analysis", those are wild fucking claims that are nearly 100% indeterminable from a few seconds of a video of the backs of kids. I don't think you have much interaction with kids. This is no longer just a difference of opinion, you're being unreasonable and illogical and overly emotional and it's easy to assume you're just trying to stir up drama and/or cause others to and that is dangerous to our cause and people take that seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you need to take a breath. THIS is not at all a scene you need to be spending your energy on. It is certainly info to be looked into, but not by you or other tweeters looking for something to get all riled up about. You really need to get a grip and stop wasting everyone's time.

            Got it. I can get on board with a plea to LE for a review. There may be other information in that video that could provide leads that none of us sees and that may/may not have anything to do with those kids. I just caution others who are interpreting things they see in an inflammatory way - for sport. This isn't a game. And really, I think efforts are better spent looking elsewhere - at this point in time, it is very unlikely anyone is going to find anything nefarious on that entire block. These guys are stupid but they're not

            The videographer either didn't actually catch those kids near or leaving the buildings or the video was edited conveniently. Some yahoo posted on another thread that the kids were "tired, rushing". You don't see their faces and you can't tell much about anything in that footage. This is just dramatizing something for effect - not helpful.

            How in the world can you say those kids came out of CPP when the video just cuts to a different angle with some kids. The video is completely cut up.

            In regards to Hagmann, he claimed he had damaging evidence from his sources and it was blocked out.  In reality it was a mother blogging about her daughters piano lessons. Someone did a reverse image and found the source. I would be very very careful with that guy.

            Nice sentiment , however I do not think it will work but you can try posting on the chive, lots of guys in the military at Camp Pendleton  reaad the chive, and you can try posting it on LEO forums. good luck. Yeah I watched the whole thing and I am retired LEO..I do not think it will hit home. too rambling. I would say more but I am tired of people freaking out when I say truth.

             I get your point.  Unfortunately if something doesn't have graphic images every second, or wraps up in 1 minute, people's a.d.d.  moves on to the next entertainment value.   I guess it is a statement toward the  ''goldfish'' mentality that has been groomed in the west.    Ole Dammegards comments appeal as real, speaking to conscience, which has been opted out for  fast graphics and quick punchwords.    Grooming in this manner began a long time ago... now the elite can get away with anything as they have groomed the public  goldfish mentality and desensitized the conscience for a very long time.

            Great message. We all need to echo these sentiments, and encourage the good people out there, to do something, and to know that the great majority would be behind them. also, I hope if there are some law men and women out there, they will take the time to commend some of the work being done here. Not mine, i am pretty new here, but some people have been doing epic work,  and should  be recognised for it. That officer that made the Canadian arrests pointed out, that we all need to help, and we can do something about this, if we do not feel so alone about it.  We are not here for political reasons, we are just moved by deep concern.
