<blockquote>
<p>The husband of Nu-Skin co-founder Nedra Roney McKell, Robert McKell faces charges of two counts of object rape and one count of forcible sodomy and two counts of violation of protective order. His accuser is none other than his adult adopted daughter, Summer; and the case is being heavily pursued by Utah County deputy attorney Sherry Ragan.</p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Summer has been implicated by a young girl who claims the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Summer’s adopted brother River was aided by Summer herself, who allegedly violently held down the girl. These alleged crimes are said to predate Summer’s allegations against McKell. Also, Summer’s claims against McKell apparently mirror the allegations against herself, thus making it appear as if Summer used her involvement as a boilerplate for her insinuations against McKell. It also further calls into question her integrity as the only eyewitness against McKell.</p>
<p>According to McKell, the revelation came during a recent interview between the young girl and McKell’s private investigator, who immediately reported the abuse to the authorities. The sex abuse this girl had suffered had already been known and adjudicated, with River being convicted. But Summer’s allegedly holding her down and injuring her were seemingly new developments. That is, until the investigator was informed, upon his reporting, that the girl’s counselor had reported it to Utah’s Department of Children and Family Services approximately a year earlier.</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting. The investigator was purportedly told in a follow-up call to his initial reporting that no investigation was warranted as it had been looked into before and the case was “locked,” a term we are informed is most often used when someone within DCFS has some personal involvement in the case. However, there is no such involvement.</p>
<p>Even more concerning, DCFS now reportedly claims that the girl’s counselor never reported it to DCFS and that the employee who talked with the investigator was absolutely mistaken. DCFS claims it will address this with the employee.</p>

            NuSkin uses placenta extract and swears it's not human though the FDA doesn't require labelling for that sort of thing. There was a huge scandal when that was discovered in the 80's or 90's. I would check for PP connections to the company, or Haiti, why the fuck not.

             Q: They use placenta in their products.  I liked that stuff when my mom had it back in the late eighties.
I'm not saying this is bad, just a heads up in case you're not down with this type of thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             A: 'Thank you for contacting Nu Skin Product Support. To address this
question, Nu Skin does NOT use human placental extract (HPX) from
aborted placental tissue. Nu Skin's source of HPX is derived under
stringently controlled conditions from full term human placental
tissue. HPX is a phenomenal ingredient which offers a rich source of
proteins and mineral salts, which are beneficial to the skin. HPX is
used in the HPX Hydrating Gel because it is an excellent moisturizer
and emollient. Emollients are ingredients that soften and smooth the
skin.'

              But make no mistake: Nourish the Children is not a charity. It’s a business for Nu Skin and distributors like Kipp, who are paid commissions and get credit toward their overall sales quotas for their VitaMeal sales. They also get a nonprofit’s charitable-donation tax receipt for any VitaMeal purchases they donate to others. The company didn’t answer our questions about VitaMeal economics or many other questions about its antihunger business.

              A limited hangout or partial hangout is, according to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Victor Marchetti, "spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."

             I also think of it as a type of pop-up psyop.  That is, designed to pack up and disappear quickly when a task is completed or the cover completely blown to the point of being ineffective.

              Further down in the Wikipedia entry is I think the most interesting history of this expression, which comes from Watergate:
             </p>
             <p>
              PRESIDENT: You think, you think we want to, want to go this route now? And the — let it hang out, so to speak?
DEAN: Well, it's, it isn't really that —
HALDEMAN: It's a limited hang out.
 DEAN: It's a limited hang out.
 EHRLICHMAN: It's a modified limited hang out.
 PRESIDENT: Well, it's only the questions of the thing hanging out publicly or privately.
             </p>
             <p>
              And with this we understand that "limited hangout" does not refer to "hanging out" in some place for a limited time, but rather hanging out one's dirty laundry to some limited extent for others to see.

                Sorry to sidetrack from your thread's topic for a mo... so when people say here, that there's a rumor of pizzagate being a limited hangout, it's just the short way of saying that this was controlled from day 1? (something to which I disagree, for the record)

            What do think about his bro's claims, or if you're into LTV, George's alter (he's not, though acton is really good at drastically changing his look), that this is all about manipulating the stock market? He could have just been trying to muddy the waters, or even provide controlled opposition, but he was hinting about trish and goodman's portfolio and that this could be a scheme to manipulate the market through hysteria or a terrorism scare, the Charleston thing, according to Dave Acton and his healing waters of mt shasta, being some sort of test

             I haven't followed his brother for a while.  There may be some truth to the claims about the stock market, given the push on the web for cryptocurrencies.    But I think things go much deeper and broader than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: with the resources and manpower being put into all of this, these people are looking for a number of different outcomes on a number of different levels.  It's how the military works and operates, anyway.

              Just thought I woul let you know George had his hearing over his phone calls with Port Authority of Charleston warning where he was subsequently arrested fro bogus charge. The Charleston Port had located the containers belonging to the Awans on the Maersk as he had stated and they were removed due to radiation.
             </p>
             <p>
              They were forced to admit he was right about everything including the diplomatic passport immunity shipping loophole which is shipping illegal black arms into the country...I.e. Awan brothers. His work was a huge reason Imran Awan was arrested. He is working with NYPD, FBZ field agents an insider intelligence agents. The judge listens to his case and found out the FBI had pinged him unlawfully, then omitted their involvement at all. The judge and the Prosecutor was disgusted by the FBI behavior stating violation of constitutional rights and dropped the case immediately.

               Oh, and here's George going for a stroll who just happens to bump into Maria Bartiromo who interviews him.  Yeah, that's riiight. He mentions it at about the 1 minute mark.

              <p>
               And here's George just outside of the Fox building.  In this little video he reiterates that he does NOT want Hillary Clinton prosecuted

               and I wonder what I would find if I dug a little into her background.  And she was very memorable at the Al Smith dinner as television viewers saw her just behind Donald Trump (remind you of any other recent videos of someone in a similar strategic position?) in her plunging red dress and striking white gloves:

               because of this little exchange, I've come to the conclusion that we are being given breadcrumbs and people like the Awans are being thrown under the bus to protect the people higher up, in both parties.

               I followed George for a while, and I agree that he has been a valuable contributor to our knowledge base - though not all the time.  And there were times when I felt that the internet forums were directing what was happening with him.  But in collaboration that is what happens anyway, as people feed off each other.
              </p>

               However,  read the wikipedia definition again of a 'limited hangout'.  I certainly don't dismiss everything Webb says or does...HOWEVER..
              </p>
              <p>
               I recognize 'game theory' tactics in some of the twists and turns of the saga, especially when new characters like Goodman (of Spiderman renown), Trish the Dish, Brainy Blonde, Queen Tut et al enter the equation stage left.  I see the 'script', the 'characters',  I can sometimes predict the plot twists,  so that familiar feeling of video games and/or a theatre play makes me consider the possibility of reality mixed with fiction, which means an intelligence element.
              </p>
              <p>
               Does nothing in my post about 'Trish's' previous employment at least give you pause?

                Yes. He was talking about the Pakistani ISI Spy Ring called the Awan brothers back 8 months ago. He wrote letters to congress, called them and finally went to their offices personally in Washington DC and gave them notice that a Pakistani Spy Ring was inside the US government systems. He filmed this explaining this could be a Nation Security Issue. They did nothing. He also is the one who found Imran's house where he spoke to the marine who stated he rented the house from Imran. He found inside some cabinets laptops, 20 blackberries, routers, etc.  They had government markings. The NCIS took them.

                 , he's done a ton of work.  I started watching him when he was looking for Eric Braverman.  Like, on Day 2.  He tried hard in that topic and then took off where leads took him.  I am not always the quickest study so some of his stuff went way over my mushy head.  I couldn't always keep up but, I'll tell ya what.  I admire his tenacity and efforts, and his ability to forge forward in the face of detractors.  I'm pleased to see his efforts paying off because, in the grand scheme, he's helping the entire country through his investigations.  Thank you for sharing what you did, too,

              Dave's a trip. Him and his resume, which is all over the place, is why I started to pay attention to Webb in the first place. It's hard not to think, considering he's for sure more than just a tech security admin guy for IC and the military (the guy's worked for stricom, the nsa, claims to have worked for cia, and he changes his look drastically from time to time), that acton is a part of this "school play" as well, sort of the the Jachin to Webb's Boaz.  Anyway, yeah, I agree that's something broader is going down. With all the plays and the players that've taken over the internet, beyond just the webb show, sure seems like something more than market manipulation is about to go down.

            "most large pyramid schemed companies are founded by the CIA."
           </p>
           <p>
            That might explain the George Webb limited hang-out because I'm now almost positive it's the CIA turning state's evidence on itself ...........which is insane all on its own but this is the CIA after all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA is turning state's evidence on itself?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep, at least that's the only conclusion that fits given the CIA started Wikileaks and used it to release John Podesta's emails and thereby nuke Hillary's campaign.

             That could very well be. GW is simply a bizarre phenomenon. His background is incoherent and he is obviously something completely different than the person he has portrayed himself as. You have to assume he is from the intelligence community.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I actually think he is much more than a limited hangout- perhaps he is the edge of a civil war within our intelligence communities, with white hats sending him on the streets and feeding him information, and black hats also feeding him (rather than eliminating him), so that while he uncovers many facts, he is also coopted into promoting some falsehoods. This, for now, may be what is preventing his demise. But I can't imagine they will allow this to continue indefinitely.

              GW is a school play but he means well. From his standpoint I'm sure he rationalizes his role as at least at step in the right direction.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I'm sure the CIA rationalizes their decision to shit can Her Thighness also as a step back from the edge of insanity which that mother fucking woman most certainly personified.

               I disagree. He's a manipulative liar and is mentally unstable. I don't agree with your CIA theory, especially regarding Wikileaks but you have the right to believe what you want.

               Yes, I've heard she has Parkinsons.

              It's not all bad. I think the plan is to slowly tear down the massive security apparatus around the JTTF which is basically untenable now that the CIA has stopped funding Muslim terrorists.

             <p>
              It could be some other program that's sacrificed though. Maybe it's part of DHS or maybe Dyncorp will be the burnt offering to the American people.
