            The whole situation seems a bit strange.  It is a Friday night, May 24.  You would think that there would be more people there to eat, if it is a popular place as we are led to believe.  If a school bus is till making the rounds, it must not be too late in the evening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, what strikes me as odd is that there are is no outdoor lighting, which means it is not very inviting.  It does appear as though the two ping pong players are look outs and they don't want the place lit up.

             James Alefantis said the reason he had the ping pong table outside was because when they first opened they weren't doing well and he wanted A.  to draw attention to the place and B.  To let people know they could play ping pong there.  It became popular about a year or two after it opened.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think he said this in an interview well before pizzagate broke.  Found it.  He said that in a Washington Post article about the neighborhood commission hearing about the table outside.
             <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/07/AR2008050703433.html">
              http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/07/AR2008050703433.html
             </a>
             .   The first Washington Post review of the place said it was not an immediate hit when it opened in 2006, the food was inconsistent.  But the review was done 9 months after they opened and they got 2.5 stars out of 4 which is a great review for a casual neighborhood place.  I'm sure they did very well after that review.

            In the version played 5 months ago Frank Wintseads comments about this video refer to the traffic hazard, not anything sinister. I can't make out the kids words. I do note that Frank's video made before the 5:00 opening time (assuming that's what it was back then) but staff coming in 2 hours before opening is common in a restaurant this size. So Im back where I started, deadend but thanks to all just the same. Sifting thru evidence is a tedious task.

            find out who the two guys playing ping pong names are , this would be interesting to see what their "jobs" are or were.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they were there "manning" the place, maybe we will get lucky and find out they work for CIA or somebody like that.

            Interesting that they were, in fact, allowed to have a ping pong table on the sidewalk for use on a busy street even years back. Most businesses would not be allowed period. So they had power for quite some time in Washington. How long has this been going on? Makes u wonder. Yes a kid is screaming but it's hard to figure out where exactly and why. So many question and few answers.

            , the "deleted by user", I found this, something that struck me too ---
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The most recent pizzagate update from Titus Frost recommends another look at the children-screaming-in-Comet video, which for many reasons was easy for me to write off. At least until recently. The more evidence we have of the very seedy activity around Comet, the harder it is to ignore this video.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, my final resistance died when I took another look at the video, and saw the family walk by. The father and the rest look straight ahead, past the guys playing ping pong, UNTIL another sudden yell can be heard, coming obviously from a child. The video source is across the street, so how can we know for sure where these screams are coming from? I was beginning to assume the sounds came up through the grates in the street, that the children were in the tunnels below. But this father hears the scream and jerks his head looking directly into Comet's front windows. The men keep playing as if nothing was happening, and finally the father turns back and continues on, possibly comforted by the ping pong player's non-reaction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing to note: the men outside at one point let out a yell while playing. Form this, you can tell that the yell and the screams do seem to come from the same general direction, and the difference in volume very much fits with the yell coming from outside, and the screams from behind glass (inside Comet).
            </p>

             I believe the theory that the camera is on the floor picking up sound from underground and the traffic sound is blocking it out for most passers by.

            This is a 10 year old video made by Frank Winstead I believe who was opposing some changes CPP wanted to make in its operations before a City Council meeting. He was threatened in a rather vicious way by Max or Mike Macoby sp??? who was Alefantis' lawyer. This video is a deadend. The evidence against Alefantis for being a trafficker is weak to nonexistent and we need to change our tactics until better evidence comes forth.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, he is a big time promoter of pedo subculture and makes a good living providing a venue for that subculture to play out. I don't  doubt he has crossed the line in his personal life with teenage boys but no one has come forward except a former employee who was over 18 and who was not well treated by this community. And Carole Greenwood's solution to the alleged  sex with her teenage son was to runaway instead of suing his ass. I wouldn't be surprised if  Alefantis procures rent boys for the elite in Washington as he is remarkably linked to both high brow society and low brow dregs. But there is still no evidence and I firmly believe  Alex Jones was forced to make amends to avoid litigation.  His 180 degree turn had all the hallmarks of an out-of-court dispute resolution
           </p>
           <p>
            A pedo subculture poses a danger to society greater than the actions of one man like Alefantis. It must be stopped. The extent of it is breathtaking and it has disturbed me to the core, how could we have been so unaware of this insidious cancer on society?.

            Seriously though I'm not joking. Yes it looks sketchy but there is no unambiguous evidence of foul play here. My guess is that kid was screaming because a lot of kids that age can't walk past a Ping Pong table and not want to play.

            Remember people are innocent until proven guilty. I was just like you in the beginning but I'm now almost positive CPP and JA are totally innocent. What's worse is anyone who accuses them of a crime opens themselves up to being sued for libel.
           </p>
           <p>
            CPP and JA look very much like a psy-op or red-herring. That's what you're picking up on. There is definitely something out of the ordinary going on but that's the whole point.

             DarkMath, How can you possibly say that Alefantis is innocent. Lawfully he is until proven guilty but he is up to his eyeballs in pedo culture and at the very least he is suspicious for actual acts of unlawful pedo activities. To say you're positive he is innocent means you think he is above suspicion and that's not the case.
            </p>

              Because CPP is a psy-op and a red-herring. I think we've been over this before. All the "evidence" was so in your face it was too obvious. CPP is a psy-op get over it.

              Presenting what very much looks like 2 parents dragging their 4 year old child past two people playing Ping Pong would get laughed out of any Grand Jury in America. Are you even American? If you were the prosecuting attorney you would probably have to move to another jurisdiction because your credibility would never recover. You'd be known as the Prosecutor who couldn't litigate their way out of a paper bag.

              Gay men don't hold anything back. Sorry. I don't make the rules. In fact they used those very words above to associate U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's name with infamy. The result is that Rick Santorum is a laughing stock and has ZERO electability.

              Being homosexual isn't a crime. Sex acts they're into aren't a crime. Your ignorance of that fact helps greatly to discredit Pizzagate as a bunch of bigots. In fact you are so out in left field I've long suspected YOU are the shill here because your "All Gays Are Evil!(tm)" and "It's The Jews!(tm)" are two of the most efficient ways to destroy our credibility.

              Added: I vaguely remember some comments (maybe) - specifically related to this video - about CPP being connected to the building next door. Where there might have once been a gap between is now filled in. I wasn't able to find anything about that in an OP, but maybe it's mentioned in the comments on one of those links.

              Could the scream be coming from the bus?  Could there be kids on the bus that were there for nefarious reason?  Entertainment perhaps?  Might have been tied and a scream got out.  It seems he goes to bus right after scream and then moves away and bus leaves.  I have been wondering about this for awhile.  Could a window have been open and he closed it or went to make sure that someone on the bus was taking care of business?  I cannot hear a definite word, just a cry out.

                Yes, this should definitely be a red flag to any PG follower or people on the verge of being red pilled.  SWAT teams in DC are probably all involved.

               If you watch the entire video, you'll notice the child screams multiple times. Every time, the sound is exactly at the exact same level, which would mean that the child's position has not changed, If it was the child that is passing by with their parents, the screaming would have been lower in volume since they would have to have been some distance away. First scream for "help" at 0:16... When the passers by get in front of the restaurant at 0;38 and 0:42. The man holding a toddler turns around and stares, almost wanting to stop and check what's going on, but decides to continue when he sees none of the ping pong players are making a fuss or seeming to panic. That's why I say that they are probably there as watchers/guards.

                Yes, I agree that the players could be there  as watchers, but I keep thinking the scream is coming from the bus.  I agree there is more than one scream, one longer one and a couple shorter ones.  I could watch this for hours and always hear screams but change my thoughts about other things  It seems JA goes to the bus to do something.  Then backs away when it leaves.

                 Yes. I saw that too and I thought they could be delivering a child that is getting off that bus, but then, where would the child be going? Next door? It's possible and that would be why we don't see anything after the bus pulls off to leave. However it could also be the player going behind the bus to retrieve the ping pong ball that could have flown in that direction. So there is no way for us to tell for sure from that video. But it looks suspicious and the screaming for help is real. It makes my skin crawl (grrrr).

                  Forgot to mention that I have thought the bus might be picking up children from the back of CPP out the back door onto the bus.  The bus comes around and drives past, showing JA that they are on their way.  The kids could have been there for who knows what.  I shudder to think.  When the bus stops or slows down JA or someone goes to it when the scream is heard.

                    Duh.  I am back to square one.  This sure is perplexing.  Does anyone think that JA is one of the people out front?  Since there is supposedly no basement, where are they coming from, the screams I mean

                    Math just commented about Playing Ping Pong on the sidewalk.  WTH?  We can't even ride our bikes on sidewalks anymore nowadays.  But if you are JA who's going to say No.

                     Btw, you see all those downvoats coming from nowhere all of a sudden on our comment thread? That's equineluvr, but I got downvoating power back, so they'll get the same treatment. They don't like me because I've called them out for the antisemite shill shit they are. They're here to divide us and make us look like nut cases.

                      I know I got it yesterday from donkey-whatever last night.  Sometimes they make good points and them they go off on their rants.  I hardly ever respond, but lost it yesterday.  It is so obvious what they are trying to do, that it is almost laughable.  It is a joke.

                  Mine too and they are as guilty as all get out.  I wish we had all the expertise of LE available to us.  But they are compromised as well.  I am sure there is LE on here and some of the Alphabets as well.  There are some that really would like to help us but their hands are tied.  I will not be able to get this out of my head all day.

            Clearly. And the guys playing ping pong at the front look like they are watchers/guards. To make it look like "ah, nothing to see here" for the passers by.

             Do you not understand that this is a restaurant open to the public?  And has been for a decade.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not some super secret place and never has been.  Several pizzagate folk have gone to dinner there.  They didn't have to know some secret password.  They just went there and had dinner.
            </p>
            <p>
             And putting a ping pong table in front of your restaurant would attract attention.

              A restaurant front where you can hear a girl screaming "help" 3 times is NOT just another pizza place. Frank Winstead was right.

               You're fantasizing.  You've built this place into a house of horrors that needs lookouts, when anyone could have simply strolled through the door.

               Frank Winstead was there filming and he just ignores a child screaming help me?

              <p>
               The family walking down the street ignores the cries for help?
              </p>
              <p>
               Face it, you have no idea WHAT the child is yelling or WHY they are yelling it.

               I hear ”Daddy" as what child is yelling
