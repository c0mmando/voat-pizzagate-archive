<p>Grandma: Why Yes Dear, Of Course!</p>
<p>You: Grandma, do you believe there is a Satan?</p>
<p>Grandma: Why Yes Dear, Of Course!</p>
<p>You: what did you think of the election? was it unexpected outcome?</p>
<p>Grandma: yes very unexpected </p>
<p>You: Did you know that Hillary blames FBI director James Comey and the leaked emails for her loss?</p>
<p>Grandma: ok</p>
<p>You: did you know that not only were Hillary\'s emails leaked, but also the DNC Democrats National Committee, and also Hillary\'s aid John Podesta... Do you know who John Podesta is?</p>
<p>Grandma: no</p>
<p>You: John Podesta used to work for Bill Clinton in the White House. Now John Podesta works for Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>Grandma: oh, ok</p>
<p>You: well, when John Podesta\'s emails got leaked, there was some very scandalous stuff in there. basically we figured out what they use to blackmail our politicians.</p>
<p>Grandma: oh? hows that?</p>
<p>You: well, lets say theres a husband and wife, and the husband is having an affair with another woman, and someone finds out about the affair and threatens to tell the wife unless the husband does something. this is how they blackmail politicians. they put them in compromising situations, and then document it, and use it to blackmail politicians. these are some very bad people.</p>
<p>Grandma: oh, ok</p>
<p>You: Grandma, do you remember when i asked if you believe in God?</p>
<p>Grandma; yes</p>
<p>You: Grandma, do you remember when i asked if you believed there is a Satan?</p>
<p>Grandma: Satan get behind me!</p>
<p>You: Grandma, these people who are blackmailing our politicians are Satanists</p>
<p>Grandma: what?!</p>
<p>You: Yes, and Obama is implicated as well. i had such high hopes for him... This has become the scandal that is now known as &quot;Pizza Gate&quot;</p>
<p>Grandma: What?</p>
<p>You: &quot;Pizza&quot;, you know, like a slice of pizza?</p>
<p>Grandma: ok</p>
<p>You: and Gate, like &quot;Water Gate&quot;, the scandal during Nixon?</p>
<p>Grandma: oh yeah!</p>
<p>You: yea, so its called &quot;Pizza Gate&quot; and you will be soon hearing about it on the news. However, the news will tell you that this is &quot;fake news&quot;, but Grandma i promise you &quot;Pizza Gate&quot; is real, and it gets much worse...</p>
<p>Grandma: what?</p>
<p>You: yes it is very scandalous. these are some very bad people. have you read the Book of Revelation?</p>
<p>Grandma: thats the hardest Book to read</p>
<p>You: you can read it in a single sitting... but anyway, in Revelation 3:9 Jesus talks about the &quot;Synagogue of Satan&quot; and how these Satanists claim to be Jews but are not Jews. </p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm</a></p>
<p>You: Yes, Grandma, the stuff that came out in the John Podesta emails is very scandalous. it would be very difficult for me to summarize the depth of the depravity in a single sitting, but let me assure you that the evidence is abundant. the evidence is so clear that this is the reason Hillary lost the election. this information got out on the internet and people turned against Hillary. </p>
<p>its very real, Grandma, I\'ve seen a lot of evidence and I\'m still looking into it, but from what i have seen so far its very bad. and the mainstream media will tell you that it is &quot;fake news&quot; to try and cover it up, but i have seen too much...</p>
<p>Do you want to know why they call it &quot;Pizza Gate&quot;?</p>
<p>Grandma: sure!</p>
<p>You: its because in the realm of pornography, &quot;Pizza&quot; is slang for &quot;Child Pornography&quot;... </p>
<p>actually, its &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot;, because it has the initials &quot;CP&quot;, but often shortened to just &quot;Pizza&quot;</p>
<p>so, in order to create CP, or child pornography, there must be someone taking picture or videos of people raping children. this is very scandalous. so consequently, anyone who engages in raping children during the production of child pornography is easily blackmailed</p>

           You: its because in the realm of pornography, "Pizza" is slang for "Child Pornography"...
          </p>

           actually, its "Cheese Pizza", because it has the initials "CP", but often shortened to just "Pizza"

            YES. We need the baby boomers and greatest generation on our side in this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note when talking to younger people about pizzagate: Know your audience!
           </p>
           <p>
            Person you're talking to is nonreligious? Start off by explaining how this a sex trafficking scandal. Focus on the emails, Haiti, Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Person you're talking to hates republicans? Start off talking about how this is a BIPARTISAN issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            In most cases, if you start with the satanism and then go rambling off into other conspiracy territory, you'll lose them. PLANT THE SEED OF DOUBT IN THEIR MINDS AND LET IT GROW. Just my opinion.

            ...so, there are some people who look at child pornography online, but when they go looking for it, they find it on websites that are run by the FBI
           </p>
           <p>
            so the FBI approaches the person they caught looking for child pornography, and blackmail them into becoming an informant.
           </p>
           <p>
            did you know that J Edgar Hoover kept a file on every Congressman and Senator for the purposes of blackmail?
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: oh, yes! J Edgar Hoover was a shit bag!
           </p>
           <p>
            You: Yea, so they still do that. they keep a file on every politician, for the purposes of blackmail... Do you remember when ObamaCare went to the Supreme Court and everyone expected John Roberts to rule against it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: oh yes!
           </p>
           <p>
            You: well, John Roberts didn't rule against it, and there were rumors at the time that he was being blackmailed. we never found out how they were blackmailing him, because he went along with their demands
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know that Justice Antonin Scalia was found with a pillow over his face?
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: really!?
           </p>
           <p>
            You: yeah, supposedly he was summoned by Obama to the White House and given a manila envelope full of evidence implicating him in a pedophile ring. 9 days later he was found dead at an uber-private resort that allegedly functions as a pedophile bordello.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you have any idea how many kids go missing in this country every year?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, did you know that the FBI has jurisdiction over every kidnapping case in America? and yet they seldom ever seem to solve any of them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know that Lindberg kidnapping was a hoax, and that after that hoax the FBI was given jurisdiction over every kidnapping in America? Yeah, so murder is a state crime, but kidnapping is a federal crime. go figure. the FBI is given jurisdiction so that they can bury every kidnapping case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Johnny Gosch? the paperboy from West Des Moines Iowa who was kidnapped? he was the first missing person to ever have their face on a milk carton... it was a huge story back in the early 80's
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: oh yeah!
           </p>
           <p>
            You: Well, the good news is that he is alive! Yes, his mother keeps a blog at
            <a href="http://johnnygosch.com">
             http://johnnygosch.com
            </a>
            and she describes how he came to visit her in the middle of the night, years after he had gone missing...
           </p>
           <p>
            today, Johnny Gosch is living in Washington DC and is working as a gay male prostitute for the elite and our politicians. He is using the assumed name of Jeff Gannon.
           </p>
           <p>
            apparently, Johnny Gosch was smart enough to stay alive one day at a time until he became an adult and was no longer desirable to pedophiles. but he kept servicing the elite, but now as an adult male prostitute.
           </p>

           <p>
            You: so, this blackmail ring is only able to blackmail people with the most scandalous dirt. a lot of what they know isn't scandalous, but sex with underage minors is very scandalous...
           </p>
           <p>
            so that is the reason there is such a high concentration of pedophiles in Washington DC... its because the pedophiles are most easily blackmailed, because pedophilia is the most scandalous
           </p>
           <p>
            You: so now you know why they call it "Pizza Gate"...
           </p>
           <p>
            its because we have discovered the mechanism of control and how they blackmail our politicians. with "pizza"
           </p>
           <p>
            yes, it seems Obama is implicated. Obama likes little boys, which are referred to as "hot dogs"
           </p>
           <p>
            and Hillary Clinton seems to like "walnuts", which is slang for a little girl, because a walnut looks like a little girls genitals...
           </p>
           <p>
            Joe Biden is implicated. Thats why you see all those cutesy Joe Biden memes on Facebook. thats to coverup Joe Biden's name in Pizza Gate...
           </p>
           <p>
            so when you see the content and context of the Podesta emails and they are talking about "pizza", "hot dogs" and "walnuts" you know they are talking about sex with minors and even babies.
           </p>
           <p>
            one particularly disturbing video is of a man describing "putting down" a newborn baby. a pregnant woman had been brought in and she gave birth and these pedophiles raped this brand-newborn baby and then they killed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            this is where it gets into things like "Spirit Cooking".... which is a Satanic ritual... that all of these people are participating in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kanye West went on a couple of rants during his concerts and they locked him up in a psych ward and said he was "exhausted"
           </p>
           <p>
            Kanye West didn't actually say anything about Pizza Gate, but the mainstream media will probably say something about Kanye and Pizza Gate being "Fake News"
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: Who is Kanye West?
           </p>
           <p>
            You: He's the New King Grandma. you know, like Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson were called Kings?
           </p>

            Grandma: oh i just love when Michael Jackson does the moonwalk!
           </p>
           <p>
            You: oh yeah, he does that during the Billy Jean debut, let me find that on youtube later...
           </p>

           <p>
            You: yeah, so "Pizza Gate" is a HUGE scandal, and soon your TV will be telling you its fake news, but its not fake news...
           </p>
           <p>
            When you hear the TV tell you Pizza gate is fake news, you will know they are lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know what "discernment" is?
           </p>
           <p>
            The best advice i can give is to "Pray Discernment".
           </p>
           <p>
            if you Pray Discernment, you shall receive discernment. that means when someone lies to you, you will immediately know they are lying. discernment is knowing truth from lies. so when your TV lies to you, you will immediately know

            You: these are some very bad people, Grandma. and we need your help to get rid of them... did you know that the rest of the World refers to America as "The Great Satan"?
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandma: No!?
           </p>
           <p>
            You: yes, that is what they think of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Grandman: but why? Americans are good people!
           </p>
           <p>
            You: Yes, there are good people on a plantation, but the plantation owner is a very bad man
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a worldwide problem! Did you know that the Clinton Foundation was implicated in child trafficking in Haiti under the guise of helping orphaned children after the earthquake? they got caught stealing children in Haiti!
           </p>
           <p>
            but this happens all over! also in Hollywood! you know a lot of pornography comes out of hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            also this pedo ring has been outed in England

             Actually I agree. But since the elderly vote counts 10x as much as the young, their opinion matter so much.
We have to prioritize the future of the world over a grandparent's agony. 
Also, the best protection against dementia is social interaction. This may keep grandma sharp, plus you may have something to talk about outside thanksgiving...
