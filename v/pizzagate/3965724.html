              The Trial of the Pyx is a ceremony dating from 1249, formerly held in the Exchequer Court, now in Goldsmiths' Hall. The Queen's Remembrancer swears in a jury of 26 Goldsmiths who then count, weigh and otherwise measure a sample of 88,000 gold coins produced by the Royal Mint. The term "Pyx" refers to the name of the box in which the coins are kept.

             The Trial of the Pyx, which is Latin for chest, was established in the 1248 by Henry III. Today the trials are required by the Coinage Act 1971. In the past the trial was meant to keep a check on any wrongdoing on behalf of those entrusted with minting the coinage. Today the trial is about quality control and ensuring that UK coins produced at The Royal Mint are within the statutory limits for metallic composition, weight and size.

             Back in 2918 I found an ad in the Gumtree which was Dearman looking for someone to help them  sell their Wonderful Slime product in Brighton.  The link is broken but it was this one:

            </p>
            <p>
             I found it from comments on their instagram and YT accounts that they were at Churchill Square selling their slime products:

             I got that from the mobile phone number that was left either on their YT channel oron their etsy page. The Gumtree ad gave a Hove post code for the buisness BN3 8JB which is Sunninghill Avenue.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Dearman appeared on the eBay Business Awards with his children he called himself  'Richard Ford' :

            </p>
            <p>
             Well that matches with a Richard Ford Agency at 63 Sunninghill Avenue, Hove

             Considering the High Sheriff Hove connection, and all the other connections from the recent Hampstead posts which detail the string of company connections I figure we now have a pretty good trail to finish off.

             Saving US Taxpayers Money Stimulates a Joint Venture Between The Sandi Group and Safe Ports

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Sandi Group and Safe Ports are experts in working in emerging markets. Their Chairmen and CEOs, Dr. Rubar Sandi and Ms. Lucy Duncan have known each other for nearly twenty years. Independently they have overcome daunting challenges to deliver large scale projects successfully.
            </p>
            <p>
             Safe Ports and TSG have been inspired by the US military’s renewed focus to streamline costs through more joint planning, coordination, integration and synchronization of logistics across all branches: the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. They decided to join forces and recently established a Joint Venture called Safe Ports TSG in order to work to find innovative new ways to support the war fighter’s logistics needs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Sandi Group is a multi-disciplined, international company with operating entities around the world. TSG and its subsidiaries are global contractors providing security planning, management, training and personnel to large scale, complex projects. TSG has been engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003 supporting US operations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Safe Ports, a Woman owned Small Business, based in Charleston, SC, is engaged in senior level US and international government relations, risk assessment and security planning, defense logistics, including warehouse management, military specification packaging, transportation, equipment resets, and technology. Safe Ports also specializes in sophisticated port security and intermodal port development.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Dr. Sandi is a well know international business leader. The US State Department asked him to join the Future of Iraq group for the post-Saddam reconstruction efforts in Iraq; he is credited with authorship of the Phoenix Plan which is a comprehensive economic development, social and political blueprint for Iraq. He has written many papers relating to security, logistics, economic development, fiscal reform and financial institutional policy for the future of Iraq.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The Joint Venture is headquartered in Washington, DC with operations offices in Charleston, South Carolina and Amman, Jordan.

              In September of 2015, The largest publicly available STEM CELLS bank in the world has opened for business at the BUCK Institute for Research on Aging in NOVATO
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine awarded Wisconsin-based Cellular Dynamics International and New Jersey-based Coriell Institute for Medical Research about $26 million to establish and run the stem cell bank. Both organizations pay rent to the Buck Institute and have staff working on the institute’s Novato campus...
             </p>
             <p>
              The bank is stocked with 300 stem cell lines. Stem cells are seen as a possible regenerative therapy and as a means of generating human tissue for the testing of drug treatments. Embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into any cell type in the body: neurons, heart muscle, skin, liver or kidneys.
             </p>
             <p>
              The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was created soon after then-President George W. Bush placed strictures on embryonic stem cell research due to moral and ethical concerns. However, the Buck Institute won’t be banking embryonic stem cells.

              CIRM has Tony Podesta ties so it is certainly worth knowing all we can about them.

             As Chief Operating Officer at freuds, Rebecca oversees the management of over 200 London-based staff at one of the UK’s largest PR agencies. Joining a then-only 10 strong agency in the early nineties,
             <strong>
              Rebecca’s first accounts were large-scale entertainment brand launches including Planet Hollywood and Nickelodeon.
             </strong>
             These proved the foundations for long-running relationships with global children’s properties and licences such as
             <strong>
              Sesame Street, Enid Blyton Company and Disney.
             </strong>
             Having established an International division at the agency, Rebecca anchored major high-profile campaigns, centred in, or on behalf of the capital for Visit London, London’s 2012 bid and Eurostar. In addition, Rebecca works on a pro bono basis as an Operations Director/Trustee for the Helen Bamber Foundation which is a charity supporting refugees and asylum seekers who have experienced extreme human cruelty, such as torture and human trafficking.

            Christian Aid Worker Danny Pye Has Been Held in a Haitian Prison Since October -

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             .Pye, an American, has been in prison in Jacmel since Oct. 13, 2010. He has not been charged with any crime. The only people who seem to know this are a few friends in Haiti, the country’s Ministry of Justice, newly elected Haitian senator (and former Jacmel mayor) Edo Zenny, the judge that refuses to sign his release, the NGOs with which he’s been affiliated, his wife, Leann, the 22 Haitian children whose only home is the orphanage that he and his wife built — and the U.S. Embassy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pye is not one of the aid workers who flooded into the nation after 2010’s earthquake. In 2003, Danny Pye and his wife Leanne moved to Haiti to start an orphanage. They established the Joy in Hope Ministries in 2008, which now operates 16 schools that teach over 3,000 children. Danny and his wife themselves operate an orphanage, today home to more than 20 children: Mackendy, Evens, Berline, Blanca, Omega, Loudrige, Rico, Chachoue, Lovelie, Toto, Ticarlis, Magdaline, Elinda, Woody, Mackenson, Diane, Nerry, Nesley, Vania, Patrick, Tina, Slendia, Riann.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..No charge was leveled by the judge against Pye. He was only told that he would not be released until he signed over his old assets — which he did, on October 16th. His family was then told he was being held in the court’s custody, pending an investigation. Haitian law allows judges to imprison a person for up to 90 days without charge while awaiting an investigation.

            <p>
             New Delhi, Delhi, India:  The enduring partnership for children between the Government of India (GOI), the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and the United Nation's Children's Fund (UN&gt;ICEF) was highlighted at a ceremony in UNICEF House today.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            UNICEF India Officer-in-Charge Mr. David Gressly thanked Head of DFID India Dr. Charlotte Seymour-Smith for committing US$36 million to support UNICEF's Child's Environment Programme in cooperation with GOI. The funding will help implement safe water supply and rural sanitation projects from 2004 to 2008. DFID's commitment will go directly towards improving the lives of the poorest families across 130 districts in 14 Indian states.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Partnerships are the engine of development," said Mr. Gressly, acknowledging DFID for being the largest bilateral donor partner to UNICEF India's programmes in the last decade. DFID's contribution of US$ 36 million announced today, along with US$6 million from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and US$22 million from UNICEF's regular resources, will allow UNICEF to strengthen its long-standing collaboration with the Government of India to achieve improved child health, learning and well being. The project will assist in achieving this through greater equity and sustainability in rural water supply, and hygiene practices in households and schools.

            I would say all these weird fires are just us noticing something that goes on all the time anyway, but given the frequency and suspicions with which ANY fire remotely connected to something that smells of pizzagate has been posted here over the past three years...I'm not so sure we can chalk them up to confirmation bias at this point.

            Also, there was a record number of military helos in air in the U.S. in the past few days, and Trump dropped that comment about possibly "not being seen for a while" because he was pissing rich, powerful people off.
