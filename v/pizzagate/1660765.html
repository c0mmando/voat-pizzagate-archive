            This one is about a Hillary for America event being catered at brandywine (maybe a venue rather than the street? )

            This one is from a Tara asking if he'd like visitors at brandywine.  He responds inviting her and her baby to dinner 
"John- &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Happy Ash Wednesday! If you are working from brandywine these days and need a break, let me know and the gal and I will arrange a visit. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't have a car but we do walk in rock creek, near pierce mill. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "

            An email to Mary podesta about traffic on and around brandywine
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28371">

            You know.  This one seems weird.  So do a lot of the emails I've read over the past few months.  There's so many women that email him wanting to catch up.  They all seem to be women that are married because they usually mention their husband or their children.  My friends don't email about dinner that often.  We text or phone.  I don't know.  They just seem weird.  They all go something like this: hey John, I would love to get together with you and Mary.  It's been so long.  Maybe you can visit our ski lodge in the Spring.  Nothing is more beautiful than the crisp winter air in the stillness of fallen snow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blah blah blah.  They all seem to kiss his a#%.  It's annoying and weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like this one- who emails something like this? "I saw you running"

            He must live or work on brandywine.  This schedule K1 that he emailed to his 2 kids has brandywine in the address box.  What is this company on the K1?

           <p>
            Here's the brandywine address associated with him.  this is too small to be his main house, right? Is it his office?

           <p>
            Someone sending him a package to brandywine that she says is "so you" but that it's "not a bribe"
You see how they all kiss up?

            Not sure how credible you consider George Webb. But in the late 70s early 80s number of his videos he briefly states something along those lines. Alleging homosexuality=pedophilia. It came off somewhat forced, but I recall thinking 'wtf man?'
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying he believes that. But I'll read/watch some info that is sourced and then suddenly "oh also gay people are bad they help perpetuate this".

            muslims don't believe in insurance. They classify it as "gambling". I'm not sure if they are required to have it in the states.  I doubt it. They are excempt from obamacare because of those religious reasons. I doubt fire and homeowners would be on their list. *edited for spelling

            There was a series of posts in Voat about 5-6 weeks ago or so that drew some ties between shipping and the Clinton Foundation. At least one, maybe more fires occurred immediately after the election. The posts were poorly written and often ignored or downvoted. May or may not be related.

            ive been trying to find information on podestas parents. theres a reason both john and tony are deeply disturbed these things just dont happen theres a cause and effect. his father was a blue collar worker and his mother mary was politically inclined and apparently they had 25 adopted children come into the family which is odd to say the least

            Bernie is a socialist - and socialism is basically the most perfected form of slave society there is.

           <p>
            Now of course just because you are a slave need not mean that you  are a sex slave, but you can become one very fast and very easy.

             I'm not defending socialism but capitalism isn't immune to slavery.  The distribution of wealth and the 1% is a big indicator that we are slaves already.

            Shill, tell us why wouldn't an owner file for fire insurance? Unless it was an act of larson and, you know, deliberately lit then they wouldn't bother - bigger things to worry about.

Not a shill, but it was a Saudi owned house. Let's assume they are muslim. muslims are not allowed to have insurance.  It's considered gambling in the k'ran. Hence they aren't required to have obamacare. Just a thought.

            Propane tanks don't explode without extreme provocation, so that must have been deliberate.  I've seen one been put in burning jet fuel for hours and eventually all it did was vent, it did not blow up.

            The problem is they were tipped off that a police raid was imminent so they had enough early warning to burn their own mansion up in flames. If the feds can't make surprise raids if their every move is exposed ahead of time by traitors within their ranks it's going to be nonstop suspicious fires and we don't get the evidence we want to see and the feds need. Loose Lips Sink Ships as they say.

            Quick google search and I found this article.....

           <p>
            The February 2010 cable, sent from the U.S. Embassy in Qatar to the State Department, asked that the Department of Homeland Security place a
            <strong>
             United Arab Emirates citizen on the terrorism “watch list” because of suspected links to the 9/11 attacks
            </strong>
            . The cable states that the suspect, identified as
            <strong>
             Mohammed Al-Mansoori
            </strong>
            , was being investigated by the FBI because he had associated with three Qatari men who had flown out of the U.S. on the eve of the attacks after allegedly spending time casing the World Trade Center and the White House.

             Propane tanks inside the mansion?  I've never seen propane tanks inside of any dwellings.  They are always outside, although I've never been in a DC mansion.

            This story reminds me of another fire - the fire that burned down the Algerian Embassy in DC (in the Kalorama neighborhood not far from Obama's new digs) that ocurred in January 2001 just before GWB's inauguration.

            Didn't think much about it at the time - it was briefly reported in the news and never really followed up. It burned to the ground and has since been rebuilt. It seemed more significant a few months later, in September.

              Waco is a huge part of all this. 
That whole situation was nuts. Before the media knew better than to cover such things wall to wall. They wouldn't cover it nearly like that now.

            I wonder if the HRC Immigration Lawyer Khan is involved in this. I know he had a weird sex business or club of some form listed at his home address. He also helps a lot of people from the Middle East get into the country, supposedly for large amounts of money to grease the wheels like Clintons. If these rumored DC raids take place soon, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see him go. WOuld actually make me laugh to see him involved. Not one MSM channel would report on it.

              Yes I noticed that. Doesn't matter. I misread the original post and it wasn't this post either. I must be tired! Anyway, there's another post on VOAT about the Texas farm at  an 818 Turkey Run (ams address as this mansion, except in Texas and connected with Bush family) that is also burning

              An early death might actually come as a relief for the anxiety-ridden operative. As posted earlier at rense.com, Fox News reported: “Sussex County (Delaware) property records show (Brock) took out a $273,000 mortgage to buy the pale yellow colonial and carriage house for $606,666 in 1995. As the converted inn, built in 1793, continued to rise in value, Brock refinanced his loan on at least two occasions. Records show he had a $1.44 million mortgage on the property, as well as two more loans against the home totaling just over $500,000. Brock received $1,587,500 for the home on May 25, 2010, in a sale to McLean, Va.-based Vardell Realty Investments.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Fox News report, by Perry Chiaramonte, continued: “The Rehoboth Beach home was torn down months after Brock sold it, amid much community opposition, so the buyer could divide the parcel and build two homes. It remains a vacant lot.” It is beyond suspicious that a 207-year-old historic house, with more than $1 million in resale value, would be ripped down. Realtor Michael Vardell has kept an unusually low profile for a real-estate agent. His addresses varied from Charlestown, South Carolina, to Bethesda, Maryland, and McLean, Virginia, towns that are associated respectively with the U.S. Navy, Walter Reed Army Hospital, and the CIA. Was Vardell involved in setting up safe houses and disposing of the bodies?
             </p>
             <p>
              The house sale was preceded by a property dispute with ex-partner William Grey. That legal conflict diclosed key dates about Brock’s relocation from Rehoboth Beach to the nation’s capital. In 2005 Brock started to date James Alefantes in Washington DC; in 2007 Brock removed some of his belongings to live with his new partner in D.C. while keeping his domicile with old partner Grey, and then in 2010 Grey filed a legal complaint against Brock, who by then had finished moving out the furniture.
             </p>
             <p>
              How does Brock’s time-line correlate with the biggest sex-crime case in Delaware’s history? Perhaps not by coincidence, in 2004, the receptionist at a pediatric clinic in Lewes, just 7 miles from Rehoboth Beach, filed a complaint with Sussex County police over pedophilic acts committed by Dr. Earl Bradley against his underage patients from Dover, Delmar, Easton and Rehoboth Beach. There were other citations, including from a local police officer, as discussed in the Wilmington WBOC news article “Red flags consistently missed for accused pedophile doctor.”

            Good point but you gotta realize they got super sloppy and arrogant. They all probably thought hillary would win and it would be business as usual. And then theres the Wikileaks emails and CPP.

            Upvoat for you. Great find. I'd love it if someone could dig deeper. It would seem like an evidence purge, but it would depend on what happened to the diplomats. Either that or a warning in case The Cannibal Queen wasn't get her share of the blood money. I'd like to know who owned the house previously, who owned it at the time of the fire, who owns it now, what happened to the diplomats, if they have any connections .... in other words: dig, dig, dig!!!!

            Same thing happened with the McMartin case. Kids reported being transported to a mountain estate where they were abused and witnessed even worse.  Ted Gunderson talks about this property in Gunderson Chronicles 2 (on YouTube and elsewhere). The property mysteriously burned down right as the McMartin case was beginning but investigators did find evidence that the property was used for ritual abuse. Gunderson's presentation includes photographs of that property as well the archaeological findings from the preschool. As the kids said, there were tunnels. There were animal bones. There were ritual objects. The photographs are in the presentation. It is well worth a watch as Ted Gunderson used to be high up in the FBI and had knowledge of the other scandals at the time, which he also talks about. So much for the False Memory Foundation, which victims like David Shurter have pointed out is just a bunch of sickos protecting themselves and blaming the victims.

             Do you by chance happen to have a link?  I recently re-read a Mc Martin investigation and don't recall them being transported off campus... only underground tunnels. TYVMIA.

            Amazing find!
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know anything about fires, but the nature of the fire- evenly spread, very large, but still not affecting the outside structure... looks more like someone doused the full inside with flammable liquid.  Seems like a propane tank explosion would have produced less "even" burning.  It's too large to be that perfect.  Also, wouldn't an explosion likely blow out some of the structure?  Again, I have no idea about structure, but something doesn't look right.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know, kind of like the jet fuel of planes triggering a perfect implosion of a couple of skyscrapers and a neighboring building.

             At least, because the occupants were UAE local police, will not have the reigns on the investigation.  FBI, CIA or both maybe?
Then again if there's anything hoakie, they'll be stepping all over each other!

            These people are literally shitting their pants right now. Their Goose was cooked long ago. Burning down a mansion won't matter. There's too much evidence even us lowly deplorables can find. Imagine how much evidence someone with some resources is finding?

             I feel the Satanist are using the Jews to hide behind.....they do horrible shit that gets blamed on Jews when it is really the Satanist who fake they are Jews.   Then the Christians catch the Satanist at stuff and then go on a rampage against the Jews.  This allows the Satanist to get all the Jews to help them because they fear the wrath of the Christians and it allows the Satanist to avoid trouble by letting the blame fall on the Jews.....clever these Rothschilds aint they.....

             Its like heads they win tails they win....lol....but the Jews oh how they suffer lol.

               "have faith that there's going to be some justice served very soon"............That's great to hear. Sometimes it's gotten pretty demoralizing in the past 3 months.

            Yes the suspected CIA paedophile farm where Podesta learnt to slaughter pigs has been covered here before, with speculation it might be 'the farm' alefantis alluded to in talking about one of the infants on his instagram. Its a place that does re-enactments of 18th Century life etc. Go digging/searching voat its all there

             I was just thinking about Turkey Run in a recent post where I mentioned Christopher Kloman, convicted in 2013 to 43 years for pedophilia. (not that he'll serve it since he is a few years shy of 80 by now).  Son of Rev. Dr. Felix Kloman, who was Dean of the Virgina Theological Seminary and Rector of St. Alban's Church at the National Cathedral, WA. 
Christopher Kloman Served on Colonial Farm Board of Mclean with Alice Starr (spouse Kenneth Starr) for 30 years. He was a teacher and a prolific volunteer:
Claude Moore "Turkey Run" Farm, Habitat for Humanity, Deacon, Library volunteer, Rescue Squad, Sailing Foundation for Children
St. John's Episcopol Iglesias San Gabrial Trade School in Consuelo,Dominican RepublicRead
For anyone interested the letters written on his behalf

             James Alafantis' mom? also wrote a letter but it is not included in the sample.

              Turkey Run Farm (now Claude Moore) was a favorite hangout of Kloman's, and used repeatedly by his defenders (among them James Alefantis' mother Sue) to cement his reputation.

               Abusive behavior toward animals is seen as a warning sign in a psychological sense. I think it's a warning sign of anti-social tendencies or something? Either way, HORRIBLE sign.

             After going back through tony pedostas art collection and his house photos what really disturbed me was the teddy bear stuffed toys next to his bed and then i remember from mk ultra survivor and artist kim noble,  there is a teddy bear in one of her paintings with the minimalist painting of what appears to be a ritualistic sex act involving a little girl.  Then theres that Dahmer style looking statue with no head as well as those paintings from i believe a serbian artist who painted what i read is her
Accounts of the serbian war and the children who were raped and murdered? 
The interesting thing is the motif of using tiled bathrooms with a drain.
I feel its synonymous with a slaughter house and i bet my hunch these sadistic psychos butcher children in those " kill rooms" and the tiled rooms are easy to clean of evidence ie. Blood, plasma, flesh , bone dust with a high powered water sprayer. The evidence just goes down the drain . the podesta pig farm Connection makes alot of sense esp. With their interest in spirit cooking

               Gays are supposed to only represent 4% of the population and comparing them in total numbers to the other 96% of the population is faulty reasoning.  How about you look at the percentage of gay men that would move on a boy if given the opportunity?

                No, I am not saying most are women. And what I said is not my opinion, its based on credible research. It's important to remember that a lot of these assaults  on kids are done from a motive of EVIL, not sexual attraction

               Heterosexual men are turned on a fully grown mature woman, it signals heathy female who can give birth to a genetcillay healthy baby. From this males are hard wired to seek females who are tall, wide hips and large breasts - this is a heterosexual man. Anything less does not cause sexual arousal - meaning: heterosexual man like Trump who is into 6ft modells has no predilection to anything other than a mature alpha female. Heterosexual man's feelings toward children are wholesome since there is no visual stimilus of generated by female traits mentioned above. Homosexuality is a deviation from norm, namely Hypothalamus of a homosexual male is abnormally large and unregulated - resulting in perverted unrestrained behaviour.

                 By definition if a man is assaulting a boy he is committing a homosexual act as well as a pedophile act.  A homosexual act by definition is the act of having sex with someone of the SAME SEX.   There is nothing in the definition about age.

              There are hetero and homosexual pedophiles... Alluding to someone being gay isn't really relevant. Boys or girls - it's illegal.

               I totally agree.  I am tired of this type of talk.  We are not on here to dis anyone for their sex or race or religion.  We are here to research and find connections that will put the elite pedophiles in jail, no matter who or what they are.

                I believe it is 100% fact that many of these child trafficking/pedophilia groups are using the LBGT movement as cover.  You saw it with the fake anti-gay protest at Comet weeks ago and it is apparent in the gaslighting that defenders of Comet are employing.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also think that pedophiles are getting married in order to adopt and abuse children.

                 Would not be surprised.  They are a bunch of sick individuals.  We are going to have to come up with something that will protect the children and the LBGTQ group from these perverts.

               It pains me that some of even the most credible researchers do not understand this. My friend is homosexual and is well aware that pizzagate is real and wants all involved to be behind bars. Has nothing to do with being a pedo, it is however a great way for shills to divide us and discredit people.

                There is a direct correlation between pedophiloa and homosexuality. There is a reason why Alefantis was selected as ac high level operative child trafficking? because he fit the bill. If you were to select a man who would be into this sort of monstrocity who would you select? You would play it safe and select a guy like Alifantis. Why do Jimmycomet instagram photos cause so much alarm? It is because we see creepy photos of very young children with homosexual men who do not have children of their own. A link between Alifantis and the chief UN Child orphans oraganisation is Charles Desantis a homosexual - these are leads. It does not mean that a heterosexual couple cannot be into child traffickin - they cam and they are, but we have to address the elephant in the room.

                 No correlation at all. Peds pretend to be gay because it's easier to explain when asked why they don't have a wife and kids.

                  Homosexuality was decreed a crime because of pedophilia. In Soviet Union the word gay or homosexual wasn't even used, instead the word used was Pederast - ancient Greek, boy lover.

             You hide the trail. Right?
Why bother if you have diplomatic immunity? Well someone who works with these people want to hide all evidence as much as possible.

             " why bother getting rid of evidence?".......Because life in prison would be a Godsend for some of these people. Their real fear is ~100,000,000 American citizens waking up to the Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             ~100,000,000 is a pretty large number, when mixed with the highly charged emotions associated with an adult raping a child well............use your imagination.

             Quick google search and I found this article.....
            </p>
            <p>
             The February 2010 cable, sent from the U.S. Embassy in Qatar to the State Department, asked that the Department of Homeland Security place a United Arab Emirates citizen on the terrorism “watch list” because of suspected links to the 9/11 attacks.
             <strong>
              The cable states that the suspect, identified as Mohammed Al-Mansoori, was being investigated by the FBI
             </strong>
             because he had associated with three Qatari men who had flown out of the U.S. on the eve of the attacks after allegedly spending time casing the World Trade Center and the White House.

              You do know 911 was an inside job done in cahoots with Mossad, right? Just checking.

               You do know that 911 would not have been possible if the whole world was not used to Muslim terror attacks?
              </p>
              <p>
               911 would not be believable if the hijackers were radical Bhuddists, or fundamentalist Christians.
              </p>
              <p>
               False flag attacks are only possible when there is some background noise of crime, terror and degeneracy. Importing Islam provides for all three.
