They can drive through without even being inspected. That concerns me.&quot; Politifact editors disputed the claim, but was Williams right?</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/dec/05/roger-williams/mostly-false-roger-williams-claim-lot-trucks-not-i/">http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/dec/05/roger-williams/mostly-false-roger-williams-claim-lot-trucks-not-i/</a>].</p>
<p>The editors say Williams\' claim is false. They interviewed an expert, &quot;Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.&quot; He assures them inspections are conducted on all freight entering the country. He says, &quot;I don’t  know what kind of inspection he means. We don’t allow anyone into the U.S. without some level of inspection.&quot;</p>
<p>But the very next sentence says, &quot;Officials don’t open every car trunk, every suitcase or <strong>every cargo load</strong>, he said, but all vehicles are scanned for nuclear material and some are subject to x-raychecks.&quot; So they DON\'T inspect &quot;every cargo load,&quot; but they might or might not scan it for nuclear material or make an x-ray check. Question: How does that stop child trafficking?</p>
<p>(Incidentally, one of Williams\' congressional staff was injured in the shooting at the DC congressional baseball game.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, a number of border customs agents have been indicted and convicted for taking bribes to allow illegal shipments into the country. One example among many: Jose Cota.</p>

<p>If President Trump renegotiates free trade agreements, a change of strategy may be necessary for those who wish to continue trafficking in drugs and children. Is newly created Amazon ocean freight services a step in that direction? For a company that has a already negotiated a large contract with the American CIA for cloud-computing services, what would be the likely level of oversight of Amazon
ocean freight, Amazon China?</p>

            Looks like their NAMBLA agenda is finally coming into fruition right as Globalism finally wraps its tentacles around our throats. I'm sure that they'll finally upgrade their current human trafficking system and the new one will be even faster and more efficient with open borders and the free flow of 3rd world children.

            Just remember that it started with fag marriage, then progressed to Transfaggotry and pedophilia is the final frontier and has always been their endgame. It's gunna be like the ancient city of Carthage all over again. Just remember who the (((Canaanites))) were. Jewish blood libel was never libel.

             it's also something to think about that the transgender agenda benefits Big Pharma like....bigly. not only do they get to capitalize on pumping insecure confused teenagers full of hormones and surgery, while also achieving the goal of human sterilization, but this also means they have a supply of young people to legally medically experiment on.

             now i might have my tinfoil hat on a bit too tight, but all those Elsagate videos concerning syringes in baby asses had me thinking, that's how they administer hormones. most shots are given in the arm; it's hormones that are given in the ass.

            I don't know if this is related or not, but the Cllinton's and Alibaba of China are pretty chummy.  Imagine all the shipping Alibaba does from China to just about everywhere

            I think they are already doing the shipping of people and maybe the business is so profitable that Amazon wants to join the competition.  Here are a couple of prior posts discussing ships.

            This is how the art is shipped. A law was passed to allow it without inspection. So I am sure this covers certain trucks too. They are lying since THAT is no longer illegal too. They are so good at it.

             Funny how how an insightful and correct answer would be downvoated so quickly. The victims say they are trafficked in shipping containers I think?

             Would thermal imaging not be a cheap and effective way to check all cargo? Seem to do a good job for police helicopters!

                We must keep the faith but not be so trusting for they are wise and foxy. But now we are too. We are hopeful now but should also be awake.
