<p>This post is related to the band PWR BTTM – a gay, punk rock group, that was in the process of gaining some serious traction. It looks like these guys sky rocketed - <strong>which is commonly reserved for entertainment/musicians that are &quot;backed&quot; by the Elite</strong>, got some solid gigs... all up until allegations of sexual assault, possibly involving minors, surfaced this week.</p>
<p>As I dug it started to feel very &quot;Heavy Breathing&quot; ish... And &quot;King Khan and the Shrines&quot;... but even more direct and with a new legal development.</p>
<p>I caught this headline from Drudge: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-pwr-bttm-cancel-tour-20170515-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-pwr-bttm-cancel-tour-20170515-htmlstory.html</a> - This link is the article that was published on Drudge, which was still up on the homepage last I checked. </p>
<p>Another article: <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/music/pwr-bttm-touring-member-quits-bandmate-faces-sexual-assault-allegations-2070894">http://www.nme.com/news/music/pwr-bttm-touring-member-quits-bandmate-faces-sexual-assault-allegations-2070894</a> - This link actually references that it involves minors, specific to the member of the band being implicated - Ben Hopkins is the member of PWR BTTM that is being accused. </p>
<p>So, I started digging. </p>
<p><a href="http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/58/2017/03/PWR-BTTM-portraits-by-Edwina-Hay-0467.jpg">http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/58/2017/03/PWR-BTTM-portraits-by-Edwina-Hay-0467.jpg</a> - This is an image of the band dressed up as Pizza</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PWRBTTM666/photos">https://www.facebook.com/PWRBTTM666/photos</a> - This is the band\'s Facebook image files... some select examples pulled out below. Pizza references on at least 3 occasions. </p>

<p>Since we’re all fans of Mr. George Webb, remember the mangoes?... I thought you may find it particularly interesting that this flashes at the end of one of their music videos. </p>
<p><a href="https://snag.gy/0YDF6y.jpg">https://snag.gy/0YDF6y.jpg</a> - This image states &quot;Too Many Mangoes&quot;, why is this important? It\'s totally out of context from the remainder of the video, and there are a number of links to citrus fruit - specifically, mangoes, being used to hide drug smuggling or perhaps even be a reference/code word for human trafficking. Here is a supporting link to reference the HRC email re: mangos: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6193">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/6193</a></p>

<p>Notice the record label is called “Father/Daughter” records? The logo is that of a man holding a little girl’s hand.

            Excellent detailed post.  You've got a good eye, I saw that NPR show back when it was newly released.  Never saw the pizza pouch until now, as well as the other pizza related images.  Thank you, your work is much appreciated!

             Absolutely. This, like any other foundation post, is only the beginning. If the allegations against the musician are false, then we can chalk it up to a coincidence. However, if true and this unravels further, we should be ready to stay on top of this as it develops. The comments in other articles seem to suggest that there may have been multiple victims.

            Ian Watkins, from Lost Prophets - My children used to like this band, but along with everyone was shocked at the crimes against babies/children this man committed and apparently still does not regret but boasts in it.  After reading the article it says that he seems to have gone off the rails after moving to LA from UK, I wonder who he mixed with in LA? - Looking at the name of the group now, 'Lost Prophets' it would seem to have some connotation or connection with this SRA?  Maybe another lead to pizzagate. Just a thought -

            This is pretty strong evidence against pizzagate. These allegations came out four days ago and now absolutely everybody is dropping  this band like a hot potato -- see e.g.
            <a href="https://theawl.com/nevermind-about-pwr-bttm-2cbd978b2db8">
             https://theawl.com/nevermind-about-pwr-bttm-2cbd978b2db8
            </a>
            -- which is the
            <em>
             exact opposite
            </em>
            of what pizzagate would predict would happen.

             Could you elaborate? How exactly can the namesake of a research project, i.e. "Pizzagate" have the ability to "predict" anything? What does that even mean?
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you basing this off of what happened @ CPP in DC? Because, we're talking about nearly an 180 degree situational difference. This is direct allegations vs. CPP which were indirect/inferred. If children/young adults came out to accuse CPP of abuse and there was evidence/corroboration, you still think there would be a massive out-pour of brainwashed DC leftists showing their support? Do you think CPP/JA would have still been leveraged as the "Fake News" Poster child victims?
            </p>
            <p>
             CPP remains relatively unscathed because of the sheer lack of hard evidence. Circumstantial? Yes! Needs to be explained? Yes! But anything incriminating? (Outside of the alleged files lifted from the PC that was magically struck by a bullet) No!... doesn't look like an investigation will ever happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             So.... yeah, in the world of "Fake News", if these allegations couldn't hold water - PWR BTTM could very well have become CPP/JA Part 2. The victims of "Fake News". But, considering they are being dropped by the label so fast, that leads me to believe there is something serious behind the accusations. Perhaps more than we currently know. Or maybe the singular accusation is true and this is all damage control to preserve their chance of success.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, to say that this is strong evidence "against pizzagate" makes absolutely no sense.

            Please Leave this post up.  There are real leads here connecting many of the alleged individuals implicated in pizzagate.

           <p>
            The connections between Bard University the Podesta Brothers, George Soros and Abramovic are clear and have questionable content worth investigation by this community.
