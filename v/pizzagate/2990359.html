            Singer has powerful friends and is as slimy as they come. He has managed to evade the law and silence any media reports about him. I was hoping that people would vote with their feet when it came to seeing Bohemian Rhapsody, but I don't think enough people knew that he had directed it, even after he was supposedly replaced.

            Yes.  I wanna see him taken down.  I believed from the start that #MeToo was the start of something huge.  It wasn't just women making allegations against grown men. Underage girls alleged Weinstein assaulted them, MeToo lead to what's happened so far with Spacey, which involves multiple underage victims.  Many actresses, like Evan Rachel Wood, came forward about being raped when they were kids.  #MeToo, #KidsToo, let's keep this momentum going.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with many that the consequences for these sickos has been far from enough.  But what has happened is still huge.  Pedos Woody Allen and Kevin Spacey aren't in jail like they should be, but they have fallen from grace.  FINALLY they are losing support and not making films anymore.  The mainstream knows about them now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and Dan Schneider is gone from Nickelodeon!
           </p>
           <p>
            YES these people need far more punishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, this is unprecedented.  This is amazing.

            You are totally right and on spot with this one Bryan Singers pedo empire is coming to a swift end. The thing is will he be properly dealy with or will he just disappear off into obscurity after these revelations? Singer has much more to do with the New World Order paradigm that anyone here can imagine. Could he be being used as a temporary cog in the wheel? Yes, for sure, and most likely, however I do believe that because he has been such an instrumental part of Hollywood propaganda and brainwashing, indoctrination of the populace into the occult art through comics and Annunaki legend programming he will be afforded some luxury of protection and will be allowed to continue his proclivities in other ways. I'm not sure many of you really understand, except for many of us that have endured the entire time here, understand how deeply embedded this satanic/Luciferian element is in Hollywood and what they are trying to do with Zecharia Sitchins Annunaki creation myths, although there are element of these myths in reality the truth is these movies are gearing you to accept that Enki, Lucifer, is really the Lord of this planet and is SERIOUS business considering Black Panther is up for so many awards when the film itself is a psychological usurpation of the energy that Bobby Seale brought to the black struggle through the BPP.

             Lucifer is just an anthromoporphiic rendition of pride and ego, one of the four deadly sins...
There is no external beast ...the beast is us..
When we surrender our wealth to the treasury we give up the ego ..lucifer is defeated..
Till then we surrender our wealth and register it to the war game created by the merchants of venice..
We inusre this game by the social security sytem..ie security for the society..
Christ is the double book entry system that runs both the peace and the war game..
When Christ re turns ..ie reverses ..when we reduce debt at the treadury..lucifer , our pride is defeated ..and we run and become surety to the peace game..

              I do believe there is some crossover from this metaphysical concept of mysticism into the physical understanding of the Annunaki "gods" considering it is their legacy conveyed in these allegories. While I do not doubt that these ethereal concepts do have a place in understanding this paradox we call life, your comment only serves to discombobulate, once again, with highly confusing spiritual BABBLE.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was an entity that has earned the christian title Lucifer, Satan, The Devil, Poseidon, Pan, etc etc.... the Sumerian Enki from the group called the Annunaki that claim Earth as their own slave farming planet. Whether this entity or it's esoteric knowledge is the only thing remaining is still a matter of great debate but I DO KNOW that this is not the time or place for confusing psychobabble about the spiritual aspects of life even though in the long run this kind of stuff does impact our individual lives. But for here, right now it serves very little purpose in this discussion except for it having been said and my having to peel you back a little. Whatever, it was said yes hat kind of spirituality does come into play but what you said seems like some very fluffy hyperbole and I just don't have the time to try and figure out more Jesuit puzzles.

               They hide the debt system in code...thats my point ..
They create these entities as stories ...when in fact they r code for their debt system..and how to farm humans when we choose to be cattle..or chattel..
It is babbel becsuse u r not taught how the debt system runs...
There is actually no money , and thus no debt..its only insurance when we fail to pay that exists as money...a failure to pay is what isnrecorded as money..
And we r the sureties for this system of virtual credit..
U have to read basics of negotiable instruments ...and then understand that the Fed note is insured by us collectively..and that surety runs the fictional debt system..
U can get out of that surety pool and use ones credits to reduce debt ie risk at the treasury..
In the latter case the US becomes ur trustee and debtor...
U wont own anything but only be the beneficiary of assets held by the US ..
What stops us from realising this andnacting upon it is pride...pride runs this world ie the payment system..
We think we own our bank account , our car , our children , home...etc..
Twe actaully loan and register the title with the war jurisdiction of Rome ..
Utube : martial law reversionary interest..
              </p>
              <p>
               One can understand how the merchants run this system or believe in their numerous fairy tales..
There is no special beast god up in the sky ..or down under the ground ..
Look up legal definition of Hell..its a state of debt ..
We r full of pride ..insisting on perfection when we r really debt slaves with no knowledge running atound in the dark afraid of some fictional beast ..
Children r being killed ...by the very same merchant class that have us lending our credit and assetsnto their banking system ..
There are people who take their time reading the legal solution since they know that is the cause and solution of the problems on this earth...including child trafficking and child rape and child snuff rings...
To make that connection one has to humble oneself and then begin to find the legal solution out of the matrix..
..and that solution is to reduce debt and gwin a higher status than the US debt corporation..
..and then be able to instruct the US war machi e to conduct war tribunals against criminals under universal jurisdiction..
Google : universal jurisdiction
              </p>
              <p>
               Only the surety ie us ..can claim universal jurisdiction..
Utube trumps speech at the UN when he rescinded US approval.for international human rights court..

              as to say that he is part of the Q team but I'd really like to hear your speculation on this subject absolutely no judgement I can totally understand why you would think that because he HAS been caught in many oddities and I've definitely noticed the way he attempts to steer focus and guide the narrative along with several agendas.

              Renegade Anon said Enty was legit last year.

              I wouldn’t doubt for a second Enty gets intel from white hats.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe the plan was for blind items to get published so that citizens would start investigating on their own. Which leads to further open source intel since we know people watch this forum.
