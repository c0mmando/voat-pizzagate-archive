            Katy Perry also known as "Kitty Purry" is a well known Pop Star and idol to young children enjoys wearing a pizza print onesie. Admitted to selling her soul to the devil. Most of her music videos contain illuminati symbolism such as the Eye Of Horus, Pyramids and Baphomet. One particular video This Is How We Do is full of references to pizza (child pornography), tacos (vagina), watermelon (semen) and ice cream. She can be seen playing ping pong and also wearing a pizza print swimsuit complete with pizza slice earrings while male dancers are dressed as Pee Wee Herman (the character of a children's TV show who was caught masturbating in a theatre and upon further investigation was found to have child pornography on his computer). Throughout the video pizza slices spelling out "It's No Big Deal" flash on the screen. Another video Bon Apetit involves Katy being prepared, cooked and fed to the elite. She has also been known to give pizza to children on stage at her shows. Once tweeted a picture of herself naked in a hot tub covered by a pizza.

             I guess maybe that depends on how many cards can be filled with the evils.

            Is there a reason you are leaving out Laura Silsby? Also as possible whistleblower victims: Monica Peterson, Seth Rich. Maybe the DNC should get a card mentioning the DNC lawsuit deaths: AG Wisenaut and Process Server Shawn Lucas.

             The cards now feature the top 20 (kind of),  If you have a text for her :) and people agree about it, she will most likely get a card

             Good idea, but then we maybe also need a 4chan and reddit card or maybe group them in a Citizen research card ?

              Yes, I like those ideas. It depends on if the OP wants to have multiple or just one card for the citizen investigators.

            Thanks for posting this and all the work!  Here are some thoughts.   Would appreciate comments!
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              I also think Dennis Hastert should have a card.  For one, he is proof that pedophilia is in the ruling class in DC. and 2. He has a connection with Tony Podesta , and 3.  He is a REPUBLICAN - which indicates that both parties, or the uniparty, are involved.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Possibly a Card for Rachel Chandler a photographer , friends with Epstein , photographed with Bill Clinton, and connection to Hollywood.
Hopefully there would be enough for a card.  I read that she did some strange photography.  Could add that connection to Bill Clinton card.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Jacob Schwartz - DeBlasio's employee and Democrat activist, found with all the kiddie porn on his computer,  photographed with Robbie Mook.  I am sure there is enough info for text, but what pictures are there?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Possibly another artist or two or more.  How  many artist should have a card?  There is Louise Bourgeois who did the Arch of Hysteria . Is there enough info and pics of weird art.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There is Kim Noble, which has plenty of info for text and pics, but she is a VICTIM, most likely.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There is  the mural prominently on display at Comet Ping Pong by artist Arrington de Dionyso. It depicts strange people holding the heads of smaller people.  Could do a card for that artist.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There is Djurdjevic, who does the torturing kids paintings.   Podesta has a large painting  of  one in his living room ..the boy hanging from his arms.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There is the artist (??) who did the cannibal painting Podesta has hanging in is office.

             its useful to have a card of all the key pizzagate players that can be easily be shared ?

            maybe do cards for Jimmy Saville, BBC, and the former BBC head who protected Saville who now runs NYTimes (I forget the name) also, Dutroux and the Château des Amerois Mother of Darkness Castle where "1000 points of light" phrase comes from, mentioned by GHW Bush former President/CIA director during Mena Airport.

            1 Comet Ping Pong (CPP) Pizza restaurant owner; one of the "50 Most Powerful People in DC;" connections to high places including powerful politicians, artists, and lobbyists. Has hosted fundraisers for politicians such as Hillary Clinton. Restaurant doubles as a nighttime party place for all ages and features music by bands such as Sex Stains and Heavy Breathing. Has Instagram account with several images of children associated with money and coded sexual language, such as #chickenlovers. Never officially investigated, never asked pointed questions about his Instagram when interviewed by mainstream media, and so the citizen investigation is huge!

           <p>
            2 One of the most elite men in Washington and one of the most powerful lobbyists in the world. Podesta was in charge of Secretary Hillary Clinton's 2016 election campaign and held fundraisers for her at Comet Ping Pong. His odd correspondence with James Alefantis can be found in the leaked Podesta emails. He is also friends with Marina Abramovic and enthusiastically engages in "Spirit Cooking." Coded FBI pedophile keywords are found throughout his leaked emails. His art collection reflects themes of dismembered people and cannibalism. He received a party invite that kids "...age 7, 9 and 11" would be "in the pool for further entertainment." Brother Tony collects creepy child-abuse art and emailed him saying, "Last night was fun. Still in torture chamber." Tony sent another email saying he was "seated with the kids" on a flight and so was "a little wired." In a leaked email was asked, "Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?"

Lewis Amselem who told her he would be “sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch,” a demon to whom child sacrifices are offered.

             8 American financier and registered sex offender known for paying a parade of underage girls at least $200 to disrobe and rub his feet, back, and legs. Touting his charitable foundation which “supports a wide range of youth initiatives” across the Virgin Islands. Epstein’s prior “youth initiatives” involved sex toys like the “Twin Torpedo” or “Jelly Anal Wand,” as well as “Joy Jelly,” a peach-flavored lubricant. At his 78-acre property in the Virgin Island, known as ‘Orgy Island” and “Island of Sin” Epstien’s foundation entertained pals such as Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Stephien Hawkings. Although his conviction has made him toxic for political donations, his recent contributions included the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Mount Sinai Hospital; the MIT Media Lab; Ballet Palm Beach; the National Multiple Sclerosis Society; and Arizona State University.

                 Bit long (1 ,2 sentences) but probably will remove the scoring points, at the bottom of all cards.

                <p>
                 its not that important(?) and it will create more space for text and pictures, but the design will loose a bit of it's trading card identity (good idea?)

                  As far as the points, I don't know what to tell you.  Would hate to ruin your great design.  Would there be points on the location cards?   Could the points be put along the sides of the pics?  Just throwing out some ideas

                 <p>
                  I think one MSM card would work, as long as Joe and Mika get a pic on it...they have earned it.

                  Also, Epstein island is complete.   I did the text for Little Saint James, but maybe forgot to send it.  Here it is. And it his post stalls out, I might repost again.  Must be the holiday weekend and people are busy.
