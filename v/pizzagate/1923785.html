            “THE ORTHODOX JEWISH TALMUD IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD”!
           </p>
           <p>
            The official unabridged Soncino Edition of the Talmud published in 1935 was “Translated into English with Notes, Glossary and Indices” by such eminent Talmudic scholars as Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein, Rabbi Dr. Samuel Daiches, Rabbi Dr. Israel W. Slotki, M.A., Litt.D., The Reverend Dr. A. Cohen, M.A., Ph.D., Maurice Simon, M.A., and the Very Reverend The Chief Rabbi Dr. J.H. Hertz wrote the “Foreword” for the Soncino Edition of the Talmud. The Very Reverend Rabbi Hertz was at the time the Chief Rabbi of England.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world’s leading authorities on the Talmud confirm that the official unabridged Soncino Edition of the Talmud translated into English follows the original texts with great exactness. It is almost a word-for-word translation of the original texts. In his famous classic “The History of the Talmud,” Michael Rodkinson, the leading authority on the Talmud, in collaboration with the celebrated Reverend Dr. Isaac M. Wise states:
           </p>
           <p>
            “THE TALMUD IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD. During the twenty centuries of its existence…IT SURVIVED IN ITS ENTIRETY, and not only has the power of its foes FAILED TO DESTROY EVEN A SINGLE LINE, but it has not even been able materially to weaken its influence for any length of time. IT STILL DOMINATES THE MINDS OF A WHOLE PEOPLE, WHO VENERATE ITS CONTENTS AS DIVINE TRUTH…”
           </p>
           <p>
            SANHEDRIN, 55b-55a: “What is meant by this?—Rab said: Pederasty with a child below nine years of age is not deemed as pederasty with a child above that. Samuel said: Pederasty with a child below three years is not treated as with a child above that (2) What is the basis of their dispute?—Rab maintains that only he who is able to engage in sexual intercourse, may, as the passive subject of pederasty throw guilt (upon the actual offender); whilst he who is unable to engage in sexual intercourse cannot be a passive subject of pederasty (in that respect) (3). But Samuel maintains: Scriptures writes, (And thou shalt not lie with mankind) as with the lyings of a woman (4). It has been taught in accordance with Rab: Pederasty at the age of nine years and a day; (55a) (he) who commits bestiality, whether naturally or unnaturally: or a woman who causes herself to be bestiality abused, whether naturally or unnaturally, is liable to punishment (5).”
           </p>
           <p>
            This “divine truth” which “a whole people venerate” of which “not a single letter of it is missing” and today “is flourishing to such a degree as cannot be found in its history” is illustrated by the additional verbatim quotations which follow:
           </p>
           <p>
            SANHEDRIN, 55b: “A maiden three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition, and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabits with her, she becomes his. The penalty of adultery may be incurred through her; (if a niddah) she defiles him who has connection with her, so that he in turn defiles that upon which he lies, as a garment which has lain upon (a person afflicted with gonorrhea).”
           </p>
           <p>
            (footnotes) “(2) His wife derives no pleasure from this, and hence there is no cleaving. (3) A variant reading of this passage is: Is there anything permitted to a Jew which is forbidden to a heathen. Unnatural connection is permitted to a Jew. (4) By taking the two in conjunction, the latter as illustrating the former, we learn that the guilt of violating the injunction ‘to his wife but not to his neighbor’s wife’ is incurred only for natural but not for unnatural intercourse.”
           </p>
           <p>
            SANHEDRIN, 69b “Our rabbis taught: If a woman sported lewdly with her young son (a minor), and he committed the first stage of cohabitation with her, Beth Shammai says, he thereby renders her unfit for the priesthood (1). Beth Hillel declares her fit…All agree that the connection of a boy nine years and a day is a real connection; whilst that of one less than eight years is not (2); their dispute refers only to one who is eight years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            KETHUBOTH, 11a-11b. “Rabba said, It means (5) this: When a grown up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (6), it is as if one puts the finger in the eye (7), but when a small boy has intercourse with a grown up woman, he makes her as ‘a girl who is injured by a piece of wood’.”
           </p>
           <p>
            (footnotes) “(5). Lit., ‘says.’ (6) Lit., ‘here,’ that is, less than three years old. (7) Tears come to the eyes again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.”
           </p>
           <p>
            KETHUBOTH, 11a-11b. “Rab Judah said that Rab said: A small boy who has intercourse with a grown up woman makes her (as though she were ) injured by a piece of wood (1). Although the intercourse of a small boy is not regarded as a sexual act, nevertheless the woman is injured by it as by a piece of wood.” (Dildo)
           </p>
           <p>
            (footnotes) “(1) Although the intercourse of a small boy is not regarded as a sexual act, nevertheless the woman is injured by it as by a piece of wood.” (Dildo)
           </p>
           <p>
            ABODAH ZARAH, 36b-37a. “R. Naham b. Isaac said: They decreed in connection with a heathen child that it would cause defilement by seminal emission (2) so that an Israelite child should not become accustomed to commit pederasty with it…From what age does a heathen child cause defilement by seminal emission? From the age of nine years and one day. (37a) for inasmuch as he is then capable of the sexual act he likewise defiles by emission. Rabina said: It is therefore to be concluded that a heathen girl (communicates defilement) from the age of three years and one day, for inasmuch as she is then capable of the sexual act she likewise defiles by a flux.
           </p>
           <p>
            SOTAH, 26b. “R. Papa said: It excludes an animal, because there is not adultery in connection with an animal (4). Raba of Parazika (5) asked R. Ashi, Whence is the statement which the Rabbis made that there is no adultery in connection with an animal? Because it is written, Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot or the wages of a dog etc.; (6) and it has been taught: The hire of a dog (7) and the wages of a harlot (8) are permissible, as it is said, Even both of these (9)—the two (specified texts are abominations) but not four (10)…As lying with mankind. (12) But, said Raba, it excludes the case where he warned her against contact of the bodies (13). Abaye said to him, That is merely an obscene act (and not adultery), and did the All-Merciful prohibit (a wife to her husband) for an obscene act?”
           </p>
           <p>
            Of the “sacred” Talmudic teachings of the “Sages,” preserved since 500 A.D. and taught more widely today than ever before in Talmud-Torah schools in the U.S.A., perhaps nothing better illustrates “fools” with “reprobate minds” than the teaching in the Talmud book of Yebamoth that spittle on the top of the bed curtain proves that a wife has been guilty of adultery, as only lying down face upwards could she have spit up on it. Spitting several feet straight up! The Talmud states: “When a peddler leaves a house and the woman within is fastening her sinnar [breech-cloth] . . . . If spittle is found on the upper part of the curtained bed she must, said Rabbi, go.”

            The first one is just from this year alone.  The other is a full list prior but there many between.  Also there is Molly Macauley who was a scientist, I always wondered how she figured in until a member on here clued me in.  Ah, these wonderful people are so well informed.  Well she worked in relation to the NASA space program under Obama and she discovered that they were probably controlling voting machines with satellites.  I know that sounds kooky but I remember that I read somewhere that our country is always 50 years ahead of where WE think they are.

             Molly was stabbed to death the night after Seth Rich was killed. There is also a link to George Soros. The investigators who were on scene last week regarding Seth Rich in DC are now on scene of Molly Macauley's death including another MedStar hospital involved.

              Organ Harvesting.  Her death has always haunted me.  Yes, I believe it was MedStar and not Howard U. Hosp.  When he did not die, they wanted to get him to a hospital that would do the harvesting, MedStar is set up for their dirty deeds.

up exposing Israel's

               I believe that HRC is currently and has been in the world cabal.x
She  takes her orders from Israel/Mossad and UK and other new world order operatives.
              </p>
              <p>
               HRC being part of the Shadow Government would have acted like Pres. Bush in covering
  up and denying 9-11 facts.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a Clinton Body Count list of course.
I believe Israel  / Mossad was complicit in 9-11.
Israel being part of the New World Order wanted Hillary elected.
That would be the only remote connection here.

               I should not have put this in Clinton body count
as it is quite indirect.

                Nope. I'm doing this for free. And to be brutally honest I'm here to make sure the mother fucking WASPs in the American Aristocracy don't get away with blaming "The Jews(tm)" for everything.
               </p>
               <p>
                And that's what they're doing right now. They're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at George Webb and the Mossad.
               </p>
               <p>
                What's that? How is that blaming Israel? Easy answer. George Mossad Webb is turning state's evidence against Clinton &amp; Co who if you haven't notice are denying any and all blame. In fact they're actively conspiring to assassinate the President of the United States. Trump's relations with Israel couldn't be better. They love Trump. So to them an attack on Trump is an attack on Israel and to a lesser extent Russia. Hillary &amp; Co will do everything humanly possible to blame anyone but themselves for their actions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Hillary &amp; Co is blaming Israel and the World for their mistakes. And that's just plain old fucking wrong.

                I completely understand your point. And kind of agree but I can't totally agree with you. I argue the WASP and Jewish Mafias merely had parallel objectives. That makes it ambiguous as to who's running the show. In 1963 when H.W. Anti-Christ assassinated JFK that wasn't for Israel. That was to allow the American Aristocracy and Military Industrial Complex to grow rich fighting Communism. They said to themselves "Hey Israel will help us fight the Communists courting Arabs in the Middle East. Let's make Henry Kissinger a Mafia Capo in charge of the Holy Lands."
               </p>
               <p>
                To further prove my point I'd say the current toxic Irish Divorce going on between the CIA and Mossad clearly demonstrates it was the
                <s>
                 American Aristocracy
                </s>
                CIA who was in charge the whole time. And more specifically it was Killary Clinton who had been put in charge of the Deep State including the CIA and Israel is now taking her out behind the wood shed and will beat her within an inch of her life. And to be totally honest between you me and the lamp post Hillary might even be given or taking the "early check-out". If she's arrested she'll sing like a canary I'm sure. I think that's why Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.

                 we're on the same team.  will say the following though.  there's a lot of information that JFK was trying to prevent Israel from getting nuclear weapons, and that he had written Ben-gurion on the very issue very shortly before his death (wanting assurances they aren't working on it).  Ben-gurion, rather than respond to the prez, merely stepped down, then the hit occurs.  Shill LBJ totally drops the issue afterwards.
                 <br/>
                 IMO, it's a level beyond Isreal, the uber wealthy zionist profiteers/bankers (many of whom happen to be askhanzai jews) such as the rothschilds, bronfmans, oppermans, etc that use israel, the us (and more and more everyday) to do their bidding cuz of the huge influence (ungodly $, blackmail info, etc) to pull most strings.  Underlings with ties to these groups, such as the bush's and the clintons, and many in govt and intelligence orgs and the military do the bidding.  That includes the CIA.   Rarely are events that occur that we could discuss in these terms that are (or appear to be) done by the US actually in the interest of the US (at least any rationale moderatley long term interest).  There are events that occur that are in the interest of Israel fairly often.

                  "Ben-gurion, rather than respond to the prez, merely stepped down, then the hit occurs. Shill LBJ totally drops the issue afterwards."

                  The American Aristocracy would really love you to believe that but please don't be fooled. JFK may have made an enemy of David Ben-Gurion but Ben-Gurion would never in a millions years put out a hit on a sitting American President especially one as popular as JFK.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've mentioned this before but I was once temporarily a member of the Upper Class before getting unceremoniously kicked out. I went to all the best schools took all the right courses etc etc. I know how the American Aristocracy thinks because I went to school with their sons and daughters for 8 years. And I almost made it financially too so I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  JFK was the first non-Protestant U.S. President and his popularity among the W.A.S.P. elite went south as soon as he took office. JFK was Irish-Catholic. He would object to using poor people as cannon fodder. He also failed to respect the American Mafia who George H.W. Bush had created an alliance with down in Cuba do run an extremely profitable drug ratline and other business ventures. Parts of the American Mafia were the hired henchmen of the American Aristocracy. Read up on the History of the Rockefeller's and the Pinkerton's. It's fucking ruthless.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  JFK was assassinated because he made enemies domestically AND abroad in Israel. In all likelihood Ben-Gurion mentioned to the CIA and/or the Dulles brothers that JFK was bad news. Ben-Gurions voice was added to a growing chorus and the rest is History.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  JFK was Irish but he grew up very soft. He was a playboy from about age 15 onwards. He wasn't a born predator which is kind of what you need to be up at those altitudes for obvious reasons.

                   that there were multiple reasons/interests, we can agree on. i'm not saying ben-gurion put the hit out. hard to get around those facts tho as one (big) reason why orders were given:  JFK didn't want Israeli nukes,he's whacked,  bought and paid for LBJ doesn't care, Israel become a nuclear power.  Also, there's info suggesting that the real brains of organized crime was in the Hy Larners, Bronfmans, and meyer lanskys   i went to college and law school with prep school wasp kids too though not Ivy level.  i know a little of the attitudes you speak of.  not doubting there are plenty of wasps (and plenty of cryptos masquerading as wasps) in the higher levels, but my $ is still on the zionists (including some wasps) doing the real devilish plotting and planning

                    . Matt Damon nails it portraying an overly up-tight American Aristocrat from Yale. He doesn't smile or laugh the entire movie. It's a little disturbing but that's what those people are like. The irony is Matt Damon is a fellow Ivy-League Celt like myself and is about as far from being a true blue blood as I am. The real deal belong to eating clubs and have an indescribable air of innate pomposity that made me a little pissed off and a lot perplexed. Until now that is, these past 9 months have helped me finally understand what it's all about.

                    Regarding Meyer Lansky, he was a genius and saved the American Mafia from itself who were mostly knuckle draggers up to that time. Lansky got them all to stop fighting each other and cooperate. He realized why they got kicked out of Cuba and the only way to recover was to start an entire city from scratch. That Mafia "cut-out" was Las Vegas. Lanksy helped the wise guys wise up. Along with Las Vegas their new found smarts nurtured a relationship with the CIA which turned into a marriage made in heaven. And what a marriage it is. The groom

                     U realize rockefellers are m o t right?   The stuff u write about lansky is well known main stream accounts of which im aware.  Not the whole story.  hy larner was the real power in Chicago.  The bronfmans were huge in prohibition and to this day.  But to conclude, as always illl keep an open mind and it may not be that important whether the sickest and richest are zionists (not neces jewish) or solely have wasp roots

              Bet there are some familiar people that the kids could identify. I'd especially look in to out of state politicians ( not alumni ) who would show up at these tsm events. If these kids went to PA authorities,  they'll be stonewalled and they should watch their back.

             Did you notice who wrote this article in 2012?  It is Victor Thorn.  He is on the Clinton Kill List.  He died last year of a gun shot wound. One of many who had their lives taken, but were deemed a suicide.

               Yes, I have read in the past some writings that  slammed him as a trash writer, we can imagine who was behind that.  I would not blame the liberals, I would blame the lying elite pedos of many stripes.  They are a team combined.

                 Well there certainly should be.  She has made it hell on earth for many of us and the parents of children who have been raped, kidnapped, and had their organs stolen.  She talks about her grand children, but I don't think she really cares about them except for continuing their nasty deeds.  What a wonderful legacy they will have.  Evil Witch.
