            I'm not sure if any of this is useful, but here's what I've come up with so far:
           </p>
           <p>
            Marc C. Gilkey is currently the Regional Manager for the Latin America and Caribbean Region with USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). He works at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. Previously, he was the Assistant Regional Manager for Europe, Africa and the Middle East with USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and served in this capacity since 2012. Prior to that, he was the Assistant Regional Manager for Asia at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India; Assistant Regional Manager in Mexico City, Mexico; and the USDA Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) Coordinator in Kabul, Afghanistan. He graduated with a B.S. from San Francisco State University, and joined the Navy in 1987.

            2004-2005 He worked in Riverdale, Maryland.
2006-2008 He worked in Mexico City, Mexico.
2009-2012 He worked in New Delhi, India.
2013-2015 He worked in Brussels, Belgium.
           </p>
           <p>
            His middle name is Clayton.

            In 2008, his annual salary was $92,293.

            in 2009, IPM CRSP (now known as the Integrated Pest Management Innovation Lab, one of eight collaborative research support programs set up by USAID) visited Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. At the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on May 26th, IPM CRSP met with Marc, who "mentioned  that APHIS is mainly interested in monitoring exports to U.S. Now it includes mango, pomegranates, and grapes. APHIS is into capacity building as long as clear benefit to U.S. shown."
            <a href="http://archive.is/3i8nL">

           <p>
            USAID developed a program called the MUAVAN Mango Program to export Pakistani mangoes to the U.S. and Europe. Marc Gilkey's name is mentioned somewhere in this 154-page report, but I couldn't find where on my first scan through it:
            <a href="http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K7WT.pdf">
             http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K7WT.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Gilkey also helped Croatia navigate complex EU rules regarding the importation of live animals. The Department of Defense offered to allow Croatia the use of six Navy-trained mine-seeking dolphins in 2013, but once Croatia joined the EU, the country faced a problem because EU regulations declared only Zagreb, the inland capital, as a port of entry of live animals. Gilkey suggested that Dubrovnik be temporarily designated a military airfield, clearing the way for a nonstop dolphin flight. (Inside Aphis newsletter, Vol. 1, 2014, page 11, page 77 of this PDF)
            <a href="http://www.governmentattic.org/20docs/InsideAPHISnewsletters_2013-2015.pdf">
             http://www.governmentattic.org/20docs/InsideAPHISnewsletters_2013-2015.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If Dubrovnik was temporarily designated a military airfield, I suppose that would make it easier to fly people out of Croatia and on to some other destination.

            ) about a meeting between APHIS and the Colombian Institute for Agriculture that took place in November. Colombia imports live cattle from the US, and hopes to soon inport sheep and goats. The US imports Colombian uchuva fruit.
