            I think 9 times out of 10 the organizations using these symbols just don't know what they mean secretly. It's up to us to educate them.

            One of the staffers own blog suggests that they are aware not everybody are on the kids side. Last paragraph below:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             My personal experiences are with Carolina Springs Academy that is now closed -- I have heard it is reopened as Seneca Ranch. WWASPS (Worldwide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools) is the umbrella  organization that runs these programs.They also have others in the United States - at last glance there was Red River Academy (now US Youth Services), LA, Second Chances, River View, UT and you never know when more will pop-up in different names. Although the like to claim they have no affiliation  -- when people dig deeper, the roots can get exposed as it did last summer with Midwest Academy (which was shutdown).
            </p>
            <p>
             Diamond Ranch Academy, sadly, though I don't have first hand experiences, I continue to receive negative feedback about the program.  I wrote about them in June 2012 and in 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I mentioned in an earlier Blog post, when I heard they use the same marketing arms and techniques that WWASPS did/does, that is a red flag to me. I have no reason to believe they are related, however I know these marketing arms aren't always in the best interest of the child.

            I am aware of Lauren and Lauren's kids. She was abused by her uncle for many years until she was 16. She came out and prosecuted him and started an organization to talk to kids all over Florida about how to be strong and tell someone that you have been abused. She has a March in all cities every year and takes victims and supporters with her in every city to March and bring awareness. She went up to the state house in Florida to get some teeth in their laws. She became well known in the State House for constantly lobbying on behalf of sexually abused children. When the elections came there was a uncontested State senate seat. Because of her work already around the entire state they did not think she should be challenged certainly not locally. So the Florida state senate seat was hers. She is in her first session. It will be interesting to see what she gets done in a state house full of monsters. She is the most outspoken victim in Florida today she has worked very hard on her own. Look up youtubes from her early days and casework and her story. And look at her efforts. I don't know if she designed the license plate or if it was done for her and she approved? We don't know how much she knows when it comes to symbols as she has been in her own bubble working hard advocating for years now. She was loud and helped bring this to the forefront in a state with huge problems. This is what I know about Lauren Book and Lauren's kids. I hope this helps as the comments here tell me you need more information on Lauren Book.

             Fuck off with the shilling. The butterfly IS a pedo logo. Better go back to that fbi document and take another look.
And beyond that, Pre-pizzagate it was commonly associated with mk ultra and monarch programming. Relating to the "cocoon" stages one would go thru during the programming.
"Pyramids are just pyramids, eye of Horus is just eye of Horus, Saturn is just Saturn, swirls are just swirls, butterflies are just butterflies..." Fuck off.. things have meaning, especially with the context surrounding the symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: OP, nice find.. Thank you. It's so easy for a business to have ANY logo in the world, yet they manage to choose the same ones constantly and, on top of that, symbols used by the very people they claim to fight. Yet another money sucking organization that does nothing to stop these issues

              Listen here you fucking kook. If you had any comprehension skills and didn't just jump to conclusions without any logical thought then you would see that the pedo "butterfly" is actually  a series of 4 hearts which is nothing like the logo we are discussing. We can't go doxxing all these groups that are actually helping the cause. 99% of people have no idea that innoccent butterflies and hearts are used by pedos that's why if its not the excact secret code then its not code. Thanks for making us pizzagaters look like tin foil hat morons in their parents basement.

                OK. Whatever that means. Coming from someone who hasn't contributed any thing to the  PG voat community except a boatload of shitty comments and only 1 submission. Until you figure out where you left your brain, fuck off and go join a flat earth forum or something.

              We shouldn't argue on if the logo here is a sign of pedophilia or not, we should check the company and staff, and connections to high profile persons. Maybe there is a connection to someone already mixed to pizzagate. Let's just look into this before making any conclusions.

              But this is like pizza and many other things. Sometimes, butterflies and hearts are just butterflies and hearts. Neither bear a terribly close resemblance to the FBI pedo signage in this instance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pedos may use butterfly symbols, but not all butterfly symbols are from pedos. The key is to look at what else is going on around a business or operation and whether you find any shadiness within said operation aside from the logos.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, that said, the site's home page features a butterfly in a similar orientation to the FBI documented signage, FWIW.

               As far as I'm concerned, these child help organizations "working to prevent abuse, trafficking, blah blah blah etc" that ask for donations are suspect regardless of the logo... but then you add a logo matching (or even just resembling) the fbi suspect list... idk, just doesn't sit well with me.

                sorry but hearts are used everywhere, especially for things related to health and care. If u want to say that every help organisation is tied to pizzagate u are a fool. i worked at a social help organisation too and we were helping ppl. so to discredit the help oganisations as a whole is just stupid. most of them are real and help ppl in need. ...what we need to figure out are the black sheep! ...and I know there are some. But stop putting all a label on without any evidence.

                  ...and just because of that case every child organisation is trafficing children / are pedophiles?
...are u serious right now? how old are u? many friends of mine grew up in child organisations and were treated very good, so I could say - if I think like u - that every child organisation is perfect and very good for children. ...it isn't always black or white u know?

                 Do you know how fronts work? At all? They have low level worker ants like you doing minuscule tasks to keep it looking "legit", while behind closed doors shady shit is happening that the worker ants (you) would not be aware of in the slightest. Even just laundering money to other shady operations, how would you ever be aware of what the higher ups are doing? The shit that happens would never be known by the worker ants, or else they wouldn't get away with what they do. Same logic applies to any organized corruption.

                  I know how it works yes because I was also responsible for the finances at my work and the boss I worked for is a good friend of mine. ...I just want to make sure ppl dont label every charity/help/children organisation as something shady or bad because it's funking wrong and is not fair to discredit thousands of honest and good people. as said there are black sheeps, but the majority is white. get out of the echo chamber / filter bubble for some time to stay realistic.
