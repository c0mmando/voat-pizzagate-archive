But I don\'t think anyone has suggested that Seth Rich was the one who gave the Podesta emails to Wikileaks, just the DNC emails.  Nonetheless he may have known about the pedophilia that seems so rampant in Washington and that may have played a part in his decision to leak the DNC emails. 
The MSM of course is all about who did the leaking and ignoring the content of both Wikileaks releases.  They are both damning and John Podesta seems to be key in both, the machinations that got Hillary the nomination and the horrible web of pedophile behavior that binds influential people together and keeps them in line.</p>',

            That Seth may have known  about DC pedophilia and based his decision in part to leak  on this knowledge is pure speculation and a thinly veiled excuse to justify this forum's attention to his murder.  I can tolerate some interference for awhile  with this forum's devotion to pedophelia because the murder is extremely important and because David Brock and John Podesta are actively suppressing efforts to solve the murder. And their power over DC needs no explanation. And we are witnessing in real time their extreme interference with freedom of the press which likewise impacts bringing elite pedophiles to justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            But we are on a slippery slope and I am putting my faith in the mods that they will balance the submissions of posts accordingly.  I've had little patience with Pizzagate trivia and tangential Pizzagate posts. I definitely don't want to see any Seth Rich trivia or tangential Seth Rich  posts diluting the pedophile aspect. Those making submissions need to police themselves and avoid junking up this forum.

            There are people with white hats in positions of power or authority following us and relying on us. Our posts need to be relevant and of high quality.  This is our chance to shine and establish our credibility.

             Question to you Pizzalawyer, what happens when you can't tolerate interference anymore...your comment indicates you are not a mod.  So it would seem that when you can't tolerate the topics others choose to discuss and the mods allow, you only have one option.  That is to stop following this subverse.  Or do you have something else you think you can do when you just can't tolerate things anymore?
