            Another death reported at WeHo home of Dem donor Ed Buck. "This was an accidental overdose. Ed played no part," says his atty. In 2017, Gemmel Moore died in Buck's home of what coroner's officials found was accidental meth OD. Rally planned for tonight calling for Buck's arrest.

            A man was found dead in the Los Angeles home of a prominent Democratic donor on Monday — the second death at his house in 18 months, according to local reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            The unidentified man, who was in his 50s, was found dead by police soon after 1 a.m. at Edward Buck’s home in West Hollywood, television station KTLA reported. Police are investigating the death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Buck, a longtime political donor and former candidate for the West Hollywood City Council, was home at the time the man died, Buck’s lawyer told the LA Times, adding that he believes the man had taken drugs before coming into the house.
           </p>
           <p>
            “From what I know, it was an old friend who died of an accidental overdose, and unfortunately, we believe that the substance was ingested at some place other than the apartment,” Buck’s attorney, Seymour Amster, told the newspaper.
           </p>
           <p>
            In July 2017, a 26-year-old man who worked as a prostitute died of a methamphetamine overdose in Buck’s apartment, according to several reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gemmel Moore, who was homeless, had flown from Houston to Los Angeles the day that he overdosed at Buck’s apartment. His mother later told the LA Times that Buck paid for his plane ticket.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moore wrote in his journal, which was reviewed by the LA Times after his death, that Buck had introduced him to crystal meth.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I’ve become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that,” Moore reportedly wrote in the diary. “Ed Buck is the one to thank, he gave me my first injection of chrystal meth.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He continued: “I just hope the end result isn’t death…. If it didn’t hurt so bad I’d kill myself but I’ll let Ed Buck do it for now.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Police investigated Buck after Moore’s death, but no charges were brought. They will be doing follow-up interviews after the most recent death, the LA Times reported.
