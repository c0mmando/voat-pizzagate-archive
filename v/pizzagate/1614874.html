<p>Anyway, back to the sender. His email address is jgedemos2@aol.com. I found someone who was posting about <strong>&quot;Orphan Benefits&quot;</strong> (which sounds suspicious on its own) under the same address <a href="http://archive.is/a5xEi">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a <strong>civil service retiree</strong> and my wife is a FERS/Civil Service retiree.I understand there is a <strong>benefit our disabled son is elegible to receive titled the &quot;double orphan&quot;</strong>. Is our son eligible to receive benefits from both of us? If so, what is the current amount one could expect?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that he is a civil service retiree. Turns out, the author of &quot;<a href="http://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181385521l/1144815.jpg">Entertaining Satan: Witchcraft and the Culture of Early New England</a>&quot;, John Putnam Demos, was also doing civil service. I found this on the last sentence of the page 235 of &quot;<a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?isbn=0300085508">Ye Heart of a Man</a>&quot;, where it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Some age restrictions on military and <strong>civil service</strong> existed, but most men maintained their positions until disabled by age. See <strong>John Demos</strong>, <em>Past, Present, and Future</em>. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same <strong>John Putnam Demos</strong>, who according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Putnam_Demos">Wikipedia</a>, is a descendant of the Putnam family who was prominent in the <strong>Salem witch trials</strong>. According to a NYT article titled <a href="http://archive.is/Fr5S">Entertaining the Devil in Connecticut</a>, he is a <strong>witchcraft expert</strong>.</p>
<p>I haven\'t read the content of the book, but considering how much these people enjoy hiding in plain sight, I think the titles of the email and the book alone are enough to speculate that this man could be another Satanist, like John Podesta.</p>',

            This is what people are missing. "Who
            <em>
             really
            </em>
            rules the world?"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Worldâs Secret Ruler Exposed
âTHE ruler of this world will be cast out,â said Jesus to the people on one occasion. Later, he added that âthe ruler of the world had no hold on himâ and that âthe ruler of this world has been judged.â (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) Of whom was Jesus speaking?
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering what Jesus was saying about âthe ruler of this world,â it is obvious that he could not have been referring to his Father, Jehovah God. Who, then, is âthe ruler of this worldâ? How will he be âcast out,â and how has he been âjudgedâ?
           </p>
           <p>
            âThe Ruler of This Worldâ Reveals Himself
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as a master criminal often takes pride in boasting about his power, so did the Devil when tempting Jesus, the Son of God. After showing Jesus âall the kingdomsâ of the world, Satan made him this offer: âI will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.ââLuke 4:5-7.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Devil were merely a principle of evil, as some have suggested, how could that temptation be explained? Was Jesus being tempted by some evil thought or by some inner turmoil that possibly followed his baptism? If so, how could it be said that âthere is no sin in himâ? (1 John 3:5) Far from denying the Devilâs power over mankind, Jesus actually confirmed it by speaking of him as âthe ruler of the world,â describing him as âa murdererâ and âa liar.ââJohn 14:30; 8:44; The New Jerusalem Bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some 60 years after Christâs encounter with the Devil, the apostle John reminded Christians of the Devilâs powerful influence, saying that âthe whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.â That one, John also said, âis misleading the entire inhabited earth.â (1 John 5:19; Revelation 12:9) Clearly, the Bible speaks of an invisible spirit as âthe ruler of the world.â But what is the extent of his influence over mankind?
           </p>
           <p>
            The World Ruler Delegates Power to Associates
           </p>
           <p>
            Writing about the Christiansâ fight for the faith, the apostle Paul clearly identified their worst enemies. âWe have a wrestling,â he candidly said, ânot against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.â (Ephesians 6:12) Thus, this fight goes beyond the human sphere, since it is carried out, ânot against blood and flesh,â but against âwicked spirit forces.â
           </p>
           <p>
            According to most modern Bible translations, âthe wicked spirit forcesâ here refer, not to an abstract principle of evil, but to powerful wicked spirit persons. Some versions offer such renderings as âthe spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly placesâ (Revised Standard Version), âthe spiritual army of evil in the heavensâ (The Jerusalem Bible), and âthe superhuman forces of evil in the heavensâ (The New English Bible). Thus, the Devil has been exercising his power through other rebel angels who forsook âtheir own proper dwelling placeâ in heaven.âJude 6.
           </p>
           <p>
            The prophetic Bible book of Daniel discloses how these âworld rulersâ have been exerting control over the world since ancient times. Deeply concerned about fellow Jews who in 537 B.C.E. had returned to Jerusalem from their Babylonian exile, the prophet Daniel prayed in their behalf for three weeks. An angel, sent by God to reassure the prophet, told him why his arrival had been delayed. He said: âThe prince of the royal realm of Persia was standing in opposition to me for twenty-one days.ââDaniel 10:2, 13.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who was this âprince of Persiaâ? The angel was obviously not referring to Persian King Cyrus, who at that time looked with favor upon Daniel and his people. Moreover, how could a mere human king resist a spirit creature for three weeks when it took one angel only one night to destroy 185,000 mighty warriors? (Isaiah 37:36) This hostile âprince of Persiaâ could only be an agent of the Devil, that is, a demon who was given control over the realm of the Persian Empire. Later in the account, Godâs angel stated that he would once again have to fight against âthe prince of Persiaâ and another demon prince, âthe prince of Greece.ââDaniel 10:20.
           </p>
           <p>
            What can we conclude from this? Simply that there really are invisible âworld rulers,â demon princes who share control of the world under the authority of their chief, Satan the Devil. But what has been their aim until now?
           </p>
           <p>
            The World Ruler Shows His True Face
           </p>
           <p>
            In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John relates how Jesus, as Michael the archangel, defeats the Devil and his demons and tells of the disastrous consequences resulting from their expulsion from heaven. We read: âWoe for the earth . . . because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.ââRevelation 12:9, 12.
           </p>
           <p>
            How has the Devil shown great anger? Just as many desperate criminals follow the policy of ârule or ruin,â the Devil and his demons are determined to bring the earth and its inhabitants to ruin with them. Knowing that his time is short, the Devil has been using one of the key elements of human society under his controlâbig businessâto promote a frenzied spirit of consumerism, which leads to depletion of natural resources and destruction of the environment worldwide, thus threatening humanityâs survival.âRevelation 11:18; 18:11-17.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the beginning of human history, the Devilâs thirst for power has also been reflected in politics and religion. The book of Revelation depicts political powers as wild beasts to whom the Devil has given âgreat authority.â It also describes the shameless alliance between politics and religion as disgusting spiritual adultery. (Revelation 13:2; 17:1, 2) Think of the oppression, enslavement, wars, and ethnic conflicts over the centuries that have resulted in the loss of millions of lives. Can anyone honestly say that the shocking and horrifying events that have tainted the pages of human history were the normal activity of humans? Or were they the result of manipulation by unseen wicked spirit forces?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bible unmistakably identifies and unmasks the one who has been maneuvering human leaders and world powers. Whether consciously or not, human society reflects the personality of its ruler and his ârule or ruinâ policy. But for how long will humankind suffer under the Devilâs rulership?

            Good night. If I could upvoat this 100 times I would. I have said this from the beginning. The incorporation of Moloch (Molech) is what tells me they're guilty. Then you have the picture of John Podesta's hands.

            And another sidenote.. I was thinking about the extreme, overly irrational responses and demonstrations of hate and violence from the left and thinking witchcraft of some kind was involved.. It's so over the top. Whatever your beliefs are, there is a spiritual battle going on.

            Interesting find.  In all the interviews with Assange I have never heard him be asked if there is anything in the Podesta emails that is important that hasn't been revealed and his thoughts on the pizza/handkerchief related emails.

            Your 1st Hexagram pic. It is a hexagram, but it is not the classic hexagram. Haven't seen this one before. Very interesting. Most interesting for your study is that the 5-petalled clover symbol in the center; it is also symbolic of a down-pointing devil pentagram. Great stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks like a real good fit to the CPP! Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The unicursal hexagram is a hexagram or six-pointed star that can be traced or drawn unicursally, in one continuous line rather than by two overlaid triangles. The hexagram can also be depicted inside a circle with the points touching it. It is often depicted in an interlaced form with the lines of the hexagram passing over and under one another to form a knot. It is the same shape as depicted in Blaise Pascal's 1639 Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem.[citation needed]
