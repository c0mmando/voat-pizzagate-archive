<p>Mutliple articles published by the MSM alleged that the spread of pizzagate was supercharged by anonymous online &quot;bots&quot; (with the motive to swing the election using the fake version of pizzagate that focused on a child sex ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The perpetrators of the harassment alleged—without any evidence—that Comet pizza owner James Alefantis and the Clintons were operating a child-sex ring in the restaurant’s basement. Last December the flood of tweets, supercharged by anonymous online “bots,” motivated a 28-year-old North Carolina man, Edgar Madison Welch, to enter the shop with a loaded automatic rifle and fire off three rounds in search of the nonexistent basement sex chamber. Welch reached a plea deal on March 15 and is scheduled to appear in court Friday for sentencing.</p>

<p>The MSM reports also allege that Russia was behind this disinformation campaign.  Below are some links with information about the massive pizzagate disinformation campaign, followed by reasons that the Russians are NOT the ones who were (and still are) behind it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Russians would not use white nationalists (they would want maximum viewership)</p>

<li>
<p>Russians are not nearly as incompetent as the pizzagate shills.</p>

<p>Russians would not have their shills display a pattern of discrediting themselves - participating in fringe conspiracy theories such as Flat Earth/Mandela effect, begging for donations, displaying &quot;memetard&quot; behavior (TOP KEK).</p>

<p>Russians would not have been so fixated on spreading disinformation in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">r/the_donald</a>.
