Frozen and seemingly forgotten about, presented as something one might pass by and disregard as a meaningless piece of trash, a random piece of paper on the ground caught my eye. It read as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>To Maddie
From Allie</p>
<p>Can I have a playgate with you at Flynn’s Forest? Your brother can come too.</p>
<p>♥ </p>
<p>Allie From To Maddie</p>
<hr />
<p>(Given that there is no major ‘identifying information’, I felt it would be alright to share the artwork with the wider community, and thus have attached this ‘divine sign’: <a href="http://imgur.com/dyxMidi">http://imgur.com/dyxMidi)</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Of note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The G where a D ‘should’ be (playgate) was written in the shape of a backward B. The ‘From To’ [sic]ness is also present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An illustration of infinite love (big hearts made of little hearts) was the focal point of the message. Significant insignia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the backside (frontside?) of the loose leaf was a simple drawing of a full circle. The lines were not entirely connected and thus it appears ‘broken’ in a sense. This circle was centered just as the heart was, so if you held it up to a light, you would see the image on the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Madeleine Mccann: The name ‘Maddie’ immediately brought to mind Madeleine Mccann. It’s not a case I’m overly familiar with, but the details provided on the forum brought her name up several times. Imagine my surprise when, just this past moment as I was looking up how to properly spell her name, I find news reports saying the case has finally been cracked!!! I’ve yet to read the article, but if I was unsure of synchronicity before, this certainly gives me a thumbs up of encouragement! Seems the news would’ve broke at the exact moment (or thereabouts) as when I found the clue. “Maddie” also sounds like “Mad Eye”, which is a one-eyed character from Harry Potter who emphasizes constant vigilance. “Mad Die” could also be a reference to the idea that insanity leads to death; anger-driven focus on mysteries gone unsolved can cause us private eyes to stop living our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name ‘Allie’ is another meaningful coincidence. We can be allies to the little ones. If we’re to experience any growth in our hearts, we <em>must</em> align our behaviours with what we believe to be best for children.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what am I going on about, anyway? Why am I sharing this?  What’s the point?
Interesting questions… I too am still trying to piece this pizza puzzle together. </p>
<p>Is it communication from the spirit realm, meant to evolve us into enlightened essence?
Is it part of a mind-control program run by aliens just to see how much shit they can disturb? 
Is it all of the above? None of the above?</p>
<p>Full Disclosure: I don’t know. </p>
<p>The answer I give to these (and pretty much all other) questions is: I don’t know.  I’m not sure I learned a whole hell of a lot else in my University philosophy courses, but that Socratic sensibility certainly made an impression... What I do know however, is that as someone who has never kidnapped or purposely hurt or touched a child, but as someone with a dark side who has in years past tasted the forbidden pizza, I must testify and give witness.</p>
<p>While I can imagine that this tract may irritate, provoke, and/or enrage many, the ultimate aim of this ‘tell all’ is to further understanding. Not only in terms of hopefully transforming micro-cosmic evidence into macro-cosmic revelations, but also by serving as an ‘open book’ so that innocents will not be caught in the crossfires of those who would judge by covers. This is not to deny anyone their righteous anger, nor to escape any karmic consequences which are due. Quite the opposite. This is my way of serving Truth and doing all I can to protect the vulnerable ones who need it most. Keeping this in mind, I come to provide a few reminders…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are perverts who seek justice as fervently as you do. This one does, anyway. Promoting hatred and death threats / public execution might seem strong strategies, but they may also create as many problems as they seek to fix. Plus there’s much reason to believe that many of the young ones today will find themselves afflicted with the condition down the line, and grown-ups creating an environment of extreme fear and condemnation isn’t likely to help anyone, it just makes it more likely that the unseemly will be driven further underground…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we’re to take suggestions of Satan seriously, then I believe that we should also be listening for The Voices of Angels as well. What is “impossible”? I have entertained many fanciful notions as of late, all with the hope of gaining a greater sense of understanding so that I might direct my energies toward healing, truth, love, and light. Ineffable Spirituality is undoubtedly a part of our world…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contemplation of quantum entanglement has lead me to believe that through being honest with myself, the truth of others will come out as well. Perhaps this is yet another great deception, but emphasizing interrelatedness seems to me the way to go if we’re to learn anything of value…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be unpleasant to hear (and difficult to speak), but given the amount of research and time that so many seekers have put in, to not go ‘there’ would be another cover-up, and the world doesn’t need any more harmful secrets. My good intention (the road to Hell is paved with them, I’ve been told) is not to exploit scandal for my own ego-centric, confessional ends. Undying hatred, neverending ostracism, infinite torture – whatever negativity could possibly visit me, if such ‘self-sacrifice’ contributes even the smallest amount to the alleviation of suffering, <em>especially</em> of innocent children, then I’m all for it.</p>
<p>If there’s even the slightest chance that the ‘visions’ and ‘premonitions’ are in fact guiding us toward truth, and there exists even the smallest possibility that through genuine repentance and light-shining this might somehow magically lead to The Truth being revealed in other aspects of our shared experience, then it’s a no-brainer. Tell all, to the best of my abilities, I shall.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Psychotic pervert finds garbage, convinces himself it was ‘meant to be’ and does his best to convince whoever will listen that if we all work together, we can make a real difference in this world of misery and woe. </p>
<p>There’s always more to be said.  For now, that’s all I have to say.</p>
