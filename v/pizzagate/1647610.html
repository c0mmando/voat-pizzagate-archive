<p>Doesn\'t it just piss you off that our DOJ hasn\'t  named or charged The perpetrators involved in this shit show...that clinton and podesta parades around publicly as if they are above the laws of this nation? These traitorous cartel were deleting emails, pleading the fifth, protecting sexual predators, making backroom deals with enemies of the United States, using our most Children as chattel and currency...harvesting their organs,.Interfering with our election process and colluding with soros (a nazi) it does not get any worse than this folks! 
Hold the low level johns  and the foundation employees accountable yes, but not holding the  leadership and masterminds of the whole scheme accountable as well is garbage. They cannot escape answering for their crimes they can no longer use  misdirection and scandal or worse blackmail to avoid Answering for their crimes!  So will these low level johns be witnesses for the gov\'t? Most likely, yes. I guess they\'ll tell us they were duped and are victims of abuse and circumstance. </p>
<p>Remember, if this goes to trial, the gov\'t will have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty. They have good lawyers and money to pay them..they literally write the medias pay check. It is an uphill battle, the enormity is impossible to gauge. </p>
<p>It\'s not clear that the clintons, alefantis, podestas, Epstein and the rest of the players will be charged . Anything can happen in court or pre-trial negotiation. Anything or nothing . There\'s no way to predict how any of this plays out. Way too many &quot;moving parts&quot; and lots of money floating around. I have no illusions about just how difficult the road to justice has been and will be.</p>
<p>But here\'s the thing, children are dead and now lots of people understand how and why. The white-hot spotlight of the local and national awareness needs to be focused on Podesta and Clinton and the luciferian scum it  represents. The nation is in the midst of a coup of sorts. A battle between the corruption and lawless vermin which have used children as commodities, engaged in nefarious trades such as organ traffickingand drug dealing, Have accepted bribes from enemies of the state and engaged in pay to play schemes.   Few communities, or even families, have not been touched not only here but across the globe. This corruption has reached a tipping point.  We have seen that these schemes have affected all ages, all nations and has persisted as a scourge thoughout history.  As a nation, as investigators, as simply supporters of the cause, we may disagree on much, but this is a non-partisan, equal-opportunity , menace, that threatens our very existence. I don\'t see too many guilty parties just walking away. </p>
<p>If you are at all concerned, read everything you can find. Spread it, force people to take notice! Then call your local, state and federal representatives. Reference the Podesta investigation. Demand to know what your state\'s AG is doing. Contact your state representative  and ask what measures are being taken to prevent trafficking, request mandatory minimum sentences, push for the death penalty.  Expose the perpetrators via social media and let everyone know you are watching. That we are watching and won\'t be silenced. </p>
<p>The courts are not immune to public scrutiny. Attend open sessions if you live near. You have a voice. We have a voice. Use it for something apart from complaining. I have done all of the above many times over and it works, admittedly not for a case of this magnitude.  No matter at what point do we stand and use our voice and demand from our elected officials justice. Who will speak for Seth rich? Who will speak for Madeline McCann? Who will speak for the unknown and unnamed children? Time to stand and be heard, and make a noise that cannot be ignored.</p>',

            I saw

            </a>
            removed you before I could. I wanted to let you know that we are trying a new thing -- a weekly
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1640929">
             Open Discussion Thread
            </a>
            where you can post unsourced stuff like this on the main board and get comments. The more people who post in it and upvoat, the more it will be seen and used. You can either put your whole thing in there as a comment, break it up into multiple comments people can reply to individually, or make an independent post in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            and put a comment in the Open Discussion thread inviting people to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you can start your comment with a headline to make it stand out by typing whatever you want to title it, hitting return twice, writing your comment. Then you highlight the title part and click the 10th button that looks like an H and it will make it a heading.

            "The nation is in the midst of a coup of sorts".........Oh it was definitely a coup. It started in 1963. Have you seen Oliver Stone's JFK?
           </p>
           <p>
            Long story short is George H. W. Bush and his CIA pals offed JFK so they could basically take over. They've run the show ever since. The President is a figurehead only. The Shadow Government makes all the important decisions. The less talking a President does the better. The best is if you can get a closeted homosexual who's posing as a heterosexual. He might even have a wife and two daughters to prove he's a heterosexual. He just doesn't want it known he's living a lie. He'll eat out of your hand.
