<p>Parents all over social media are in an uproar over a letter posted by a Pennsylvania mother from her children’s dentist office. Smiles4Keeps Pediatric Dentistry sent a letter to a mother threatening to call Child Protective Services if she did not schedule a dental appointment for her child.</p>
<p>The dental office staff has responded to the post and comments with a post of their own, defending their actions as being their legal obligation. Instead of quieting public fears, the response appears even more disturbing to parents, who are accusing the dental office of “bullying,” and “blackmail.”   Please Read Article to See Actual Copy of Letter</p>
<p>According to the mother’s post, there are several practices that the dentist office maintains that concerned her, any of which could account for her choosing not to continue taking her children to that particular dentist:</p>
<p>1- Parent does NOT go into patient area with their child.
2- Parent does NOT meet dentist. (They meet hygienists.)
3- Only one appt for procedures (fillings) per day. If Parent has more children, they must come on a different day.
4- They will report you if you don’t respond to them.</p>
<p>There are many good, loving parents who refuse to allow their children to be seen by any doctor, dentist, or health provider unless they are able to accompany their children, not wanting to leave their children alone inside a medical office.    For some, that policy alone is reason enough to decide never to go back. How are parents to protect their children if someone, even someone they have never met, is permitted unfettered access to them?</p>
<p>Does she really need to justify or explain to the office why she chose not to take her children back?</p>

<p>I don’t have to tell you where I go with my children nor do I have to tell you my plans for their future care…. What I do with my kid’s teeth after I LEAVE your office is none of your business.
You ARE NOT the caregiver of my child WHEN I SAY that you are no longer the care giver, and NOT when YOU tell me so.</p>
<p>Is Smiles4Keeps attempting to tell their clients that they do not have the right to change providers at will?   And what will this Mother have to do to keep CPS away from her door?</p>
<p>Nancy Schaeffer was a valiant and courageous fighter for our children and did all she could to speak out about the evils of CPS.

<p>Mrs. Schaefer states that the financial motive for the State to legally kidnap children was put in place in 1974 by Walter Mondale with the “Adoption and Safe Families Act.” This was later expanded by President Bill Clinton in 1997 with The Adoption and Safe Families Act that gave states cash bonuses for every child adopted out of foster care. (Editor’s note: Bill Clinton signed this bill into law, but the bill was passed by the Republican-led House and Senate led by Newt Gingrich, so it was a bi-partisan effort initiated by a Republican majority in Congress.)</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Act 31  (Child Abuse Reporting and Recognition Requirements) states that healthcare providers must report your failure to bring your child to the dentist for evaluation and care. </p>
<p>I don\'t know about you, but this really scares me to death.  Please Read Article.  Thank You.</p>',

            Hi folks!!! 👋👋 Source here!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Just wanted to reach out and say thanks for caring and sharing!
           </p>
           <p>
            Smile4Keeps should be investigated and parents should be alerted of this kind of bullying in our communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            (The crazy thing is, that this time it wasn’t verbal. It was a WRITTEN threat. Parents generally don’t have the proof needed to alert others or protect themselves.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Without sharing nothing would happen. So thank you thank you THANK YOU!

            Whoa whoa whoa!! These dental groups are in cahoots with the schools and use the same scare tactics the schools here in Cali use. Oh man do I wish this was by my house , I'd like to walk  in there and give them a piece of my mind ! We are in charge of our own children regardless of what anyone says ! i seriously think we need to look into our local dentists everywhere !  I will work on the ones by me .  Z

             I know!  After finding out what I know now, I think I would jump over the counter and try to strangle them.  Reporting them right away to the Dental Assoc.  Yelling really loud when there are people in the office usually gets what you want.  It has always worked for me.Let everyone hear what they are doing.  WHAT do you mean you are going to report me to CPS if I don't reschedule right now?  WHAT do you mean you want the name of my new dentist?  I told my sister in law to do that when she wanted her new carpet job fixed and she got just what she wanted.  My Mother always told me the bird that screams the loudest gets the worm!

             Not good. Having a little in your toothpaste is one thing, but taking drops sounds scary to me.  But there are dentists I am sure that have just been brainwashed by their schools and training to hand this stuff out really believing it.  Then there are also those that have ulterior motives especially with the poor and unsuspecting.

            for this eye opening and very important post!  People need to spread it far and wide!
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed the dentist in the OP, Ross Wezmar of Pennsylvania,
            <strong>
             is involved with government affairs for the American Dental Association.
            </strong>
            I'll try to find the link and post it here.

            Connecticut DCF – same thing is going on!
           </p>
           <p>
            Now it makes sense to me the strange things two female employees of our family's former dentist's office said to me years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            For many years I had had a nice relationship with everyone in the office.  But one day things changed.  I was in for a cleaning with one of my two then school-age children.  The regular appointment for the three of us had had to be rescheduled, because of my work or grad school, their activities, or one of us was sick, and then, it was rescheduled for just two of us, again for some good reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            I never understood until now why the hygienist's personality seemed to change that day; she grimaced at me in the chair and pointedly said it was “neglect” that my other child was a couple months past their six month appointment time.  And looked past me to the outer area as though to report me to someone.  I looked at her like she was insane.  My children never had any problems with their teeth, and for that matter neither did I.  And getting an appointment rescheduled there does require some waiting time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I instinctively felt she was eager to contact DCF, for no reason at all.  I thought I knew the type from where I once worked, I thought they were motivated by jealousy of other parents whose children they worked with.  I had no idea then that DCF was evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            I shudder to think now what the hygienist actually had in mind for them.  My children are beautiful, and I was a financially strapped divorced parent who could not have afforded a lawyer on my own.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time, I just assumed she envied me and was pathetically insulting me and hoping to harm us, but I never thought she was scheming to get one of my children stolen for sex trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes more sense now why the wall in at least one exam room was plastered with photos of this hygienist’s young daughter who was very involved with dance.  I always thought that was very odd that she allowed complete strangers to see those photos.
           </p>
           <p>
            I immediately found a new family dentist, and never brought my children back there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Years later, I went back there for a cosmetic repair for me, because the dentist seemed to have more experience at that than my current dentist might.   After the repair his receptionist, who I had been friendly with, showed inappropriate behavior.  Although she knew we had literally not even lived in that part of Connecticut for years, and that my children were young adults, she had been stalking their dental care.  She proclaimed falsely that my children’s current insurance did not include dental (never true,) and that they really, really, wanted them back in their office, to help them.   She implied they weren’t getting their teeth cleaned and examined!
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't correct her, I was so shocked I just smiled and politely thanked her, and backed away slowly like one does from someone not in their right mind, and thought of what my son told had told me years before which was that her son was the biggest drug dealer in their high school and that she had no clue.  I also noticed the dentist behind her, looking displeased with what she was saying, or how far she was going with it, and I got the hell out of there.
           </p>
           <p>
            We were lucky.  People must know about this disgraceful situation of dental offices trying to report good parents to try to get their children stolen by government child sex traffickers.  I wonder what their kickback is.

             There most def is a kickback for these dentists willing to partner withe CPS.   CPS gets money from the govt. for every child they place in a foster home.  So I am sure they can pass on a cut to these procurers.  They are helping Medically Kidnap our children and handing them off to CPS for placement.  I think this is slowly happening across the country.  We may be surprised at how many states are already with this program.  So very scary and am glad you escaped this.  My dentist would never be part of this.  We know him for about 25 yrs.  and he is a good father to his children and good to his techs.  We even exchange Christmas Cards.  People need to shop for a good dentist.  I would be afraid to take my child to a pediatric dentist.  I remember years ago they had dentists that worked on all children and I never heard of a special one for kids.  This may be a new thing, started for their CPS/DCFS operation.

              You're welcome.  I just came across something huge.

             </p>
             <p>
              I just Googled my former dentist, and noticed Delta Dental featured on internet entries for him.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I looked up Delta Dental, and found they co-developed a program with a dentist working for the Missouri state government, called
              <strong>
               P.A.N.D.A.,
              </strong>
              to train dentists to report neglect and abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              P.A.N.D.A.?  You've got to be joking.  This is sick.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Prevent Abuse and Neglect through Dental Awareness (P.A.N.D.A.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Since [the 1990's] P.A.N.D.A. has been replicated in 44 US states and 14 international programs.

               I just found this and I wanted every one to see this   SEALANTS ARE DANGEROUS  especially for children  BPA

               Please Read All.  It Is Shocking
              </p>
              <p>
               I just read an article saying that dental sealants are dangerous. This was an eye opener considering I just had sealants put on my son’s 6 year molars. After reading the article, I called the dentist and asked if they can be removed and told them why. Of course,I was told that they never heard of this. They are supposed to call me back to let me know if they can remove them. Sealants contain BPA. The same chemical that was once in baby bottles and was removed. Recent studies have further detailed the health impact of this substance, reported on at News Inferno:

               This is about The Dental Team's Role in Identifying and Preventing Family Violence     An Example:   • Know the definitions of child abuse and child neglect and understand family violence as a problem affecting all age groups.   Since when should Dental Techs and Drs. be snitching on families to the point where they are trained in identifying problems.  This is scary to me.  Also I am checking on the coating they are offering children for their teeth.

                  Grand Wizard was the title given to the head of the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan which existed from 1865 to 1869.   He commented on the early imagery of the Veiled Prophet (see image above), dressed in a hood and robe similar to members of the Ku Klux Klan and being armed with pistol and rifle, thus referring to issues of the white supremacist South. At the time, the Missouri Republican commented, "It will be readily observed from the accoutrements of the Prophet that the procession is not likely to be stopped by street cars or anything else."(October 6, 1878) Historian Spencer interpreted the reference of the Republican to "streetcars" as related to the 1877 labor strike. Lucy Ferriss wrote about the VP events in her memoir, characterizing St. Louis as "the northwest outpost of the Confederacy."[2]    The Prophet  was derived from the Grand Wizard.  Also there is a picture on this page

               I can't believe this!  If it were not so sick I would laugh.  They have probably been laughing themselves.  Naming it PANDA.  But here is the kicker.  Did they think that no one would ever become suspicious, and not be able to add things up?  This is amazing!  OK.  We need help here.  You have done some really great work but hopefully people will see this and join in.  I will kick in some help now.    PANDA!  I am shocked.  I will look into this Jerk Mouden.

             Yes, but they then demand you hand over your new Dr.'s info and they then have that info.  I think people have to stand up alright and I don't mean just poor people.  Everyone.  We must not put up with this.  Many people are too afraid to speak up.  Get your groove on.

               It's what the govt and CIA are using on politicians for years, Blackmail.  Now they are using it on us.  We have to nip this in the bud.  It has already been passed in many states.  I have another story I may post.  NC is fighting back.

             I think people think they don't need to worry, they don't need to worry unless something goes wrong, even then they think CPS is there as a savior.  They think that the Agency is for people that have problems, you know fires that kill the parents with no family left to care for the children.  Little do they know what they have become.  I wonder if they have ever been there to protect the children.   If people think things are still the way they were when they were kids, they had better Wake Up.  Walter Mondale, Bill Clinton and a Republican House threw our Children under the bus.

            Call CPS yourself. They are not going to respond to a report like this from the dentist. There are all kinds of idiots who call them with retarded things. And they know that people use it to intimidate vulnerable parents. They also know that pointlessly contacting the parent over something this idiotic, does harm to the family and child: therefore it is unethical and defeats the purpose of CPS. 
Call CPS and ask them.

            In looking for a pediatric dentist, I couldn't
            <em>
             believe
            </em>
            how many had the "no parents in the exam room" policy.  That was a non-starter for me.

               I completely agree.  When they find out what is really going on and the scope of it, well, watch out.

            That’s so ridiculous. Immunizations are forced in California. There have been babies taken before even leaving the hospital because a parent didn’t want their baby vaccinated.

            This kind of stuff scares parents and makes them afraid to speak up.

             So now it's not just required for kids to be vaccinated before starting school, they really are requiring it at birth? This is insane! My baby almost died from the birth dose of hep b and I later found out preterm babies should not get the birth dose because it causes the exact reaction my baby had. Needless to say I was beyond furious and began questioning the one size fits all vaccine schedule and vaccine safety. If you want to piss of doctors, ask them questions about vaccines and refuse to "go along" with the schedule.

              Yes! One of mine was born 3 weeks early. We had to have the baby immunized before we could leave the hospital. Then again a couple of months later. I’ve never had any problems arise, but you never know about long term.

              What’s up with all these missing doctors?? I’ve heard a couple of theories and both are scary. One is that they are getting rid of doctors that are getting close to cures or the truth. Another theory is that they are forced to help make biological weapons or something to use on us. Either way, it’s a scary thought. We’re nothing to them.

                 Now now, we can't have natural methods to heal that would steal money away from big Pharm. I would be terrified if I was in their position. I really do wonder what happened to the CDC employee too.  The guy seemed like a really good guy by everything I saw from his family.

                   And yet MSM stayed fairly silent about the mass missing or murdered holistic doctors.  I never did see any 20/20 or 60 min. episodes about it. We know they hide things they don't want us to know about.

               I agree.  Both are frightening.  There are more I believe than have been reported.  I think darkknight had found his notes on line.  Scary.

             I’m in California. That is scary. After everything I know now, it sure makes me handle things differently. They won’t allow your kids to go to school without proof of immunizations. If they don’t go to school, you’re breaking the law then too.

                 I think this is a good way to start the red pilling going.  True every day stories they can't discount.  This is not Conspiracy Theory story as they say.

             Yes, that is a perfect description.  My hope is that the people that spoke out on the internet, the hope is they will share this extortion with their friends, relatives and work companions.  Screaming out in front of the Law Makers Offices in a large group is what it will take.  Instead of people marching today they need to march for their children.  Before they are taken.

             Yes, it[s OK to abort so they can steal the organs and stem cells and then if you have the child, they get CPS to take it.  A win win for them either way.  Yes they are SICK.

              What they really want is to take parental rights away completely. I see it coming, and I know you do too. Just like the article about Delaware wanting to allow a child to decide race or gender without parental consent. It's slowly going to happen if this isn't stopped. Right now things are just happening in small doses so the masses are not aware. They will just keep adding more and more provisions until just about anything a parent does can be seen as a reason for a child to be removed from their care.

                It looks like they are planning it mainly for the 13-20 year old's we see now. This group has been the everyone gets a trophy generation. They are so invested in themselves, all about me, me, me. I can see some of them going along with it. Sad to say that,  but I believe it's possible.

                 I don't know what has happened this generation.  They are so enraptured with tech giants and put them on pedestals.  They also are so disenchanted with politics that they don't vote, but yet they don't want to believe that these people are trafficking and stealing children.  They are too busy taking selfies.  Yes, and sending each other pictures of their meals.  I am so over it.  The invention of the IPhone is here for a purpose.  To spy on us. I have discovered something I should look into more about how they plan on getting info on our children through scanning their skin with an IPhone and an AP.  When I saw it on the news, My Jaw Dropped.

                  I saw this on a Voat site and thought about this conversation. A way for See Eye A to collect DNA through Microdermabrasion. Crazy !

                   This really scares me.   "Much of the touch-screen technology used now in iPads and other things came out of various companies that In-Q-Tel identified," Smith told NPR.   Just think about all those free ipads given to kids in the schools.  Never use facial recognition.  I am telling all the young kids I know not to do it.

                    I didn't even catch that with the I Pads as I skimmed through the article. I imagine it's the same with touch screens on phones. Seems there is no escaping it with the technology that is out there now. I went back and looked at the sites they linked to..The Intercept and NPR. You should look at those too.  One other thing away from this topic that really upset me last night is a special on TV Easter night... Jesus Christ Superstar. Guess who is playing Jesus...John Legend. I felt sick after seeing that, knowing his connections to Marina A. I saw something about him on VC too. Will go back and find it. They are mocking anyone who has a connection to God, Jesus or the Mother Mary.

                     I am not watching any of the Jesus movies.  They are all a pack of lies anyway.  How do we know what is true or false?  Legend is tied up with the Christy Tiege or what ever her name is.  We had posts on her and him just recently.  Sick.

                      Yes, these people are sick. I knew something was happening with them with the amount of attention they have been receiving. And you are right about what may true or false. Really none of us know, but we all know there is good and evil in this world.

                       I told my husband that I am no longer listening or watching any of their claptrap about the bible, Jesus, God, Mary or Religious Christmas stories.  All I have to know is that I believe in God.  I will pray to him in my home or wherever.  I don't need them to tell my anything.  My prayers are between me and God.    They have fed us nothing but a Pack of Lies.

                        I am the same way.  I have seem some of the worse hypocrites in the church too. I keep it as a private conversation. I grew up going to church, but stopped early 20's. It did not stop my faith in a higher power though. I am one who believes the signs are there if you just open your eyes.

                         THIS is it exactly.  There eyes are closed AND when we tell them about, their ears are closed too.  But I believe people are waking up.  It just will take something shocking to make them jump out of their chairs and get riled up.  Riled up is what they will be when they find out the truth.  Batten down the hatches.

                          I just wish they would. It's hard when you see what they can't. I posted a video that makes you happy and sad. This mom understands. Grab the tissue if you watch.

                   Oh I know.  I use me phone sparingly and try to have it off in the store.  Don't want them to know anymore than they already know.  My mother could have gotten one 5 years ago.  Someone tried to talk her into it and she was 85 and she said why do I need that.  She said she just wants one just to make calls in an emergency.  'We have been so hoodwinked.

                    Good for her. My daughter is even aware of the tracking. She showed me about how you can take the tracking off that's inside your phone. She saw how you can do it on a Utube video.

                     Wow.  I will have to see if I can find it.  I am too scared to do that, but the guy next door is really good at tech stuff.  I tell them a lot of things and he has helped with my laptop.  This is great news that we can get around this. Wow.  Thanks!

                      I talked to her and she said you can found it by searching Yahoo tracking +device+samsung+battery i phone. She found it on Utube from there. She doesn't know if it can be done on other brands though.

              There have to be somewhere.  Something to indicate who's pocket they are in.  I guess it's not really needed as long as they are doing the Dirty Work of the CPS another 3 Letter Org.   They are either spying on all of us or stealing our children.

             So very true.  I get emails in my inbox all the time and this one really caught my attention.  I really admire this mother for taking a stand and not being afraid, but at the same time we know what has happened to families that have spoken out........  STOLEN CHILDREN

              I’m right, so I’m not afraid. It’s true though, the fear…this establishment has been preditory on the poor for 20 years and not one person has stood up. That’s how scared they are.

              Yes, I'm waiting for the PR campaign that calls her crazy to start. Probably CNN will lead the way. Hogg will come out of getting his gray hair retouched and start a demonstration on the importance of having teeth.

                Really? They're defending this intimidation?

                You know what? FB is rife with paid trolls so don't take these things to heart. You did the right thing to make this public, and it's only logical that they'd try to cover up what they're doing by setting the paid attack dogs on you -- as if you deserve that!

               Ugh don't get me started.  I just yelled at my husband to get rid of ABC News and their covering the March to Steal Our Guns.  There I said it!  We don't get cable but it doesn't matter it will be on all the news stations.  Can't even get your local news anymore without the Psycho-Babble.

                And now it's obviously psychobabble. They at least used to have convincing programmers. Maybe it's the red-pilling, though. Maybe it's easier to tell since we woke up.

                 I have read that cable and the news shows viewerships are way down, but they keep on keepin on.  They are backed by their Evil Elite Corp. to keep spreading their False Flag Ops and other lies.  No amount of money will be spared to keep brainwashing the masses.

                  But it's satisfying to know how poorly they're doing. Sean Hannity is kicking ass while CNN continues to sink in the swamp of their creation.

                     I can tell you now ahead of time.  Lies Lies Lies.  And then some more lies.  This garbage about Stormy D is enough already.  I don't know if he did it or not, but it was before he ran for Pres. and he was not under the WH desk with her. They I believe, are trying to do a replay of Bill &amp; Monica.  Sleeze Sells.

                       Yeah, Linda Tripp.  I read something I think last year about her owning a shop now in VA.  Actually it had something to do with a hotel. Wow the stuff that pops into your mind.

                         Bingo!  Shows how we can work together.  Remember how some were talking about how it was all a set up?  How Monica was a plant of some kind?  Wonder if Trip was involved in that.  She was hanging around with Monica.  I smell a Big Rat.  Here now, she has a shop with a doll featured on his Instagram.  Wowza!
