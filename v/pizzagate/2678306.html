Major TV shows and pedophile references seems directly related to &quot;pedowood&quot; and arouses suspicion in my mind. In this clip, the two improv actors use the references &quot;Ice cream&quot; and &quot;pizza&quot; and both laugh... there is a blatant laugh from like one dude in the audience but it was not funny in any way, so there can only be one reason anyone was laughing and that reason is that they were openly joking about baby rape and find it funny that nobody will know except for insiders. Well too bad dudes, we now know... you\'re BUSTED. Relevance: confirms pizza and ice cream as code words, useful for further inquiry. </p>

            Thanks for taking the time to post it.  I kinda want to go through more of them.  I also noticed a lot of negative white people topics and jokes.
