<p>A god of the Ammonites; possibly the same as Malcam, Milcom, and Moloch. It may be a title rather than the name of a specific god. The Mosaic Law demanded the death penalty for anyone who sacrificed his children to Molech.—Le 20:2; Jer 32:35; Ac 7:43.</p>
<p>MOLECH
(Moʹlech) [from a root meaning “reign as king” or “king,” but with the vowels of boʹsheth, “shame,” to denote abhorrence].</p>
<p>A deity particularly associated with the Ammonites (1Ki 11:5, 7, 33); possibly the same as Moloch (Ac 7:43; compare Am 5:26) and Milcom. (1Ki 11:5, 33) At Jeremiah 32:35, Molech is referred to in parallel with Baal, suggesting, if not an identification, at least some connection between the two. Numerous authorities regard “Molech” as a title rather than the name of a specific deity, and therefore, the thought has been advanced that the designation “Molech” may have been applied to more than one god.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the Malcam referred to at 2 Samuel 12:30 and 1 Chronicles 20:2 is the idol image of the Ammonite god Milcom, or Molech, although the Hebrew term could be rendered “their king.” (Compare KJ; AS.) Earlier in the Biblical account the Ammonite king is referred to by his name Hanun (2Sa 10:1-4); hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the name Hanun rather than Malcam would have appeared in the Scriptural record if the king rather than the idol were intended. Also, it is thought unlikely that a king would have worn a crown weighing about 34 kg (92 lb t). For the same reason it has been suggested that David placed Malcam’s crown on his head only temporarily, perhaps to denote his victory over the false god. According to the reading of the Targum, which has been adopted by numerous translators, the crown had only one precious jewel. This has given rise to the view that it was the precious jewel, rather than the crown itself, that came to be on David’s head.</p>
<p>Child Sacrifice to Molech. God’s law to Israel prescribed the death penalty for anyone, even an alien resident, who would give his offspring to Molech. (Le 20:2-5) Nonetheless, apostate Israelites, both in the kingdom of Judah and in the ten-tribe kingdom, passed their offspring through the fire.—2Ki 17:17, 18; Eze 23:4, 36-39.</p>
<p>The ‘passing through the fire’ to Molech has been regarded by some as signifying a purification ritual by means of which children were devoted or dedicated to Molech; others understand this to mean actual sacrificing. That the Canaanites and apostate Israelites did sacrifice their children, there can be no question. (De 12:31; Ps 106:37, 38) King Ahaz of Judah “proceeded to burn up his sons [“son,” Sy] in the fire.” (2Ch 28:3) The parallel passage, at 2 Kings 16:3, reads: “Even his own son he made pass through the fire.” This indicates that ‘passing through the fire’ is at least sometimes synonymous with sacrificing. Likely, however, the worship of Molech was not always and everywhere the same. For example, King Solomon, under the influence of his foreign wives, built high places to Molech and other deities, but not until the time of Ahaz is mention made of child sacrifice. (1Ki 11:7, 8) Undoubtedly if this abhorrent practice had existed earlier, it would have been denounced along with the other forms of idolatry existing during the reigns of the various kings. For this reason some commentators favor the view that the expression ‘to pass through the fire’ originally applied to a purification ritual and later came to signify actual sacrifice.</p>
<p>“The passing” to Molech mentioned in the footnote on Leviticus 18:21 evidently refers to devoting or dedicating children to this false god. This text has been variously translated: “You must not dedicate any of your children to the service of Molech.” (AT) “Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through the fire to Molech.” (AS) “Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch.” (Dy) “You must not allow the devoting of any of your offspring to Molech.”—NW.</p>
<p>Ahaz and Manasseh are the only Judean kings referred to as making their offspring pass through the fire. However, with the impetus given by these two kings to child sacrifice, the practice apparently became entrenched among the Israelites in general. (2Ki 16:3; 21:6; Jer 7:31; 19:4, 5; 32:35; Eze 20:26) The children, at least at times, were first killed, rather than being burned alive.—Eze 16:20, 21.</p>
<p>King Josiah defiled Topheth, the chief center of Molech worship in Judah, in order to prevent persons from making their offspring pass through the fire. (2Ki 23:10-13) But this did not eradicate the practice for all time. Ezekiel, who began serving as a prophet 16 years after the death of Josiah, mentions it as occurring in his day.—Eze 20:31.</p>
<p>The view has been advanced that the Molech to whom children were sacrificed had the form of a man but the head of a bull. The image is said to have been heated red hot and the children cast into its outstretched arms, thus to fall into the flaming furnace below. This conception is largely based on the description of the Carthaginian Cronos or Moloch given by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus of the first century B.C.E.—Diodorus of Sicily, XX, 14, 4-6.</p>',

            This image. Look at the paper in the bottom left that says "Moloch Maschine". It's referencing a German science fiction movie. Maschine is German for the word machine. The Moloch Maschine is featured in the landmark sci-fi film Metropolis. This film features a culture where the workers live and die in an underworld to provide for an elite class who live above ground.

            Let's also not forget that Alex Jones exposed the worship of Molech 10 years ago when he snuck into Bohemian Grove. People back then were calling him crazy and now look. Molech is being mentioned again by the elite and it's down in writing.

            If they are bowing down to Moloch (the satan), then they are in serious trouble.  Because for one thing is this, Yahweh will not allow the children to be slaughtered as in this way that they are doing.  Now they may think they're just being silly, I don't know.  I do not know how they could do this to little helpless children who cannot take care of themselves.  Here's the deal, you guys, once a nation finds out that something like this is going on, we're in huge deep trouble as a nation and it demands repentance.  This is such sick stuff, it will not be allowed by Yahweh.  Now I ask you this, please do NOT MAKE FUN OF YAHWEH'S NAME. He will fight against this mess.  Just pray over and over that he helps us because he will not stand for this sickness and especially in this nation considering who he knows we are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once a nation gets into this nasty mess, then you have all kinds of sicknesses, like perverts doing animals, then sicknesses and plagues going on, murdering people for fun, mass orgies of every which kind.  It's not that history repeats itself, it's that human nature does.  If all of these things happens in this nation, then Yahweh can destroy it because then it's just so worthless. I mean, who wants to live inside garbage, inside a septic pool of trash and filth.  It's just horrible things that can happen to people, and for those little kids to be hurt in that regard worldwide makes me more than ill.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing that I wish to add because I don't think others are studying it, the true name of Jesus is Yahushua, and you can prove this by looking at the Hebrew of the book of Joshua (Yahushua) and comparing the LXX.   Next comparing the NT books in Greek as well. Yahushua was his earthly prophetic name.  He inherited his father's name Yahweh.  That's in the Scriptures as well.  So you will do well not making fun of Yahweh's name.  Yahushua's father is named Yahweh, his family name, and so is Yahushua now!

             I don't believe for a second that this is 'human nature.' It's a complete anomaly, an abomination, a mutated form of humanity. Most people in the world, I believe, are good and have the ability to empathise. The inherent goodness of people is slowly being eroded though by the way society is going - all this child abuse also creates adults that are unable to empathise and so perpetuate the cycle - it is the most horrific of crimes. These people have a fundamental part of their brain either missing, or twisted by deformity. We need to find a cure for it, basically, we need to find a surefire way of identifying and curing sociopathy. Imagine if suddenly these monsters had empathy thrust upon them and could feel for others, imagine the crushing weight of their guilt. That is what I want for these people, I want them to be cured and to then feel the enormity of the evil they've committed.

              <p>
               (Sorry for long post but it's important) People need to know that this stuff was actually prophecy said to happen straight from the bible.
              </p>
              <p>
               Are Bible prophecies merely the work of clever humans? Do they bear the hallmark of divine inspiration? We invite you to weigh the evidence.
WE LIVE in difficult times. From all parts of the earth, we hear a steady stream of news describing calamities and social unrest. Is there any special significance to the current world situation?
              </p>
              <p>
               Some 2,000 years ago, the Bible foretold that the world’s troubles would climax in “the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matthew 24:3) This does not mean “the end of the world” as people fear it. Rather, the Bible describes a pattern of events and attitudes, or a sign, that would occur during a time period called “the last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1) Jesus told his followers that when they saw “these things occurring,” relief would soon follow. (Luke 21:31) Consider some of the prophecies that mark our time as unique.
              </p>
              <p>
               Prophecy 1:
              </p>
              <p>
               “Nation will rise against nation.”—Matthew 24:7.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: In the early years of the 20th century, many were expecting continued peace. The start of World War I shocked the world and began an era of unprecedented warfare. As the Bible book of Revelation foretold, peace was taken “away from the earth so that they [mankind] should slaughter one another.”—Revelation 6:4.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               “The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 still seems to mark the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.”—The Origins of the First World War, published in 1992.
Although the catastrophic death toll of World War I cannot be precisely determined, one encyclopedia estimates that military deaths alone totaled 8,500,000.
World War II was far more deadly, with figures varying from some 35 million to 60 million soldiers and civilians killed.
Between the end of the second world war and 2010, there were 246 armed conflicts in 151 locations worldwide.
Prophecy 2:
              </p>
              <p>
               “There will be food shortages.”—Matthew 24:7.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: Famine caused more than 70 million deaths in the 20th century and continues to be a global problem.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               According to the United Nations, hunger is the world’s greatest health risk, and 1 in 7 people worldwide currently do not have enough to eat.
“Today’s food shortages are not the result of one-time, weather-driven crop failures but rather of four critical long-term trends: rapid population growth, loss of topsoil, spreading water shortages and rising temperatures.”—Scientific American.
Prophecy 3:
              </p>
              <p>
               “There will be great earthquakes.”—Luke 21:11.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: Because more people live in earthquake-prone areas, the number of lives lost or disrupted as a result of earthquakes has sharply increased.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               The World Disasters Report 2010 says: “Of all large disasters, seismic events have killed the greatest number of people in recent years.”
Each year, from 1970 to 2001, there was an average of 19 earthquake disasters* reported, with an average death toll of 19,547. In the ten years before 2012, the average increased to 28 earthquake disasters per year, with an average death toll of 67,954.
Prophecy 4:
              </p>
              <p>
               “In one place after another pestilences.”—Luke 21:11.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: Despite medical advances, millions still die each year as a result of infectious diseases. International travel and the world’s growing urban population have increased the likelihood that disease outbreaks will spread rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               Smallpox killed an estimated 300 million to 500 million people in the 20th century.
The Worldwatch Institute reports that during the past three decades, “more than thirty previously unrecognized diseases such as Ebola, HIV, Hantavirus, and SARS have emerged as new threats.”
The World Health Organization has warned of the rise of drug-resistant germs, saying: “The world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which many common infections will no longer have a cure and, once again, [will] kill unabated.”
Prophecy 5:
              </p>
              <p>
               People will “betray one another and will hate one another. . . . The love of the greater number will cool off.”—Matthew 24:10, 12.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: Hate-fueled genocide has claimed the lives of millions. In numerous countries, armed conflicts and crime have led to cycles of increasing fear and violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               The Nazi regime killed six million Jews and millions of others. Regarding the reaction of ordinary citizens, author Zygmunt Bauman observes: “Mass destruction was accompanied not by the uproar of emotions, but the dead silence of unconcern.”
According to BBC News, it is estimated that some 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed within just a few months. One researcher estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the mass murder.
Each year, more than 740,000 people die as a result of crime and armed conflict.
Prophecy 6:
              </p>
              <p>
               “Men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . having no natural affection.”—2 Timothy 3:2, 3.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: Our era is one of greed and a lack of moral restraint. Such attitudes have fostered numerous social problems.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               A UNICEF UK report on child welfare says that parents and children in the United Kingdom “seemed to be locked into a compulsive consumption cycle.” Families buy material goods “in an attempt to compensate for relationship problems and social insecurity.”
An estimated 275 million children worldwide are exposed to domestic violence in the home.
“In the United States alone, over 500,000 older adults are believed to be abused or neglected each year.”—Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Prophecy 7:
              </p>
              <p>
               “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth.”—Matthew 24:14.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fulfillment: The Bible teaches that God’s Kingdom is a real government, ruling from heaven with Jesus as King. This heavenly Kingdom will “crush and put an end to all [human governments], and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”—Daniel 2:44.
              </p>
              <p>
               God’s Kingdom—both what it is and what it will do—is the central message taught by Jehovah’s Witnesses earth wide.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the evidence reveals:
              </p>
              <p>
               Worldwide, Jehovah’s Witnesses, numbering more than seven million in more than 230 lands, teach others about God’s Kingdom.
In print and online, Jehovah’s Witnesses have made Bible-based information available in over 500 languages.
The Sign and Your Future
              </p>
              <p>
               After examining the evidence, millions have concluded that the Bible’s sign of the last days is now being fulfilled. As the first six articles in this series have shown, history proves that the Bible is indeed a book of unerring prophecy.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can also have confidence in what the Bible foretells for the future. These prophecies will affect you, for God promises to bring an end to these traumatic last days. The remaining two articles in this series will explain how “the last days” will end and will also tell of the wonderful future ahead for the earth and mankind.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters defines an earthquake “disaster” as a seismic event that results in at least one of the following: 10 or more people killed, 100 or more people affected, the declaration of a state of emergency, or a call for international assistance.

               But it's not 'human nature' to do any of this stuff. It's a minority of humans who have that in their nature, so it's not applicable to humans in general.

            The owl is most likely Lilith, who was also fond of child sacrifice. She was Babylonian in origin, and basically the female version of Satan. Some say wife. Her name basically translates to "owl".
           </p>
           <p>
            Moloch was, as you say, an Ammonite God who also was worshiped occasionally by heretic Jews. The Ammonites were distantly related to the Jews, and spoke Hebrew. The Moabites also worshiped Moloch, but under a different name - Chemesh if I recall correctly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, it should be known that they have done genetic testing on Ashkenazi Jews, which shows they left the region in the 8th century BC. This makes sense, as it was precisely the time where the Assyrians conquered Jerusalem, and deported numerous tribes into Babylon. We can only presume that some of them went a bit North from Babylon, into what would become the Khazarian Khaganate. We can assume that some Ammonites and some Moabites went along with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, would some Jews have adopted Moloch and Lilith, Ammonite and Babylonian deities in the expulsion from Israel and Judah? I don't see why not, especially when losing a war in such an epic fashion. Probably a lot in terms of crisis of faith at that period. However, in Christian terms, these people following Moloch and Lilith would indeed be called "The Synagogue of Satan" - Jews who call themselves Jews, but are not, and lie.

            Moloch, and various spellings and other names, is none other that ha-satan, meaning "the satan."  The chief one is known by various names.  There are also lower demons. The satan has a chief, he has his body (meaning his angels and people).  So then the true messiah also has his body and his assembly, which is his body, plus his angels.  His followers = his body.
           </p>
           <p>
            So they are following Moloch. Again, he's known by many names.  Osiris, Moloch, Malcom, etc.  Still there is a chief one, but we do not know his name for sure, and it's not Lucifer.  Lucifer is another name for Venus in the Roman, and it's for Baal (Jupiter) in the ancient Hebrew.  The TRUE messiah star is Saturn, no joke!  However, the later Jews have the star Jupiter as being the messiah (the one opposite from the true one).  But anyway, you must keep this in mind, the chief satan is not as being portrayed in various symbols.  That is simply made up by man.  It's not real. What it is, is that they think it's real.  That's the key.  They are following "demons," the lowlife ones.  So stupid.  I can't tell
you who the possible true satan chief is because you would not believe me, plus it might hurt you.  It's too wild!

            The real meaning of "anti" in the early Greek means the one opposite from.

             Satan the Devil
Definition: The spirit creature who is the chief adversary of Jehovah God and of all who worship the true God. The name Satan was given to him because of his becoming a resister of Jehovah. Satan is also known as the Devil, because he is the foremost slanderer of God. Satan is described as the original serpent, evidently because of his using a serpent in Eden to deceive Eve, and for this reason “serpent” came to signify “deceiver.” In the book of Revelation, the symbolism of a devouring dragon is also applied to Satan.
How can we know whether such a spirit person really exists?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bible is the chief source of evidence. There he is repeatedly referred to by name (Satan 52 times, Devil 33 times). Eyewitness testimony as to Satan’s existence is also recorded there. Who was the eyewitness? Jesus Christ, who lived in heaven before coming to earth, repeatedly spoke of that wicked one by name.—Luke 22:31; 10:18; Matt. 25:41.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the Bible says about Satan the Devil makes sense. The evil that mankind experiences is far out of proportion to the malice of the humans involved. The Bible’s explanation of Satan’s origin and his activities makes clear why, despite the desire of the majority to live in peace, mankind has been plagued with hatred, violence, and war for thousands of years and why this has reached such a level that it now threatens to destroy all mankind.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there really were no Devil, accepting what the Bible says about him would not bring lasting benefits to a person. In many instances, however, persons who formerly dabbled in the occult or who belonged to groups practicing spiritism report that they were at that time greatly distressed because of hearing “voices” from unseen sources, being “possessed” by superhuman beings, etc. Genuine relief was gained when they learned what the Bible says about Satan and his demons, applied the Bible’s counsel to shun spiritistic practices, and sought Jehovah’s help in prayer.—See pages 384-389, under the heading “Spiritism.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Believing that Satan exists does not mean accepting the idea that he has horns, a pointed tail, and a pitchfork and that he roasts people in a fiery hell. The Bible gives no such description of Satan. That is the product of the minds of medieval artists who were influenced by representations of the mythological Greek god Pan and by the Inferno written by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Instead of teaching a fiery hell, the Bible clearly says that “the dead . . . are conscious of nothing at all.”—Eccl. 9:5.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is Satan perhaps only the evil within people?
Job 1:6-12 and 2:1-7 tell about conversations between Jehovah God and Satan. If Satan were the evil in a person, the evil in this case would have to be in Jehovah. But that is in complete disagreement with what the Bible tells us about Jehovah as being One “in whom there is no unrighteousness.” (Ps. 92:15; Rev. 4:8) It is noteworthy that the Hebrew text uses the expression has·Sa·tanʹ (the Satan) in the accounts in Job, showing that reference is being made to the one who is outstandingly the resister of God.—See also Zechariah 3:1, 2, footnote in NW Reference edition.
Luke 4:1-13 reports that the Devil endeavored to tempt Jesus to do his bidding. The account relates statements made by the Devil and answers given by Jesus. Was Jesus there being tempted by evil within himself? Such a view does not harmonize with the Bible’s description of Jesus as being sinless. (Heb. 7:26; 1 Pet. 2:22) Although at John 6:70 the Greek word di·aʹbo·losʹ is used to describe a bad quality that had developed in Judas Iscariot, in Luke 4:3 the expression ho di·aʹbo·los (the Devil) is used, thus designating a particular person.
Is blaming the Devil just a device used in an effort to escape from responsibility for bad conditions?
Some people blame the Devil for what they themselves do. In contrast, the Bible shows that humans often bear much of the blame for the badness they experience, whether at the hands of other humans or as a result of their own conduct. (Eccl. 8:9; Gal. 6:7) Yet, the Bible does not leave us ignorant of the existence and devices of the superhuman foe who has brought so much grief to mankind. It shows how we can get out from under his control.
            </p>
            <p>
             How powerful a figure is Satan in today’s world?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus Christ referred to him as being “the ruler of the world,” the one whom mankind in general obeys by heeding his urgings to ignore God’s requirements. (John 14:30; Eph. 2:2) The Bible also calls him “the god of this system of things,” who is honored by the religious practices of people who adhere to this system of things.—2 Cor. 4:4; 1 Cor. 10:20.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <em>
               Really pay attention to this part and think about who is running "kingdoms of the world"
              </em>
             </strong>
             When endeavoring to tempt Jesus Christ, the Devil “brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time; and the Devil said to him: ‘I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.’” (Luke 4:5-7) Revelation 13:1, 2 reveals that Satan gives ‘power, throne and great authority’ to the global political system of rulership. Daniel 10:13, 20 discloses that Satan has had demonic princes over principal kingdoms of the earth. Ephesians 6:12 refers to these as constituting ‘governments, authorities, world rulers of this darkness, wicked spirit forces in heavenly places.’
            </p>
            <p>
             No wonder that 1 John 5:19 says: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” But his power is only for a limited period of time and is only by the toleration of Jehovah, who is God Almighty.

             Interesting, when looking into various people linked to this and the companies they re directors of, I came across quite a few companies that had 'Jupiter' in their name. Do you think that means anything? Can you whisper to me who the possible true satan chief is?

              The bible doesn't say Satan's true name. God made sure to cover up his true name when Satan slandered the true God's name, which is Jehovah, or Yhwh (Yaweh). In English we say Jehovah as well as many other languages. Satan is not what the worldly artists depict him as. He is actually just an Angel who rebelled. The bible describes him as a high ranking Angel.

              How can we know whether such a spirit person really exists? The Bible is the chief source of evidence. Without the bible what history of the past eight thousand years of mankind do we have? We don't. There he is repeatedly referred to by name (Satan 52 times, Devil 33 times).

Jesus Christ, who lived in heaven before coming to earth, repeatedly spoke of that wicked one by name.—Luke 22:31; 10:18; Matt. 25:41.

              From where did Satan come?
             </p>
             <p>
              All of Jehovah’s works are perfect; he is not the author of unrighteousness; so he did not create anyone wicked. (Deut. 32:4; Ps. 5:4) The one who became Satan was originally a perfect spirit son of God. When saying that the Devil “did not stand fast in the truth,” Jesus indicated that at one time that one was “in the truth.” (John 8:44) (What are we doing when it comes to Pizza Gate? We are trying to expose the truth. We in a sense, are in the truth.) But, as is true of all of God’s intelligent creatures, this spirit son was endowed with free will. He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means “adversary.”
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope this helped. Ask me anything in the future and I'll answer it as best I can.
             </p>
             <p>
              And remember this when you look at everything the MSM is telling us and who is actually at the top and in control of it. “The original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, . . . is misleading the entire inhabited earth.”—Revelation 12:9.

              I'll have to think about it.  The very early Christians knew it.  We don't know 100%.  More like 99.7%.  Plus if I told you who they said, it requires a Bible study to understand it.  That's because it might hurt you, and I don't want that to happen.  Anyway, Yahushua (aka Jesus) was born on Oct. 3/4, 7 B.C.E. on the Day of Atonement.  Now that is a long study to look at all the evidence, plus astronomy software such as Voyager II, or whatever it's called now.  Is extremely precise. You have to put it all together line upon line, precept upon precept and historical references.  It's very interesting.

            This all has happened before again and again. Whether actually worshiping Moloch for ethereal and magical purpose or through proxy through the detachment, callousness, selfishness, power lust and sadism, the end results are the same. The corruption of the powerful that leads to preying on the vulnerable. In the end, no matter what their drive to rape, torture, kill or eat children and adults, the effects on their psyche and on society are roughly the same. Why do we keep seeing this same pattern? Because a cult of domination has real lasting power even if you do not believe in the mystic aspect. The cult of the elite is killing us and our children to satiate their lust for power and domination.

             So is it the case that they do all this sick shit, get found out, the people get angry and revolt, then stuff settles down, people think it's all been cleared out, but secretly there are some of them left over who manage to wiggle their way pack into power and take over again over a period of decades/centuries? How do we get rid of them for good?

              We must take a hard look at American culture, prosperity theology, the distribution of power, money and capital. There are systemic reasons that people who are narcissistic and sociopaths are dominating the police, board rooms, political offices and the media. To break they cycle, we must change the very ecology of our culture and power structure. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Concentration of wealth is concentration of power. In a corporate oligarchy ran government, AKA inverse totalitarianism, the masses of people are just another resource to exploit. In aggregate, the masses form a lasting capital to lord over.    We must accept that our dying  global capitalist system is really just edging ever closer to state monopoly capitalism AKA Stalinism.  Modern international companies are just as centrally planned as the USSR was. They are embedded in western government just as much as in the USSR.   The one thing always lost on western analysis of the fall of the USSR is that the Soviets were trying to make the USSR's economy reflect what America's would look like during the lest breaths of capitalism. Central planning like conglomerates. The merging of monopoly interests with state interests. The breaking of unions. The destruction of the social safety net. Rationing of health care and basic human needs. The one party system where you can vote for whom ever you like... so long as the elite have preapproved them.  The USSR was a monopoly capitalists wet dream, or so they thought. The corruption ate at the system and it finally fell through system complexity and corruption. Also the atrophy of the masses. It turns out having a population of starved and illiterate people does not make the best labor force. It turns out that lack of social mobility, freedom of expression, freedom of movement,  freedom of religion, and general lack of the most basic human rights atrophies the masses. We are facing those exact issues in America today. In the long run, the Soviets were proven correct. America is falling. We are rotting from the inside out. We are ignorant, uneducated, unmotivated, lack security of health, home and family. We are demoralized, demeaned and debilitated. The masses are rekked.

              How do fix it? Through democratizing the workforce. By bringing the common men and women back into politics. By kicking out the corrupt elite from every powerful position in our society. By decentralizing everything. By breaking up their global cabals. By declaring America a nation of the people, for the people and by the people through what ever means necessary. By a cultural and political revolution. By taking back what the elite have stolen from us over the generations. Capitalism has been a nice ride for some for centuries, but so was feudalism, slavery, mercantilism and other economic systems. They came to and end. We are looking hard at the end of this one. We must put away the old paradigms of leftists and alt right. Of Democrat and Republican. For those are all just the flip side of the same coin in the pocket of the elite.

            Keil and Delitzsch note in their Commentary on the Old Testament,[6] "It (the boundary of the tribe of Judah) then went up into the more elevated valley of Ben-Hinnom, on the south side of the Jebusite town, i.e., Jerusalem (see at Jos 10:1), and still farther up to the top of the mountain which rises on the west of the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and at the farthest extremity of the plain of Rephaim towards the north. The valley of Ben-Hinnom, or Ben-Hinnom (the son or sons of Hinnom), on the south side of Mount Zion, a place which was notorious from the time of Ahaz as the seat of the worship of Moloch (Kg2 23:10; Ch2 28:3; Ch2 33:6; Jer 7:31, etc.), is supposed there, but of whom nothing further is known (see Robinson, Pal. i. pp. 402ff.)." This reference in the Book of Joshua is the first mention in the Old Testament of this "Valley of the Sons of Hinnom".
           </p>
           <p>
            This valley, as Keil and Delitzsch note, is "on the south side of the Jebusite town, i.e., Jerusalem." This valley is mentioned five times in the Book of Jeremiah (7:31,32 19:2,6 32:35) as the place in which the people would "burn their sons and daughters in the fire" as part of the worship of Moloch as noted by Keil and Delitzsch.[6]

            Child sacrifice at other Tophets contemporary with the Bible accounts (700–600 BC) of the reigns of Ahaz and Manasseh have been established, such as the bones of children sacrificed at the Tophet to the goddess Tank in Phoenician Carthage,[13] and also child sacrifice in ancient Syria-Palestine.[14] Scholars such as Mosca (1975) have concluded that the sacrifice recorded in the Hebrew Bible, such as Jeremiah's comment that the worshippers of Baal had "filled this place with the blood of innocents", is literal,[15][16] while Mark Smith has stated that in the seventh century child sacrifice was a Judean practice performed in the name of Yahweh.[17] J. Day, Heider, and Mosca believe that the Molek cult took place in the valley of Hinnom at the Topheth [18] No archaeological evidence such as mass children's graves has been found, however it has been suggested that such a find may be compromised by the heavy population history of the Jerusalem area compared to the Tophet found in Tunisia.[19] The site would also have been disrupted by the actions of Josiah "And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech." (2 Kings 23). A minority of scholars have attempted to argue that the Bible does not portray actual child sacrifice, but only dedication to the god by fire; however, they are judged to have been "convincingly disproved" (Hay, 2011).[20]

            The oldest historical reference to the valley is found in Joshua 15:8, 18:16 which describe tribal boundaries. The next chronological reference to the valley is at the time of King Ahaz of Judah who sacrificed his sons there according to 2 Chron. 28:3. Since his legitimate son by the daughter of the High Priest Hezekiah succeeded him as king, this, if literal, is assumed to mean children by unrecorded pagan wives or concubines. The same is recorded of Ahaz' grandson Manasseh in 33:6. There remains debate about whether the phrase "cause his children to pass through the fire" meant a religious ceremony or literally child sacrifice.

            The Book of Isaiah does not mention Gehenna by name, but the "burning place" 30:33 in which the Assyrian army is to be destroyed, may be read "Topheth", and the final verse of Isaiah which concerns of those that have rebelled against God, Isaiah 66:24.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the reign of Josiah a call came from Jeremiah to destroy the shrines in Topheth and to end the practice Jeremiah 7:31-32, 32:35. It is recorded that King Josiah destroyed the shrine of Molech on Topheth, to prevent anyone sacrificing children there in 2 Kings 23:10. Despite Josiah's ending of the practice, Jeremiah also included a prophecy that Jerusalem itself would be made like Gehenna and Topheth (19:2-6, 19:11-14).

            <p>
             With regards to all the hellfire reference; What Did Jesus Teach About Hell?
“If your eye causes you to sin,” said Jesus, “get rid of it. You would be better off to go into God’s kingdom with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. The worms there never die, and the fire never stops burning.”—MARK 9:47, 48, Contemporary English Version.
            </p>
            <p>
             On another occasion, Jesus spoke of a judgment period when he would say to the wicked: “Depart from me, you accursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” He also said that these ones will “go off to eternal punishment.”—MATTHEW 25:41, 46, The New American Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
             AT FIRST glance, the above words of Jesus may seem to promote the teaching of hellfire. Obviously, Jesus did not intend to contradict God’s Word, which clearly states: “The dead no longer know anything.”—Ecclesiastes 9:5, NAB.
            </p>
            <p>
             To what, then, was Jesus referring when he spoke of a person’s being thrown “into hell”? Is “the eternal fire” Jesus warned of literal or symbolic? In what sense do the wicked “go off to eternal punishment”? Let us examine these questions one at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
             To what was Jesus referring when he spoke of a person’s being thrown “into hell”? The original Greek word translated “hell” at Mark 9:47 is Geʹen·na. This word comes from the Hebrew Geh Hin·nomʹ, meaning “Valley of Hinnom.” The Valley of Hinnom hugged the outskirts of ancient Jerusalem. In the days of the Israelite kings, it was used for child sacrifice—a disgusting practice that God condemned. God said that he would execute those who performed such an act of false worship. The Valley of Hinnom would then be called “the valley of slaughter,” where “the carcases of this people” would lie unburied. (Jeremiah 7:30-34, King James Version) Jehovah thus foretold that the Valley of Hinnom would become a place, not for the torture of live victims, but for the mass disposal of dead bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Jesus’ day, the inhabitants of Jerusalem used the Valley of Hinnom as a garbage dump. They threw the bodies of some vile criminals into this dump and kept a fire constantly burning there to dispose of the refuse and the carcasses.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Jesus spoke of the undying worms and unquenchable fire, he was apparently alluding to Isaiah 66:24. Regarding “the carcases of the men that have transgressed against [God],” Isaiah says that “their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.” (KJ) Jesus and his listeners knew that these words in Isaiah referred to the treatment of the carcasses of those not deserving a burial.
            </p>
            <p>
             Therefore, Jesus used the Valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, as a fitting symbol of death without hope of a resurrection. He drove this point home when he warned that God “can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (Matthew 10:28, NAB) Gehenna is a symbol of eternal death, not eternal torture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is “the eternal fire” Jesus warned of literal or symbolic? Note that “the eternal fire” mentioned by Jesus and recorded at Matthew 25:41 was prepared “for the devil and his angels.” Do you think that literal fire can burn spirit creatures? Or was Jesus using the term “fire” symbolically? Certainly “the sheep” and “the goats” mentioned in the same discourse are not literal; they are word pictures that represent two types of people. (Matthew 25:32, 33) The eternal fire that Jesus spoke of completely burns up the wicked in a figurative sense.

             In what sense do the wicked “go off to eternal punishment”? Although most translations use the word “punishment” at Matthew 25:46, the basic meaning of the Greek word koʹla·sin is “checking the growth of trees,” or pruning, cutting off needless branches. So while the sheeplike ones receive everlasting life, the unrepentant goatlike ones suffer “eternal punishment,” being forever cut off from life.

             It was and is a sick and heinous crime for someone to pass their children through the fire.  I'm telling you this, Yahweh will not put up with it, period.  But he will give a nation to repent of its sins.  It's just right now many in this nation do not know this, however, they will know it.  The people of the world will know it, and it will be a dark spot on us and those nations who did this mess.  It's a horrible thing.  I wish that I could explain how horrible that it is.

             Here is one other way that it's horrible.  I didn't do this mess, you didn't do this mess and others here didn't do it.  Millions of Americans would never do this horrible and evil crap.  But when a ruler of a nation rules, the sins of that ruler can pass onto the people. No joke! There would be much explain about this.  The sins of our present ruler (Obama) will be over soon, 2017.  That is a hugely important year because it's the last year of our unconditional blessing period that we have had for 70 years.  So it happens and we will see what happens after that. While a child is not responsible for their father's sins, then it's different with a nation.  This scares me knowing what I may now know.
