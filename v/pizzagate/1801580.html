<h2>Notinseln (Rescue islands)</h2>
<p>Notinseln is their most criticized project. Any shop nearby a school can take place in this program. The owner has to pay 750 Euros to get a sticker for their store front and a note what to do in cases of emergency. I have tried to get this paper but you can\'t find it online. If you wanna try it, the term for this paper would be &quot;Handlungsanweisungen&quot;. That\'s a hell of a price for just getting a sticker, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12316.jpeg">this one</a> to be exact, a sheet of paper and being officially responsible for kids in your neighbourhood. What are those partner stores for? 
In cases of emergencies children can go into those stores to recieve help. This practise is criticized because a real help would be an enviroment where children can ask any adult for help in cases of emergency. Some experts were warning this practise could lead to children searching for the right spot and getting caught because they can\'t find a Notinsel in time. </p>
<p>I would love to see the Handlungsanweisungen. Because I wonder if it says that in real heavy cases they should inform the Hänsel and Gretel Stiftung? Because maybe this whole project is for finding suitable kids for another aim? </p>
<p>Most interesting was a study done by the Kinderschutzbund (save children league). They asked some kids about their feelings around those Notinseln. Their answers are telling. <a href="http://www.kinderschutzbund-nrw.de/pdf/Ergebnisse%20NotinselnCo%20Final.pdf">Find it here</a> (german)</p>
<p>We should never underestimate the intuition of a child!</p>
<h2>Childrens negativ ratings and reason</h2>
<h1>Children who wouldn\'t visit those stores made following statements:</h1>
<ul>
<li>would be better to give every child a mobile phone with emergency call on it</li>
<li>rather hang posters everywhere that tell children who to get help</li>
<li>I don\'t dare to go inside because I don\'t know them</li>
<li>This sticker is fake</li>
<li>Those stores aren\'t safe</li>
<li>completely perverted, could be some men which do stuff to kids</li>
<li>Perverts abuse us</li>
<li>We get raped there</li>
<li>What will they do to me?</li>
<li>depends on the store. If it is creepy, no way!</li>
<li>affraid of being rejected</li>
<li>I have got no idea what kind of people working there …</li>
<li>No, they inform the youth welfare service</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Kein Täter werden (Don\'t become an offender)</h2>
<p>The foundation is working the field from both sides. They have a program for pasedophiles which gets <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12317.png">communicated very disturbingly</a> on their web page. Find this page <a href="http://haensel-gretel.de/projekte/kein-taeter-werden">here</a>. It is not just the picture. The claim to it is so twisted that it\'s hard to understand the actual meaning. It says</p>
<h3>Not klicking prohibits abuse</h3>
<p>This is a double negation so to say. Not is negative and prohibiting is a negative term, too. It leaves you a little bewildered. Plus: How can not klicking anything be saving any kids? Whatever, I really support the idea of prevention. When I read those boylover Forums, I think that some education about children rights, their consciousness and development could help. Although people who take those offers are less likely to harm anybody and if so they are registrated. But in this case, I feel something isn\'t right with the Hänsel and Gretel Stiftung. </p>
<p>By the way <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12320.png">this is their appereance</a> on a press conferens about the don\'t become an offender project</p>
<hr />
<h2>Kindergerechte Videoanhörungszimmer (video taping rooms suitable for children)</h2>
<p>Another project they advertise on their webpage are the video taping rooms. Maybe that\'s just a good idea for supporting kids who have to give evidence, but maybe this room is more? A comfortable room where children get filmed? Maybe its rentable?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Kinderschutzkongresse (children saving congresses)</h2>
<p><a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12321.png">forums for politics, &quot;experts&quot; and practise</a>
Why the quotation marks ???</p>
<p>*What does &quot;expert&quot; actually stand for? *</p>
<hr />
<h2>Kulturlotsen (culture pilots)</h2>
<p>This projects convey private sponsorships for children. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ein fester Kreis an ehrenamtlichen und kulturbegeisterten Paten trifft auf Kinder, im Alter von 6 bis 12 Jahren, damit sie gemeinsam die Begeisterung für die Kultur entdecken. </p>
<p>A steady circle of voluntary and culture excited godparents meets up with children between 6 and 12 years old so together they can explore the enthusiasm for culture. </p>
<p>Jährlich gibt es 60 Patenschaften mit Mädchen und Jungen. Häufig besitzen die Kinder einen Migrationshintergrund. Die Stiftung wird für den Bestand des Projektes sorgen und den Ausbau betreiben, auch die Übertragung in andere Regionen nach diesem Beispiel anstreben.</p>
<p>Every year there are 60 sponsorships with boys and girls. Frequently those children have an immigration background. The foundation will keep this project running and pushing forward the  further development, even transfering this project into other regions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A steady circle sounds like they have their god parents all together, not searching for new ones. So a group of people gets handed out new children every year to visit museums and art exhibitions, concerts and other stuff, we now know can be realy dangerous for a kid without their parents. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/stiftunghanselgretel/videos">their youtube channel</a>. Lots of children meeting politicians or other adults there. </p>
<p>This is <a href="https://youtu.be/rhg1vn3XMEw?t=145">their commercial for the NOTINSEL project</a>, where a child (around 8 to 10 years, I guess) <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/51ce410c12/12328.png">has the name TIM written to her forehead and is wearing a choker</a>. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Speculation and connecting dots</h2>
<p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201612081048318106-german-authorities-sexual-abuse/">Mind this article</a> about the scandal that hit Germany last year. The Berlin Senate had a project in the seventies which sent street kids to convicted child abuseres and made them foster parents. Could the Kulturlotsen be such a thing? Children getting handed out to Paedophiles?</p>',

            I don't think so. I do help children and I don't know any person who wouldn't. I think the majority would help. This sticker thing makes absoloutely no sense, other than making money. It's not even like they would recieve a training for situations of emergency. They really just got a stciker and this "Handlungsanweisungen" note. It's totally useless for the shop owners or children.

            Saw this today here In the video, watch if u havent,  he describes the "hair of sheep are angels on the st peters basilica throne. Biggest throne in the world spmething like that, hes a little whacky, i think hes right about backward speak. Avo/ova makes sense but really interesting about the sheep because the hansel gretel evening prayer about the 14 angels seems like a link. Between the wool as hair of sheep that are (being devoured by satan?)  Turn into angels. Just maybe the wool is more significant based in luciferian origin. Seems likely. Also the basilica throne turned upside down is a vagina with every exact thing in place ovaries etc... I've heard this before about the pizza slice symbol the wedge could simply be a vagina. This guys thing is not all about sheep but is interesting .

             Wow! Thank you. I really like this guy. I know he's not so popular round here but I feel like he really has some deep insights. I also thought about Jesus sheep. I remember christians and especially his disciples being called that way. In Psalm 23 the Lord is called my shepard. 
And in Germany, I think this is similar all around the world a sheep is used as as symbol for dumb people, the masses if you will. Sheep follow the mainstream like they would follow their shepard (or leader).
            </p>
            <p>
             The word Sheep production sounds disgusting either way you put it. 
It's awful to think about any being as being produced. This is a technical term which mocks any soul. So, it would be awful to think about sheep as something to "produce" and then "profit" from. To them it's just a product it seems.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what if …? What if the sheep production is more about producing sheep in terms of "stupid followers".
Or what if it is about producing angles/babys? They are offending beings anyway. What ever they may mean exactly.

              More likely angels/babies, the guy is intense, but the story of the hairs is compelling. DNA strands type stuff comes to mind. 
Also I posted about the searches for heart tolerance match the searches for heart transplant tolerance, the heart progress search as well and the medical molecular/celular biology science industry being forefront and that works out as progress. Most of the bigger companies like basf have an interest in it,. Like growing organs because that's the human problem our organs go out. The term sheep production does sound mocking! I think that metaphorically there is something to the string of wool and connecting it to hansel and Gretel story. Absolutely chilling. I think it's meant to chill and back a person up from checking it out. Because it's such a dark thought. So there's light on it, it'll get clearer. It's unfolding and we can't know what will happen. Ps Im not sure if you even know that we have a pedophile activist problem and it's actually in my locality in the bay area, anyway they call themselves heart progress. They have a face book.and website and followers! Hence my searches.
Ps dangerous times.

               I've read about it on voat, I think. Or somewhere else. But I haven't had the time to look into this growing organs subject. But it's definitely on my list.

             Thanks for the ping :) I watched the commercial video and to tell you the truth, I don't think this could be seen as evidence of abuse if simply for the fact that lack of Vitamin D and lack of sleep could certainly be the reason behind the dark circles around the eyes and probably more noticeable on those children with light skin complexion. They could simply have not been exposed to the sun long enough to develop a Vitamin D deficiency. The girl's choker is another baseless assumption, I see this as a fashion trend, HOWEVER, this here

             is NOT acceptable and it is EXTREMELY suspicious. I absolutely have to remind people here that if "an image is worth a thousand words", THIS says a whole fucking lot! That boy seems petrified and the pedophile looks like he's proudly taking a picture with his latest prized catch!

              Thanks for your reply.  I always appreciate info I may not be privy to.  The pic of the boy and man is outrageous.  I think there are enough suspicious situations on here to raise more than en eyebrow.

            i found another articel from 2009 stating that the foundations spokesman and "organ" is "Jerome Braun".
He also registered a mentorfoundation and a TV foundation at the same address with telephone nrs only 1 digit changed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could be some scam or fraud, but could also be nothing. Couldn't find anything PG related so far.

             I think you are spot on with the Sex Kitten programming connection to the yarn ball. Yet there may be something more horrible lurking with regards to this situation. The so-called "fable" of Hantzel and Gretel is actually not fake, it is a real system experienced by many sentients. The women who are in this organization on the main page are very likely of godheads who have been through the Hantzel and Gretel system (most as the Witch who eats the children). Also just think about it, it is a horrible fable to begin with - why name an organization that is supposed to "help" (in satanic crypto-speak that means kill) children? It wouldn't surprise me if more horrible things are going with regards to this group. E.g. The kind of horrible witches that attend the Brocken mountain witches gathering every year.

              The link for their commercial for the Notinsel Project is a STUNNER.  Every child has dark circles under their eyes.  Some are just lightly dark and some are really dark circles, but all of them as I could see have circles under their eyes.  Those of us that are familiar with this look, know what it means.  Sexual Abuse.  Please Have A Look.  This really shocked me.

                Here is something I found.  Dark circles can occur when the skin under your eyes thins, exposing the blood vessels, which produces the dark discoloration. Fatigue and aging are the most common causes of dark circles, but allergies, anemia, congestion, eczema, lifestyle factors, and irregular pigmentation can also contribute to the existence of dark circles. Eye irritation, heredity, nasal congestion, history of sun exposure, and loss of skin elasticity can also cause dark circles. Either accidental or nonaccidental (abuse) trauma can cause dark circles to appear as a consequence of superficial or deep hemorrhages. Hope this explains it some.

                I don't really know, now that you mention it.  I remember when I first started on here I read about how the panda bear look was the circles around their eyes and it was a sign.  I just never looked into how it happened, and I believe it was because I did not want to know.  It was just one more sad thing.  In my mind, if you really must know, I imagined it was because their abuser never  let them sleep, they were abusing them hour after hour?  That is the part I never really wanted to know. It is a sign though, for  the pedos just love those pandas.  But your answer may be right.

              I see their logo is similar to the Wool Logo.  There was a post yesterday about the Wool Mark Logo maybe being suspect.  If you look really close, there is a resemblance to the swirl, and a great way to hoodwink us and try to fool us.  I think it is a possibility.

                OOPS.  Sorry.  What do you think about the logo being suspect?  I will look through the site as well.  Am German but not as proficient as I was.

              That article isn't that bad because they want to prevent pedophiles from taking action against children. So they try to stop the pedophiles from going after kids. There is nothing wrong about. If there is a place where pedos can go to prevent child rape it is good in every way. ...many pedos hide it till it breaks out and then rape kids. ...if there are ppl the pedo can talk to he may never will do it.

              him
             </a>
             ! 
Klaus M. Beier. He is working for the Charité (univesity hospital) and
             <a href="http://www.exberliner.com/features/lifestyle/loving-kids-the-wrong-way/">
              gave an interview about Paedophilia
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             From this interview:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Q: But where do you draw the line?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              A: Literature, for example, is full of characters being attracted to the pure, virginal beauty of a little boy or girl. Thomas Mann’s infatuation for the young Tadzio on a Venice beach... does it make him a paedophile? There’s nothing wrong or abnormal with being sensitive to a kid’s beauty... But once you get aroused by that child, and the memory of that child induces an orgasm during masturbation, then you have crossed the line. Artistic depictions of those fantasies are a grey area, though: whether you draw or paint kids or write novels, you’ve got to be careful not to slip into the illegal realm of child pornography.

              There is nothing wrong about that answer. He is just describing what is illegal and how far ppl are allowed to go if you look at the law. Also I couldn't find anything suspicious on their homepage so I don't know how to dig further as I can't see anything there!?

               I don't know either. Just sharing what I found. Most suspiscious about them is that they run their foundations as so called social-franchise which is a great way for raising money and to distribut it irreproducible.

            I can probably clear up one issue: the wool. If you unravel it while walking, you can trace your way back (home). This is basically what Haensel and Gretel did it in this old narrative, although they used bread crumbs instead.

              From what I remember, the story went like this: The kids overheard the parents talking about leaving them in the middle of the forest. One of them sneaked out and collected rocks. The next day, as the parents led them into the woods, the kid dropped the rocks. Then they used the rocks to find their way back. The parents were pissed off, locked the kids up, then took them into the forest again. This time the kids used the bread crumbs, but when they tried to find their way back, they couldn't because birds had eaten the bread. That's when they got mixed up with the witch.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't remember wool really playing a role in the story, except maybe with what the kids were wearing?

               Grimm's fairy tales were based on real incidents so obviously back then kids were being abducted and abused then cooked and eaten. All the Grimm stories are based in fact.

              I just found another explanation: if you look at the wool, you can see that it is supposed to form a "&amp;" which would make the name into "Haensel and Gretel". I really think that's all there is to that.

              Yes, I know, no mention of wool anywhere else. One explanation could be that bread crumbs would have been too difficult to be incorporated in a logo because nobody would have recognized them as such. Also, when we were kids, we did use wool to play "trace back".

            In particular, the kids said "Besser finde ich, dass jeder ein Handy geschenkt bekommt mit dem
            <em>
             Polizei
            </em>
            ruf drauf" So they trust the police more than the Jugendamt (CPS) and would call the cops before calling a friend or their parents. I think that's really interesting. There is a lot of media putting out the notion that cops are friendly people - think Toto und Harry, or how there always seems to be a positive character who is a cop in kids cartoons - but not anything to make CPS seem nice. I wonder if MSM is going to start pushing that idea with TV shows, movies, etc.

            The fact that businesses have to pay for the sign is really suspect. To me it seems like they're paying for the ease of luring kids in (not making any accusations based on fact, but just feeling) In North America there is a thing called Block Parents. I always felt it was kinda creepy when I was a kid, but it does appear to be a legit program. I went to their website and there is
            <a href="http://www.blockparent.ca/program_costs.htm">

            I find in Germany, titles are really important. If you say you're an expert, you have to have some sort of credentials. Perhaps these are people who are experts based on lived experience, but don't have a degree in Sociology or Psychology or whatever. Or, you know, they're pedos.

             Every single one of their press conference pictures (whatever the occasion) doesn't look like pictures I am used to see when it comes to childrens rights. Think about any press conference on this matter. You most likely will imagine some friendly people (most of them women) smiling powerfull into some cameras and faces.

             Their pictures somehow never fit my maybe restricted imagination.

             sorry for not being accurate. You're right. But I think it is clever to first call the police and than your parents, don't you think? Because police definitely has more ressources like a parent. If the parent is far away working he/she can't help right away. But I would want my child to inform me after that.

              That's okay :) I thought your translations were good.

              In some communities, especially in North America, calling the police can create more problems. I find the cops in Germany to be a lot more relaxed, but I'm a pasty skinned person with blue eyes soooo... Personally, I would train a kid to get as far away from the situation as possible, especially before taking out a phone. Standing there and talking on a phone while the person is there isn't a good idea. Calling 112 won't help you if the guy is right there to snatch the phone from your hand and drag you away.

               I just remembered - like a month or so ago, I remember some late night / early morning show playing on MDR or some bullshit. It was a cop show where they investigated crimes to do with kids. All of the cases were framed in a way where the Jugendamt was going to help. Though to be honest, the cases were pretty fucked up. Like one mother had a teenage daughter living in a room that looked like it was for a toddler.
