            All the clerical pedophiles have to do is look concerned and issue some "guidelines" and Catholics just give in.

            Catholic hierarchy have such contempt for the sheeple and are so well insulated in their rainbow bubble world that they really believe tossing a few crumbs out to us will work. Somehow I don't think that's going to work this time. Far more people are wise to their tricks and semantics.

             Yes, we must never make the mistake, to believe, that the bishops do not know.  The bishops are always in the loop, the know everything.  They did not get to where they are by keeping their eyes and ears closed.  They are part of keeping it all secret.  I think you are right, even though there are those catholics that still idolize the pope and the church, the cat is out of the bag.  There are many that know and will net forget.  The problem is, that many are leaving God as well.
