<p>Sorry for the pizzagate break, after the numerous death threats I was getting I took some time to for myself and stayed off Voat for a while. Not dead don\'t worry, just needed a long break to find my head. For those wondering what I have been up I\'ve been keeping up to date with the virus on my YT channel covering it. Just made a shoutout to Voat in my latest video and admited I was a pizzagate researcher. </p>

<p>For those threatening me, I have no idea if you are just trying to catfish me into looking into Racine and distracting myself from everything else down a dead rabbit hole and the threats were a way to do that, or if it was legit, ether way I <em>will</em> find out.</p>

            Hi GamePawn hope yr doing well.  I think the work you and many others did on Pizzagate some amazing research took place on Voat back.then. Mostly its rubbish on here but I still find the occasional gem.  Like u still waiting for the expose on Racine ... I get the feeling if they know so much why not just put it out there.  Stay safe

             Do you notice how they attempt to coddle you with the Bad Cop Worse Cop routine? They ‘hope you are doing well’ and ‘glad you got a well-deserved break’. They want you to tell them everything you know, and they ‘will protect you from disinformation and take care of you’. They will bribe you with false status as a ‘well respected researcher’ if you play by their rules. Just don’t investigate Racine or they will want you dead and buried as what happened to others. They will claim your time is too valuable to waste on the Root of All Evil and model for the real Agenda of Eternal Enslavement. Does that make sense? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? They don’t.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing is safe any more, and the more you share the safer you will be. They had to wait several months to take out

             for this very reason. They did not want to make it too obvious. They will make ‘accidents’ happen. The virus is now the perfect excuse to remove those who know too much. We know you are a younger man who may not have the decades of experience to see how extensive the network is, or know how to discern when you are being manipulated, but it should be pretty obvious by now that they are desperate to keep anyone from investigating Racine. Look at what

             figured out from simple research and paying attention to the manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             We exposed the corrupt moderators long ago. Srayzie was running blackmail operations here as a moderator of Pizzagate and after she started the GreatAwakening. Do you really think she ‘walked away’? Many moderators and their legion have stalked, attacked and issued death threats to those who know too much as they did to you. This is why they are lying and telling everyone that The Truth is “a pedo protecting bot”. The Truth exposes elite pedophiles and a completely controlled community of pedophiles. The Truth is not a bot. The Truth is Real. Jesus Christ is Real.

            - Research Anything spoken of, and you will find that Everything shared about Racine is The Truth since The Beginning. This is why other moderators have issued death threats against you and in some cases were acted upon including

            Jesus Christ and The Truth are The Only Way. Do not fall for the tactics of corrupt moderators and those who make threats, censor, ban, lie, slander, attack and have openly partnered with those who worship Satan and drink blood.

            and others have easily been able to verify so much of the information shared. Racine is not a distraction. Racine is THE ROOT of all Evil and the model for the Real Agenda beyond 21 and 2030 of Eternal Enslavement forged through the Great Deception of Sustainability (Satan’s Ability) with the Mark of the Beast enforced by 5G+ AI, Smart Cities, Resilient Communities and Community Policing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look back into Sustainable Racine and see who Bill Clinton appointed to the President’s Council on Sustainable Development. What are the the connections to Brazil and other global trafficking hubs? Who ran Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign in Wisconsin and what do they do now? What happened to the past mayors and other officials in the area?

           <p>
            SenateAnon told everyone to “keep digging into Racine” and then vanished. Q followed and has never explained why Paul Ryan resigned, why Trump made The Deal for the 8th Wonder of the World, or how NXIVM and the Knights of Pythias are two of many more groups directly associated with Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NXIVM doctor, Danielle Roberts, is from Racine and practiced in the area. The Podestas were made in Racine and lived a bit south over the border in Lake Forest. Art in Embassies was built with collections from Racine companies. The World Core Curriculum was created in Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Path of Souls is directly connected with Racine and its unique global position. The area was founded by the Astors.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Rothschilds themselves live in Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The community is controlled by corrupt pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is a major hub for trafficking and the Fight to End Exploitation was a cover for those involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan did not resign to spend more time with his family.

            How many small cities under 80,000 receive a billion dollar referendum endorsed by Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, controlled by the brother of a famous actress known for playing vampire roles?

            That 70’s Show was based on Racine and included a cast of Scientologists and Freemasons with characters named Red Fez.

           <p>
            The list goes on and on forever. Who would ever tell you NOT to investigate something so obvious? Why would those who investigate be threatened unless there was much more to the story?
