<blockquote>
<p>The tremendously destructive Woolsey Fire has been widely reported as beginning “near” the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL or Rocketdyne), but it appears that the fire began on the Rocketdyne property itself.  Cal Fire identifies the fire location as E Street and Alfa Road, a location that is in fact on SSFL. It was recently reported that the “Chatsworth electric substation” experienced a disturbance 2 minutes before the fire was reported, but that substation is in fact on SSFL, near that location.  A photograph posted on Twitter from KCAL9’s Stu Mundel shows the fire starting Thursday afternoon near the same location, which is only about 1,000 yards away from the site of the 1959 partial nuclear meltdown of the Sodium Reactor Experiment (SRE) reactor. </p>
<p>The Chatsworth substation is located “within the larger <strong>Boeing Rocketdyne Santa Susana complex</strong>,” according to a CPUC document </p>

<p>Well, we have a couple of  posts on voat which reference  Aerojet Rocketdyne: </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1724505">Ashton Kutcher, a Thai Massage Parlour, Studio City in North Hollywood, military connections, an Indian orphanage and the Clinton Global Initiative : 6 degrees</a></strong>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2015 Ashton Kutcher was spotted coming out of a Thai massage parlour <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373381/Ashton-Kutcher-pictured-leaving-Hollywood-massage-parlour-solo-visit.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3373381/Ashton-Kutcher-pictured-leaving-Hollywood-massage-parlour-solo-visit.html</a> . Their website: &quot;http: losangeles.backpage.(com)/TherapeuticMassage/ancient-massage-free-table-shower-grand-opening-818-760-2288/50587668&quot; </p>
<p>[URL is in quotation marks and slightly modified because the address is not an accepted link] </p>
<p>The place has been troubling me for a number of reasons and so I went back to have another look today. If you use Google maps to look up the address (11335 Moorpark St, North Hollywood, CA 91602 ) you will see that it is in a retail centre with other businesses right next to it. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lAVZeImgur">http://imgur.com/a/lAVZeImgur</a> Album</p>
<p>So, looking up the massage parlour\'s address I came across this database : <a href="http://datagovus">http://datagovus</a>.(com)/los-angeles-business.php?id=0002804276-0002-8</p>
<p>It includes a long list of businesses at the adjoining address of 10333 which I thought strange after looking at the physical location.</p>
<p>The first business that jumped out at me was <strong>Smack Ass Productions inc.</strong>
Agent is Christine Karasseferian at business address 10200 Sepulveda Blvd #140, Mission Hills CA 91345.</p>
<p>She is an accountant at AGI Accounting <a href="http://www.agiaccounting.com/">http://www.agiaccounting.com/</a> . She is also Finance officer at First Christian News <a href="http://fccnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-27-01.pdf">http://fccnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2016-27-01.pdf</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Her partner at AGI Accounting is Jyoti Gaur.</strong>  According to the Linkedin profile <strong>Jyoti worked at Aerojet Rocketdyne for 17 years.</strong></p>
<p>Also Jyoti also follows this boys\' orphanage in India: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahara_Ramakrishna_Mission_Boys">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahara_Ramakrishna_Mission_Boys</a>\'_Home_High_School</p>
<p>An earlier biography when she was studying for her MBA revealed more:  <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/centers/sbl/whos/students">https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/centers/sbl/whos/students</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jyoti\'s passion for environmental and sustainability issues led her to Marshall\'s Society and Business Lab. Exposure to a number of inspiring social entrepreneurs during her time at the SBL helped Jyoti solidify and expand her ideas and goals. During the summer of 2010, Jyoti interned at the Deshpande Foundation in India. She created a network for NGOs that works with the HIV/AIDS community by using mobile phone technology in rural India. Her experience was invaluable to her career goal of working for a socially responsible investment fund that focuses on international development and emerging energy projects. Jyoti was selected as a 2011 Clinton-Orfalea Fellow with the <strong>Clinton Global Initiative</strong> in New York.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another listing for Smack Ass Productions inc. showed a Steve Valentine as President <a href="https://www.productionco.org/smack-ass-productions-inc">https://www.productionco.org/smack-ass-productions-inc</a>.  Now, I don\'t know who this person is, I haven\'t spent much time looking but a quick google search did bring up a character from the series <em>Dexter</em> with the name Steve Valentine <a href="http://dexter.wikia.com/wiki/Steve_Valentine"><strong>who was a pedophile that targeted small boys</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another post points to a masonic lodge or the <strong>International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers  that both Dyncorp and Aerojet belong to</strong>: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1750303/8572639">Came across this old post that I thought deserved more attention - Ashok &amp; Amrita Mahbubani (Podesta Emails)</a></p>

             Barbara Dana Broccoli OBE (born June 18, 1960) is an American-British film producer known for her work on the James Bond film series.
            </p>
            <p>
             Broccoli is the daughter of the James Bond producer Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli and actress Dana Wilson Broccoli (born Dana Natol). In 1995, Cubby Broccoli handed over control of Eon Productions, the production company responsible for the James Bond series of films, to Barbara and her half-brother Michael G. Wilson; they continue to run the company as of 2018.[4] Barbara became President of the National Youth Theatre[5] after the success of their 60th Anniversary Diamond Gala at Shaftesbury Theatre in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             Broccoli married and divorced director and film producer Frederick M. Zollo.[when?][3] She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2008 New Year Honours

            <p>
             Broccoli was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, the younger of two children of immigrants from the Calabria region of Italy, Giovanni Broccoli and Kristina Vence.[1] He acquired his nickname after his cousin, mobster Pat DiCicco, began calling him "Kabibble," eventually shortened to "Kubbie" and adopted by Broccoli as "Cubby."[1] The family later bought a farm in Smithtown, New York, on Long Island,[2] near their relatives the DiCiccos
            </p>
            <p>
             At the beginning of the 1950s, Broccoli moved once more, this time to London, where the British government provided subsidies to film productions made in the UK with British casts and crews. Together with Irving Allen, Broccoli formed Warwick Films that made a prolific and successful series of films for Columbia Pictures.

            <p>
             A notable lobbyist and a man of integrity, Mr. Oliver Kellman is receiving bad press on online media sites lately. The information is not just untrue but unruly and uncalled for as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Oliver Kellman, Jr., is a lobbyist with a decent showing and a reputation to be proud of. The affable man with a calm demeanor and sharp wit continues to be an authority in domestic and international Public Policy and geopolitical engagement. Through his eponymous foundation OKW Holdings, Oliver is catering to the geopolitical consulting needs of a global clientele with genuine concern, integrity, and focus. Due to his leadership and professionalism, the foundation has grown in outreach and influence. Presently, OKW Holdings has offices in Washington, DC, New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, along with affiliated partnership offices in several offshore destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Rip-off Report accuses Mr. Oliver of frauds that never happened. The report is filed by someone who wants to remain anonymous for reasons best known to him/her, which undermines the credibility of the information outright.
             <strong>
              The report accuses Mr. Oliver and his brother to be the kingpin of all kinds of fronts, among which illegal arms running and soliciting hookers are the most serious.

             In the case of the Haiti response, our network of resources and agencies tells us that the critical need is for financial support to enable aid agencies to activate their assistance and be nimble in their response.

             Therefore, Kaiser Permanente is pledging $500,000 in financial support for immediate disaster relief to the following organizations:

             Wow that was some old thread.  I wonder what we might find on Kaiser in Haiti.  So we would probably be looking for Kaiser Permanente now.  Is Giustra tied to Kaiser and if so is Valentine also since he's tied to Giustra?  Valentine and Kaiser might be a start.  These people start out OK and then boom before you know it they start getting caught up with really bad people and stuff.  Amazing that Kaiser now  somehow ties into Heather O. Evidently those that took part in her death knew exactly where to take her.

            The Mormon church was set up by a Freemason,  Joseph Smith.  A lot of masonic symbols and rituals are used in Mormonism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of the Mormon Church is to track bloodlines for the intelligence agencies.  (prior DNA and the internet)
           </p>
           <p>
            Same as the Jehovah's Witnesses were set up by intelligence agencies / Freemasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            They both have their own courts. Things must go to the elders first.
           </p>
           <p>
            And a record for pedophilia and Ritual Satanic Abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much like the Jew's and Muslim's, they don't respect the laws of their host nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            So many cover ups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joseph Smith ended up in gaol for pedophillia,  allegedly making masonic hand symbols for assistance.

            There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!
           </p>
           <p>
            With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!
           </p>
           <p>
            "The president's message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines," said CPF President Brian K. Rice.
           </p>
           <p>
            The president later changed his tune. He said on Wednesday that he had spoken with California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) "to let him know that we are with him, and the people of California, all the way!"
           </p>
           <p>
            WTH is going on here?  I really don't know.

              The biggest misconception is that it doesn’t rain in California. The fact is, it does rain, even in Los Angeles and southern California. But we throw away most of that water because rather than collect it, we let it drain into the sea.

             Now why would that be?  Why are Californians allowing this?

                Ferrerro bought Nestle.  They seem to be gobbling up everything.  They also own bottled water co.  I would imagine they still get the water from Cal.  Is Chocolate City in Burlington Wi.?

                According to Noonan: "The three of them sat like old friends and discussed strategies and made treaties. Clintons crimes were to be set aside until his wife finished two terms of working with Republicans to shore up the base and move away from these Trump loving racists as Ryan put it.    Lynch would seal the deal by not investigating the Clintons further. Ryan gets to remain Speaker, the Democrats get the Senate and the White House and 2024 is up for grabs.     The pilot never got to tell his story on Fox News because he ended up dead even though under heavy guard.   Just as some of us have expected.  When will people learn that there are not 2 parties.  They are all working together behind the curtain, against all of us.    Paul Ryan is up to something with Rahm Emanuel which should all frighten us.

                I have hated them since I found out what they were up to 30 years ago.  HQ in Switzerland   They used to have rug making factories in India that employed small children that worked so many hours that they turned blind.    Yes they are evil.

            , you've got what is probably a completely inaccurate per Rule 2 statement here:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a masonic lodge or the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers that both Dyncorp and Aerojet belong to
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The IAM is a huge international labor union for aerospace machinists, not a Masonic Lodge. Unless there is some actual evidence that the union is a Masonic organization, this claim makes this whole thread look like disinfo. (You may not be aware, but we have a history of numerous sketchy accounts pushing bogus claims about Masonic affiliation to push important topics into the "conspiracy theory" dismissal zone and probably protect Masons actually involved in criminal activity by muddying the waters).
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm also having a difficult time understanding how this thread shows any direct relevance between the Woolsey fire and pizzagate per Rule 1. It happened at a property that was once owned by a company that once employed the business partner of someone who happens to own a business next door to a business that Ashton Kushner once was seen entering? I'm sorry, but that just doesn't meet our definition of PG relevance. It's pretty much 100% speculative.  While those individual tidbits are definitely interesting and worth researching as leads, this belongs in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            until actual relationships can be documented.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give this the 24 Hour Grace flair because that is our policy, but this really doesn't belong here as written at this point.

             On May 5, 1888, Thomas W. Talbot, a railroad machinist in Atlanta, Georgia, founded the Order of United Machinists and Mechanical Engineers. Talbot and 18 others had been members in the Knights of Labor. Talbot believed that a union needed to be formed for railroad machinists that would resist wage cuts. He wanted to provide insurance against unemployment, illness, and accidents but also wanted railroad machinists to be recognized for their craft skill. Unlike the Knights of Labor, who accepted everyone, Talbot's union accepted only white U.S. citizens, preferably native-born. The union excluded blacks, women, and non-citizens, and had secret passwords. Despite the secrecy, the order spread beyond Georgia, thanks in part to "boomers", men who traveled the railway lines for work. These boomers established local lodges in new areas. Within one year there were 40 lodges, and by 1891, there were 189.

             Certainly knighthood and all its appendant evils was nothing to which the average citizen of today, and more especially the average workingman, would aspire. The role of the workman in the chivalric society of the middle ages was only a little lower than that of the knights' horses and hounds. But regardless of the incongruity involved, workmen usually seemed discontented with the origin of their organizations and endeavor to prove, to themselves at least, some type of noble origin.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Knights of Labor blessed their organization with elaborate ceremonies, many of the reminiscent of the Masonic institution.
            </p>
            <p>
             This order maintained great secrecy, and until about 1880 was not even called by its proper name in communications, the symbol for the name of the order being a "triangle within a circle" or, at other periods. "Five stars." In fact, the order carried its secrecy to such a degree that in many calls were even chalked in secret symbols on sidewalks or fences to summon the membership to the meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of this secrecy and indeed most of the ritual of the order can be traced to Uriah Stevens, who belonged to a great number of fraternal organizations, including the Masonic fraternity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually the thing which he and his contemporaries were trying to create when they founded the Knights of Labor was not particularly a trade union but a type of Masonic order for the working classes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think  this information shows proof that there is  "actual evidence that the union is a Masonic organization".

             This is the reason I posted here, for that kind of feedback,  People need to look at pizzagate from a SYSTEMS point of view, not only individual cases of pedophilia. Compartmentalisation is the reason they've been getting away with it for so long.

               People need to look at pizzagate from a SYSTEMS point of view, not only individual cases of pedophilia. Compartmentalisation is the reason they've been getting away with it for so long.

              I absolutely agree with you, LDT...but for this sub, it has to be written up and supported with links in a very concrete way, with the connections spelled out. Not scattershot as a conglomeration of leads and suspicious facts. That is exactly why we have more than one subverse -- the preliminary research submissions relying on hunches and speculation go in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagtewhatever">
               v/pizzagtewhatever
              </a>
              , and the ones that make a sound case go in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              . Ultimately, some material will move from pgwhatever to pg as it develops.
             </p>
             <p>
              Systems submissions are fine for
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , so long as the system and how it relates to the pedo elite abusing kids can be clearly described and claims sourced with supporting links.

              A lot of interesting stuff has come up in discussion of this thread -- but without it being rewritten to clearly show a likely connection between the fire and elite child abuse, I can't leave it up under Rule 1.

              If you want to make a thread about deep state infiltration of labor unions, you'll want to find a way to link it to organized sexual abuse of kids and/or propping up those we think are behind it...perhaps by showing votes and/or money being funneled to them.

              That is quite interesting. If the masons are as nefarious as some claim, it would make sense that they would infiltrate labor unions in order to control voting blocks. One could argue that IAM members were the illegal aliens of their day...the same playbook probably applied. I wonder how that lines up with other world events...

             Since the institution of Freemasonry was originally adapted from the craft of the stone workers, one of the guilds or building trades, it should not be surprising that many similarities can be traced between the various labor organizations and the Masonic Order.

              It's clearly masonic to me, and the whole aerospace industry is at the very least corrupt in the conventional sense, but my own research indicates to me that the corruption goes deeper and has occultic elements. I have written many posts on the origins of the Jet Propulsion Lab, Crowley, Parsons et al., and even their possible involvement in FF. Some people may not be paying attention ;-)

                 .[12] According to the BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, along with the Parsons Green train bombing and police having foiled at least seven 'significant plots', this makes it "the most sustained period of terror activity in England since the IRA bombing campaign of the 1970s."

               A Mason was a bricklayer. It literally was founded as a labour group by the most talented "builders" of the era...in the modern era those "builders" are machinists, aerospace engineers, etc

            Holy crap.  Spider's web of pure evil, carrying out their dirty deeds under our noses.  Kutcher's anti-human trafficking software is shady as F#@K.  During his speech to congress, he shed those crocodile tears right on cue. Ok camera one, zoom in to get a close up Asston's eye with the teardrops. Got it. People will eat this up with a spoon.

            After digging into the parlor, I found it is an illegal rub &amp; tug that operates under multiple names. My comments are deeply nested, but are only downvoted.

             I used to go there (from 2006. 2010, before things got hot in other NoVA places I discovered) for a good massage and a predictable ending. After it went downhill and my attention went elsewhere. The new owner (young mamasan) was trying to turn it around with younger girls and a decent but low-key level of service."

             </strong>
             but all the older women were working off gambling debts. She said they were all gambling addicts, and were in the AMP trade because they couldn't pay them off an other way, but essentially were there by choice (I. E, it was fast money, but they weren't

             I just read through your comments on that Besta post about the massage parlour.  That's exactly the same pattern that I found with the Ashton Kutcher parlour.  I found it on a number of other  websites being advertised as a prostitution service.  I'll see if I can dig up all the information I had.  This is really important - to look at the operational side of how these trafficking rings work. Upvoats for you!

              LDT, a post focusing on evidence Kutcher is frequenting underage massage parlors while running a child trafficking charity, if clearly presented and well sourced will get a positive flair. That would be great.

             Elizabeth Ann Smart was born November 3, 1987 in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Edward "Ed" and Lois Smart. She was raised in a family that was a part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,[3] with four brothers and one sister; she is the second-oldest child in her family. Smart attended Bryant Middle School and East High School in Salt Lake City, and later, Brigham Young University, where she earned her Bachelor of Music in harp performance.[4][5]

             Sources say Romney has told friends that he's planning to submit requests to join at least three high-profile Senate panels: the Finance Committee, the Commerce Committee, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

            <p>
             I don't know the answers to a lot of those other questions, but I have been worried about the link between Smart and Romney for some time.  It's LDS Mormon Church I believe.

             Timeline: Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.

             You are a wonder!  I have read that so many times and it didn't click.  How many times have we said that a lot of their ops are connected.  Simi is surely another of their controlled areas with many connecting businesses and bad actors.  Good Catch.

              Rocky Road Ave. is the exit in Simi Valley that is at the base of the Rocketdyne Complex in question. This area is a stones throw from the Manson family ranch in Box Canyon.

               Wow.  This is getting crazy.  This goes way back then.  Once infested always infested.  Looks like the whole area is a CIA and Pedo Cesspool.   See my comment about IAM having Freemason connections.
