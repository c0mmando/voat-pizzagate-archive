<p>Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell has been discovered — at In-N-Out Burger.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old was photographed alive and well Monday at the burger joint’s location in Universal City, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Once spotted, Maxwell — who was sitting alone with a pet pooch — told an onlooker: “Well, I guess this is the last time I’ll be eating here!”</p>
<p><strong>Maxwell, who was reading a book called “The Book of Honor: The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives,” has been underground for months — and has not been pictured in public since 2016.</strong></p>
<p><em>So imo she knew she would be photographed before she went there. Nice choice of book for an alleged Mossad agent. /s</em></p>
<p>On Wednesday, it was reported that she has been living with tech CEO Scott Borgeson in his secluded mansion in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, since 2016, according to a close neighbor.</p>
<p>Maxwell left the residence about “one month ago” when the news of her involvement with Epstein broke, a neighbor told The Post.</p>
<p>Borgerson has flatly denied any romance with Maxwell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am not dating Ghislaine, I’m home alone with my cat,” he told The Post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked about the status of his friendship with Maxwell now, Borgerson replied: “I don’t want to comment on that — would you want to talk about your friends?”</p>
<p>A new front in the Epstein case opened Wednesday morning as his accuser, Jennifer Araoz, filed a lawsuit against his estate, Maxwell and three unnamed female household staff members.</p>
<p>Araoz alleges she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Epstein at his New York City townhouse when she was 14 and 15 years old, including a forcible rape in 2002.</p>
<p>She first disclosed her alleged abuse in an exclusive “Today” show interview with Savannah Guthrie on July 10, the same day she filed papers in New York state court, saying she intended to sue Epstein.</p>

             </strong>
             [18] Famous London chef/restaurateur Ramsay ate In-N-Out for the first time when taping Hell's Kitchen in Los Angeles, and it soon became one of his favorite spots for take-out.[68] Ramsay was quoted, saying about the experience: "In-N-Out burgers were extraordinary. I was so bad, I sat in the restaurant, had my double cheeseburger then minutes later I drove back round and got the same thing again to take away."[68]
             <strong>
              Thomas Keller
             </strong>
             , a fan of In-N-Out, celebrated with In-N-Out burgers at the anniversary party of his restaurant, The French Laundry.[69] Keller also plans on opening his own burger restaurant inspired by his Los Angeles experience of In-N-Out.[70] Julia Child, one of the first celebrities to champion the chain, admitted to knowing every location of the restaurant between Santa Barbara and San Francisco.[71] Child also had the burgers delivered to her during a hospital stay.[69]
             <strong>
              Anthony Bourdain reportedly said that In-N-Out was his favorite fast food meal;[69] later naming the restaurant as "the best restaurant in Los Angeles"
             </strong>
             .[72][73] Ina Garten at an interview at Today show divulges "I have to say, I don't eat fast food at all, with one exception. When we're in California doing book tours, we always have to go to In-N-Out Burger. It's so good and I know it was Julia Child's favorite too, so it's okay." [74]

            <p>
             <strong>
              In-N-Out was one of the very few restaurant chains given a positive mention in the book Fast Food Nation.
             </strong>
             The book commended the chain for using natural and fresh ingredients and for looking after the interests of employees regarding pay and benefits.[75]

              I am slowly beginning to see LOTS wrong with this story. Why the big time lag between spotting and news item. No name of the person who "found her" ... the perfection of the photo... the high diff between the 2 images of her.

               ... #BarrCoverup is a hashtag on Twitter. And rightly so, considering that the feral prosecutors have been denying justice to the Epstein victims, by refusing to reopen the old case in Florida, although the plea deal was illegal according to US law.
              </p>
              <p>
               I felt like vomitting when Barr said the victims deserve justice.
              </p>
              <p>
               He is in charge of the federal prisons. He is responsible that Epstein died or disappeared.
              </p>
              <p>
               And on top of that, he should have recused himself from the case, since he worked for Kirkland &amp; Ellis, the law firm that represented Epstein in Florida.

                The old charge in Florida involved only one girl. How did refusing to reopen it deny justice to the other Epstein victims? The ruling that the plea deal was illegal opened the path for all of them to bring their cases against him, and his co-conspirators, did it not? And it made Federal prosecution possible as well.

                 No, it didn't. They only
                 <em>
                  chose
                 </em>
                 one girl for the plea deal in the end though. You might want to reread articles about the Florida case.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Because in a new trial they would be able to punish the co-conspirators as well - all the famous people who raped the girls. They got immunity in the plea deal.

                 No, this is why I am bitching about it. The judge ruled that the plea deal was illegal, then said the victims and the federal prosecutors should come to an agreement about how how to procede now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The victims demanded that the case should be reopened,
                 <strong>
                  the federal prosecutors refused
                 </strong>

                 Incidentally, only a couple of days before Barr recused himself from the case. Well done. /s

             Yes. I almost understand poor Mossad. /s
            </p>
            <p>
             Everybody insinuates Epstein was running the child trafficking ring for the Mossad, while nobody talks about the CIA, that must also have been involved. Epstein told the Evening Standard that he was CIA, that was some time in the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since he worked at Dalton, where Donald Barr was headmaster, who worked for the CIA predecessor OSS, and Anderson Cooper, who  was a student there, also has been a CIA asset, I guess he first worked for the CIA, then later also for the Mossad.

            Whats with Borgs cat excuse? Here he says something about his cat in another press denial as well.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Scott Borgerson, CEO of Boston-based tech company CargoMetrics, is denying a Daily Mail report that Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's alleged madame, is hiding out in his Massachusetts home.
            </p>
            <p>
             What he's saying: &gt;"I'm in Europe right now and there isn't anyone in my house but my cat,"
            </p>
            <p>
             Borgerson tells Axios, adding that he's asked local police to check the residence. He says he knows Maxwell, but is not dating her, as the Daily Mail has asserted.

              Go to amazon. Look up the book. Check reviews by G. maxwell - they communicate through these reviews. If you click on her name, her profile appears and five years of reviews!
