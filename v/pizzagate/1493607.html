            Agreed.
The fact that some random people  decided to do some research into this so called conspiracy theory shouldn't even make it onto the local news channel, but it's made its way to MSM only for them to scream fake news before it even was news at all. All social media sites are banning it or suppressing it. Strange that some people shared some findings about pizza on social media with each other, now even the pope weighed in calling it a sin to spread fake news/lies about politicians.  If there is nothing to find, why the f%ck do they care about random people chatting about it or researching stuff on their own?  We aren't professional investigators hired to do this, we aren't fbi, CIA, cops,  or important officials assigned to this case. We are just random people checking into a few things.  So why the outrage? 100% panic &amp; fear of us finding something they're hiding is the only thing I can come up with.  The pope chiming in just makes me add him to the list of something to hide. Even if we weren't connecting dots or finding anything, their response to pizzagate makes me want to research it even more.

             The outrage is that people are actually questioning things and wanting to find the truth. The outrage is they (MSM) have been completely delegitimized, they couldn't steal the election with there "Fake News and Propaganda", they're outraged cause Wiki has awoken the sleeping giants who have been lied to, manipulated and called crazy conspiracy theorist. MSM media are coconspirators in this coverup!

            Whether or not that really was Assange on Hannity yesterday that guy did make one very important point [echoing Trump I believe]. The MSM is becoming increasingly irrelevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            This FakeNews meme is the cherry on top if you ask me. They're bashing the open source investigation into the Elite Pedo Network but then pushing an Alepo narrative that keeps getting caught out for ACTUALLY being FAKE. It's like no one told them we know how to do google image reverse search lol, putting out pics claiming it's Aleppo and two seconds later we all come back saying 'uhhh you do know that's a picture from a music video,, or fire in pakistan' Hahahaha!!! lolz

             It was Assange. The only people saying it's not are shills and people who obviously can't identify shills.

               Yes, see if you can schedule an appointment to meet with him. Someone should probably do that. I would if I was in London.
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: we have no proof that he is alive (a shill would never admit this), unless you consider audio and video of him as proof (lol). But the fact is there isn't even
               <strong>
                evidence
               </strong>
               that he is not alive. The shills are using "lack of proof" (still ignoring the audio/video) as "proof" that he's dead. The idea is to discredit the leaks. Even though nobody has disproved any wiki leak. Ever. Utter shillery.

                Well if I catch a peak of him at the window tomorrow i'll post a pic :) either way there's no disputing the leaks pre october 21st are real! Besides all of the Podesta emails were an automated release. So even though it seemed drip fed they where pushed once and they had a system in place to stagger the release.. or so i'm told by trusted autists :)
