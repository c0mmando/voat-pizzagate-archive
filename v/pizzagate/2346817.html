<p>Relevance: Feldman has always positioned himself as the victim of a huge pedo ring in Hollywood -- a pedo ring run by wealthy producer/directors that prey on young stars. This cabal is the intricately involved in the original pizzagate story through sexual and political connections. Hence, PedoWood actually pontificating on our POTUS and morality in an attempt to take back control over policing their own scummy swamp that they all wallow in.

<p>Yesterday, I performed some random  searches that had nothing whatsoever to do with pizzagate, and was astonished at what turned up. When I read it through, it was instant validation of everything I\'d been saying about that POS named Feldman. He\'s a betrayer/handler and this proves it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/304747/greg-harrison-corey-haim-feldman-pedophile/">https://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/304747/greg-harrison-corey-haim-feldman-pedophile/</a></p>
<h1>Corey Haim’s friend accuses Corey Feldman of covering up for the real abuser</h1>
<p>Earlier this year, Corey Feldman spoke out about an unnamed Hollywood pedophile that is still prominent in the industry who raped his then-best friend and frequent co-star Corey Haim at the age of 11.  ...</p>
<p>Corey Haim’s mother, Judy Haim, subsequently threatened legal action against Feldman for discussing the molestation claims regarding her son. Lending his voice to the chorus of Feldman detractors is Greg Harrison, who claims to be friends with Judy Haim and one of Corey Haim’s closest friends throughout “the last twenty years of his life.” In a public Facebook post, Harrison wrote that:</p>
<h1>Feldman introduced Haim to his rapist and that Feldman and the abuser tried to cover it up.</h1>
<p>Harrison named the actor-director who allegedly raped Haim and it’s definitely not an A-list recognizable Hollywood icon that Radar Online teased. “What I am about to say is not my opinion,” wrote Harrison, “it comes straight from the mouth of Corey Haim.” ...</p>
<p>Let me take you back on this famous timeline, when Corey Haim was around 15 years old when he first moved to LA, to act in a little movie that was to be called, The Lost Boys. It was Corey Feldman who introduced him to Actor – Director and Pedophile XXXXX XXXXX. It is also public record in many interviews that Feldman did and is no secret, that Feldman was jealous of Haim. Corey Feldman introduced this pedophile to Haim and a lot of other boys.</p>
<p>Now let me bring you back on the famous timeline to 1997 and a little film called, “Busted.” One day Corey Haim went to the set of “Busted” with his mother Judy Haim. When Judy and Corey Haim arrived on set, they saw both Corey Feldman and XXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim had not seen XXXXXX in years. Judy Haim witnessed her son enraged saying, “What the Hell is he doing here?”. Corey Haim slammed and pinned Feldman against a wall and said, “I’m out of here man!” Judy Haim was a witness to this fight and also heard Feldman say, “Oh come on man, I thought you might like this!” Corey Feldman had arranged all of this even though he knew about the abuse that Haim had endured from XXXXXXX XXXXXXX. Corey Haim and Judy left the set that day. The next day Corey Feldman told the media that he had to fire Corey Haim because of drugs. This is yet another example of the many lies and abusive manipulation of twisting the truth that Judy and I have come accustom to seeing and experiencing from Corey Feldman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it! Feldman is a fucking POS who was jealous of Haim and others. His way of getting back? By outsmarting them and recruiting them for their eventual downfall. He must have just loved when Haim got on drugs and his career was derailed. Must have come in his pants when Haim died. And every time someone mentions Haim? They mention Feldman. It\'s revenge for Haim being handsome and talented. But Feldman won. And each time someone solicits Feldman\'s opinion and touts how it was Feldman spearheading the battle, Feldman just laughs and laughs and laughs at how stupid we all are. </p>
<p>One of the reasons I find the above so credible is that little aside Harrison gives later on in the article: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a later update, Harrison clarifies that he was not Radar Online’s source for the blind item about the purported A-list pedophile, so it’s possible that Haim was abused by more than one man. After all, Feldman did claim that he and Haim were “passed around” between a ring of Hollywood pedophiles back when they were working child actors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This melding the two cases of abuse (one at 11 and the other at 14) is where some of the problems originate, and why perhaps, Haim\'s mother has denied Sheen could have molested her child. Here\'s the two dates: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.datalounge.com/thread/17621676-corey-haim-s-a-list-rapist-may-finally-be-named-%E2%80%94-what-took-so-long-">https://www.datalounge.com/thread/17621676-corey-haim-s-a-list-rapist-may-finally-be-named-%E2%80%94-what-took-so-long-</a></p>
<p>a producer when Haim was 11, and an actor when Haim was in his mid teens. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this molestation when Haim was eleven ... I found this ... and this is why this story and all stories like it are so tragic: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalenquirer.com/true-crime/hollywood-child-sex-abuse-cover-exposed/">https://www.nationalenquirer.com/true-crime/hollywood-child-sex-abuse-cover-exposed/</a></p>
<p>“Corey had bottled everything up, but he finally told me what happened when he was in his mid-20s,” revealed one source, a longtime confidant of the late star of the cult classic “The Lost Boys.”</p>
<p>“The man was the first of two who molested him. These men chewed him up and spat him out.</p>
<p>“Friends said Corey should sue them. But Corey told me, ‘No one would ever believe me! I’m a big star, but —– [his first molester] is bigger.’</p>
<p>“Corey was afraid that if he named him, Hollywood would ostracize him.”</p>
<p>Actor-director Dominick Brascia, who said Haim was 14 years old when they met, confirmed the man’s name to The ENQUIRER.</p>
<p>Haim was so confused by the sexual encounter with the man that </p>
<h1>“he fell in love with him,” Brascia claimed.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>But again, this article is clear in there being TWO separate assaults ... a string of other assaults where he was passed around. And Brascia is problematic. He\'s one of those witnesses you don\'t want to put on the stand, but do anyway because he knows things. In this case, I believe this last bit of testimony offered answers a lot. Why? Well, because it\'s clear that Haim was raped twice: at 11 and 14, BUT when asked, Haim always says he was raped at 14 1/2. Now why would he do that? The sexual encounter at 11 had to be a rape if done with an adult, but it would not be processed that way IF Feldman fell in love. Brascia confirms that theory, but there\'s another pertinent question ... one that would also make it not a rape ... and that is if the actor he engaged with sex at 11 were also a child.  So we have to ask, was it an adult? Or another child that groomed and took advantage of a very innocent kid? </p>
<p>But of course dumpster diving wouldn\'t be what it is if not for uncovering bombshells -- and I did run across one. I\'d asked many times what\'s up with Alyssa Milano. She\'s a complete little know-nothing little bitch and yet she just rattles on and on, seemingly not worried about anything that drips out the froth spewing from her mouth. Why? Why does she feel so protected and how the hell does she stay relevant enough to be on Weintein\'s Golden Globe attendee list? Well, here\'s why: </p>
<blockquote>

<h1>Haim never married or had any children. He was involved with Who\'s the Boss actress Alyssa Milano from 1987 to 1990, and her parents, together with his manager at the time, unsuccessfully tried to get Haim help for his addiction.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup, that little bitch dated Haim. And I\'m sure she tried to get him off of drugs. Couldn\'t be a cash cow to the men who raped him if he was using? And don\'t think Milano was up into this ring? Another girlfriend of Haim confirming Milano was a regular at Alfie\'s Soda Shop: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There was a nightclub for underaged actors at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel that was called Alfie\'s Soda Pop Club. I met him there – it was like, Alyssa Milano, Nicole Eggert, and Corey was there.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here\'s Haim confirming she was and defending her at the same time. Makes sense since he dated her and was loyal. Please pay particularly close attention to Hoffman\'s casting director father worked for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/who-alphy-hoffman-corey-feldman-reveals-name-third-alleged-child-abuser-710384">http://www.newsweek.com/who-alphy-hoffman-corey-feldman-reveals-name-third-alleged-child-abuser-710384</a></p>
<h1>Who Is Alphy Hoffman? Corey Feldman Reveals Name of Third Alleged Child Abuser</h1>
<p>“He was the guy who ran Alphy’s Soda Pop Club,” said Feldman. “I met him when I was 12 years old. He came to my house to pick me up in his car. I’d heard rumors he threw the coolest parties in town and he was well connected.</p>
<p>“He was the son of Bobby Hoffman, who was the top casting director at the time for one of the major studios. That studio ran many of the hit shows that were on TV at the time, from Happy Days to Laverne &amp; Shirley to Mork &amp; Mindy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Happy Days? (Erin Morn molested)   Laverne &amp; Shirley? (That would be Gary Marshall) Mork &amp; Mindy (Robin Williams -- all those rumors about him). But what about Milano? Here\'s what Haim had to say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a 2004 interview published in 2012 by Vice, Feldman’s late best friend and fellow \'80s child actor Corey Haim, who died in 2010, said of Hoffman: “I don’t think he’s a good human being … I lost complete respect for Alphy Hoffman. Alphy sucks! Point-fucking-blank.”</p>
<p>Haim said that Alphy’s Soda Pop Club parties were attended by other stars including Alyssa Milano, Nicole Eggert, Scott Grimes and Alfonso Ribeiro.</p>
<p>Haim revealed in the interview with fellow Soda Pop Club attendee Jennifer Juniper Stratford he stopped attending the parties because “a few people were starting to do drugs around me and people started drinking. Not Scott, not Alyssa, not Nicole, not us. This was not my drug time yet.”</p>

Brascia confirms that theory, but there's another pertinent question ... one that would also make it not a rape ... and that is if the actor he engaged with sex at 11 were also a child.  So we have to ask, was it an adult? Or another child that groomed and took advantage of a very innocent kid?

           Yup, that little bitch dated Haim. And I'm sure she tried to get him off of drugs. Couldn't be a cash cow to the men who raped him if he was using? And don't think Milano was up into this ring? Another girlfriend of Haim confirming Milano was a regular at Alfie's Soda Shop:

           And here's Haim confirming she was and defending her at the same time. Makes sense since he dated her and was loyal. Please pay particularly close attention to Hoffman's casting director father worked for:

            Who Is Alphy Hoffman? Corey Feldman Reveals Name of Third Alleged Child Abuser
           </h1>

            “He was the guy who ran Alphy’s Soda Pop Club,” said Feldman. “I met him when I was 12 years old. He came to my house to pick me up in his car. I’d heard rumors he threw the coolest parties in town and he was well connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            “He was the son of Bobby Hoffman, who was the top casting director at the time for one of the major studios. That studio ran many of the hit shows that were on TV at the time, from Happy Days to Laverne &amp; Shirley to Mork &amp; Mindy.”

           What? Happy Days? (Erin Morn molested)   Laverne &amp; Shirley? (That would be Gary Marshall) Mork &amp; Mindy (Robin Williams -- all those rumors about him). But what about Milano? Here's what Haim had to say:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            In a 2004 interview published in 2012 by Vice, Feldman’s late best friend and fellow '80s child actor Corey Haim, who died in 2010, said of Hoffman: “I don’t think he’s a good human being … I lost complete respect for Alphy Hoffman. Alphy sucks! Point-fucking-blank.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Haim said that Alphy’s Soda Pop Club parties were attended by other stars including Alyssa Milano, Nicole Eggert, Scott Grimes and Alfonso Ribeiro.
           </p>
           <p>
            Haim revealed in the interview with fellow Soda Pop Club attendee Jennifer Juniper Stratford he stopped attending the parties because “a few people were starting to do drugs around me and people started drinking. Not Scott, not Alyssa, not Nicole, not us. This was not my drug time yet.”

            We all know pizzagate has a "Satanic" aspect, but the church of Satan is far from the "cult" we're dealing with here. I think this is more evidence Feldman is a puppet. Does anyone really take the church of Satan seriously? They're kinda silly imo. Perfect fall guy though.

             It's another platform to get on. Oh, shit! Forgot to post that article I saw about Feldman. Let me see if I can find it. In the meantime, here he is threatening the girl who quit Corey's Angels. How did he threaten her? Why ala Weinstein of course! He told her she'd never work in LA again! Funny, eh? Here's the soft, tender-hearted Feldman actually threatening someone with those words. Yeah, cuz he ain't a POS.

            Just came across the photos for the opening nights of Valkyrie which I hadn't seen before. Brian Singer grew up with Chris McQuarrie. Tom Cruise and Brian Singer very friendly. Ben Fellows statement about TC violently sodomizing want to be young male actors. Scientology a front for underage sex and child trafficking. Where did Tom and Nicole's kids come from?

             TC hasn't really been looked into either. Didn't realize he was friends to Singer. Anybody that associates with Singer on a that kind of personal basis is suspect and deserves looking into.

              Chris McQuarrie directed heaps of TC films -edge of tomorrow, the MI 5 and 6, Valkyrie, Jack Reacher....the list goes on. McQuarrie very friendly with Singer, grew up together. Look at Valkyrie after party photos. Tom Cruise and Singer look like two peas in a pod. Mainly men, cant see many women. Church of Scientology in the thick of pedogate. Its not that the Church has info on TC being gay (who cares these days right), it's the pedo stuff they have got. There's also some reference out there to Nicole being afraid of leaving Conor alone with TC.

            Great work. My introduction to Corey Feldman's claims was through his book "Coreyography." Although it was obviously a carefully crafted, ghost-written story, I still felt sympathy for him. But, after listening to several interviews with Feldman's acquaintances and former "Corey's Angels" on the

             Opperman Report
            </a>
            , it seems clear that Corey is a mooch, a constant "victim" and a pervert. The timeline has it that some of his "Angels" were getting ready to expose him for abuse and non-pay, and then suddenly he conveniently comes out with these allegations and an Indiegogo campaign to raise money for...himself. I'm glad he's bringing light to Hollypedowood, but I just don't think he's a good character.

             I've known lots of people that have been sexually abused, and none of them, we're talking ZERO percent, would ever want or set up a child to go through what they went through.

             As for Feldman, it may be. Maybe he was finally ready to talk or maybe it wasn't enough for Feldman to see him suffering like that.

              From what I've read, sacrifices are indicated by the numbers, dates, ages all that nutty numerology stuff. And the one who sacrifices usually does it for money or a business deal.
             </p>
             <p>
              The blonde hair is a sign to the masons and a rite of passage showing devotion to the cult.

             <p>
              I haven't seen the madonna thing but yes, cross dressing is another masonic rite of passage. As with females in drag in public like

            Funny Feldman said he fired Haim because of drug use
           </p>
           <p>
            When Feldman was filming Lost Boys, Schumacher fired him be a use of drug use
           </p>
           <p>
            March 9, 1990 , Feldman was busted with an estimate of 9 grams of drugs
           </p>
           <p>
            23 balloons of heroin, 2 with coke
           </p>
           <p>
            HE was looking at 8 yrs for possesion with intent to sell
           </p>
           <p>
            Each balloon would have covered a user for a week
           </p>
           <p>
            This was in an article... dual drug busts turn a painful spotlight on two children of hollywood...it was in people ,  Google title, you can read it, He was already good friends with Sam Kinison at the time, he is quoted here
           </p>
           <p>
            So how did he get out of it?

             Just goes to show he has powers behind him, and powers aren't behind people that aren't on their payroll.

            <p>
             This is more damning because if he was that victim that PedoWood was out to get, they would have cut him off at the knees right then and there. He'd still be in prison without a little help from powerful friends.

            Well, migratory, you and I and some others have been calling Feldman a Scumbag of the Highest Order. Thanks for your Dyno-Mite Research, we now now it has been verified.  Somehow I don't think those were the only two times, but I could be wrong.  Feldman is so deeply caught up in this.  He is doing the bidding of that powerful elite person that we also suspect.  That's where he is getting his money.  I've seen him wearing some pretty flashy outfits.  Those Designer Sun Glasses cost a Bundle.  You don't make that kind of money with a Lousy Band. Thanks for all the digging.  I think there will be more in that rabbit hole as we both know.

              I think it is out there and it will come out.  Also people are not afraid to speak out now in the comments of CDAN DL  and Twitter.  Those sitting on the fence about Woody Allen I think are listening more closely and changing their minds.  I have been saying that it is moving like a roaring train toward the station.  I believe now that the people are running this show and that Pedowood may be losing the battle.  They will have to move faster and push those lies a little harder.  People think Oprah is so popular, but on DL she was really shut down as far as popularity.  Things may be looking up.

               I would say so based on what I just saw on Twitter. Two freakin' amazing tweets! The legal shit is happening and a legal shitstorm will lead to convictions. They can try to embarrass our POTUS all the want with cracks about his weight and asking to get spanked, but they're going to jail ...

                 The House must immediately make public the memo prepared by the Intelligence Committee regarding the FBI and the Department of Justice...There is no higher priority than the release of this information to preserve our democracy.

                  A review of a classified document outlining what is described as extensive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse was made available to all House members Thursday and the revelations could lead to the removal of senior officials in the FBI and Department of Justice, several sources with knowledge of the document stated. These sources say the report is “explosive,” stating they would not be surprised if it leads to the end of Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel investigation into President Trump and his associates.  #WHOOPY!!!

            I recall something about Haim complaining about Feldman's sadistic character but I can't remember the details now. Very tragic if he was the handler.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to find strategies for these victims. As more truth about these cases is revealed, I hope it will be easier for the victims to find their way out of the maze of control. What a sad world wee live in. I look at some survivors and I'm utterly inspired by their resilience and joy, there is always hope.

             There's always hope. It's the handlers job to keep it hidden. The lack of hope means the victim remains reliant on the group that abused them for worth. Like with Haim. He actually rented a billboard after he'd gotten clean and announced that he was back and going to make amends. Isn't that pathetic? He's apologizing to them! That's what these monsters will do to you.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure Feldman is a bona fide sadist. He'd have to be. He loves what he does ... loves destroying people he's jealous of. That'll teach them a lesson. It's all os sick. Will have to do a part II because there's so much I couldn't include.

                Pleasure, I think this #PIZZAGATE guy sounds very droll but has some excellent posts re pizzagate. I wrote and asked why he was banned, but no reply, guess looking at his posts it is really easy to know why.  Some of them are quite gruesome. I should have put a warning on my last post! :) We are winning!

              I was just going over the case of Jaycee Lee Dugard. If you ever feel depressed about anything, that woman's life and resilience/attitude is a fucking miracle and inspiration. What is absolutely tragic though is she is clueless about NCMEC, is a spokesperson for them and has been pictured hugging  Oprah. I hate Voat, I hate being here but every time I think of these sadistic people I feel I have to come back and help in anyway I can. This can't go on anymore.

               Oprah is a Feldman. She's a weasel opportunist who would say and do anything for the $$$. She was a mess as a kid, a mess as a teenager, a mess as an adult until a mentor groomed her to knock off Phil Donahue. She scored big and they gave her more tasks including ruining neighborhoods/communities by spreading the fake news of people putting razor blades in Halloween candy. It was a lie, she knew it was a lie, and the apology came way too late.

               To me, she's a J.K. Rowling. She was allowed to rake in billions of dollars (and notice that like Bezos, she never uses her own money) so she could fund The Kenyan's presidential run. Remember that Geffen yacht outing with all the big dogs? No doubt they spirit cooked up her throwing her fat ass in the presidential ring. Gayle will no doubt be the unofficial first lady.

                   Well, Gayle has been with her for how long? Seems to be a thing with her. She demands absolute loyalty. Even with workers. They all sign NDA that seem to be airtight in people blabbing about really goes on. I got a kick out of a tweet that gave a little insight into the real Oprah, and not the fictitious one we see. This tweeter used to work in PedoWood as a grip and tech on movie sets. This one time he worked on a movie that Oprah was in. He said that the movie set always had a table with food and drink set up for the cast and crew, and that this set was no exception. There was a fruit infusion drink that was a mixture of juice and pieces of fruit. He said he said Oprah sidle up to the table. She was the only one there. Everyone was busy doing something, but he and this other guy were watching her. She went up to the fruit drink and looked around to make sure no one was watching. She didn't notice that she was being observed. Next thing you know, she takes the lid off and STICKS HER HAND IN THE DRINK fishing for a piece of peach that was floating around. She grabs it, shoves it in her mouth, and puts the lid back on before walking away. He couldn't believe it. He said all afternoon people were going and drinking from the drink she stuck her hand in. When I read it, I thought, "Now that's the real Oprah." She's a gross, disgusting pig and not what she portrays.

                I haven't looked much into Oprah. The fact that she supported and promoted Obama is enough for me to dislike her. I have no real faith in Assange but I understand some do. I won't go into my thoughts on him here because I'm trying to stay positive and focused on kids that need help.

                  That's if he is even really locked up, I have my suspicions from a stalker he had (he only appeared after she left, the whole thing is suspicious af). I really only care about the kids at this point and being against sexual abuse of any kind, I can't get behind Assange and his cohorts and what they stand for.

            Terrific research and puzzle piecing. I already knew Feldman was a fraud and a poser, but this puts things in another perspective altogether. Thumbs up.

            Excellent post! It is becoming clearer how this went down. I wonder though if a child who is being abused themselves can truly understand the harm in introducing other kids to their pedo abusers. Esp if they have maybe fallen in love with their abuser or are suffering stockholm syndrome and /or are getting desperately wanted attention. I have personal experience witnessing a situation like this as a teenager and not understanding what was happening let alone all the complexities. The real crime is what you do or dont do about it as an adult when you should have developed better judgement.

             I've heard that argument before, and, yeah, you can blame them.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can't turn a good person bad. Yes, you can tempt and trick them into doing bad thing, but if they were abused ... they'd never subject someone else to that abuse. Never. It shows a malevolence. And not all kids are malevolent. Some pet cats ... some kill them. That's the difference. For Feldman to have allegedly protected so many pedos and actually say that Haim? He's evil ... out and out evil and sick to his core.

              He probably is evil now....when he was a child though he maybe thought he was helping his friend to get benefits cos he too had been conned that this was a good thing.  They dont call it grooming for nothing.  I saw friends of mine given surf boards, the use of high end cars, party houses....most of the kids in the local area thought it was fantastic. We didnt want to believe there was a dark side to this. One day I asked a 17yr old friend if mine if he had evet been molested by this provider of gifts. He said to me that he wouldnt call it that because when someone sucks your cock it feels good.

                  Unfortunately this man had molested boys all over the country and overseas. It was a huge case and ended in an international man hunt....who knows why some go down and others never get caught. I have to admit as teenagers we all enjoyed the parties at his places.....he always had teenagers (both girls and guys so it 'seemed' normal) around doing odd jobs on his farm....we liked the chance to earn pocket money and he just seemed like a nice guy......we nearly felt sorry for him....thats the problem with these people kids just cant see through their cons.

                   I think each pedo is different. Obviously, Haim hated the pedo who raped him at 14 so there was no identification and no misplaced sympathy or affection. He straight up couldn't stand him. And pedos cultivate whatever works. They never stop and that's what makes them so dangerous.

             We all adapt to our environment. A lot of former victims held captive despise the use of the term stockholm syndrome, they explain they were simply playing a part to survive. We can sit and judge these people but we have no clue what it's like to be in a situation like that. If you look to the past, it is only in the last 20 years or so that pedophilia has even really been talked about in the open. It's not only society that has been evolving in thought, as a whole, but also the individual. Sometimes people try to normalize a situation to make it okay for them to endure, they fade in and out of denial.

                        Maybe you should get some dick instead of being one 😂😂😂😂. But seriously, you were being a dick for no reason and then got butt hurt that someone called you on it. Now put on your big girl pants and stop playing the victim

                            "I know you are but what am I". This is getting tiresome. Your response to Tricia's misunderstanding was reactionary and uncalled for. You obviously aren't a reasonable person, which is a detriment to someone claiming they want to help kids. You're smug and defensive so I'm sure you'll never admit you over reacted but that's ok. It's been fun taunting you but I'm bored with it now so adios!

            This is fantastic detailed research. Feldman has been paid off by the big names who got him to only name the small fish.
