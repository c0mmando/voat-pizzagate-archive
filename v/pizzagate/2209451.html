            Was his laptop in the hotel room or in his house?  I hear people saying its obvious he didn't remove it because it would still be in the room. But if he removed it beforehand it could explain it not being in the room. A scenario I have not heard anyone say yet....what if the hard drive has evidence of who is behind the gun deals/terrorists/trafficking etc., whatever it turns out to be, and he has put it in a safe place, in case anything happens to him? (something like Imran Awan did), hopefully the 'safe place' will be revealed by the trigger of him dying. Just a thought

            People should keep in mind with these articles coming out at the moment that they could be just fake news/rabbit holes to distract us, leading people away from the fact that Vegas was a flase flag attack done by the deepstate to keep America in a state of fear and to cover up real issues they don't want the public to focus on, like pedogate the fake Russian narrative for example.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully if there is any truth to them it might raise awareness to get the truth on the real shooters and reveal that the FBI is covering what really happened with a fake narrative.

             The only fake news is coming out of mainstream news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now ABC is reporting about the missing hard drive. In other words, they're being pressured to tell the? It truth because we already know it to be true. If "they" were the custodians of the information about the hard drive, do you really think we'd be reading it? And you know what the one big telling proof is that they weren't going to tell us? It's that they didn't have a logical cover story prepared for how it went missing.
            </p>
            <p>
             This one walked away.

              Paddock owned "Paradise Ranch"; which is an LLC joint venture with the Phillipines Children's Fund of America.

               Conjecture: Paddock did not earn millions on video poker, he ran guns and probably aided in the trafficking of children. (pilots license, 2 planes, multiple properties)

             This. No, not conjecture. The link given to the DEA wiretapping Paddock proves the gambling story a false narrative.

             <p>
              Here is what we have gleaned from law enforcement sources who are NOT directly linked to the sham active Las Vegas probe of Paddock:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Paddock had a number of cell phones acquired and linked to numbers in Los Angeles, CA.
              </li>
              <li>
               From what we can ascertain on or about 2013 one on the LA-based numbers linked to Paddock turned during a DEA wiretap.
              </li>
              <li>
               That phone was reportedly an AT&amp;T Mobility phone.
              </li>
              <li>
               After tracing the phone to Paddock, DEA agents delved into his finances and background.
              </li>
              <li>
               DEA agents pinpointed a high number of federal Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) linked to Paddock’s bank transactions, including large wire amounts.
              </li>
              <li>
               A number of such wires were from shell companies without an official brick-and-mortar presence in any domicile.
              </li>
              <li>
               A number of SARs involved offshore wires coming into Paddock’s U.S. accounts.
              </li>
              <li>
               Paddock may have maintained at least one offshore bank account.
              </li>
              <li>
               Paddock subscribed to different cell phones in different U.S. cities from different cellular phone carriers.
              </li>
              <li>
               A number of those phones are now in the possession of the FBI lab in Virginia.
              </li>

            That's the official story? That he removed the hd from the laptop, shot himself, the hd is gone, and he worked alone? Show us something from the video cameras in the room! Or at least some security footage from the lobby.

             Yeah, where is all the security footage? But you remember that shooting victim Rachel Sheppard's lawyer had to get a stay against MGM to stop destroying evidence including security footage. Why would they be destroying footage if they had a madman barricaded in a room? It would support their story, no?

              Sheppard's attorney Brian Nettles asked for the order to preserve key card records, surveillance video, radio traffic and anything connected to the shooting.
             </p>
             <p>
              That includes the festival grounds and the room at Mandalay Bay where the shooting originated.
             </p>
             <p>
              MGM lawyers argued the request was broad and unnecessary, since that material was already being preserved for law enforcement.
             </p>
             <p>
              But Nettles said it was important to get it on the record and in open court, not just for his client, but for the public.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Our concern is that before the discovery period starts, something bad could happen. That something could be altered, something could be destroyed. They said in court today, they're already looking at fixing or changing that room," he said.

            So, it is obvious that the hard drive was in the laptop when he brought it to the hotel (nobody would carry a non-functioning laptop). He couldn't have disposed of it after his brains were blown out. It is not small enough to hide in the room. So the only options are that he threw it out of the window or the FBI have it. Or he sent it to someone before the shooting and after he had finished using his computer

               Nothing wrong with questioning things. Be skeptical. I'm figuring there was because it's for sure that's what good ole Stephen was into. My guess he was big into child trafficking.

            Eric Paddock dumped a HUGE smelly hint when he said this while talking about his brother's "quirky sense of humor"

            Good post thanks.  A couple times  I posted my speculation about whether there
            <em>
             could be
            </em>
            ties, given the International CP ring connected to Australia and the Philippines.    But I didn't have evidence to have debunked, so I'm also interested to read the post about 'Paddock's debunked tie' to child trafficking.

             Bangkok: Australian Federal Police have played a key role in uncovering a syndicate streaming extreme child sex and torture to Australian paedophile predators in a $1 billion-a-year underground industry in the Philippines.

             I believe I read something about Stephen Paddock starting to buy a lot more guns in June of 2017.
If, and that's a big if, he was involved in playing a role in an international child porn production or distribution and it was a good way to fund his gambling lifestyle, one could see how this bust might piss him off.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The arrest of David Timothy Deakin in the Philippines has revealed one of the darkest corners of the Internet, where pedophiles in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia pay overseas facilitators to sexually abuse children and babies.
            </p>
            <p>
             The arrests come two weeks after Philippine authorities, acting on an overseas tip-off, made one of the largest seizures of its kind in the country, uncovering a major operation live-streaming the abuse and torture of children from dark corners of the internet to predators in Australia, the US, Canada and Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The AFP also played a key role in the arrest in the Philippines of 52-year-old alleged Australian child sex predator and "dark web" mastermind Peter Scully, who has been charged over what police say are the most shocking cases of child murder, torture and abuse they have seen in the country.

            Speculative motive for shooting if he is shown to have ties:

            <p>
             <em>
              Seems Australian CP producers have quite a connection to working in the Philippines. Stephen Paddock didn't have a social media 'footprint' so we are told, but no one has told us whether or not he had a Dark Web 'footprint', using aliases... CP involvement would an ideal way to make money perhaps, if you want to spend a lot time gambling, or traveling.

               Would not be surprised.  Peter Scully, you just jogged my memory.  That was a horrible operation.  Quite some time ago, so much to read and look at that it seems years ago when only months.  Yes, I agree.  If he wired her 100K then I don't think it was for her flight back or for souvenirs.

             This is not a setup. Due to the nature of the rules here, I was unable to post this story, but I'll post it here. It's breaking news on the DEA wiretapping Stephen Paddock. That means Paddock was on the POTUS' radar and was a shady character. This Vegas thing, THAT's the coverup by the Deep State and what people like Loomer are pushing back on. Here's the link about the DEA. Paddock was dirty!!!! And like I said, I wanted to start a thread in #pizzagate, but it wasn't specifically tied to what Rule 1 specifies.

             I just posted this link in reply to someone else. I'd wanted to make it a separate post, but it doesn't conform to Rule 1, but within the confines of this thread it's valid indeed.

            <p>
             Paddock was dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. The LA Coverup is the false narrative about this scumbag.

             I think they were both scummy. If you saw the interview with the brother, so many red flags stood out. Like the fact he couldn't think of anything to say to the victim's families. Really? How about something like, "From the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry at what happened." Then there's him leaving his phone on. It's a very sociopathic thing to do. I mean, his brother was discovered to be the mass shooter, and a reporter is interviewing you in your driveway as to what the hell your thoughts are as to a family member perpetrating this crime, and he leaves his cell on so the ringtone keeps sounding? And he checks caller ID's? Got something more important to do, Bruce? How about molest a couple kids?

              Haven't seen this brought up anywhere else, but it seems like Paddock has two bothers. Eric is the one you saw doing the coked out interview.

               Could be. But this story is breaking apart and I believe the truth will be revealed. The exposing Paddock as being wiretapped was a HUGE leap in the right direction! And Laura Loomer is ripping MGM Resorts a new one with what she's finding out about their political leanings ... well, Mandalay anyway. Don't know if it was condoned by MGM so I'm trying to be fair. But HUGE Killary supporters even going so far as to drive workers to the polls to vote? Really? Who the fuck does that? It would seem the ideal place to stage a false flag. But as is the case lately, these things are so hastily put together that they're getting REALLY sloppy!

            It was during this trip that ISIS invaded the Philippines, coincidence?  Maybe Paddock was arming ISIS in the Philippines, as well as the child porn stuff?

             ISIS is/has been involved in human trafficking, no reason to rule out that they wouldn't sell kids to a international porn ring.  Seems that exchanging Kids for Weapons is probably a good deal for both sides.  All speculative of course.

            Of course the hard drive is missing it contained a recording of him doing the shooting.  They would have had to release at least some parts of it at some point in time. If it goes missing they can't release it.

Investigators found hidden surveillance cameras that were placed inside and outside the hotel room, presumably so Paddock could monitor the arrival of others. The cameras were not in record mode.

             No doubt! Everything that was put in that one post that got MAJOR pushback is turning out to be true! In fact, I tried to post something about Paddock and the post was removed because that other info was judged to be "speculation"!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, here's more
             <s>
              speculation
             </s>
             ... no, not speculation. Cernovich is calling Paddock out and tweeted: "Vegas shooter was trafficking firearms for Islamic terrorists in Philippines, and children"  I put the link up in the OP.

              Well, can you repost some?  Now that it is true, maybe it will be harder to vouch for.  Speculation?  We have at the beginning been allowed to post and then research.  It is hard to research and question if we cannot post.  Rather backwards, imo.

                Thanks, I do remember that one and it was one of the reasons why the article on the Australian/Philippine CP ring stood out so much, bringing Paddock and his girlfriend to mind.

                Don't drive yourself nuts over it.  It would be interesting.  I just went through the above post, and was reminded that Paddock worked at Lockheed.  Comey was head of Lockheed from 2005 - 2010.  Very interesting.
