             This is related to Pizzagate because the word "Domino" was found in the Wikileaks John Podesta email dump in an email from Herb Sandler to John Podesta. This term has been heavily investigated and speculated about and what it could mean to the Pizzagate investigation.

            </p>
            <p>
             A domino mask (from Latin dominus, "lord", and Medieval Latin masca,
             <strong>
              specter
             </strong>
             ) is a small, often rounded mask covering only the eyes and the space between them

             domino (cloak)
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The name in use to describe this partial mask derives from the Latin for dominus, for
             <strong>
              "lord" or "master"
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             [1]
             <strong>
              combined with the word mask (itself deriving from medieval Latin masca, for "specter" or "nightmare")
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             [2] Masks of this type became known as domini because they resembled French priests' winter hoods, which were white on the inside and black on the outside.

             The name in use to describe this partial mask derives from the Latin for dominus, for
             <strong>
              "lord" or "master"
             </strong>
             [1]
             <strong>
              combined with the word mask (itself deriving from medieval Latin masca, for "specter" or "nightmare")
             </strong>

             Occult symbolism seldom ever just means one distinct object or thing, but many multilayered things that shape a concept.

             "He who knows does not talk, he who talks does not know."

             In this context it can be a case of playing Lord, Master, Dominant position, being a specter.

            <p>
             Also think about contextually what a "mask" represents. A mask hides, veils, keeps secret.

             "It was masked, unknown, an unseen force of evil and stealth."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Their methods served as a cloaking device."

            Just like the walnut sauce emails. If you read the entire set of email exchanges, they're clearly talking about a southern Italian walnut sauce. Pizzagate is real, don't get me wrong, but to be called a shill for pointing this out makes us look like fools. Where does that code word legend come from anyways? How do we know walnuts are code for black child? Pizza is clearly code for CP/pedophilia but the other code terms seem to be pulled out of thin air and regarded as gospel.

             Screenshot from an anonymous user on 4chan.  No link because that code is made up completely.

             Pizza is absolutely not code.   The origins of this were CP was used as code on 4chan for child pornography.  People would say post CP, or Mods are asleep post CP.    People began to parody that using other terms for CP,  like pictures of Chocolate Pudding or Copier Paper or  Captain Picard and the one that took off was Cheese Pizza.  Pudding or Paper or Picard or Pizza by itself were not used.

             This is literally where this whole idea goes back to.

              Post CP is an acronym in which CP can have a variety of meanings. Initially used as an acronym for 4chan posters to indirectly mention or request a child pornography thread, in later years the acronym became commonly associated with the posting of other subjects with the same first letters (C &amp; P, most notably “Cheese Pizza”) to parody prohibited request threads or to troll those who hope to find child pornography. The users can also ask for illegal pornographic materials by requesting photos of delicious cake.

               Are you nuts?  It's just as likely to be code for the walnut moon of Saturn called Pan, since that is what Alefantis names himself.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, since I myself use pine nuts in pesto, I am quite convinced this is just a recipe for a walnut based sauce.

                Bingo.   Not only are pine nuts used in Basil Pesto, but Ligurian Walnut Sauce is from the same region that made Pesto famous.  It's known as salsa di noci in Italian.
               </p>
               <p>
                John Podesta has published his walnut sauce recipe online and there's even video of him making this sauce you can in an article on him from 2014.  It's chicken stock, walnuts, olive oil, butter, tomatoes, salt, pepper, basil and parmesan.
               </p>
               <p>
                Amazing that this forum has not posted video of John Podesta cooking Walnut Sauce from before pizzagate, but there you go.

                "which food would give him the mental ability to play better. Like saying, will I be more likely to win poker on beer or wine this evening?"

                ^ I wouldn't call this a "reasonable" analysis.  I would call this a team of damage control specialists trying to spin this email out of the pizzagate "conspiracy".  If this "reasonable" explanation is the best spin you can come up with then it just shows me how desperate you really are to make this thing go away,  it also motivates me to look into the Sandlers even more.  thanks for the help!

                 Well it's the author's interpretation which I deem to be reasonable, more so than the nefarious interpretations. Since it is an email talking about a game of dominoes.

                  I'm sure its just another coincidence that you and the author have both created accounts within the past day, less than 24 hours from each other.

              Yes you are. Your latest tactice is to thumb through the wikileaks and post circular bullshit that will go no place, hopefully fall within the posting rules, and slide the forum.

            Uhmm yea... This changes nothing.  The Sandler domino emails are still very suspicious and will remain to be a key piece of the Pizzagate puzzle.   Just google Herb and Marion Sandler and tell me thats not what elite-pedo-satanists should look like...

                You really should have stayed with the law school pursuit.. I'm sure it would have payed better than playing spin doctor for a bunch of pedo/elite power brokers in an obscure online research community.  What are you even doing here?  Did you create an account 3 hours ago with the sole purpose of distancing Herb and Susan from this movement?

                It too late,  here's the unfortunate reality for you and your masters.  Anyone who is featured (on any level) in the Podesta files is now a person of interest. Good luck containing all this... you're gonna need it!

                    Thanks for the ping, Dapper. The only doxxing that is against the rules is sharing of senstive personal info like soc #, financial account numbers/pw's associated with someone's real life identity. This is just free speech.

                    Word of advice: When someone guesses facts about you, confirming them makes you party to the dox.
