            one of Qs followers posits a scenario.whereby the stolen plane,  a q400 bombadier with a huge Q painted on the tail was payback for the missile launch in June intended to either assassinate Trump or strike a target in East Asia that could bbe blamed on North Korea and thus bring peace talks to a screeching halt, maybe even triggering a war.
           </p>
           <p>
            The  missile was launched, so the story goes,  from the Richard B Russell sub which was produced in the 60's and before it was decommissioned and sold (to the CIA?) had been fitted with nuclear missile capability.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theft of the plane was a cover to enable two f15s to strike at the sub. In one of the videos you can see a streak moving faster than the plane from left to right under the plane, that being a missle from one of the f15s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside from a few fancy maneuvers the plane just kept circling in the same area, which is inconsistent with some of the views the amatuer pilot was reporting, first Mt Hood, then Mt Olympus. Per the theory, the plane was flying remote, no one aboard. It then struck Ketron Island where the CIA is supposed to have a secret bsse. The pilot did claim that as soon as he finished his Bachelors degree he hoped to enlist in the military as  an officer. If he is presumed dead, military intelligience could make good use of him. I found it interesting that he circled, or the plane circled , long enough to jettison its fuel payload which is standard procedure when a plane has to make an emergency landing. If he was suicidal why not go down in a fireball of flames...to avoid injuring 3rd parties on Ketron??
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyhow, some weird things happening in the Pacific Northwest, wouldnt you say?

            So I don't know too much about ketron island but I know that next to ketron is an island called McNeil island. McNeil island is a compound for violent sexual predators, that's literally all that is on the island. Some of them are lifers some not. Idk if this is helpful or not, but it's certainly not advertised that it's a sex offender island. I've lived here my whole life and never heard of ketron island and only found out about McNeil a few years ago..

            , is it possible Tony in video discussing event on island (sacrifice, ancient technology, etc) hints at connection to Brennans?
US Magistrate Judge Edmund Brennan, who resided over the hearing on in Sacramento 8/15/18 for Omar Abdulsattar Ameen, a man wanted for murder in Iraq, allowed in as a refugee by Hussein, even though, he had Al Qaeda ties back to 04?? Ties to Mexico? 
bio: Assistant US attorney 88-94, deputy chief of civil division, 94-97, Chief of civil defensive litigation, 97-05, and so on...
Edmund F. sits on the court that is "Sacramento Superior Court whistleblowers also assert that federal judges at the US District Court for the Eastern District of California are collectively responsible for the concealment of systemic civil rights violations, honest services fraud, and RICO racketeering by Sacramento Superior Court family law judges and judge pro tem attorneys against indigent, financially disadvantaged and disabled pro per litigants. For more than 10 years, USDC EDCA judges have obstructed, impeded, and dismissed federal civil rights litigation against the RICO enterprise members."
           </p>
           <p>
            That came from a corruption investigation into the Family Court system as basically a RICO-tied ponzi-scheme (my choice of words)

            This guy is a brennan too... Judge John Brennan: He was credited for setting up the current separated structure of court, E.G. family court. Well connected, but 2 run ins with the law got him disbarred. Seems to be a big scandal in NM involving higher judges that filed fraudulent motions to help his cause. Ok, so one of the incidents involves a woman he was allegely trying to rape AND trying to get her to engage with a prostitute, half his age, at his home still shared with his wife. GET THIS... charges dropped? because victim backed down AND Brennan's expert witness testimony  revealed ""a number of severe psychiatric disorders."?! OH, it get's better. The victim is the daughter of a "former" Brennan pal, a "well-connected attorney" AND high ranking state government official (at the time of the source I used). Following me?...
"Having her mental illness trotted out in front of her high-profile buddies is likely not something she was looking forward to. (We've named her before in previous news accounts, but I have never been comfortable with that. She was, after all, both an alleged victim and a person with a mental illness.) "

So, this John B judge possibly creates the setup for family court, where all of the dirty laundry of elites may be revealed, engages in acts with what sounds to me like a trauma victim, and proves his worth in the courts he created? Is this guy the brother of Edmund F, who is dealing with the terrorist, and who may be helping to hide a number of atrocities. ARE THEY BOTH RELATED TO JOHN BRENNAN? 
All this came from looking into the terrorist case:

            I don't have time to go through all this to see if it's been posted, but someone on Eddit said there's an island near Ketron that might be of interest. Hopefully, you already know about it, but I thought I'd add what I read. I was born and raised in Seattle and I've heard of many small islands, but I've never heard of Ketron. Might help but might be nothing.

            N4490X has been
            <strong>
             deregistered
            </strong>

             My conclusion:  Likely fake tail number on wreckage.

            Did not notice if anyone noticed or posted this already, it's the most recent &amp; 3rd part of an interview with Tony Rodrigues on Adam Rivas Dauntless Dialogue, in the very beginning Tony talks about the trafficking and SRA "off an island of Seattle", that he was involved in which was apart of the CIA secret space program he is giving testimony of being sold off to his whole life.

            just want to point this out, i didn't see it mentioned when i read through the comments yesterday, don't have time to read through all the new comments but anyways. the pic showing the plane circling the island to make a "Q", was not the plane that crashed; it was a plane belonging to the county sheriff that circled the island shortly after the Q400 crashed. AFAIK we do not have the flight path of the plane that crashed.

                I'm not really sure it matters... like what if Q is 5 years old... does it change the information that we are learning? a plane circled an island. We know that. A plane did loops: horizontal and vertical. The island HAS SERIOUSLY PEAKED THE WORLD'S INTEREST. If any 1 piece of this proves false, HOW DOES IT CHANGE THE REST? (sorry for caps) How does it change the lack of coverage by MSM, the connection to people willing to pay 1500 pounds for a baby because, "she's just so beautiful"?

            darkknight, I'm going to sticky this thread for a bit. The usual shills have been strangely absent tonight, but I don't want a sudden forum sliding attack to bury this.

            If my deduction is correct, then I think I may have figured out HOW the fuckery is being done without raising suspiscions or being spotted.

            There is likely a secret entrance into the island only accessible via submersable. Depending on the size of the craft, you cluld traffic children via this pathway. Likely via an entrance that leads into the mansion, possibly through the wine cellar.

            Can we tie Gary Lundgren to the owners of Lemongrass Restaurants?

            I understand the chain is owned by a couple with differing last names.

             I haven't seen a tie in there, but Lundgren owns 65% of that island whereas the lemongrass owners own a home on 5 acres. So essentially just "neighbors".

            Could it have been both? two main thoughts here are the ties of this story to previous stories of bad things happening that shouldn't have near here (e.g. missile launch, plane with engine problems) and a twisted past and present history, design, and occupancy of the island, with special cables, secret vault rooms, I've heard bunkers mentioned...what if..(going for the gusto) The island is the nightmare of all nightmares for trafficked children and slaves but also serves as an electronic weapons facility, with the ability to protect departures and arrivals and insurance capabilities of sabotage-on-demand? Key witness of major pedo-bust gets witness protection after faking his own suicide and Q400 circles the island for an hour (feds must secure possible LZ?), dazzling us all with a...wait for it.... Q-loop or two before nosediving the the ballsiest drone ever right into pedo-island-top-resient's priceless yard decorations.

              both this is relevant because of it's close proximity to previous events, AND it's relevant due to inhabitants. Is the Island both a pedo-island and some sort of base for bad guy ops (think electronic sabotage/SAPs). Didn't someone above say Bronson had super tech?

            Land was sold on Ketron island with the promise of sewage service, which was never fully provided. The ground is hard packed, so septic will directly leach out of the ground onto the beaches. Washington State formed the Department of Ecology in 1970 and it became increasingly difficult to make any money developing waterfront like this. Many of the few residences on Ketron island would best be described as cabins. There is no airport!  There's not even room for something like that, there is no major traffic to and from the island. It's only a mile by ferry, but it's also directly on a major boating lane, so there is no real privacy on any of the beaches. People would see any strange traffic. This sounds like disinfo directed at discrediting QAnon.

             Q posted about it himself, though. What do you make of that? The MSM are framing this as a wack-a-doodle baggage handler who decided to go for joyride and then go out in blaze of glory. They aren't connecting it to Q...at least so far.

             those hooks are under the bar. those are chairs below them. Likely for umbrellas, purse, coat, etc. or at least that's my guess

             I found this regarding a court case involving Lundgren and the sewer system that was/is on Ketron Island:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1409336.html">
              https://caselaw.findlaw.com/wa-court-of-appeals/1409336.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             A functional sewer system is cited as what prevented the plans for a housing development of 200 homes on the island. Lundgren was slapped with the lawsuit and stiff fines when his sewer system was found to be dumping waste directly into Puget Sound. This happened in the late 80's early 90's.

            <strong>
             former prison island
            </strong>
            owned by the Washington State Dept. of corrections.  The prison was closed in 2011, and the island is
            <strong>
             now a detention center for violent sexual offenders

           <p>
            "The United States government bought land on McNeil Island in 1870 and opened a federal penitentiary there in 1875. By 1937 the federal government, which had been accumulating parcels of land adjacent to the penitentiary, had purchased all the land on the island and compelled its last residents to leave. The federal penitentiary's most famous inmates were probably Robert Stroud, the "Birdman of Alcatraz," who was held there from 1909 to 1912;
            <strong>
             Charles Manson
            </strong>
            , who
            <strong>
             before inspiring Helter Skelter in killing Sharon Tate and others in 1969, was an inmate from 1961 to 1966
            </strong>
            for trying to cash a forged government check; and Alvin Karpis, who was transferred to McNeil Island in 1962, from Alcatraz as a result of its impending closure, to complete his sentence. Karpis, who was labeled the FBI's Public Enemy #1 at the time of his capture in 1936, was the point man for the Barker–Karpis gang that committed kidnappings and numerous bank robberies while operating through out the midwest in the early 1930s. Pacific Northwest bootlegger Roy Olmstead was also an inmate for four years before his release May 12, 1931.
           </p>
           <p>
            Washington state took over the penitentiary from the federal government in 1981. It was called McNeil Island Corrections Center (MICC) until 2011, when it
            <strong>
             became the Special Commitment Center for violent sexual criminals.

            the guy who stole the plane was from Wasilla, Alaska (hometown of Sarah Palin):

            <p>
             Alaska Airlines said the suspect was a ground service agent employed by Horizon. Those employees direct aircraft for takeoff and gate approach and de-ice planes, as well as handle baggage.

             Russell went by “Beebo” on social media, and on his Facebook page, which had limited public access. He said he was from Wasilla, Alaska, lived in Sumner, Washington, and was married in 2012.

            , and possibly implying no plane was stolen here at all, but another missile launch occurred and was shot down. I just looked at the original post I made about that incident when I saw it on local news the day before Q mentioned it, and my link to the 8chan post where an anon posted side by side pics of the "Lens Flare" next to a nuclear missile launch is dead. Sketchy AF!  Here's a fresh link:

             Video of the burn and also the aftermath shows no fuselage remains, no wing remains, just some garbage and a few parts scattered around.  There would be more from a plane that

              Good point. A plane was definitely "stolen" and chased by F-16s. Locals got it on video (there are links in my other comment). That part is confirmed.

              Like the derailed train incident, though, I don't understand what Q is saying happened here.

               Clearly a live missile didn't hit the island, so I'm wondering whether the plane was taken up as a distraction from the missile launch.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or was the audio just a recording from a sound studio, with the plane being remotely controlled and carrying a missile, then the missile remotely disabled by white hats and dropped on land where it could be retrieved?
              </p>
              <p>
               But there wasn't enough wreckage in the published video.  Could be the real crash site wasn't photographed, just a mocked-up one.
              </p>
              <p>
               Holography is also a possibility, used to distract from the missile launch perhaps.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lots of possibilities.

                So the plane was a Q400 and the guy was a Baker...perhaps this was the DS sending a message to Q and Anons that they can take control of people and aircraft at any time and will do so if more dirt is revealed. Perhaps Q's "Think missile(s)" just referenced the rogue ones already launched -- Whidbey, Hawaii, Japan and Saudi Arabia?

            Nicole Pham owns 80 percent of the Lemon Grass business.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1979, when Pham was 17, she and 6 friends decided to leave their native Vietnam for America. "We decided to leave after the war ended and the Communists took over," she says. "To us, this was an adventure, but we had to do it secretly so we couldn't speak with our parents or family about it. If we got caught, we'd be killed."
           </p>
           <p>
            Only one week passed from the day the teens decided to escape before they found people who contributed money for their voyage and departed on a boat to Hong Kong.
Once in Hong Kong, the teens stayed in refugee camps for one year while awaiting American sponsors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pham's sponsor lived in California, and at age 18 she arrived in Hollywood, where she stayed for 3 months. "I found out that we couldn't go to school and had to sew to earn money," she says. "That's not what I considered in finding freedom."
           </p>
           <p>
            With $225 from the government and advice from a family friend from Vietnam, Pham moved with another friend to the Olympia, Wash., area.
           </p>
           <p>
            After a short period, she moved in with a sponsor family who later agreed to become her foster family.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the next 10 years, Pham earned a high school diploma and a business degree from South Puget Sound Community College and Evergreen State College. After receiving her degree she worked at Pabst as a staff accountant. In 1996, she and several peers were laid off.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1996, she and several peers were laid off. Pham decided to open her first restaurant, a business she was confident she could run, given her passion and talent for cooking and her background in accounting.

             Great find! I think a big part of her story that's missing is who was the "foster family" that took in an 18 year old girl? It seems that hownthe trajectory of her life changed after that, they may be wealthy or prominent.

              This woman and her husband purchased the Morris Mansion located on Ketron Island in 2015 for 1.1 million. The home has over 5,000 sq ft and sits on 5 acres with a beach and massive dock. It sounds like it's probably the most prominent home on the island.

             It would surface in an underground entrance to the mansion. Probably to somewhere near something like the wine cellar.

             </strong>
             in the Ketron incident in that it was the place where air traffic control was trying to get the guy to land:

             Two weeks ago, WADS conducted a three-day (July 24-27) air intercept

             Btw, on July 31, WADS got a new commander after his predecessor was transferred to NORAD in Colorado:

               In the OP, the guy near the scene is quoted as saying, "we got clowns (CIA) boys lots of them," and "Clowns all over Fox as well."
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe that's the who.  Why else would CIA show up to a plane crash and be controlling the narrative on TV news?

                 I was just referring to what the guy said who was quoted in the original post above about clowns (a word for CIA operatives).  Don't know how the guy knew they were clowns or if they really were.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The involved "locals" could certainly have been plants.  And local authorities who balk at participating in false flags can be blackmailed or threatened.

                 Maybe a body will turn up but be charred beyond recognition and the family won't be allowed to view it, as at Sandy Hook.

               I suspect you're right.  Especially when you consider that there was the air intercept drill only a couple of weeks before, July 24-27.  There's always a drill.

              Isaac Kappy discussed Portland PD today on Periscope. Said they protect pedophiles. Gave number for portland pd and asked everyone to call and ask why they protect pedos. Also gave email to Portland pd media relations officer. Requested same thing. If I see more about that I'll post it.

             Dragons' Den is a reality television program format in which entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of venture capitalists in the hope of securing investment finance from them. The program originated in Japan, where it is known as The Tigers of Money (マネーの虎 manē no tora), a pun on "The Tiger of Malaya" (マレーの虎 marē no tora), the nickname of WWII general Tomoyuki Yamashita).[1] The format was created and is owned by Nippon TV and is distributed by Sony Pictures Television.
            </p>
            <p>
             Local versions of the show have been produced in nearly 30 countries, as well as one for the Arab world; in some countries, more than one version has been aired. The most popular name for the show is Dragons' Den or variations thereof, a name that originated in the United Kingdom. The show has also been titled Shark Tank (a name that originated in the United States) and Lions' Den, and variations on those names, among others. In versions where the name of the show contains a creature's name, the investors are referred to by that name.

             Just found some pay dirt. Ties between the sewer system and a sexual predator. Factfinder2 just found ties to Richard Branson and James Caan a few minutes ago. Going to put it on main body now.

               INTERNATIONAL FRAUDSTER AND SEXUAL PREDATOR, GARY LUNDGREN HAS TIES TO THE KETRON ISLAND SEWAGE SYSTEM&lt;&lt;
During the Campaign in 2015 Trump filed suit with the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce against Lundgren and his business partners claiming that they entered into a conspiracy against Trump in a business deal in Panama. Lundgren has a history of being a shady businessman, once finding himself in court in Washington over the mismanagement of the Ketron sewage system. And just to boot, he has a history of being accused of being a sexual predator.

            Heya dk111, just wanted to give you a tip on how to keep wikipedia links in-tact, as some of them include characters that break the hyperlink when presented here in their raw form.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can use the following syntax to keep a link from breaking:
           </p>
           <p>
            [custom link text here inside square parenthesis](raw hyperlink here in round parenthesis)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Example work arounds for the wikipedia link you provided in your post:
            </strong>

            Scribing from current digs (this story is less than hours old).

            Here we go down the rabbit hole. Or we would if the soil weren't apparently unsuitable for it:
Per (1), the ferry apparently visits four times daily. That's a lot for a place with a population of &lt;20.
From the same article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The island has no gas station, store, mail delivery or garbage pickup, and the Pierce County ferry only comes four times a day. Many of the residents use their own boats to reach the mainland in Steilacoom.
So there are fewer than 20 residents, most of whom use their own boats, but the ferry visits one/four times a day?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anchorage-based entrepreneur J.C. Morris bought the entire island in 1946 and planned to build 200 homes on the island with a retail center, churches and a school. His plan was thwarted by the prohibitive cost of installing sewer lines.
Can't find anything about J.C. Morris, but Goog'ing "J C Morris Anchorage" gives:
J C Morris Insurance Services, 4011 Arctic Blvd #105, Anchorage, AK 99503, USA.
Nothing of note to be found.
            </p>
            <p>
             Morris’ mansion was sold in 2015, a 5,300-square-foot mansion platted on 5 acres of land. The Thurston County residents who bought the home paid $1.1 million for it.
This led me to (2):
            </p>
            <p>
             The new owners are Thurston County restaurateurs Nicole Pham and her husband Jim Porter, according to Karen Vincent who handled the sale for Morrison House Sotheby’s International Realty. The estate originally was listed for $1.77 million. Then it was reduced to $1.299 million. It sold for $1.1 million. The couple own a small chain of Lemon Grass Vietnamese restaurants in Thurston County.
This all seems legit, the restaurant exists, and I can't find anything that looks suspicious to me.
Note that Sotheby's International Realty is not directly connected to Sotheby's (3rd party company that S's bought out), but their employees are all part of the same social stratum.
            </p>
            <p>
             The home features an 800-square-foot living room with panoramic water views, a wine cellar, three bedrooms in the main house and a storage room on the ground level to store supplies brought from the mainland.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            &lt;Storage room
           </p>
           <p>
            &lt;Supplies
           </p>
           <p>
            More on this from (3). Note that this article gives the date of purchase by Morris as the early sixties, not mid forties.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On the home’s lower level, a former walk-in vault serves as a wine cellar and an adjacent room is reserved for playing pool. A spacious lower-level closet is equipped with rods and shelves for storing out-of-season clothes. A storage room as large as many contemporary living rooms is lined with shelves for supplies brought from the mainland.
Note that this article gives the location of the storage room as seemingly belowground, while (2) implies that it is on the ground floor (first floor for Burgers). I wonder if the pool room has a ping pong table?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because of the limited evening ferry schedule, said Chenaur, guests often spent the night in the guest quarters, the cabin or in the two unoccupied bedrooms. When many children were staying over, the couple lined the den with beds.
ALMONDS ACTIVATED!
            </p>
            <p>
             During the Chenaur’s tenure on the island, it was not uncommon for 25 or 30 people to stay overnight. During one wedding, the home and its outbuildings accommodated 49 people, she said.
So the fully-occupied house nearly tripled the island's population? I know I'm a fucking bumpkin, but that sounds like a popular party.
More information about Morris:
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of those same issues kept Morris from realizing his vision of a fully developed island. He platted more than 250 lots, but sold only a few. And while some lots like his own could handle waste water in a septic system, other lots don’t have the right soil for such a system, necessitating the need for a sewer system that never was completed.
So either he was a shit entrepreneur (didn't check the place out/couldn't be arsed to follow through), or there was some other plan. Note that the 'bad soil for digging' would be an excellent cover for underground tunnels. "Sorry, buddy, you can't dig here, the soil's bad. It's nothing to do with the concrete tunnels which definitely aren't down there."

              Found something intriguing, a Keith Sergio Samuels commented one of the Lemongrass's facebook photos, saying he goes there a lot and this time he had a complaint about the food. I checked out his profile and he is a PROUD freemason with masonry imagery plastered all over his profile.

              Now whether a self-proclaimed freemason (who seems to be legit considering his facebook connections and interactions with other masons in his area) visiting this restaurant frequently is just a coincidence or an actual connection will require more digging around the clientele of the restaurant.

                No.  But the menu page looked exactly  like that.
               </p>
               <p>
                What I saw was a page of restaurant critics

               <p>
                comments posted at the beginning of the menu.
               </p>
               <p>
                Am still looking for what I saw.  Will advise.

               I know. Unbelievable. What a low price to give the family for a child so sad. Notice he kept referring to the baby as It. How would he know his brother wants a baby girl child so desperately? So weird. So many questions. Did he ever give them that £100k for the charity without the purchase of the child? Doubt it. They all want something in order to help charities these leeches. This man is no exception.

            Ketron Island Dig
(2/2)
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that he may have had an insurance business since 1937, which is still in business today, would indicate he wasn't that bad of a businessman, and was likely to have had cash/collateral to finish his project. Hmm.
The former owners were Marion Chenaur and her husband. His given name, Clayton, only shows up in (4). Neither of them have any other online presence that I can find, which is interesting considering how popular they seem to have been socially in their day.
There's a fraud lawsuit (he was found guilty) concerning Carl Clayton Chenaur from 1977, but I don't speak lawfag and my eyes threaten to melt when I try. See (5) if you want to give it a shot.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'We call it camp Ketron,' Mrs. Chenaur says, because the couple's children have always enjoyed playing on the property's grounds and by the water. 'There's so much territory to play [on],' she says.
I can't find reference to the couple having any children, although the article references grandchildren.
            </p>
            <p>
             The basement includes a large storage space, a billiards area, and a curious remnant from the original owners: a walk-in combination-safe door that leads into a protected room. 'I have no idea what it was intended for,' Mrs. Chenaur admits, but they currently use the space as a wine cellar, 
Secret panels? Hidden rooms? DING DING DING! See pic related 3.
I'm still digging, but I'll throw in what I've got so far. This looks weird.

tl:dr
Mansion on an isolated island with hidden rooms, underground storage, and reference to large social gatherings with lots of children in attendance. Former owners seem to have been socially popular, but have no real online footprint; husband may have been corrupt. Vague, inconsistent, and slightly suspicious stories about the history of the place, which seems to have a lot of human traffic considering how deserted it is.

             This is interesting.  I would make my own post but I suck at archiving and stuff so passing on to you.  Rob Porter/Record Producer/Vital Records....see his top posts about renting out the Ketron Island estate to others/corporations/etc.  Is not his main home (at least it wasn't then).
