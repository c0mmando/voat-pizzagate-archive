<p>After comparing that to the map of the 2016 election results (  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vo9ar">http://imgur.com/a/vo9ar</a> ) the places with the most vanishings appear eerily similar to the places throughout the country that had the most DNC votes, especially the place in California on the border of Nevada, Washington, Wisconsin, Iowa and all up the East Coast.</p>
<p>The other funny things I noticed from the article where I found the map ( <a href="http://dcxposed.com/2014/04/27/secret-vanishings-americas-national-parks/">http://dcxposed.com/2014/04/27/secret-vanishings-americas-national-parks/</a> ) is that most of the children that vanished were between the ages of 20 months to 12 years old, I do note that this may have been mentioned in the earlier posts, but the other thing is that most of the children that were found were in strange places that they shouldn\'t be able to get by themselves, had a fever and were traumatized, they were also still in the clothes they disappeared in but were WITHOUT their shoes and with no marks or scratches on their feet, really? Sounds a bit odd does it not? </p>
<p>That point in the article right there made me think of a video by Ole Dammegard i watched the other day where he breaks down the recent false flags perfectly and even predicted the Westminster one a month before it happened because they leave clues at the previous one to where the next one will be. One thing he mentioned in the video is ABOUT THE SHOES!. If anyone has noticed the crisis actors/victims or what ever they are, they either have one shoe on or NO shoes. The video goes for 2hrs of mostly him talking but if you scan through it to where he shows some pictures of Westminster (pretty sure around the middle of it) you\'ll catch the pics with no shoes, he goes on to say that he believes this is a Masonic ritual where one shoe off means (correct me if I\'m wrong) their willingness to be a part of what is happening and NO shoes means they full support and pledge to the cult! </p>

<p>Well fuck me, could this mean the kids have been taken by these people and had whatever happen to them and then they take their shoes as a symbolism of what they\'ve done? And them appearing traumatized with a fever is from what ever sick shit they\'ve just done? The article also states that these kids never talk about or can\'t remember what happened to them. I think this all sounds too close to the story line we\'ve been following to just be nothing. Would love to hear what you guys think?</p>',

            Great post! The shoe thing reminds me of JA's coffin-making buddy werkingonmynightcheese's Instagram, lots of creepy photos of kids' shoes, almost like he kept them as a trophy/memento. Also that video two people did of CPP and tunnels in the surrounding area, where a bunch of young boys in mismatched shoes were filmed being jogged out of the venue by a worried looking man

            I have tonnes of common sense but get lost in the bathtub. So I think people like me just shouldn't go into the woods unless there is a very well worn path. Or go with someone who is good at that stuff.

            I have hated Amazon for years.  I have suspected them of something nefarious with Immigrants or worse.  How do you think they are complicit?  Bringing in trafficked humans in boxes and ships and airlift?  I would love to see them exposed.  They opened and expanded a  huge place in Joliet Ill  That would be near two airports and near the docks of Lake Michigan as well.  Stop using Amazon.

            So some anonymous guy on 4chan says to look at blue districts and missing persons and everyone starts overlaying maps? Implying that higher concentrations of democratic voters abduct more kids? It's been said on many a post that child sex trafficking knows no political party and I don't see how looking at blue districts and Amazon distribution centers is going to solve any mystery.

            National park disappearance can also be explained by the vast amounts of wilderness, novice hikers and lots of wild animals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yall do your thing but this sounds like a waste of time. What if this anon said to look on the map of white supremacists organizations and starbucks? Would there be another call to dig dig dig? I just hate to see so many resources directed at this "tip" from an anonymous person on 4chan whose post was vague, without any real substance and seems a lot like an attention seeker looking to get folks running around for his own pleasure. If he had connected any of those things he cited than why ask people to to do it again with little to go on? Why not just report his findings? (Hint) He had none.

            and found this snippet:
"Taking off one and handing it to him with whom a covenant was made was a symbol of sincerity.Removing “both” shoes signified quite another thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are separate and distinct symbols - in Freemasonry both are used - and it is wise to distinguish between the two, not to miss the beautiful implications of entering that place which is holy with both feet bare"

           <p>
            It's called 'THE RITE OF DISCALCEATION'

            Yup.  Not saying that high population centers wouldn't be the focal point for any type of illegal import/export business, but blindly saying "holy crap they match" is misleading.  Clearly the targets of the traffickers are consumers, and by default more consumers are in high population areas.... Reminds me of the Ice Cream sales vs. Violent crime link from back in the day.  They aren't related to each other, but they are both related to warmer weather.

            Just to make it clear to everyone.... the "blue" portions of the map also represent the highest population density areas in the US.  So anything would be over weighted statistically to those portions of the country.  If you really want to say "OMG, all of the kidnappings are around blue portions of the election map", that is great, but statistically it would be that way by default.  It's simple math.

             Yes i know that but if you read the article it says that most that go missing are children between the ages of 20 months to 12 years old, it also says most of the others are elderly people, which is easy to explain. The article also says that no one with a firearm has ever gone missing. What i would like to know is why the kids that are found have NO shoes with no cuts or bruises on the feet? And can't remember what happened to them.

              You're just wrong. I'm not trying to anger you. You obviously don't know about Hunters 411. You're just not up on it like other people. Tons and tons of NOT children. This has nothing to do with molesting children or sex trade. In fact, if you bothered to actually do the research into 411, no offense, but they state outright over and over again that they look for sexual assault. In 100% of cases where bodies are recovered not one sexual assault, because that is always everyone's first thinking, it's what they check for and they rule it out. It has never been found. You need to research this further and stop just posting cool stuff because you have some interesting facts.

            Can you also compare a map of sanctuary cities?  I remember a lot of the blue/dnc voting cities are sanctuary cities.  These places might be easier to traffic children in and out of.

            There was a news / chat show interview on UK television after the London attacks. The victim went on national TV the NEXT DAY after the attacks with no shoes on because they were been cleaned?!!. You could not make this shit up. He apparently walked to the studios with wet socks. Masonic symbolism.

             Ahah yes that would be the bloke he also showed in the video, I was wondering who he was. His shoes were getting cleaned haha fuck so he couldn't find another pair anywhere at all to wear on TV, they just threw themselves under the bus right there!

              The amount of clothes and shoes This Morning receive for product placement is ridiculous. NO WAY did they not have spare shoes for this guy. On a lighter note .. if a "terrorist" attack happens close by me the first thing I will be doing is removing my shoes and pretending I was a crisis actor!

                  It was a photograph, google image it. Its a dummy under bus with only legs showing. Its behind the wheel, not flat, no blood. They just presume "she's" dead without pulling her out. Its comical

                   Pretty certain protocol isn't leaving someone under a bus and presuming they're dead. No doubt false flag.

               There was a  news / chat show interview on UK TV after the London attacks. The victim went on national TV the next day after the attacks with no shoes on because they were been clean. You could not make this shit up. He apparently walked to the studios with wet socks. Masonic symbolism.

            I've been separately researching the astonishingly high number of people who go missing every year in our National Parks. Sometimes it's entire clusters of people all at once-- adults as well as children. But of course this is not reported in the MSM so most people are blissfully unaware. I hadn't heard about the children reappearing and shoeless though. And they definitely sound like they were traumatized somehow. I think your theory is worth looking into more.

             I would like to tell OP that this is likely in part due to population density differences. There are more people in DNC voting counties, as they are usually urban.

              Also, there's a lot of national parks on the west coast, and probably few in the plains/Midwest.
             </p>
             <p>
              So not only do the coasts have higher population, they also have more national parks.

              David Paulides is a former cop who has been investigating this for years. Here's a video about some of his findings:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRqp5AqixE">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfRqp5AqixE
              </a>
              I haven't watched it yet so can't vouch for it. His books on the subject appear to be out of print.
