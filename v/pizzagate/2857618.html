<p>This relates to pizzagate as it is about Elites and children mind control symbolism related to Satanism or Monarch.</p>
<p>This article is well written. I checked all the references and they are not taken out of context. This content fits the bill for clothing specifically made for children who are part of the Monarch movement it seems.</p>
<p>I have been discussing with my spouse the lives of Céline and her late husband going back 40 years. We are all aware that Céline was taken under René\'s wings at barely 12. It seems odd but he was truly a powerhouse of the music industry, he wasn\'t some n00b. She and I are the same age so I have always followed her career. She sang for the Pope in 1984. I am currently racking my brain trying to find any &quot;illuminati shit&quot; in their past but coming up empty.</p>
<p>Céline is an extremely nice person. I know MANY people who have worked for her in many capacities and they all report astonishment at the quality of the Dion-Angélil family. When René died, everything changed overnight. She distanced herself from the Angélil side of the family. She fired people from her crew. Her manager quit his job. This all happened so fast. She\'s been gallivanting around the world taking on a more sexy approach to her art. I support her but it\'s atypical for her. It\'s sort of like when Christina Aguilera did the sex thing and everybody was all like: WTF? It was atypical and unexpected. We are not official family members but close-ish relations.</p>
<p>So I am just dumbfounded. I cannot tell you where this comes from. It is inexplicable!</p>
<p>I am specifically concerned with the fact that they hit all the child mind control symbolism. When I look at this I think about Sara Ruth Ashcraft\'s testimonies about her childhood. The striped and Zebra thing comes to mind. <a href="https://twitter.com/SaRaAshcraft/status/1055136938636861441">https://twitter.com/SaRaAshcraft/status/1055136938636861441</a></p>

            My first clue was when she married a much older man. 
I felt she was manipulated. She was soo young taking up 
With a much older man.  A 30 yrs old with a 49 yr old is one thing but their ages at the time were inappropriate.

             I am from the Angelil side of the family. There has never been much drama surrounding this. Though you are right that she has lived an insulated life. In the first phase as a young celebrity and in the second phase completely surrounded by Rene's machine. But, to me, the relationship was always one where Rene dedicated himself completely to the process of Celine's work. It will always remain something surprising to me. They lived a life where most people are distracted from each other or fall into drama, yet I am not sure anymore how many times they renewed their vows. An interesting couple throughout and super nice and generous to all. I have noted the Luciferian pledging across her recent work. Her song "Je fais ce que je veux" made me cry because it is so obviously a cult pledge. I approach this as I have all other cases, with the most generous and positive attitude. It's not as if I can walk up to the fam and bring this up. I used to chat here with a distant cousin of Kate Spade. I am bracing myself for the same heartbreak as he figured out how she is connected to "them". Discretion is the best protection at this point. Most people are far away from knowing enough basics about the cult to understand what membership means.

             They got married later in life. She has never been considered a child bride of a pedo. In order to be able to understand the relationship, you would have to live around them, read the press in French for 20 years and assess this using this knowledge. The drive to point fingers at unscrupulous producers in my Province is high and a few have been destroyed fully over such revelations. Kids in our entertainment industry are not sexualized at all, and they are styled in age-appropriate clothing, it's such a huge difference from American dance mom and beauty pageant stuff. You would have to know French in order to watch Quebec TV and notice this. There is no such drama when it comes to Celine and Rene. And that is why I am supportive of Celine. She has been perfect all her life, she can do whatever the fuck she wants in my book. But it is her association with trash satanists that is worrisome and sad.

               Il est important de comprendre les personnes qui font partie du culte. Ce sont des gens qui ont une partie de leur vie encrée dans le philanthropie, dans la religion, dans la charité. Pour comprendre l'ensemble du mouvement, il faut comprendre ses membes. Ils sont tous des gens qui ont une apparence publique fantastique mais une vie privée secrète que l'on ne comprend pas encore complètement. Cela fait plus de 2 ans que j'étudie les "Luciferiens" et le prospect de faire une étude de quelqu'un qui est plus proche de moi que Madonna ou Lady Gaga est très révélateur. Votre réaction ressemble au "kill them all!" qu'on voit souvent ici. Mais sans comprendre un système, il est impossible de le detruire. Les Luciferiens se croient justifies dans leurs action par notre consentement (nous aimons leur art) et donc pour que le peuple cessent de donner leur consentement au "glamour" de Hollywood, ils doivent etre eduques sur leurs pratiques. Tous doievent comprendre la corruption qui enveloppe la planete pour pourvoir la refuser dans le futur.

            I've heard her sing a few times but beyond that nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. Getting together with a 12yo child; bingo! You'll recall many singing stars &amp; duet couples in particular have adult-child relations as part of their formula for success; Cher &amp; Sonny, Gloria Estefan, and the semi-literate singer who married Tony blah, blah, blah as Sony Music boss. I forget her name, but she stars on the TV amateur singing contest show.

            In 1990, went on an exotic fishing tip with my FIL &amp; his 2 father/son real estate investment partners. The younger realtor told me his daughter was going to become a H-wood starlet. He'd just paid thousands for her professional picture portfolio. 
  She was a cute little girl, but only really beautiful to her father; the easy money idiotic realtor.
I begged &amp; begged for him to keep her home. I poured out my heart to change his mind for a perfect stranger. "How are you going to protect here living in the Midwest? You guys know the rest of the story, drugs, rape &amp; porno movies; the woman's badly damaged goods today.
           </p>
           <p>
            My points to him were patently obvious, but he believed the H-wood Big Lie. His daughter was beautiful, all Dad's think this. H-wood means easy money, he craved that big money. His marriage broke up, his business robbed my FIL and this poor little girl was just more grist for the mill.

            I don't watch TV to avoid this toxic culture. It never crosses my doorstep, because I don't own an idiot box. Join 'Cut the Cord' it cures the entire topic &amp; keeps it away from your family door.
We need a few more pedo-revenge killings. Maybe a TV series I can avoid watching.

            Wooooow. Holy shit. That children’s clothing line is beyond sick, demented and purely satanic. The reason they push “gender binary or neutral” crap is so that they have population control on the masses. The more people feel “other” the less likely they will reproduce which is exactly what they want. That is the entire reason for the LGBTQ movement. Remember that Celine Dion came from a family of 14 kids I believe and she was youngest. That in itself is not normal. Also in Montreal, Quebec where she is apparently from, there is a heavy Luciferian occult upper class. Queen Elizabeth and monarchy have visited several times. Canada is now supposedly paying for gender reconstruction surgery for trannies with tax dollars.

             the tranny kids is also about normalizing kids "choice"... if they can choose their gender, they can "choose" to be sexually active (with an adult).   they are trying to normalize pedophilia and some people are ok with it, it seems.

             It is really interesting when you consider her ancestry. Carmencita and I discussed this a couple of nights ago. Not only does the gender neutral freaky clothing line disturb me, but look at the infant with the New Order tee on.

             As the years go by they get more and more blatant and stop caring what the public thinks. Look at that dislike bar. She knows the satanic bitch. They try to apply humor at the end but it's obvious. Karma will be a bitch.

            More pathetic sickness. Went to the website and saw all the “celebrity” parents with their kids. Oh yeah, that makes me want to go out and get my kids the same creepy clothes that all these inbred pervs get their kids. Who are the retards that actually worship these cretins?

             Omg, it never ends. I came across this, and all kinds of alarms went off. I haven't had a chance to read it all yet, but what I did see is pure abuse of these kids. I'll pop in later.

              You actually have absolutely no clue of what I said do you ? It flew so far over your head it went out into deep space never to be seen again.  Id explain it in detail but I doubt you'd get it. Go play with your GI-joe dolls and let the adults handle the big boy issues of the world. Go to your room !

               You can try and hide behind that same, ineffective figleaf, but your pathetic excuses will not work here.  Anyone in front of the cameras — be they actor, politician, #FAKENEWS “reporter”, etc. — should most definitely be judged by what they are portraying, whose agenda they serve, whose pockets they line, whose oxen they gore.  More and more people all over the world are waking up to this.  Most Goats know that Q said long ago: “Their symbolism will be their downfall.” and shills like you who attempt to deflect or deny Celine Dion’s obvious Luciferian/Satanist connections are wasting your time here.  Q said it best: “They think we are stupid.” Clearly, you are either one of them or you are just a stooge.

            Words fail me. This is deeply deeply disturbing. This is out of the closet--a pure announcement. I have always detested her music and this is as evil as it gets. I suggest you reexamine what you think you know about her. What you write rings many alarms--singing for the pope for one--meeting her husband at age 12??? Not sure why you are dumb founded--no offense, because it all seems real clear to me. Thanks for posting this--I appreciate it.

             At this point, I am disappointed that she has lent her name to a company that designs symbolistic shit. I've been here 2 years and have perused the habits of the lifestylers. I can name no action in private life that would raise any flags. This clothing is for children younger their Celine's own. I don't see the association between her and the brand. They would be from two different worlds.

              She has been singing in Las Vegas for some time. Big big red flag for mafia. The money is enormous and it seems those who do it are  connected. As Sam Giancanni was quoted in Double Cross, "Working with CIA is just like the mob, it is the mob." All roads lead to Rome.

               When she was in Vegas she was under contract with Ceasar's Entertainment. The Luciferian hulabaloo of Vegas seems to be run out of the Luxor and it's not a Ceasar's property. Ceasar's palace has the weirdest vibe. I don't like the garishness of it either.

               The Pope came to Canada in 1984. It was a big deal. They got the most famous singer to sing for him in Quebec. That is Celine Dion. Another friend's dad got to give the Pope a beautiful set of handblown dishes. I watched those dishes get made. Outside of the things we suspect, there is normal diplomatic activities. The things we talk about are limited to another tier of activity. The reason why I talk about this is to figure out the systems and functions. I don't think much about the specifics, I try to figure out the system so that a clog can be thrown into the machine, at just the right place to break it most. Trust the plan. Look at Jade Helm 2015 logo... Do you see the ghost clog (sabot)? We are here to "sabotage" The Masters of the Human Domain!
