<p>Hello Cheese Pizza lovers! </p>
<p>We are offering to send fresh (not seen on Tor before) pictures of Cheese Pizza direct to your email. We will only send to Tor email services (SIGAINT, TorBox etc). </p>
<p>When we send you email we will also include a .onion address that has not been seeded / posted to any Tor hidden service directories. You can sign up at that address to purchase more fresh pictures of Cheese Pizza as well as trade your own for BTC. </p>
<p>Here is how it works: 
1) Choose from the menu below and deposit the correct amount into the BTC address -&gt; 12h5PpA4ok6mbfxL8TjCLe3QMZuhWvVTzs 
2) Send an email to marios-pizza@sigaint.org - keep it simple. All we need to know is the BTC address you sent FROM 
3) We will reply within 1-2 hours (our daytime) with an email containing the .onion address and a ZIP file with 10 pictures 
4) If you purchased more than 10 pictures we will send more emails. Each email will contain a ZIP file with another 10 pictures. If your email service rejects the email - your inbox is full etc - don\'t worry, we will wait a while and try again until you receive all the pictures you ordered </p>
<p>Cheese Pizza menu:<br />
- 10 pictures = 0.01 BTC<br />
- 25 pictures = 0.025 BTC 
- 50 pictures = 0.05 BTC </p>
<p>Looking forward to serving you some fresh Cheese Pizza! </p>
<p>Cheers, </p>
<p>Mario :-) </p>

<p>I looked at the history of transactions for that Bitcoin Address.  You can view it for yourself here: <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/12h5PpA4ok6mbfxL8TjCLe3QMZuhWvVTzs">https://blockchain.info/address/12h5PpA4ok6mbfxL8TjCLe3QMZuhWvVTzs</a></p>
<p>There is only 2 outgoing transactions from that address, only 1 of which closely relates to a price on that &quot;menu&quot;.  If it was a service, it sure didn\'t get any customers.  <strong>The real bogus flag however, is this:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Type that address into google.</li>
<li>One of the only &quot;clearnet&quot; results is to this forum thread:

<li>I ran a who-is on 2hu-ch.org and it was registered in 2016.  This conflicts with the thread date of **Fri Jul 31 05:47:05 2015 **</li>

<p>If somebody can prove that this advertisement for &quot;cheese pizza&quot; was in fact existing on the internet (clearnet or darkweb) PRIOR to #pizzagate breaking out, I will gladly add this back to my site.

            I'm just not certain the post wasn't prior to pizzagate.  For one, can you put a link to the "whois" result in your post?  Also, it seems possible that the website had older threads from elsewhere posted on it.  The site is called "overchan;" maybe that means it's some kind of aggregator?

             I believe the other one I removed was the artwork circulating by Kim Noble. She has not come out as being a ritual abuse survivor, and those pictures were drawn by one of her "multiple personalities". I agree that she could be drawing these pictures as an outlet for dealing with a childhood trauma, however I searched the web and couldn't find anything published regarding her real past. Using her pictures, particularly as a source for the "handkerchief under the victim" theory seems to be reaching a little far.

            Noted.  I will remove that bit, at least until such time as sources can be found.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The wiki article that is sourced does not reference pedophelia even once in the entire article. It seems to be a code used amongst homosexuals, and that's it.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think the handkerchief code is still relevant, as it indicates a plausible explanation.  The code isn't necessarily exclusive to homosexuals; it may have been adopted by others who wish to communicate sexual preferences using code.  As for the significance of white, for now I will change that to a suggested possible meaning, until such time as a source for it can be found.
           </p>
           <p>
            It occurs to me that another possible explanation for the handkerchief email is that it was just a handkerchief, and had a map folded up
            <em>
             inside
            </em>
            it.  This seems somewhat unlikely, though, as in his reply, Podesta said "it's mine, but it's nor important," not "they are mine, but they aren't important." So it seems the handkerchief itself had special significance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for your thoroughness!

            The pizza related handkerchief map is the kernel of this discussion, imo as well. All other things have plausible deniability.

            While we're at it off the top of my head, it's been established (I think) that things like the "#hotard" pic upon further analysis is most likely JimmyComet calling the person in the thread a hotard. Seaman still spreads this all the time too and he should know better. Love David though.

                 if he was calling  joewills a hotard it likely would have been on the same line, not separate. Like in  # hotard @ joewills    on the same line.   These people arent normal so there's that.

            I understand this well.  But I'm not really following your argument on this in particular.  You seem to be saying (1) that since this bitcoin address only sent someone something once, it's probably fake.  Eh, I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            And (2) you searched and found the post on a website that was registered later than the date of the post.  So you think someone registered a website just to make one fake post with a fake date?  Or someone hacked the site and change the posting date?
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, the possibility of that individual post being fake isn't particularly relevant, as we have other evidence to corroborate the use of "cheese pizza" as code for child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, you said you had to remove "more" disinfo.  Was there anything else you found in the summary sticky that you found questionable?
