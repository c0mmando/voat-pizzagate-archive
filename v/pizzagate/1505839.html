            Interesting. I have been investigating as many angles to all of this that I can.  Recently, I came across this video claiming that the Jesuits are cypto-Jews.  All of this is so complex and interwoven and go so far back in history. It was just one interesting take on things.

            Some people in this /v wonder whether these dicussions have any place here.  I say they do because understanding what is going on helps me to put more and more of the pieces together.  In the end, it may be that this is actually a very simple overarching reality that just seems complex because it's completely foreign to me.  As I said in another post, I have a friend who was brought up in all who has told me the best way to look at this, even by the numbers, is that we live in a satanic world with a few normies, not a normal world with a few satanists.   That freaks me the F out.

             My argument to anyone questioning the relevance of this thread is: shouldn't we try to understand the motivations of the group most often associated with paedophilia, especially when John Podesta identifies as something of an activist within this group?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm more optimistic than your friend, I believe that Satanists are very much in the minority and that they are starting to lose their shit with Trump's win and the internet's focus on pizza and such.
            </p>

             Perceptions of reality have been manipulated through language that has changed to accommodate political ambition, one example of this ambiguity is the use of codewords to conceal practices which the public would find unacceptable.
