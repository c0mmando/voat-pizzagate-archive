            Your argument falls well short because YouTube and Google are not a monopoly. Not even close. There are dozens of viable alternatives to google products.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think their censorship is shitty. But it's not illegal.

           <p>
            Private entities have the
            <em>
             right
            </em>
            to censor speech, but there's a difference between rights and obligations. So there's not really any conflict between the right to censor and an obligation based on an implied agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do agree they have somewhat of an obligation/expectation from the pubic to allow free speech, and I also think it's in their best interest. Most people want
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            censorship to the things they read each day, so social media will accommodate them. But there's a threshold to how much they can censor before it turns too many people away. For example, I believe Eddit has screwed itself and will be replaced by voat within a few years.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             But - you can't sue someone for a breach of a social expectation.

            Thank You and That makes perfect sense, I was just reading about David Seaman and read a similar comment, the person said "publicly traded" companies and not legally allowed to censor users w/o legal merit, I'll amend the post and and put "public" instead of private but the problem still remains. PizzaGate needs a legal team, and I'm sure we have the numbers to easily pay for it.
