            Rayzie, every public health beneficiary is intimidated as every level of corp and govt failure to comply and mandate report to OIG, DOP, governor, each dept and is same in Veteran scandal ongoing; law/ contract mandates/Beneficiary Rights/ADA Title violations not fix and protect beneficiaries from further harms, worsened conditions, self reliance, added disabilities and conditions, failure to timely and accurately diagnose and treat. Every funded npo does not help but covers up and failures mandate report harms and fraud billing. Connecting Clinton into the systems and infrastructures of all in corp, govt, npo and oversignt agencies all involved and dots to connect via contracts, via profits, via immigrant and peison back to work peograms with govt/corps/npo and staff ( including in shipping processes)  and funding is key. Immigrant to work in USA is key. $urely to horse mouth are fences in buttfruck dodge children of corn fields, of no value and unfit for public health.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every beneficiary wronged are doors to call and document fed violations, including failures to mandate report at every govt/corp/npo level. Documenting violations is what holds in courts. You crossed paths with ones doing steps that were of value to your pursuits. Hence,  same troll shills put up gates that wisely jumping are key skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maryland registered offenders posted as not monitored and real estate dwellings are also keys to mapping and jobs given to unhireables. Institutionalizing versus jails, staff and patients harmed by offenders are in media to dig up. Same judges and others will pop up. Corp connects to Boystown and abandoned industry sites are by the offenders. Agricultural product corps spent ample money and time to build factory sites then abandoned sites. Why? Is key. Conagrua and bio sustainable corps in USA and abroad conect as do orphans/fosters/cps in USA and abroad. Ukraine and other countries regulations on adopt and foster. Boystown and nun and research in deaf and other medical are keys. Proving to those ones is like proving to septic matter. Flush the crap, reseed the core roots that dropped on your path. Court cases media never cover in every system and reports are keys, also. Follow papertrails, money, board directors. Every governor is dotted in to contracts and director boards and profit bigtime. Citizen nonawareness and apathy has allowed much.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama and bio sustainable is loose terms for life matter as resource to products and energy. Follow the UK cows to the bones of corp and Germany WW2.

            Trump is going to have to start investigations against all Clintons to even get absurd govt/media  off his back and son. Its all a distraction and disempower techniques. He should have done it from the start. Clintons are connected into every infrastructure, including npo, CDC, NIH, universities and research and more. What Chelsea twits is connections. Even the image of Chelsea as a young female child not to be attcked has allowed Chelsea to bloom in the seedy ways. Propoganda is so easy to the masses that it is beyond sad and disturbing. The surely shill has been a distraction on voat for months abd ones still fall for it and waste their time responding and proving points.    Surely shill aint going to do shit for pgate or any real issue. In NYC, "keep it moving," is the advice that rids the lice.

             $urely is a gate to souldier marathon jump to flush. Other areas brought into voat that were flushed, mango shipping protocals and every corporate/npo on contracts and fed/state funding are key in the Pgate gate systemic infrastructure and connect dots to NASDAQ, Haiti/Clinton industrial park, other countries and connected corps/npos, pharmaceuticals on NASDAQ and medical industry/universities/hospitals/institutions, board of directors, contracts , oversight boards in house to govt departments such as DOP/OIG/Disability Rights (all connected an fund streams, HMOS and all there state/fed/corp contracts. Papertrail is contracts, laws, mandates, etc.  and documenting all sorts of violations of laws and contract mandates are key to take down in courts to dismantle. Every law and contract and funding  should be read, posted; including Federal Aquisition Handbook that Trump knows and read. Many are pdf files from every govt dept on their websites as links, making the maze inefficient and timely to sort through; same with every CPS/health departments cases and beneficiary complaints/hippa requests. Solving and busting  requires contract, laws and violations to connect the dots and show public the blatant trillions in fraud connected to violations against beneficiaries of all ages.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing all about Mango shipping requirements and the pricess is eye opening and connects the dot in players of this systemic set of infrastructures in USA and abroad are systems of constructive fraud that allow and enable and do. Govt staff unions from public health care jobs to any dept is also cover up systemic and key. The number of govt and corp staff in systemic violations is habit and intimidate. Failure to comply to federal mandate reporting in timely and full reports is one of many felonies that occurs daily, as beneficiaries and parents call and report. Ones should know contracts, laws, all the dots connected in players and USA beneficiary rights and benefit rights, abroad, inside and out.
$urely is a fence to jump that is miles from core and old news.

             Ok, well there are other sites that have the story. Arewesure is the one that said it originated there. There were tweets and everything. So decide for yourself what you want to believe. I wouldn't have posted if I knew that I was going to go thru all this.

Time to white out with bleach in apathy and jump that gate like a souldier not metaphorically hump.

            AFAIK the story of Joseph Rago's connection to Hillary Clinton begins with Sorcha Faal. It was then reposted without attribution on Free Republic and various others ran with it. This doesn't mean that the the connection doesn't exist, but clearly there's room for skepticism here.

            You added links to two mainstream sources, the mirror and the WSJ.  Did you notice that they don't support your original post whatsoever.  In fact, these two articles say absolutely nothing about Hillary Clinton whatsoever.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your initial link is conspiracy nonsense filled with lies. You claim your source has nothing to do with Sorcha Faal.  That is only because you never tried to find out the original source of this conspiracy. In this sentence the author is making clear he/she is relying on the reports of others, "reportedly investigating."
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He was reportedly investigating Hillary’s involvement in the purchase of Russian drug company Veropharm by Abbot Labs at a time in 2014 when sanctions against Russia would have prevented the sale.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            He offers no links, so you cannot then try to figure out who made this claim. These fake news sources love to rip each other off.  He names two sources, but they are not the original source of this claim The first person to make this claim is Sorcha Faal on July 22.  As usual he cites a report from Russian Intelligence as the source of this knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can also go back to the news reports of the sale and find none of the news reports mention Veropharm being under sanctions because it was not.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also zero news articles involving Veropharm and Clinton prior to the Sorcha Faal article.  And the reason being is because Sorcha Faal made it up.  And Joseph Rago was not investigating some imaginary case of sanctions violations.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you unwittingly swallowed and passed along a conspiracy theory started by Sorcha Faal.

              We have definitive proof that the FBI is not interested in any law, order or justice.

              Our only hope is for the world to know the real Truth - and start by exposing the model and "Root" of the entire system in Racine, Wisconsin where the Clintons and Clinton Foundation are directly connected to the RICO criminal networks. It would be the domino that works best of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and would show the world there will never be justice in a broken and corrupt system.
             </p>
             <p>
              We must rise against the real model of Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast before it is too late.

               What's your model? The value of a model is its ability to predict outcomes given a known set of facts, simply saying "it's Racine" doesn't have predictive value.

             Why does it matter when he won his award? Of course they are going to say that the death doesn't look suspicious. What are the odds? He was young and investigating Hillary. Hello? Sound familiar?

                  Sorcha is a woman's name, but it doesn't matter because Sorcha Faal doesn't exist.  It's the fake pen name of the guy who owns the site.

              Well EquineLuvr is related to Jesus, so let's all pray to rid him of this malevolent spirit of intellectual evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dear Amon Ra, who art in art, bring us our daily bread to hit over the head of equineluvr until he submits and we might harness his powers for good.
Amen. Amon.  Zip-Zap-Sham-Reem-Naar-Wahl Om.

              Horsefucker lacks any self confidence. That's why he has to attack everyone while informing us how smart he is. It makes him feel good. But in reality he is a coward bullying everyone over the Internet. In real life, the little bitch would have his teeth knocked out.
