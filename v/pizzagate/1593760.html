            I took a look at the original document on Wikileaks, and it appears "322" is a page number of a much longer report on Haiti. The previous page has "321". You have to open the pdf to see it's the page number though.

             Ah I see! I feel silly now. Was the other one about the 10 year old girl a page number as well?

              It looked like it -- it was right where the other page numbers were. However, there was only one page of the pdf on Wikileaks, so it's possible it could be something else. It does LOOK like a page number though. Also in that email there are number and letter codes, B5, B6 etc. I believe those were added by State before the email was declassified to show the reasons parts of the email were redacted before release. They refer to different reasons for redaction.

             thanks for the page # info! I was going to blog this.
But maybe they selected that page to obliquely get 322 in the letter?? If there's any more on this 322 and Clinton in Haiti I will post it.
