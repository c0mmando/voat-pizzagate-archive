<p>Last night</p>
<blockquote>
<p>two girls go missing in a black neighborhood in Milwaukee, there is a notorious house there that everyone is suspicious off as being a front for trafficking</p>
<p>police are called, the police search the houses multiple times and claim they found nothing</p>
<p>parents organize a search party/mob</p>
<p>the crowd breaks into the house, finds childrens clothes coated in blood</p>
<p>shooting breaks out from the traffickers</p>
<p>they\'re seen moving the children to another nearby house</p>
<p>police arrive, begin beating back the search party, FUCKING ESORT THE TRAFFICKERS OUT THE BACK WHILE COVERED IN TARPS SO THEIR IDENTITY IS HIDDEN</p>
<p>two kidnapped children make a break for it in the chaos, are rescued safely</p>
<p>documents and shit are found pertaining to the trafficking operation</p>
<p>more police show up</p>
<p>one of the houses mysteriously burns down</p>
<p>media mentions nothing about any of this, frames it as an angry mob burning down a house</p>
<p>you are now here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ok I\'m going to try and explain the Milwaukee stuff for people who haven\'t been watching all day.</p>
<p>In the last few days, 9 black children have gone missing. 3 of them were just yesterday. The cops haven\'t done shit, no amber alerts, nothing.</p>
<p>This morning, some of the kids were seen being put in a red minivan at a house by neighbors, and it drove away. Cops searched the house and found no kids, and left. Other missing kids have been spotted at the house in the past, and it\'s believed that a child sex trafficker lives there (one of two households that lives there, it\'s a rented duplex).</p>
<p>The neighborhood was not satisfied with this, so they gathered at the house to see wtf. Someone inside the house shot at people.</p>
<p>Cops came because of shots fired. Entered the house for a while, then whisked away the people inside into a paddy wagon with coverings so you couldn\'t see them, all very covert. Crowd doesn\'t like it.</p>
<p>Around this time, people get a tip that some of the missing kids are seen a couple blocks away. They go there, and find two of them. Another one runs away. I believe 4 missing kids have been found by the crowd, including the 3 from yesterday.</p>
<p>Cops leave, and crowd immediately enters the house and creepy van parked out back. That is when people found child-sized swim trunks that looked bloody in the van (they were shown on the stream), and people mentioned seeing the room with blood (not shown, Nitty never entered the building).</p>
<p>Cops watched people break shit and go in and out of the house for a while, then decide they\'re going to stop people, and do. Do their intimidation crap, shoot some gas, the usual bs.</p>
<p>Crowd decides to start creepy van and house on fire. Fire dept comes, working on putting out fire.</p>
<p>At some point after the fire, someone (from the crowd) fired a gun a few times, a woman was supposedly hit and taken by a medic to the hospital. Unclear what happened with that.</p>
<p>Now, it\'s just a big mess of cops and crowd and it\'s a tinderbox because of course.</p>
<p>We don\'t know who owns the house. It\'s for sale. The man and/or old woman that lives upstairs may be unrelated to any trafficking, but they own the creepy van and let the tenants downstairs use it. They had been on scene but have left.</p>
<p>Underlying issue: Cops don\'t care about missing or trafficking black kids and people are going to deal with it themselves.</p>

            This entire thread is horrifying and can I just remind everyone that this is the same police department that handed a naked 14 year old boy who was bleeding from his rectum back to a serial killer inside an apartment that contained a dead body.

            <p>
             While in Congress, Neil Abercrombie was one of Barack Obama's earliest and most vocal supporters. This is not surprising, as there is a close Obama/Abercrombie family connection and seemingly many shared values.  Studying at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa in the early 1960s, Abercrombie attended classes with and befriended current United States President Barack Obama's parents, Stanley Ann Dunham and the young Marxist economist Barack Obama. Sr.

            <p>
             Abercrombie's wife Nancie Caraway, an academic, noted for her far left views, has also been a D.S.A. member.  In 1985, Dr. Nancie Caraway of Hawaii was listed as a member of the Feminist Commission of the Democratic Socialists of America... Note the presence of Barabara Ehrenreich on this list. in 2008, Ehrenreich founded Progressives for Obama , with D.S.A. comrades Bill Fletcher, Jr. and Tim Carpenter.

              Texas woman pleads guilty to sex-trafficking 9 year old girl to former Humane Society of US VP David Wills

            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Turns out David Wills from Rockport is the former president of the Michigan Humane Society as well as the former VP of the Humane Society of the US. Even though the mainstream media hasnt touched it... There are plenty of articles documenting his ties to these organizations available.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Coincidentally, the Humane Society backed candidate Clinton in her bid for president, and called Trump a threat to animals.

              Okay, what we have to watch out for is the networking that goes on in getting these pervs in positions of power. Willis was called out in 2010. He embezzled money from the HSUS and tried to float the combining of HSUS and the Michigan Humane Society which would have meant the HSUS actually running and controlling pet shetlers. The pervs must have wanted to get their hands on animals ... God only knows what they were going to do to them, but look what they're doing to kids!

            They may control the BLM narrative for now that will not last for much longer. We can use this info to target them (the real problem) and not the rest of the population allowing us to be unified and PISSED.

             This is almost exactly what happened in Minneapolis. "A" mob didn't burn this house down, THE mob burned it down. It looks like the new method for destroying evidence that the cabal is using is to summon a BLM mob and then strategically burn down buildings with evidence of their misconduct inside. This is exactly what happened in the 3rd precinct and the Order of Odd Fellows Building down the street where Floyd and Chauvin worked together.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only do they get to burn evidence down, but they also get to associate pizzagate with BLM, rioters and arsonists.

            this is a LARP
