            Stallone's movie, Over the Top, was filmed at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas.
           </p>
           <p>
            While filming there, Stallone had a room at the Las Vegas Hilton, and was allegedly involved in sexual activity with 'a 15-year-old girl' inside his room.
           </p>
           <p>
            Afterwards, the teen claims Stallone said that if she told anyone, 'they would have to beat her head in.'
           </p>
           <p>
            According to a former Las Vegas Police detective, one of Stallone's bodyguards, Michael De Luca, took the 15-year-old girl to Stallone's room to meet Stallone.
           </p>
           <p>
            The girl said that she had been 'intimidated' into having sex with Stallone and the bodyguard Michael 'Mike' De Luca.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2013, Stallone bodyguard, Michael De Luca was shot and killed by California police.

             666
            </strong>
            every month in her lifetime, on top of a trust with $50,000 per year for medical and psychiatric expenses.

             Hmmm I'm not fully sure. Just don't think it's random. Might be something to do with side-effects of mind control techniques (or microchips installed in their head or something). Strange world we live in but I will be looking further into this for sure!

             A lot of Pedos have whats known in prison as "SHORT EYES". They focus short of the subject matter and often have a drooping left eye lid. Whether this is caused by Narcissism (False Self) as a result of abuse, or because they take so many psychotropic meds like Librium which affects the ocular nerve is anyones guess.

              I find this observation about "Short Eyes" very interesting. I think I've observed that in sketchy people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any famous examples?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, do you remember recently that some team developed an AI Software "Gaydar" that supposedly was very accurate at picking out Gay persons from Photo's/Video? It was headline news about 2 months ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've also noticed that a few Narcissists I have known all seem to have a shortening of the distance from the underside of the nose to the base of the chin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Scroll down and look at picture of DB and JA:
Power LIst 2010 - DC Power Couples:
              <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/alefantcomet.htm">
               http://www.rense.com/general96/alefantcomet.htm
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Notice the proportion of the area above the top lip to the underside of the nose and the dimension of the lower chin.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is just something "off" about this facial dimension.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once I started "seeing" this, I noticed there are many other's that have been implicated in some of this that have a very similar dimensional disproportion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Almost like hormones were off or something. Partly between genders.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also wonder how many Pedo's are dyslexic. 
Certainly there is a lot of Narcissism out there in the World, but to find the combination of Gay, Pedo and Narc all in one, makes it seem potentially biological in some way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just food for thought. No real conclusions or accusations. Just mulling it around.
             </p>
             <p>
              Especially the facial proportions. If a computer can be an accurate "Gaydar", why not "Pedo-Soft"?  ;)

               Its an interesting subject that could do with more exploring. I wish someone would a YT video on it to open the subject up.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you do an image search for convicted Pedos you would see a prevalence of them have the drooping left eye, short eyes and often photographed with eyes swiveled round in the socket. Lots of famous Deep State actors have the weird eye thing going on as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               I haven't ever noticed it in Gays, but in the case of Alfantis I would think of him as someone who had been subject to childhood abuse, a drugged up Pedo Narcissists, not as Gay.

            The ole hinky eye. Don't be surprised when more come out against Arnold and others.  The dam is just beginning to lap over the top.  The MSM can't ignore too much longer. I'm beginning to wonder what happened in the NoKo.  Was that the seat of the Deep State?  Were all assets deployed to decapitate?  Little fat boy has been awfully quiet. Maybe Q was right?  Keep doing God's work, my friend.

             Arnold's brother died in a car crash back in Austria right around the time when Arnold's career took off! Another sacrifice?!!! Arnold was my idol.
