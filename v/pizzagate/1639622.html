            Pizza slice as reference to a server is highly likely. I did not make the connection until now, but I have used the term pizza box in regards to servers a lot in the late 1990's. This came from the so called Pizza Box from factor.
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050119154302/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box_form_factor">
             Wikipedia has an entry about it since 2005.

             So, when Hitlery wrote (see Wikileaks), "Have a slice for me!" she was referencing a server?  That doesn't sound right to me.

            Very , very interesting. I will check this you check out what McConnell and Hawkins have been reporting on death betting..I had never heard of this. Livestreaming would also add to the adrenaline rush of these sickos and additional profits.

            Does anyone recall that there seemed to be some odd cords coming to /from  Pegasus? I am going to try and find a pic. Always wondered what they were for. They seemed to be connected from one building to the next.

            For one thing, as I read your post, I could not stop thinking about snuff films. I think this is what is really taking place. We know Podesta is into cannibalism. I don't think rape and torture is completely satisfying for these guys, nor for their satanic rituals.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I came upon your mention of Pegasus, finally the upper 'floor' area that is on wheels and inaccessible to those on the ground floor, or to children, made sense. Murder can be messy. This might be why they want to be very far removed, yet in the same room? For filming and viewing?

              I don't want to be sordid, but we have to be willing to look at facts. If they truly are practicing some satanic occult belief system, and we've got the Abrhamovic connection, and the art, and Insta's that tell us they're into this stuff, we have to consider that murder is taking place somewhere. With the number of missing children, we have to assume they are getting rid of some of them, otherwise there are huge storage units full of children somewhere? I dunno, Podesta just looks straight up evil to me. I think he would quickly get bored by anything short of murder. Sorry to say. I really, really am.

               James Alefantis also brags about slaughtering 40 rabbits and post pics of the rabbit parts on his Instagram. Commenting "so much slaughter.." (or something to that effect) Allegedly for a feast for his elites friends. (He also shows one in a cage alive presumably ready for slaughter.) He has sent several disgusting mutilated pig pics to Podesta. It's like some sick ongoing joke..I am a vegetarian and an animal rights activist so all this is particularly disturbing to me. Wonder where all this slaughter takes place? The pig farm? Is this Podesta's pig farm? Can you find me the post about Podesta gutting the hogs?? I keep hearing about it but have yet to come across it.

               They don't always have to kill children involved in ritual abuse. They don't even have to go missing that long at all. Some cults literally scoop off kids for a few hours off the streets on their way home from school. (sadly I know this from personal experience but that is for another time, another post.)
 I've once witnessed them doing this with animals in my neighborhood. A black Mercedes pulled up near my house and scooped up my neighbors black cat. They drove away too fast for me to get the license. Needless to say, she never saw her cat again. There have been some instances of children being taken then returned, dazed and often drugged, dropped off at some park (this via new reporting in my City) Mutilated animals have shown up periodically in well to do neighborhoods, literally on peoples front lawns. Sometimes by the dozens.
              </p>
              <p>
               But ya, in cases where ritual murder is involved they of course are never seen again.

               </p>
               <p>
                "Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown, he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-creation."
               </p>
               <p>
                "Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta explained: “It’s best to do the butchering at 4 a.m., “because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It’s most important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a knife in its throat.”
               </p>
               <p>
                "In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.”

            Was reading an article about while back about a guy who had started a crowd funding site for CP producers bc the producers weren't getting paid, CP being commonly available free in the dark web. Was disgusting, but being a business person made me think about ways the scum bags would profit if the traditional model want working, so yeah, live shows and live streaming memberships, and memberships in general where they get regular new. If there's pricing pressure it would stand to reason they would need to produce more content for the same money, and be increasingly more shocking, sad to think about. Another aspect is while the dark web seems to be mostly dudes, it's guys in reports of arrests, busts, etc... On the live / social end it seems to be more balanced with women partaking at the elite end via their relationships with men in the gay and transgendered community. Where there are pics of masked parties, there are always lots of women. When I see those I think that they are, will be, have been witnessing something that they don't want their personal identity associated with, and there's filming going on.

             At the end of the article Pedophile Parties in Hollywood, It recommends  John McCain's Org. as a possible help to counter pedophilia, etc.  He has been mentioned as a possible player in the pedo elites.  Maybe the person that wrote the article was not aware of this at the time of the article.  There are new names added constantly, thankfully.  We are being red pilled everyday.
