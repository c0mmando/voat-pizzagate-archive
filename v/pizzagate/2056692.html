              Notice the comments are still disabled for MSM. It means they can print any type of propaganda and go unchallenged. They even published a story about how it was Trump's actions that will cause a rise in Obamacare premiums. The rise in premiums was predicted and determined even before the election. It's completely false, but there's the new narrative going unchallenged and spreading like wildfire.

              This is unbelievable.

               That's precisely why the public opinion of the MSM is at an all-time low. The MSM lie, and then lie about the lies, and then attempt to destroy anyone who calls them on it. But the lies are getting so ridiculous, even the zombified masses are starting to catch on.

                 I sure hope so, because now everyone is all NK nuke crazy and Trump is even more lunatic.  Maybe I'm the one who is crazy but I putting this out there, its wild speculation but I think (and hope) this will end with a unified Korea.

                  China will never allow a unified Korea. Not going to happen. NK are useful idiots for China. Trump is a lunatic? For trying to diplomatically end the nuclear provocations of fat boy Kim? What about the "lunatic" Bill Clinton who gave NK the reactors in the first place? How about "lunatic" Obozo who ignored the threat, for all of his 8 years, that NK was making missiles with miniaturized warheads? This is a very unstable regime that should not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. Nor should Iran.

                These are two factions. One thinks molesting children is okay, and the other doesn't. No middle ground. There's more that goes into the philosophy of molesting children, and that includes destroying America because American ideals would never permit this to be legalized. They're been undermining our country and changing laws to suit their fancy. And I'm sickened to death by the LGBT community in not speaking out. I was a huge supporter of gay marriage and being able to lead the life one wanted to lead, but if they include child molestation in their platform? Yeah, I'm rethinking all the decisions I made in not calling them out.

                 A war of two completely divergent moralities. The NWO liberal pedocracy have held sway for the last 40 years but have now overstepped the mark and are more vulnerable than ever. Pizzagate was the tipping point.

                  Totally agree. The leak of those emails was the defining moment that we realized there was a war. Those freakin' emails caused me to break out in hives and get involved. It goes much farther than whether we'll have socialized medicine. This is a war on children and ideologies in saying that a class of children is all right to plunder. The expendables are human trafficked and used for heinous blood / organ transfusions and the rest are f*cked up in the head by being ritualistically abused?

                  Hell no! It's not going to happen! RESIST? Yeah, I will resist. They subconsciously gave us our message.

                 I completely agree with you about the LBGT community but so many pedos are hetero so can't blame them for that. You are right that it is as simple as protecting children or not.

                  I'm not saying the LBGT is responsible for the pedophilia taking place. What I'm saying is that they are not speaking out on the child predation in their community. They are also promoting transgender causes in all forms, including four-year-old children deciding what sex they want to be. It is wrong, disgusting, child abuse, and should be condemned in the strongest possible language. Remember, it was the LBGT community that advanced the narrative that all gays were not pedophiles. That was a prevalent stereotype, but now after getting major support from the non-gay community they're turning their backs on gays that engage in sex with minors? And encouraging minors to undergo life-altering surgical and chemical procedures? Really? And they're getting the full benefit of having established equal rights in terms of adoptions, etc., and I'm supposed to be all right with their not condemning this?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It makes me think that I was played. I'm well aware that not every gay person is a predator, but the fact they're not speaking out bothers me to no end. And it's not even not speaking out, they're supporting this. With heterosexuals, it's that they don't believe this is happening. That's why they're not condemning what's taking place, but the gay community is promoting transgender summer camps for kids as young as four? It's freakin' child abuse! I fully support any adult who feels they want to undergo such procedures, but kids?  And the fact that we just had a well-known star have his 16-yr-old transgendered child go missing means it doesn't prevent psychological problems from occurring. What age did Jade Logue undergo this surgery? She's 16 now, so when? Twelve? It's done over a number of years so really? We have a community supporting a 12 yr old making that life-altering choice and now she runs away? How did it solve anything? Plus where did she get the idea she's a girl to begin with? It seemed to come from Donal who kept saying what a gentle, gentle little boy he had. Little boys can be gentle. They are gentle.

                 <p>
                  This war is being waged on children. That's what I'm trying to say and I'm getting very upset with those going along with it -- no matter who, what, or where they are.

                   I hear you, loud and clear. very articulate argument, but it seems so long as money is to be made from sex with children, shit like this is going to keep happening. I think there are parents that are intentionally giving the kids endocrine disrupting hormones, just as they are probably only having kids to turn them into living sex toys.

                    It seems every one of these perverse stories give us a glimpse as to what is actually going on. I mean, there's Tamera Luzzatto, who I would swear is a transgender, with a website Evie's Crib and no one even arrests him/her? What? Come on! There are still no charges or even an investigation! Exactly why would a grandmother be selling adult strangers video time with their granddaughter? Do you think they were teaching her the alphabet? Then there's crazy insane Angelina going around participating in Satanic rituals while stealing kids and collecting them like a Cabbage Patch collectioin! And then Sandra Bullock, Madonna, and others are doing the same thing? Why? Why is this going on? You know they're not altruistic.

                     I agree with Everything you both said.  So sick what is going on, and yes it makes me angry too that the LGBT people are not countering this transgender push for children.  I believe it is a mental condition really mostly, but there can be exceptions.  There should be deep deep therapy and counseling after they are 18 or later if by choice.  Yes, we were all taken for a ride because we really could never believe that humans could be so outrageously evil.  Down to the bone evil.

                   So you admit openly (((they))) prey on your womanly instinct to not stigmatize ANYTHING whatsoever.  Women are literally the MAJORITY and they even convinced you youre a minority.  Even now youre fine with chopping off healthy genitals because after turning 18 its magically no longer a mental illness. Are you starting to see how your principles take a backseat to feelings? Are you not embarrassed in the least??
