            More Asia trafficking: THE NEPAL / INDIA / SRI LANKA NEXUS
(Nepal is on the China border)
           </p>
           <p>
            "FOR SALE. BABY SHOES. NEVER WORN."  Just like Haiti, Nepal had a huge increase in child trafficking after the earthquake. Let's research the Nepal-India-Sri Lanka pipeline...
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard C. Blum (DiFi's hubby) - Nepal
Arthur C. Clark - Sri Lanka
Lady Lynn Rothschild - India
THEY ALL HAVE STORIES TO TELL.
           </p>
           <p>
            FIRST:
"Nepal: ‘Since earthquake, 15% spike in human trafficking’
A total of 308 persons of less than 18 years, and another 327 of over 18 years of age, were intercepted in the three months before the earthquake."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Immediately after the earthquake struck Nepal last year, human trafficking shot up by 15 per cent, a report of the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal has revealed." "In the three months post-earthquake, 331 persons of less than 18 years of age, and 394 persons of over 18 years, were intercepted."
           </p>
           <p>
            “Of late, India is increasingly becoming the transit location. From Nepal, the women are trafficked first to India, and then to Sri Lanka, Thailand or Bangladesh, from where they are taken to Middle East, Europe and Africa,” said Maiti Nepal’s communications officer Achyut Kumar Nepal.
“Of late, India is increasingly becoming the transit location. From Nepal, the women are trafficked first to India, and then to Sri Lanka, Thailand or Bangladesh, from where they are taken to Middle East, Europe and Africa,” said Maiti Nepal’s communications officer Achyut Kumar Nepal."
"As per Nepal Police, a total of 1,233 women and children were also reported to be missing three months after the earthquake, and as many as 161 children were rescued from different border points, between Nepal and India, in the same period."

            BLUM and DiFi are considered to be a Globalist power couple and are among the wealthiest in the Senate. Blum took an interest in Nepal at an early age and became close friends with Mt. Everest climber Sir Edmund Hillary. Through him he became acquainted with local sherpa families and created a foundation to help Nepal, including young girls involved with trafficking. HE IS ALSO A TRUSTEE FOR THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION, with a thoroughly globalist membership. The following Brookings Institute paper is a MUST READ:
           </p>
           <p>
            NOTE: This transcript of a speech made by Blum was dated 10-14-16. This was about one month before the Presidential Election. It is clear that he assumed Hillary would win. He is negative towards a Trump presidency. Blum is promoting his new book, AN ACCIDENT OF GEOGRAPHY: COMPASSION, INNOVATION, AND THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY. It includes his Nepal backstory with Sir Hillary.

            SIGNIFICANT QUOTES:
"I went originally to Nepal in '68 and I went there --I was going to Bangkok no business and I just kept going and the first night out, a couple of us spent in a Tibetan refugee camp. And there was these little kids that were either born there or carried over the mountains, friendly, you know. I mean, you fell in love in about 10 minutes. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "This was back in the '70s, helping as many trekkers do. The kids of shepherds that we went with and at some point, I see all this kind of buildup over a period of time.
I said, "Well, this isn't really fair. We're just helping shepherd kids of shepherds we know. What about the other ones that may be just as worthwhile or deserving?” So, I met a long (ph), tall fellow by the name of Sir Edmund Hilary (ph) and we became close friends for about 30 years until he passed away and most of the Himalayan trust work in the Nepal, which he started, we had funded for most of that time and we said, "We don't know who to help, not to help. Why don't we have a venture? We'll give you the money. You decide." Now, the thing about Ed Hilary, the analysts of people who were good in the development world, you wouldn't see his name listed there except on my list."
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is a guy who went to the villages, help build schools, pounded nails. I never pounded nails with him because I'm not capable, but in any event -- so over this period of time, we've known families forever. I'm a godfather to one family for over 40 years. So, part of that is I think about them all the time, as you would relatives. I understand a lot of their problems. I understand a lot of what they're doing, but I'm also convinced that you can find kids in the villages or out in the fields."
           </p>
           <p>
            "So, other the years, the American- Himalayan Foundation grew basically because six of us scruffy guys came off of Mount Everest in 1981, the Tibetan side. We're the first ones ever allowed to go there and said, "Let's do something."
So, the American Himalayan Foundation today has probably touches maybe close to 400,000 lives. It's, of course, started with the shepherds and Tibetan refugees and the Dalai Lama, but our biggest program was something we weren't even aware of in early years and that is trafficking and we have 15,000 young girls in school being saved from being sold and however bad you think the trafficking problem is, it's worst than that and a lot of these young women develop AIDS -- 80 percent of them do. They never live to be 20 years."
           </p>
           <p>
            "I probably -- so when I see somebody like Trump making those comments towards young women, you wonder what kind of impression does he make on young men then may want to run after somehow some prostitution. Anyhow, I feel this very deeply and as you can tell."
           </p>
           <p>
            "So, some years ago, King Birendra, who unfortunately, when they had assassination, most of the royal family was killed, said, "Richard, whenever possible, avoid doing business with my government,""

            "I've spent a lot of time being on with Jimmy Carter, been on his board for the last 15 years, what I would say about Jimmy Carter and I have been in all the worst possible places in Africa with him." (Blum is on the board of the Carter Center, which pushes vaccines)
           </p>
           <p>
            "First of all, I've been involved with the Clinton Foundation and despite all that you hear, they do an awful lot of good work. Raj knows this. He worked with them, particularly on AIDS projects and then, nobody spends more money there than Bill Gates. So, we just need to do more and more of that."
           </p>
           <p>
            "And when we have a new administration, I don't think that, you know, hopefully Hillary can ignore what has been said by both Sanders and to a certain extent, by Trump about what we have to do to make sure that there is more equal opportunity for everybody here."
           </p>
           <p>
            "it may have been that first couple of weeks. Been refugee camping out, trekking with local people that says, "My goodness, these are lovely people. We should help them. Maybe there's something to do here." And if you think about it, one thing sort of led to another and then I was probably the first decade because we were up in the mountains. Most of the hill people -- the lower caste Hindus are the ones where the girls get sold."
           </p>
           <p>
            "You talked about ownership very -- very early on and I would say that was probably 30 years before USAID started to really take ownership very seriously. You know, you talk about the importance of culture in a lot of your work is devoted to culture and improving the place where people live to give them some pride in that place and then, of course, moving into trafficking."
           </p>
           <p>
            "And then if you find something, for instance, in our investment business, the -- I mean, if we get in and out of something within three years, that's a trade. We tend to find businesses and grow with them, just as we have done with the American-Himalayan Foundation.
We started with shepherds and wound up with trafficking issues. So -- and particularly, with our investing in Korea and China and so forth."
           </p>

            "You've been working in places where, as you said, there's lot of corruption, rule of law isn't really good, but you've been actually very successful in China."

             ARTHUR C. CLARK:
'Paedophile' Arthur C Clarke sparks protests in Lanka
            </p>
            <p>
             Child right activists in Sri Lanka have expressed shock over science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke's confession in a newspaper interview of a life of paedophilia and called for his deportation just around the time Prince Charles was to knight him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clarke, 80, widely regarded as a visionary and author of the celebrated 2001: A Space Odyssey and some 80 other books, was quoted as saying in the interview published in London's Sunday Mirror that having sex with children was all right.
            </p>
            <p>
             ''Once they have reached the age of puberty, it is OK... It doesn't do any harm,'' said Clarke, who has lived in Sri Lanka for 40 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I am trying to think of the youngest boy I have ever had because, of course, you can't tell it here. I think most of the damage comes from the fuss made by hysterical parents afterwards. If the kids don't mind, fair enough,'' he was reported to have said in the interview which was conducted at his house."

             "Excerpt from a letter written by Arthur C. Clarke (from Colombo to Colombo). It is dated 11 Oct. 1991 and concerns “short shorts”:
My favourite is Hemingway’s—he’s supposed to have won a $10 bet (no small sum in the ’20s) from his fellow writers. They paid up without a word. . . .
Here it is. I still can’t think of it without crying—
FOR SALE. BABY SHOES. NEVER WORN."

"Sir Evelyn de Rothschild gifts wife orphanage in Tamil Nadu on birthday"
"A birthday gift worth half a million dollars, but no diamonds or cars.
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, member of the Rothschild banking family and the chairman of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, its London merchant bank, gifted his American wife Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild an orphanage in Tamil Nadu on her 50th birthday.
"I have a great feeling of satisfaction," says a joyous Lynn, who is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and Foreign Policy Association.
Looks like this is one celebration she will always cherish."

             "McCain Institute's Failure To Use Donations For Anti-Trafficking Purposes Raises Questions"
"Questions about John McCain's foundation have arisen amid revelations that, for the last several years the foundation has not been using its donations, instead depositing small amounts of their large endowment into the Arizona State University Foundation. This issue has added importance when considered in the context of John McCain's controversial sources of funding and the arrest of a number of past campaign workers on charges such as child abuse and drug trafficking."

            Hi

             @darkknight111
            </a>
            , thank you very much for your post!
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to edit the headline and add two or three sentences at the top of the post what the 'Asia Foundation' is, so that people will have an idea before they look at the links you provided.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please add some info in the headline how the Asia Foundation could be linked to Pizzagate / why we should look into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this will also get more traction for your post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since headlines unfortunately cannot be edited on Voat, I would like to ask you to self-delete and repost.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will flair the post with 'Edit Warning', please delete within 24 hours, you can re-submit any time when you'll have edited the post.
           </p>
