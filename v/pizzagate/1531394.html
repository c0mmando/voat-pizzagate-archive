            is compromised. I've started a new sub (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pedogate">
             v/pedogate
            </a>
            ). Use that, if you like. I'm not promoting anyone to be MOD there. Unless I too get compromised, no posts will be deleted.

            Agree 100%. There should be a main board / deleted board. If you want to hang out in the netherworld of deleted threads, so be it. They should still be accessible / viable

            Completely agree. I think it's a lesson in learned helplessness. I've determined to simply filter through the bullshit posts, and use guerilla style word tactics when confronted by the ones in question. They have tactics. They come to each others' aid. There are sock puppets that help back 'em up in their bogus claims, too. All I can back it up with are my own conversations with 'em which they only used lots of different logical fallacies. Just remember screen names. There are patterns. Like clockwork, every time I see something relevant and obscure, sure as shit, see a familiar name try and shoot it down, then a janitor, then that same puppet. Take this one for instance, the general pattern I've seen (whether the claim was true or not) is if the post is against the mods or one specifically it will be downvoted into the void. Seems like some are CTR or simply their training has put them in a predisposed position to harm in an attempt to help (in other words, they think they are making the right decision when in fact it goes to divide or disrupt or negate or...

             bot's to salt a verse with anti-semitic shit-posts, then they bring in a team of shill-bots to save the masses from Amalek, then the shill MODS step in and delete everything they deem 'Tainted' by Amalek, and that's how they mass delete all sub's on voat.

             Like now  with pizzagate, we can't mention Saudi, because according to

              The MODS are working for VOAT all the way up to ATKO, I see time stamp's on these mod's vary from &lt;30 days to 1.5 years at the same time, these mods are also mods on

            It only works when everyone can upvoat/downvoat. So since a lot of people are new they can't downvote until they get 100CCP, so offtopic and fake shit would just stay.
