<p>So let me explain my view on this whole thing... I believe PizzaGate is probably real (not enough evidence to say definitely)... If it is in fact real, that would mean that not only Hillary and Podesta but dozens if not 100s of other government officials are totally and utterly FUCKED if Trump becomes president..</p>
<p>This is something that I\'ve been wrestling with.. because if that is the case, you would expect that these dozens of people would absolutely find whatever means possible to stop Trump. As a result, I totally thought today would go differently. I genuinely believed that through some blackmailing shady shit that enough electors were going to switch their vote to stop Trump and put in some random compromised Republican that wouldn\'t rat out PizzaGate..</p>
<p>Now that that officially hasn\'t happened, I\'m totally confused. Are we to actually believe that all of PizzaGate is real and Hillary, Podesta, and everyone else are just going to wait patiently for their ultimate demise? That is just stupid... If this is really true they have a couple options:
1. run away (which they haven\'t done)
2. Stop Trump (Monica Petersen style)</p>
<p>Does what I\'m saying make sense or am I going crazy? I mean really stop and think about what Trumps presidency means to this entire fucked up organized criminal endeavor? How can these people just sit back idly? Either they are going to do something VERY Drastic, or this whole thing just doesnt make sense to me anymore. Any thoughts?</p>',

            You're right, it's no good to canonize someone, especially an anonymous someone from a chan. It is undeniable that the side-by-side wide breadth of issues he responded to, however, and their corresponding prescience has been convincing enough to keep his name around. It's also no good to dismiss entirely.

            But "assassinating major figures is very difficult and dangerous" most likely -- if we are to take FBIAnon seriously as an insider and understand the context of the quote among all seven AMAs -- he is most likely not referring to available assassination technology, but the ramifications of taking down so public and divisive a figure after so contentious an election. I think the difficulty and danger he was referring to here is social, civil, and/or political, and my other quote was to highlight that a bit. There are more supporting quotes regarding the elite and their control over a roiling populace, though they are not as directly related.

             one elector in Kansas said she received 500 emails an hour
            </strong>

            Their system is setup to absorb failures, much like a military organization. They'll throw some of their people under the bus, fake some deaths and keep on working toward their goal. Nothing will stop them until names like DuPont, Rothschild, Rockefeller... Etc have been completely cleansed. They'll probably try to offload the blame on Jews or Muslims or something like they have done for centuries.

            Trump was friends with Epstein also, and also went to the Island. This is a problem on both sides of the political spectrum, and I think Trump is going to be exactly like every other President, he will sell the people out in the interests of big business. He is as corrupt as Hillary is.

            Trump is a big time Zionist. He swore allegience to Israel. His daughter is married to a Jew. He has ties to AIPAC and CFR.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless he's actually a lot clever than he lets on and he does a complete 180 on the jewish-owned American media and gov't. I just cant see this happening. As soon as he turns his back on the vile pedo scum that rule this country his head will be decapitated at a parade. JFK style.

            Nothing changes for us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if Trump does pursue tearing these bastards to shreds, his investigations will be secret, and possibly we will never even know if he drags the ring leaders into secret prisons like they're terrorists. In fact, secretly may be the only way he can effectively destroy them. If he comes out and gives open credibility to the conspiracy theory (despite that it's apparently completely true), he will be made into a lunatic by the MSM, and he will lose the power to take them down. He has made subtle hints here and there, though, that he knows (like the dinner speech where he said Hillary had stolen a few villages in Haiti, and the room went fucking -silent-), and that gives me hope he will fight them. I think it's possible Trump has known for a long, long time, and that Epstein tried to drag him into the blackmail club via the 14-year-old-but-looks-18-prostitute ploy, but either failed, or Trump has counter blackmail on them strong enough to keep them silent. Although, they did cart out that accusation, Trump just called it lies and ignored it- I imagine that if they really had anything real on him, they would have used it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, Trump might not even need to wage war on them to destroy their monopolization of power. Congressional term limits might so thoroughly limit them logistically that they die out in a generation. They would have fewer and fewer allies at the top to protect them, and less and less time and opportunity to blackmail new recruits. More and more (especially right wing) politicians will have heard of pizzagate, and be wary of getting caught in their net.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, the public exposure of the pedos in power will still be up to us, even if Trump is assassinating them in the shadows. Any investigation he does would likely see the investigators both sharing info with us discreetly, to farm out work and out of pure patriotism, and lurk our boards for info they may have missed. If there is no investigation whatsoever, the entire job rests on our shoulders. Either way, we must investigate as well as we can, and spread the truth to as many as we can. We can hope that Trump will help, and I personally think he is likely to, but we cannot afford to rely on him.

            Rudy Giuliani stated that pizzagate was real in a tweet today...I think the new admin will start throwing serious support and retribution toward offenders very soon now to counter the alternative. My Lord, I hope they catch every one of them and skin them alive.

            Of all the idiotic brain-dead bullshit to come out of this dumpster-fire of an election cycle, Pizzagate is the dumbest.  Anyone who believes this is either too stupid to live or too bat-shit crazy to be left running loose.

              I don't debate or discuss wackjob conspiracy theory with people stupid enough to fall for it.  It's a losing battle.  I could line up facts, point out it's been completely and utterly debunked 8 ways from Sunday, and link to all the proof that it's complete and utter bullshit.  Then, in response, since you're stupid or wacko or both, you would respond with crazy conspiracy responses.

              Essentially, it's like playing chess with a pigeon - no matter how well you play the game, the pigeon is going to knock over all the pieces, shit on the chess board, and then strut around like it won.

               I didn't want to believe Pizzagate either, but my personal feelings have nothing to do with the truth. Uncomfortable truths are often the most important ones. If we apply Occam's razor, there is definitely something shady going on. I looked at the evidence and was convinced. You didn't look at the evidence and thus will never be convinced.
It hasn't been debunked, but that doesn't matter to you, since you never cared about the truth in the first place. Perhaps you don't even believe in objective truths?
Explain why Antinous, the love-boy-servant, is Jimmy's Instagram profile picture.
Explain the 65,000$ worth of Hot Dogs went to the White House.
Explain the prices of the Beanie Babies (20$ each, somewhat sassy, must buy all 200)
Explain the 'warm' 'traffic' after Hastert's disappearance.
Explain Clement Freud, Denny Hastert, Anthony Weiner, Maria Abramovic.
Explain why nobody except us has complained about the so-called family friendly Comet Ping Pong's owner posting lewd pictures on his Instagram.
There are coincidences, but you're just a deluded coincidence theorist.
(Of course! Four creepy businesses with pedo logos just happened to randomly be next to each other.)
At this point, I can say that Pizzagate has lost all partisanship to it. Perhaps you're defending your 'heroes', but for the vast majority of us, this is simply Good vs. Evil. Why do you feel compelled to defend the 49th most powerful man in Washington D.C.? If Pizzagate were false, it would simply self-destruct on the Right, and Leftists everywhere would point at it and laugh.
But Pizzagate is not false. All the news articles simply claim it as debunked, but none of them have addressed the claims. The closest was the New York Times, but even that was very short of addressing a substantial amount of the major claims that constitute Pizzagate. What do you fear if you are wrong? This should be your greatest concern.

            It's been corrupt since the JFK assassination and the CIA has their hands in every scandal to date. It would not be unfeasible to think that the CIA needs a major draining of the swamp because it is full of evil shit and hides shit from Congress and the American people all that shit is coming to an end.

            I think that Hillary and her people did all they could do that was above the line, i.e. fake news narrative, Russian hacking, etc. I think they put this out there with the help of the news folks to try and drum up popular support, which they didn't get. Either people saw it for what it was, or at the least people thought they were being sore losers, and didn't take the bait.

            I don't know much about Trump, but I think the presence or lack of a major event/false flag in the next few months may tell us what the Hillary/Podesta crowd knows about him.

            I don't believe they will assassinate Trump now.  If he does get elected, it could still be difficult for him to bring these sick fucks to justice.  MSM has already buried this as "Fake" news so unless new evidence comes out (a real smoking gun) then he may just have to settle for draining the swamp (I would be outraged).  I do see a glimmer of hope in the fact that Trump has better blackmail on them then we know of and the fact that the FBI will be less muzzled under a Trump presidency.  We can believe (using FBI Anon here) that much of the FBI is pro-trump and chomping at the bit to prosecute.  He may just as well release the dogs on them when he gets in office.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think what the elites care more about then the Trump presidency is WWIII which they are trying to antagonize as we speak.  All this rhetoric of "blame Russia" serves a two-fold purpose: of discrediting Trump but also souring our relationship with Russia.  They want to deteriorate this relationship as much as possible before he enters the office.  I find the Turkey attack of the Russian ambassador even more evidence of this truth --&gt; Russia declares war on Turkey and then we are obligated to defend fucking Turkey (what a shithole) as they're a NATO ally.  The Trump card (no pun intended) is that Trump is much too savvy for this and much more well-informed then anyone gives him credit for.  I believe he has some high-level sources feeding him intelligence, and a very good understanding of the elites/cabal.  My guess is he will work to promote a friendly relationship with Putin.  Fingers crossed.

            I don't get how someone can believe the elite's involvement with pizzagate and at the same time believe trump is going to shut it down. If the elite are involved then trump is involved. I really don't get why people think he is some savior and start screaming "shill" just because someone isn't sucking trumps dick.

             I really like Trump, but I'm not a fool to blindly believe there's no way he's a part of it. He was friends with Epstein for a while, though he did kick him out of the club for hitting on that young teenager. It's my hope that he is not a part of it though, mostly because he didn't earn his money gains from playing a part in their secret cabal of blackmail. He's a good business man, and that's how he succeeded with his wealth. But at the end of the day, he provides some hope while Clinton provided absolutely none since we KNOW she's a part of it. Also the fact that Trump doesn't do drugs or drink and didn't let his kids either. He seems to have some morals where I can't see pizza activity being okay with him. He also gave a huge middle finger at the Al Smith dinner to those elite.  But again, only time can tell.

             I completely agree with you. People are throwing out scenarios, but they miss the most obvious: TRUMP WILL DO NOTHING! No pedos are scared because nobody in power isn't a pedo. (I exaggerate, but you see my point)

             Steve Bannon is Trumps closest advisor.. Steve Bannon was a co-founder of Breitbart news and close friend of Andrew... If PizzaGate is real that means Breitbart knew about it before his death, and Bannon would make sure that justice is served.

              This reason by itself is extremely compelling for me. Also, when Jeffrey Epstein was a member of Trump's exclusive Mar-a-Largo Resort, didn't Trump personally ban him for life? I had read somewhere that it was because Trump found out that's Epstein had been trafficking underage girls through the resort itself and that's why Trump personally banned him for life. Does anyone have a link to what I'm talking about?

               “Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. ... They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,” Prince claimed. They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information...“The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation and you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments,’” Prince explained.

                As well, Erik Prince(name I believe?) who I think is the head of Trump's private army was the person who shed light on wieners laptop helped start pizzagate awareness. Rudy Giuliani tweeted about it... Trump himself said his AG would take care of those politicians who took "something else"

             I think that the elite pissed Trump off, by not taking him seriously. There was, several years ago a correspondent's dinner ribbing of Trump by Obama that you could see really made him mad. I read an autobiography of FDR said that he was bullied at boarding school by his "peers" and look what he did to get back at them as president. There is no accounting for people looking to settle grudges.

            Alternate reality: We, vie CIA led Turkish rogue cop assasinated a Russian ambassador to turkey today in an attempt to start WWIII, hoping to provoke Russia's Retaliation and keep A, focus off the investigation or even B, be under a new war and delay transition of power.
Cooler heads prevailed and who knows WHAT trump or Putin or whoever had to say today to prevent a total meltdown....
Today was a big deal. In my imagination anyway.

             I for one would not mind a bit if Russia decided to return the favor. If our CIA is in fact trafficking children, weapons and drugs, Putin can take down as many of them as he wants. I don't think Russia wants a war. 
I did see the video, with the "lack of blood." Could it have been a staged event?

            Imho the dems will play the alien disclosure card hoping that it throws everyone into enough chaos to distract them from pizzagate. Btw, I believe pizzagate includes child rape, child trafficking, satanic ritual abuse and murder, cannibalism, as well as drugs and arms trafficking. I think this is so bad that you have to start in Hell and work your way backward to figure it out. Don't laugh too hard...I'm serious.

             I was actually thinking the same thing. I was reading through those emails in regard to the alien disclosure (particularly in conversation with the Blink 182 guy). They were discussing preparing the people and all that stuff. I really think this would be their last attempt at distracting us from the mass occultism being widely acknowledged.

              Podesta emails...big into et and disclosure of aliens...there's an email from one of the former astronauts that discusses disclosure and space war. Biblically believed to be demons but noted by almost all victims of sra. Some thinking disclosure will come out of China of Russia b4 the us reveals it. I know...sounds totally whack job crazy, but with recent Antarctica trip by Kerry and other world leaders, I'm really starting to wonder.

             I've meet a guy (many years ago) who was absolutely certain that he had been abducted by aliens and sexually abused. I think this is a mind control trick to fuck with the victims. Same as making creepy movies, so that victims cannot trust their memories, or when they start to remember, they confuse the memory with the movie.

              I seriously believe demons or reptilians exist.... Christians and Muslims believe in it... maybe there's some truth to it.

               Christians believe they were the giants of the Old Testament (think David and Goliath) and demon angels cast out with Satan. Their return to earth is predicted and spoken of extensively in revelation

            I disagree.... Steve Bannon is Trumps closest advisor.. Steve Bannon was a founder of Breitbart news and close friend of Andrew... If PizzaGate is real that means Breitbart knew about it before his death, and Bannon would make sure that justice is served.

             My personal theory: Comey and his brother were, as boys, kidnapped but escaped. I think the brothers found out then, or later, who the kidnappers were and what for, and that Comey's whole career has been to avenge this.

               Comey and the brother know all the dirt on Clintons so that could be held against him but he doesn't come across as a snake. The very fact that there have been leaks, the re-opened investigation in October, the international pedo ring busts, the rolling heads around the world, (Korea, Italy, NZ, IMF, etc), the MSM panic, the cancelled war with Russia, Obama looking exceptionally haggard, lack of indictment of weiner, probably other things I can't remember but added up, plus my hope for the future of this country, I think this.

            Yes it's confusing, I thought they'd stop him in the electoral college too. So I too am scratching my head. And no big false flag yet. I do not see how they go gently into that goodnight, I just don't know. Maybe it's not hundreds. Maybe the puppet masters can afford to throw the puppets under the bus, and they themselves feel they will be safe. You would indeed think you would see people scrambling at this point. I 'feel' inside that something big (good or bad) is about to happen (relatively soon). I think it will be good. Look at Trump's tweet today. "Civilization needs to change."

               its a bit coincidental that 2 terror attacks happened on the same day (12/19), but I don't think it leads anywhere tho

              is very intriguing.  Hmm... If that were the case, he could then get away with some massive executive orders on day 0, that pull a lot of rugs out without recourse.

              I would hope he doesn't lay low, that only gives the media more time to erode people's impressions of him.

               I have a feeling he'll start with the media. Peter Thiel has a nice record against the media in court and CNN is already being sued by black employees for racial discrimination. Sweet, sweet irony...

              I've really been trying to have faith and stay hoping that he just pulled the greatest con ever on the establishment but the cynic in me has been saying the same thing you just said. I even said it to myself right before I cast my ballot in November.

                So far so good I'm not disappointed yet, but I can't say I'm 100% relieved until at least after I see how the first 100 days to 6 months go, and if all goes well then we just have to pray that he doesn't get assassinated.

                Erik Prince or whatever his name is, is the one who did the interview with infowars I believe, shedding more light on pizzagate and Wieners laptop. Erik helps guard trump, head of personal army etc.(personal army just in case military goes w/ HRC and tries to do a coup against American people)

             They better make it count. I think they're out of bullets and that Trump has gathered/garnered too many power players w/ too many powerful connections to his side of the chessboard.

            Comments: (1) if Pizzagate were not real, then the top people in the Democratic Party (Clinton, Podesta, etc.) wrote these emails over the last 5 or 6 years with the deliberate intention of leading us all down the garden path, knowing all the while that they would eventually be released by Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign and would lead to them almost certainly losing the election. Such a scenario seems even more improbable than the wildest versions of Pizzagate. (2) A complete change in the administration means that heads will roll. However, it's likely the ones at the top like Podesta will get off with a slap on the wrist.

             You don't think these people are capable of planning 6 years in advance? Soros was backing Trump too, and within one generation the whole Trump clan will be Jewish.   These plans are literally centuries old. Never underestimate the zionists.

              How has Soros been backing Trump? And, if he has been, why would he bother funding the anti-Trump riots and all the opposition to Trump in the media? If he was - as you suggest - backing both horses, then it wouldn't matter to him who won the election as he would win either way. This theory just doesn't make any sense and sound like paranoia to me.

              I think PG is a huge enterprise with 100s of people involved over many years. But, I dont believe its a hundred years old and I don't think this entire charade was one big planned event.. there's no way, they are clearly fumbling a little bit

             (1) - I see what you're saying, but I don't totally agree. i dont think those are the only two options. I think there are 4 options.. A pizzagate is real, B what you said, C pizzagate is actually something else (drugs, weapons, some other type of crime), or D the emails literally mean nothing - they're just weird coincidences, which I know is hard to believe after you've gone down the rabbit hole a few times.. but in reality it is a possibility.. old people say weird shit.. my dad sends me cryptic emails because he thinks he's funny/clever, and he's not talking about anything criminal... I personally think options A and C are the most likely, D is the next most likely, and B is the least likely.
            </p>
            <p>
             (2) I hope to god you're wrong about that...

              I don't agree that B, C or D are realistic. C is the only one that's possible, but I've tried substituting the code words with other ideas, but, if they can be made to work for one message, they don't work across the board. A is the only option that makes any sense.

               Yeah there's only one 'theme' that can explain everything, without having to cherry pick or leave bits out, or allow for hundreds of crazy coincidences, and that's child trafficking, rape and torture. :-(

            Its very possible that Trump may not prosecute. Or I worry that the demise of Clinton Foundation leaves a business opportunity and a different enterprise takes over ( this could even include Trump himself), A lot of possibilities. At this point I think we can safely say that the Hill has been toppled and be grateful for that.

            inb4 you're just a fucking shill!!! - no, I'm a rational thinking human being trying to make sense of the other side of this whole story. I am only interested in the protection of innocent children, and we need to understand this thing from all angels in order to do that.
