<h2 id="md-authorities-identify-3-family-members-found-dead-monday-in-new-jersey-swimming-pool">Authorities identify 3 family members found dead Monday in New Jersey swimming pool</h2>
<p>EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. — The Monday deaths of three members of the same family have been ruled accidental drownings, New Jersey’s Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office confirmed late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The victims have been identified as Bharat Patel, 62, his 33-year old daughter-in-law Nisha Patel and her 8-year-old daughter, who was unnamed, NJ.com reported.</p>
<p>UPDATE: We‘re back in East Brunswick where a 32 yo mother, her 8 yo daughter, and another relative (a 62 yo man), died in the backyard pool Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>According to neighbors, the family had just moved in and gotten the pool serviced. They were excited to use it </p>
<p>According to neighbors, all three family members moved into the Clearview Road home recently, and a pool company had been on site in recent weeks to prepare the property’s above-ground pool for use, the media company reported.</p>
<p>A neighbor who heard screaming from the residence just after 4 p.m. Monday called police.</p>
<p>Although the prosecutor’s office ruled the deaths accidental drownings, WPVI reported authorities have contacted an electrical contractor to investigate the scene because they believe an electrical issue in or near the pool could have contributed to the deaths.</p>
<p>East Brunswick Police Lt. Frank Sutter said at a Monday afternoon press conference that all three victims died at the scene.</p>
<p>“We believe the mother was calling for help from inside the pool,” Sutter said.</p>
<p>East Brunswick Mayor Brad Cohen said in a statement provided to NJ.com: “The entire East Brunswick community is shocked and saddened to learn of the three deaths yesterday in Frost section of the township. Our condolences go out to the family and may they find strength from the community that shares in their grief.”</p>

            That was easy. Wow. That’s a lot of experience for a 33yo. She’d have been approx 21 when Obama was inaugurated!? And she has
            <em>
             two decades
            </em>
            of experience. So the 33yo began her career at 13?
           </p>

            Holy shit, did you vet this at all? Vindy, what is going on with you lately?

                      because i voted for him, i have a God Given Right to question him, and all other elected officials. You need to fix your own Penal Country, then maybe you can worry about mine. You have no say, and your opinion doesn't matter.

                        The other reason is that my enemies ping you. And I'm not afraid of anyone knowing what I'm saying. I would ping more people, but I do not want to brigade with downvotes. You and george are the only two who care about PG, and don't seem to downvote brigade anyone, unless you actually disagree with them. I know it pisses off vin, but I didn't mean to anger you. I sent DM awhile back, asking if you'd like me to stop. It might have gotten lost, i know you're busy.

                        As for DJT, I think the only way you get politicians to carry out their campaign promises, is to hold a pitchfork to their throats, and calmly remind them, that which has been given, can also be taken away. In a heartbeat. Just by not voting.

             A better question: what's going on with you?
            </p>
            <p>
             Three minutes after posting you try to debunk, eh?  While you were hovering over everything I post, waiting to pounce and criticize, you failed to notice I was in the middle of writing the thing. If you watched his short videos, the whole point was him vetting whether the mom was actually connected to Gates. In the second one, he states she wasn't. I wrote the headline based on what I recalled, then sketched a draft submission with the urls to each of the tweets, so the TweetSave bot would archive them. I hit submit, so I wouldn't lose my work, then went back to vet and archive the possible pizzagate Arkancide connection before that was scrubbed. THEN I went back to the beginning to add some summaries of the beginning tweets of the thread and realized I'd mischaracterised his work on the Gates connection. By that time it was too late to edit my submission headline, which was wrong. So I deleted the whole thing -- only to find that you felt the need to deploy a little ProtectVoat smear action.

               Mmm. So the part where the dead grandfather runs a charity that is a Clinton Foundation partner is something you want to bury in pgwhatever, huh? It's a good thing you're not in charge of this sub, isn't it!

               Untrue, as you also well know. Once someone is removed from the mod team, that information disappears. And when I removed you, I didn't think to check who modded you, or screencap it, because I wasn't yet convinced you had ill intent toward this sub.

               I deleted it as soon as I realized I'd gotten one of the facts wrong. I was in a hurry to get it up on the board for digging  and the key elements archived before I had to go to work.

                I don’t believe the middle part of your comment, which I replied to, mentioned anything you are mentioning. Funny about you bringing up your ‘authority’ in the sub. I didn’t bring it up.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your next line of bullshit, I only skimmed, but it seems peculiar that (for years) you never even noted who modded me in the first place. Aren’t you a researcher?
               </p>

                It looks like what follows is another smear to cover up your own failings. Then it seems with you ending with a plea about being genuine.

                Getting ‘all hands on deck’ to promote bullshit is not what this subverse is supposed to be about. There are a great many Voat subverses out there. The creator’s intent for

                was to make it a haven for facts.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason for that is very clear: bullshit speculative material only helps the naysayers and further only helps the elite pedos.

                You’ve lost your way. The old Vindy might’ve simply made a comment about their admitted mistake instead of wasting time on drama and finger pointing.

                Circling back a bit: You are accusing me of invention when that’s precisely your behavior. We’re not perfect people. It’s just a message board. Truth is more important than speculation here. You don’t have to pretend otherwise to save face. It only hurts everyone.

                   This merely demonstrates your ignorance. Original research posted on Twitter always involves "a large amount of twitter links by the same person." It's called a "thread". Twitter only allows 150 characters per tweet, including urls, so it always takes multiple tweets to articulate anything in-depth and juicy.

                 He used to  know this. I didn't see what he put up originally, so I don't know how much of a mess it was. But I do think it's odd that he didn't put this in his own sub, to work on until he was sure he had it right. Maybe it's 'journalistic competitiveness', 'publish or perish', idk. Just seems odd.

                  I did notice that. I’m sure others who care to will notice as well. And then there is another smear attempt in here by Vindy, because I called out another thread I happened to catch as utter unsubstantiated bullshit. And yet he thinks their bad behavior can be twisted onto me?

                 This merely demonstrates your ignorance.  Original research posted on Twitter always involves "a large amount of twitter links by the same person." It's called a "thread". Twitter only allows 150 characters per tweet, including urls, so it always takes multiple tweets to articulate anything in-depth and juicy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You shit-talked research without properly vetting it, based on your own ignorant and erroneous perception of Twitter. And then you had the gall to try to chasten me about sloppy modding.
