   Trump mentions John Podesta three times in Martha Maccallum interview tonight on Fox. I seem to sense a distinct 'special' disgust when he mentions his name.

            wow. A lot of effort is made to discredit the attribution to Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds exactly like him. Maybe it's a voice synthesizer set - up to frame him?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the work I did a few months ago on it. I went through it bit by bit. You can do the same and judge for yourself. 
I fail to hear any words like "john" - But I definitely hear Podesta's distinctive voice.
           </p>
           <p>

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1665269
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But then, if Podesta is innocent, why would would so many "doctors of science" be out there trying to convince us of that doubtful "truth? "
           </p>
           <p>
            We are way less than  "the Law" 
Why would it matter so much what we think?
           </p>
           <p>
            The powers that be have made it clear they are holding back from any investigation or arrest..
           </p>
           <p>
            So what does it matter what we think, say or decide anyway?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are they fighting so hard?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's rather to convince lurkers or bystanders or readers here, rather than to convince those who've listened to it themselves and who have studied all the other evidences around this;. And who know , for themselves, that it sounds exactly like Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Funny how persuasion and mind - control works. The perps definitley know how to use that "magic" to the max - make you disbelieve your own eyes and ears.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I was a Prosecutor , yes..it would matter what I thought.  But I'm just a little guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Podesta is lucky I am just a private person. Because if I was an empowered Prosecutor I would get reliable voice prints and then it would be certain evidence.

            I would be stupid to try to convince you.
           </p>
           <p>
            From "Mark Twain" i.e. Samuel Clemens, in regard to the Shakespear authorship question.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ""Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare’s Works? Ah, now, what do you take me for? Would I be so soft as that, after having known the human race familiarly for nearly seventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any one could think so injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me. No-no, I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind, it will never be possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine sincerely, dispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition. I doubt if I could do it myself. We always get at second hand our notions about systems of government; and high-tariff and low-tariff; and prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and the glories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and approval of the duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefs concerning the nature of cats; and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic; and our preferences in the matter of religious and political parties; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the Arthur Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second-hand, we reason none of them out for ourselves. It is the way we are made. It is the way we are all made, and we can’t help it, we can’t change it. And whenever we have been furnished a fetish, and have been taught to believe in it, and love it and worship it, and refrain from examining it, there is no evidence, howsoever clear and strong, that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion. In morals, conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment and associations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash. Whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels, and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels, we keep our sacrilegious hands off it. We submit, not reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately afraid we should find, upon examination, that the jewels are of the sort that are manufactured at North Adams, Mass."
            </p>

            It's so obvious. A few downvoats should suffice to get the message clear to the rest of us that he's a shill. Anything more than that is a waste.

            I'd recommend research Trump further. Trump is another illuminati-puppet false prophet, Trump and Hillary are technically even to be called family.

            First, because our Founders created an Elite patriarchy -- read the Constitution -- and endowed them
with land grants and immense influence and control over the nation's wealth, natural resources and our
people's government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, because -- as JFK made clear in one of his speeches -- secrecy enables crimes like Allen Dulles
and GW Bush brought to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't fight against what we don't know -- and CIA made many of the things we don't know about laughable with
Operation Mockingbird while also destroying our free press here in US.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be sure you're familiar with Mockingbird, Paperclip, Gladio and MKULTRA/Monarch.

            From what I've heard about "W" I'm sure drugs also played a part in his self-destruction.

            It's clear from what a lot of Trump says that he's frustrated with how things are going, but I think knowing people like Podesta get to roam free is what disgusts him the most. I think his foreign policy right now is a way to appease the Deep State temporarily, so they won't notice the gears moving in preparation of a massive pedophile roundup.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta can't fall until there's some kind of investigative body to knock him down, and the head cop in this country is Comey, a shill for the Deep State. Eliminate him (preferably with a scandal, bonus points for WikiLeaks showing he was coerced by the Clinton campaign) and you can actually start an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the way this'll really play out is that Soros will be tied to this, and he'll sacrifice Podesta, Comey, Alefantis, and yes, the Clintons, all to save himself and Obama, his new figurehead. They'll reforge the Democratic party in a socialist image, (gutting a party and building it up again will require a few familiar faces, I expect they'll basically just stand Obama up there, maybe even make him Chairman) and I think this'll all happen before 2020.

             I hope you are correct. But I'm starting to get suspicious that the Trump cheerleaders are just as infected with false hope as the Obama - cult followers.

            I agree with most here.. Let's remember Trump has never mentioned the word "pizzagate" or referenced any of the allegations on podesta.. Some could argue he's been careful.. No way.. He's not careful.. He makes claims and tweets he can't always back up.. And he's never mentioned PG or any of the evidence from wikileaks and he doesn't even like or approve of wikileaks!
Let's get realistic here.. He's not working for us.. He's just not!

              Obviously I have no proof,  but I don't think Trump has anything to do with this.  He's been under public scrutiny for 4 decades.  If he had any link to pedo shit it would be front page news by now.  Sure,  he was friends with Epstien until shit got weird..  then I heard he through him out of his resort and hasn't associated with him since.  But I'd be interested in clarification among those that are more on top of this shit than I am.  I just want to eradicate pedos.....   my mission.

               I was disheartened by this article from "Veteran's Today" And I hope it's fake news / Propaganda, but it might be true.

            Trump might hate Podesta, but not for his pedophilia and Satanism.  Plenty of Trump's buddies would be part of the pedophile, child murder and Satanism set.

            He toyed around with the Clintons too, made them squirm by parading Bill's rape victims at the final debate, and calling Hillary a criminal. But it was all for show. He announced after becoming POTUS that they were good people and essentially should be left alone.  By bombing Syria without Congressional approval, he can now be made to do whatever the deep state wants because he has committed a crime and can be impeached at any time.

             The bombing in Syria may have been at an empty air strip. They make - up whatever they want so hey, they are able to go ahead with what they do without having a plausible reason.

             Even the 9/11, though ostensibly a pretense for War, was actually an occulut ritual. They may have been easily able to make up any pretense they wanted, to do what they want.. For Vietnam , it was Gulf of Tonkin. For WWOne it was the bullshit bombing of a Prince in Serbia.

             It doesn't have to make sense and it never does. [ We're the sheeps, remember. The more cognitive dissonance they can set - up the deeper people go into their trance  They studied and know what they are doing. ]

             So wrong.  Congress is required to 'declare war' on a country.  Obama has been droning people to death for years.  Gassing your own people is prohibited by Geneva conventions...  thus Trump was well within his rights to bitch-slap that Assad.

            yep. totally biased reporting. i think trump is a nice guy struggling under the weight of information he's had to ingest and the restrictions he is trying to operate within. it would be very frustrating and he cant get an unbiased interviewer not treating him like shit.

            firstly the reese witherspoon lookalike interviewing him is biased and tried to shut him down a couple of times when he brought up the 28 bills that have been passed and when he brought up podesta. i see a man trying to tell the truth who has had to learn a lot in the last 100 days most of it probably about what he can and cant do due to the complex web of lies and deceit the previous potus's have allowed to happen or been forced to make happen by the cia and fbi. blackmail and subterfuge are the order of the day.

            I didn't see anything but trump talking out of the side of his head keeping to script.  It's just a game of mirrors so we don't see the elephants (plural) in the room.  I wish it were different and I have tried to see some shred of decency in trump, my bias tried bigly, but just would not float.

            I think it's great that he keeps bringing up what the mainstream media suppresses. Because of his position, it FORCES people to at least look it up. And that will result in the same thing that happened in 2016........ your everyday American that never would have researched anything beyond what the news feeds them by going online and looking. That is how so many more people have woken up over the past couple of years.

            At the very least, he's shining the light on things that get covered up. You can't be mad at that, whether or not you're happy with him.

            Something is holding back the NYPD and that's been true (as reported by Rothstein) over 50 years and three halted investigations.  And evidently that also included some part of what Watergate was about.

            We also had the Franklin case which took us into the GHW Bush White House.

           <p>
            We also see that higher ups in government are controlling pedophile ring investigations in many other countries -
UK, Belgium, Australia, Norway, Ireland.

            As John Stockwell/former CIA has made clear ... anyone who is part of the "establishment" isn't going to permit any harm to come to the system which supports and protects them.  That included Pres. Carter as Stockwell pointed out -- and as much of his actions make clear.  And, I'm quite sure it will include Trump.  Even if Trump isn't involved in anything Epstein or pedophile related, there are still questions about his behavior towards women and women who have brought accusations against him.
Remember that included his own first wife's testimony in the divorce proceedings.
We also see it in Trump's outrageously overt exploitation of people, male and female.
And we see it most especially in his willingness to use his political power to de-power women in every way in our society.
We see this in his attacks on abortion, for one, and population control.  On Planned Parenthood which the nation supports and where the nation supports government funding of PPH.  We see it in many ways in his attitudes about women.

             ive been thinking this. abortion is about a womans right to terminate a pregnancy in a safe medical environment. all of this anti abortion propaganda really worries me it could set womens rights back decades. and it is ironic because on the one hand we have paedophile rings exploiting unwanted children and on the other hand we have a strong message against abortion. i dont agree with hillary on late abortions they should only be allowed up to 12 weeks and i think the morning after pill should be promoted more as should contraception for women. trump is most definately not perfect and i think he has found out he's more or less a figurehead because the cia and fbi have strangle hold on world affairs and the government he inherited. he definately did hang out with epstein and he definately did go to lolita island but if he is a luciferian who sacrifices children to moloch remains to be seen. i personally dont think he is. he's just a womaniser.

              While Trump may not be a Luciferian he is certainly someone with little respect for anyone, but most especially women and he should not be holding high office.  This is a liberal nation which supports universal health care for all and equality for females, as well as the  right to choice and Trump stands against all of those things.  What Trump is introducing is a White Supremacist government under corporate control.

              Actually, Hillary would betray women on late term abortion if the opportunity came as is clear from many of her statements suggesting she would support the Republicans if they came up with the right "wording."
             </p>
             <p>
              However, you don't seem to understand that females may not even realize that they are pregnant before they are 8 weeks or even further along in the pregnancy.
             </p>
             <p>
              PLUS, you don't seem to realize that there are entirely DIFFERENT reasons for an early abortion than there are for a late term abortions.  MOST of the late term abortions take place not because the woman/family doesn't want a child, but because there is something wrong with the pregnancy which is negatively affecting the woman's health or future ability to bear a child -- or even her life.  That's why late term abortions are only about 1 in every county in the US every year.  Phenomenally rare.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let me give you an example that when abortion was illegal in the US before 1974, women who had problem pregnancies were often forced to carry the child to term only to deliver a dead child.  The actress Debbie Reynolds had that happen to her twice where she was carrying a dead infant in her body for months.  The likelihood is that the second child also died because here system had been so depleted by being forced to carry the earlier child to term.

             Planned P is a ruse/it's about eugenics.  And regardless of which side of the fence you are on pro or anti abortion when are taxpayers supposed to be responsible for the indiscretions of others?  All of Soros money poured into riots and wars would fund PP for a century (or more) or even decent birth control that doesn't put you at risk for a plethora of diseases.  People that are pro abortion should be raising the money to fund it.  Heck, let the Cllnton Foundation fund it but they are too busy trafficking children and organ harvesting not to mention funding wars.

              Cleary you are against Planned Parenthood and the work it does for women ...
             </p>
             <p>
              But, Planned parenthood isn't doing abortions based on Eugenics ....
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Eugenics (/juːˈdʒɛnɪks/; from Greek εὐγενής eugenes "well-born" from εὖ eu, "good, well" and γένος genos, "race, stock, kin")[2][3] is a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of the human population.[4][5] The exact definition of eugenics has been a matter of debate since the term was coined.&lt;
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Each woman individually makes her own decision about whether or not to have an abortion for her own individual reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              And ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would you think it unusual for tax payers to work together for the good of society?
Whether it's to help finance public schools (not Charter schools) --
or it's to fund our libraries -- or our police departments?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why wouldn't they try to help provide birth control and contraception -- information and the actual product -- for women who can't afford it?  And, abortions for women who need them whatever their reasons?
             </p>
             <p>
              And, once again, the American public supports government funding for Planned Parenthood -- 
it is right wing fanatics in this country who stand against women's rights to participate equally in society -- and their  right to make their own CHOICE as to whether or not to have a child.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you understand Global Warming you also understand that population control is KEY to aiding the planet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Beyond that, the next most dangerous practice for the environment is the ruse of animal-eating and domestication of animals.

            We can't be sure what Trump is really all about as yet.
            <br/>
            There are many rumors about his own sexual behavior, with accusers coming forward.
Of course, a situation where one is abusing children, torturing, SRA is the lowest form of cowardliness, imo.
But even on surface behavior, it's obvious that Trump is a corrupt and possibly involved in sexual misconduct.

              Read on another forum how those numbers are um, inflated but not going to track it down.  Might have been in reddit conspiracy.  We absolutely cannot trust what any msm media tells us and the pedo crack down comes from them and then we jump on it like starving creatures.

              And sure, they will throw some dispensables under the bus to make it seem like something is happening.  Any one of them is dispensable if the baggage gets to troublesome but it won't be bc of trump and his protecting the children.  He slaughters brown children now in the ME but I guess brown children don't count.  Or maybe it's not as horrific to just have your limbs blown off or watch your mother, sister, brother get raped or your whole family slaughtered while in the mosque praying rather than be part of a satanic sacrifice.

            IMHO, Trump mentions Podesta (John &amp; Tony), as well as Clinton's ties to Russia to off set the focus on Gen Mike Flynn...

            Here's what Trump said about Podesta (FF to ~ 16:26 min):
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump asks "does anybody ever ask about
            <strong>
             Podesta
            </strong>
            having a company w/ his brother in Russia? Does anybody ask why
            <strong>
             Podesta
            </strong>
            would not let the FBI check on the server (when somebody hacked their server)? And btw, they tried to hack the RNC too, but we had good defense. They couldn't hack us. Does anybody ask why
            <strong>
             Podesta
            </strong>
            had a company in Russia w/ his brother? They don't mention that. Now, they should mention that Martha, but they don't..."

            Correct. I think people hear "globalist" and it automatically has bad connotations to it now, which it should for a variety of reasons since it was high jacked by the elite who are trying to subvert an entire world into slavery for their benefit. However, globalism in its purest form has many positive attributes and those are the things we need to get back to. It should never overshadow nationalism to any nation, but we benefit by making deals where both parties benefit, for instance in areas of trade. We've just been setup in a terrible "deal" when it comes to global positioning in areas such as trade or defense and told we just have to suck it up and pay the bill bc "Muh America bad". As a small business owner, I can say that a lot of the rules we have in place in many nations make it very difficult for a company to do business in other countries and it would be a benefit for all of us if we can take each nation one at a time and strike a FAIR deal. That is the type of globalism Trump is referring to. He's simply saying he doesn't believe in isolationism.

            The Podesta Group is so criminal that it's ridiculous. Evil interests were giving the money to this cannibalism fetishist for political favors. It's spelled out so clearly in the Podesta leaks.

             He can't do anything about a ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theory. Sucks for you insane fucks.

              so if the only reason your attacking pizzagate is because you believe it is a "ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theory", does that also mean you spend your time shitposting other "ridiculous fictitious conspiracy" theories that you don't agree with?

               Dont waste downvoates on this guy, its a trick to steal all our downvoates so when he shit posts he can upvoat it with his alt accounts and we wont be able to downvoat it.
