            More bad news about expecting any kind of justice in Arkansas:
           </p>
           <p>
            The two police officers that Linda Ives believes were the murderers of her son Kevin and friend Don Henry are Ronald Jay Campbell b. 1961 and Kirk Lane b. 1961.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jay Campbell :
           </p>
           <p>
            Campbell was fired in 2000 from his job as a lieutenant with the Pulaski County sheriff's office after Sheriff Randy Johnson stated that Campbell had tried to intimidate lower-ranking deputies into charging more for off-duty jobs.Campbell became Lonoke chief of police in 2003! Then in  2006 he and his wife get charged and convicted of stealing prescription drugs, stealing the neighbor's jewelry, wife having sex with prisoners,etc. They serve a couple of years, appeal, conviction reversed, appeal reversed but from a 40 yr sentence to 2+ years? Now his social site says he's manager at the Lonoke Fire Dept! Wife Kelly can't stay clean, busted again in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kirk Lane:
           </p>
           <p>
            Went to the FBI Academy then to Pulaski Co as Sheriffs Office of Investigations Div. Commander.2009 he makes police chief in Benton. Even though some citizens objected "“too much baggage” to be police chief", the mayor stated " [the Ives/Henry case] was 20-something years ago and it was old news and everybody had forgotten about it,”
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the state Atty General last year mentioning Kirk Lane among others needing to be praised for their work:
           </p>
           <p>
            "If they are not heroes, I do not know who is.
As Arkansas’s chief law enforcement officer, I am proud of the work of our officers and am honored to assist them in protecting our citizens by providing them with life-saving training and resources."
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole state of Arkansas is a cesspool except for some very brave people and a grieving mother seeking justice.These soulless ones that can murder under the cover of the badge are well connected to people that don't want the skeletons unearthed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a look at their pictures: two big bruisers over 6 ft. tall each one of them. Those two kids didn't stand a chance.Lane's comment in 2009: " he can understand why the rumors might persist. “If the family loses sight of us as suspects … they don't have anything else to hold onto,” Lane said

           <p>
            Will Byers - named after Chris Byers who was one of the boys murdered in the West Memphis Three case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Wheeler - I am not sure who he is named for

             Obama went to Harvard with a Wheeler and he was named to some Office.  Forget now.  Sinclair I don't know.  Yes, Very strange indeed.  But just about everything has weird tie ins so that it sounds conspiratorial in nature.  That is part of their MO.  People just are too trusting and stupid to believe it.  Trusting?  Why would people trust Politicians anyway?  Now that IS Stupid.

              I mention it because Winona Ryder was one of the people who helped get the WM3 off of the murder charges. They because close friends. Jonny Depp and the main suspect Damion Echols share a tattoo and lived together for a time.

               I am suspicious of both of them if they helped get those 3 out of jail.  There should be some research  into the SPLC since I believe they may have been involved as well.

            At the time the state medical examiner initially determined that the boys were struck by a train as they lay in a "marijuana-induced deep sleep", about as believable as Gary Webb's "Multiple Gunshots" suicide or the botched Starbucks "robbery" resulting in Clinton Associate Mary Mahone's death who was shot five times, once in the back of the head, with the key to the safe in her hand. The safe held $10,000 and wasn’t touched or the... &lt;insert 50+ "unexplained" Clinton-related deaths here...&gt;.

             Yes, I don't believe that clap trap either. They have fooled far too many people for too long.  I hope this blows up on the internet and people start tweeting stuff around.  We need some of this to go viral.  They just want it to go away.

            The Trump administration is probably rubbing mud in Clinton's eye with this. Maybe the dead boy's mother who is pushing this was told she would get protected if she pushed it?

            Don't know if they will really get busted but I still love that they are getting punked. :)

             Well they were bringing enough in from Columbia.  They eventually had the CIA pass out some in Cali as well.  The DEA would have been kept busy in Arkansas if they really did their job.

            27-Kevin Ives &amp; Don Henry – Known as “The boys on the track” case. Reports say the boys may have stumbled upon the Mena Arkansas airport drug operation. A controversial case, the initial report of death said, due to falling asleep on railroad tracks. Later reports claim the 2 boys had been slain before being placed on the tracks. Many linked to the case died before their testimony could come before a Grand Jury.
THE FOLLOWING PERSONS HAD INFORMATION ON THE IVES/HENRY CASE:
28-Keith Coney – Died when his motorcycle slammed into the back of a truck, 7/88.
29-Keith McMaskle – Died stabbed 113 times, Nov, 1988
30-Gregory Collins – Died from a gunshot wound January 1989.
31-Jeff Rhodes – He was shot, mutilated and found burned in a trash dump in April 1989.

             7 killed from 89 thru 90.  All connected to this case.  Hmm.  But what does it have to do with who the dead girl was.  I just find it odd that there have been many accidents with trucks.  It seems to be part of their MO.  There were all those that happened in relation to Nebraska and Idaho too, remember?  I think many are caused by people that have been under MKU that is why there are not any leaks of info from people.  Either they do not remember doing it, or they also are killed off.  I can't wait until the woman in Cali and her political husband come forward with that info about Henley.  Wonder what is up and behind these two Rapists going on the Road.  Really Very Sick.  They are trying to get out in front of what will be released.  Or do they have plans to involve this woman in a truck accident or similar?  Idk, but something is Very Fishy Indeed.

               They will be trucking busing boating trafficked people in of all ages and sexes.  Then possibly even more Elites and Pedowood Stars will be as well.  Maybe this is a moneymaker for these guys.  Maybe they will be charging Big Bucks to others to partake.  The kids will be brought there to them.  Or Participating Hotels as well can put them up.  They will probably use the same plan for the Super Bow.

             Killed off all the witnesses.  Just like they are doing with the Mandalay Shooting.  Bet there are others killed off with other False Flags.  Also, we know they kill to protect themselves. Thanks will check it out.

               Lord only knows.  I am sure and so are many others, that there must be many more.  There was an election with Election Fraud committed, so in order to come through such an operation, many unsavory acts must be committed.  I think most of these deaths can be allegedly contributed to them, but there are other players now as well like the Podestas, and George Soros.   Who knows.

            They need to look into Raymond " Buddy" Young
           </p>
           <p>
            He was the Chief of the State Troopers that did security for Clinton
           </p>
           <p>
            He was rewarded with a job at FEMA for not only keeping his mouth shut, but the eleven guys who worked under him
           </p>
           <p>
            Larry Nichols was a close friend of his, Nichols has plenty to say,  check out the vids on YouTube
           </p>
           <p>
            The boys could have seen the drug running, but my guess they knew about the free coke parties Bill and Dan Lassiter would have with underage girls
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill had his own Lolita parties before Epstein
           </p>
           <p>
            He would invite high up people to these parties
           </p>
           <p>
            His brother was involved also
           </p>
           <p>
            Both Dan and Rodger got busted
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill gave them both last minute pardons just before Bush was sworn in

             Some of this was covered on CDAN and yes, you are right.  He did have parties way before Epstein with underage girls.  Someone said that there was a dead girl involved.  So if this ever comes out fully, Stand Back.  I have heard the name Young before but quite a while back.  I am sure there is much dirt to be uncovered.  The documents the Judge is seeking will be unredacted.  I can't wait.

              Another Blind spoke of a young virgin cheerleader with a promised college scholarship who after being brought to Clinton swinger parties re the promise of a badly needed job, ended up a high school dropout, drug addict, and hooker in Vegas. Just one of many lives young lives ruined.

               It seems that whoever the Clintons come in contact with end up either Missing, or In Serious Trouble.  Their lives become ruined and BC HRC keep Chugging Along.  When will people learn to just avoid them.  Nothing Good comes from Hanging Out With Bill.

                 Kevin Ives and Don Henry, both 17, crushed by a train, August 23, 1987. Their deaths were ruled accidental, with the medical examiner saying they had fallen asleep on a railroad line after smoking marijuana, but a grand jury found they had been murdered before being placed on the tracks. They had allegedly stumbled on a plot to smuggle drugs and guns from an airport in Mena, Arkansas, that Bill Clinton was said to be involved in as state governor.

                 That was the CDAN item I mentioned but on CDAN there was also a Rocker included but some said it was a Comedian.  Some said Don Henley.  Idk, who else was included but this story has been swept aside Way Too Long.

                         Great Idea.  Especially for the Overweight ones, they will be skinny in no time.  No more pheasant under glass or diamond encrusted sprinkled lattes, sorry.  But I heard that NK does not exist and is a fabrication of the CIA.  Other story is that they will never be bombed because they are big  money launderers.

                 Spivey shared a story about a conversation he had with Clinton
 while on a flight over southeast Arkansas. The trooper noticed a
 blackened patch amidst the greenery below that, surprisingly,
 Clinton recognized. That patch was all that was left of an estate that
 had burned to the ground in the mid-80s.
 According to the trooper, Clinton began reminiscing about rumors
 of his involvement with the woman of the house, a onetime
 "Penthouse pet." Her husband, Spivey said, was involved in a
 pornography ring.
 Clinton explained to Spivey, "You know that mansion just burned
 down right on top of them." Years later, Spivey remains struck by
 one thing: the eerie expression that crossed Clinton's face as he
 spoke those words.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This Jane Doe was just 14 years old at the time of her Clinton
 encounter. And, according to the witness in whom she confided
 years later, she had attended a 1984 party co-hosted by Arkansas
 bond daddy Dan Lasater and Clinton's brother Roger. Both would
 later serve jail time on drug charges.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to Lambert, the young assault victim fled Arkansas when
 Gov. Clinton won the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination.
 Lambert and several reporters traced the girl, now a woman in her
 late 20s, to California. But she remained elusive till the end.

                 Lucile quoted Carl Limbacher:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   This Jane Doe was just 14 years old at the &gt;&gt;time of her Clinton
encounter. And, according to the witness &gt;&gt;in whom she confided
years later, she had attended a 1984 party &gt;&gt;co-hosted by Arkansas
bond daddy Dan Lasater and Clinton's &gt;&gt;brother Roger. 
As told to Lambert, the girl was rendered &gt;&gt;unconscious by a
deliberate overdose. And when she came &gt;&gt;to she was half-naked,
with the governor of the state of Arkansas &gt;&gt;on top of her.

            The enduring mystery surrounding the boys’ deaths led the Benton woman to file a lawsuit last year seeking to force eight federal agencies and three Arkansas-based law enforcement agencies to produce any and all documents amassed over the past 30 years that may provide some answers. The lawsuit accuses the agencies of violating the federal Freedom of Information Act by failing to turn over complete documents in response to requests Ives and her Little Rock attorney, R. David Lewis, filed in 2012.  The requests sought all information the agencies may have in their archives pertaining to Kevin Ives or Barry Seal, a pilot who in 1985 testified that he smuggled tons of cocaine from Colombia to drop zones in the Louisiana swamps, and was assassinated in 1986 in his hometown of Baton Rouge.  Miller dismissed most of the agencies from the lawsuit in a July 25 summary judgment order. But on Nov. 15, he ordered the three remaining defendants — the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Homeland Security — to turn over to him, by Dec. 1, all the unredacted documents they say are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

            According to news articles shortly after the boys’ deaths, the engineer of the train that couldn’t stop in time to avoid running over the boys at 4:25 a.m. Aug. 3, 1987, later said the train’s spotlight had illuminated them shortly before they were struck. He said they were lying on their backs, motionless and in a somewhat unnatural position, and covered by a tarp from the waist down. A rifle and a flashlight lay beside them.
