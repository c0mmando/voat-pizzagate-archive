            My ranting vent:  CIA is corrupt and has worked with  the politicians, and those who own them  (Multi-Trillionair Rothschilds and the many others at the top and middle tiers of power).  Their goal is to use propaganda and technology, along with diseased food, water, air and education and money-slave-work labor financial systems to  keep the public slaves ignorant and controlled workers.
May y'all burn in hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many agencies and boards need cleaning up, because their either regulated from the top or  complicit or enablers on all levels.
            <br/>
            The  top gouging of corporate finances and political upholding of this  produces a  financial-emotional-societal  slavery-work-labor  that is riddled with torment of all kinds for the general public.
May y'all burn in hell for your complicit and enabling perpetuation of this high inflation vs low wages for the public.   The public pay the taxes they can't even afford, while the rich get loopholes,   that is not   MAGA  but sadly it's what the rich people view as  MAGA.
           </p>
           <p>
            List any specific programs:
           </p>
           <p>
            My ranting vent:  Food and Drug  needs to clean up the toxic shit they allow in food.  It's killing humanity,  but of course that's what the corporate  pharma  owners want, so they can push their  pills on a sick population and have a sick  public to make  billions of dollars from pharma and  to control better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dept of Animal and Plant inspection service needs to clean up the way they treat the animals and process them for human consumption.
           </p>
           <p>
            The GMO groups,  like  Monsanto and others need to be controlled.    PUTTING FISH GENES IN VEGETABLES  is  ONLY PSYCHO.   This converges with the Dept of Agriculture with chemical and   seed modification.     NO  the  so-called   tests  that pass    their  grade is not acceptable  !!
           </p>
           <p>
            This converges with  Department of Food and Nutrition
           </p>
           <p>
            And what the hell is    Department of Agriculture: Risk Management Agency?    Are y'all trying to deduce the amount of risks to society  or  just manage the amount of disease that gets pumped out on society.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dept of Commerce full overhaul.    FEDERAL RESERVE   needs a speedy death,  and the way in which money is used  to enslave people.
           </p>
           <p>
            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ----   put legislation in place that  STOPS  killing  the ocean and air.     No, it's not carbon taxing,    U.N. and NASA has admitted to dumping chemicals  (chem-trails)  into the air.   STOP IT!    What's the purpose,  more diseased  humans who can  buy the pharma  pills and be easier to control.  It's  DYSGENICS  at it's absolute evil !!
Read the book Aldous Huxley's  Brave New World and see what  has been put in motion since WW2.  Now,  if you have kids  or relatives why the hell would y'all want your kids and grandkids to live in the hell-hole  society and world y'all are  passing laws and procedures to create and perpetuate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Dept of Defense:    only defends the politician and world owners with the big $  who   control the  Federal Reserve and Money, along with all other military operations to keep it in place.
It doesn't serve the public it serves the politicians and corporate owners.
These Defense  groups are compromised through  drug  and child crimes  to name a few. 
Those who aren't complicit are enablers and those who don't know should educate themselves to learn  the extent of it  that was never cleaned up in military or in  government offices,   (Project Flicker and  military UN peacekeepers sexually assaulting and Dyncorp  trafficking children and drugs for governement  ---   see   Bush/Clinton Foundation)
           </p>
           <p>
            Election Commission:   What a joke.    This needs cleaning up.  It's a sham that  many of the public  have seen through.... (the ones who haven't been  addicted into escapism and despondency or apathy)      These puppets aren't elected, their appointed.   By now that should be painful obvious to a 2nd grader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Federal Labor RElations Authority:      Labor laws are despicable !    Slave labor for slave wages, while  these groups pay  $ for $   much more in taxes than those who are  earning  over  $100k  per year.    Don't even get me started on the shite   loopholes for those who  ecrue  over $200 k per year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a search in your heart, if y'all have one,  or ask for a conscience of ethics,  then search inside and ask if this is honestly the dead zone  society y'all want for your future or that of your children or grandchildren?
           </p>
           <p>
            Dept of the Army:    STOP  creating  fake news and fake wars to send  the people into.   Fighting for freedom?   The only freedom should be from the US and UK  and EU  politicians and those  multi-trillionaires who own them.
            <br/>
            Instead,   YOU ALL   go fight in those wars!      Aaah,  but   the  corporate elite  controllers have to get their drugs and lithium out of  Afghanistan,  or minerals out of Africa Congo,  or  children trafficking  billion $ business out of it,  or   minerals out of the  Vietnam war,  or   martial control law out of  9-11  along with the fake   AlQuaida  enemy contrived by USA/UK  and now the fake contrived  invented  ISIS  because too many people discovered AlQuaida was contrived they disposed of it like a bag of garbage   and made the rules to dump BinLaden's  body in the ocean so no incriminating investigation could lead back to expose their lies and reveal the truth of this  global corruption.    MILITARY ???    Money maker ---   YOU GO AND FIGHT,  along with your children and family.   PLEASE DO !   NOW!   Enrol in frontline service  NOW!
           </p>
           <p>
            I really don't know where to start or end.  Corruption is global and it's at the top, sideways and all levels of humanity now thanks to the shit at the top that gather momentum and speed as it's rolling down the hill.

            My ranting vent:   Cleaning up the food,  water, changing regulation  of those dumping into the sky should be a no-brainer.

            Investigate  the child  slavery for trafficking and sexual rape among   society  INCLUDING  the government  mid and high levels of employees ---  THIS INCLUDES  BUSHES,  CLINTONS,  OBAMA,   Podesta's,   all other rank and file of society that is prevalent and protected  on media avenues like  google,  youtube,  facebook, Craig's list,  web and dark web, etc, etc.

            Question:
            <strong>
             Do you have any management reform ideas, such as acquisition/procurement reform?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            My ranting vent:   Yes,  but it would fly in the face of  the  Skull and Bones,  Bohemian Grove  Masonry  foundation that is a ritual liason for  those with corporate money and power who have the real control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise,  you're wasting my time and yours, shuffling shit around  or covering it with sugar to make it appear as something less than shit is a waste of my time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question:
            <strong>
             Do you have any other ideas for reorganizing the Federal government?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            My ranting vent:  Minds far  greater than mine have webpages and elaborate videos outlining  problems and solutions,  but y'all call it fake news.
Enjoy your shit world you're pretending to improve.
            <br/>
            An idiot would know that  y'all have no actual intention of cleaning up anything or improving anything at a core level that would provide REAL  HEALTHY change to society.

              Because life is awesome. WTF are you talking about. Just because we have a ridiculous and out of control president doesn't mean its going to ruin me and I will continue to fight for what I believe in. This whole pedogate thing is a peoples war! No one in the white house gives a fuck, are you serious. And all Trump cares about is his ratings, his ego and twitter followers. The way a man treats his wife speaks volumes about his character!

               He has cracked down on pedorings and made more arrests in a few months than Obama did in 8 years, OK. 3000 have been arrested as far as I know. He has promised to use the full force of the government to go after child trafficking... Once they get these people to rat out the higher ups the "fun" will begin... hopefully

                     I disagree. And it's not that he did the investigations, hacked his way through the jungle called the internet, and kicked down doors himself. It just seems that there are A LOT more happening now than all throughout the last admin.

                      That's not something its possible to disagree with. There's a firewall between POTUS and FBI director. Was put there after Nixon.

                     <p>
                      That's why you see such a large effort to discredit revelations like these after the fact. The judicial and executive are playing opposite hands....

                        I'd ask what makes them think the amount of arrests qualify as "overwhelming"?

                        A quick search seems to show operations run by the FBI during the Obama administration yielded are larger volume of arrests per operation as well as a larger volume of victims recovered during operations.

                       <p>
                        Does Obama get credit for that? Or nah?

                   What do you think? Why was the Savile case not investigated properly? Why was the Detruex case not investigated properly? The rings are protected... Rumor is Trump has lifted the ban on properly going after these rings...

                    Rumor has it? So there was a Federal ban against prosecuting child trafficking rings before Trump. Are you dumb or just that brainwashed? Honestly, what was the highest level of education you finished?
