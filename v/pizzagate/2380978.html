            This gives me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Dear God, I hope there ok, but I can’t believe that they are. It’s hard to look at their fotos. I’m a grown man at work reading this and trying to cry.

            The mom was convicted in the late 90s of having sex with a 14 year old boy (no idea how old she was at the time) -- but, I still don't buy that she was abusing her boys.  Seems like with her past conviction, they would have looked at her pretty intently once the allegation of abuse was made.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, even if you did want to keep them away from her -- why would you just give your kids away to strangers?  I know I wouldn't.  I might disappear and live under an assumed name WITH my kids, but I'm not giving them away to some "underground child sanctuary".  My guess is he either killed them to get back at the mom or, if he did give his kids to someone, he sold them.  There is pretty much a zero percent chance that he is telling the truth about what he did with those boys.

            This freak needs to be locked up til they find out what he did with those boys.  I don’t think this will end well. So very sad.
