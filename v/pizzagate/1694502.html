            I've been following Mike Trimm on Youtube for almost a year. I didn't know about the DHHS policy. And he's got a point. Mainstream media used the CCP shooter to prop up the conspiracy aspect tied to CPP itself and that MSM having done so, set the stage for the term Pizzagate to be associated with shooter/conspiracy nut, and thus to be discredited. That's why there's a push to use terms like human trafficking and pedogate, thereby creating a break from the conspiracy nut aspect tied to Pizzagate (thanks, MSM. You skeevy bastards.)

            I listened to the whole thing. I don't hear any new revelations. I was already aware of the DHHS policy of protecting agents and using sexual abuse. Of course this is not only in our country, it's worldwide. Downplaying Pizzagate isn't the answer. Without Pizzagate opening my eyes I wouldn't be here today, it's a stepping stone to understanding the whole situation. No, we shouldn't focus solely on that, but if you start looking at the connections, you will find their are business "covers" for child trafficking, I have found several that are suspect. He is right about not accusing anyone, you will get sued. Thanks for sharing. I will follow him to see what else he finds,

             Yes comet pingpong may have art that depicts pedophilia. But that's not where it's happening. And to make an assumption and think that it's happening there is falling privy to misinformation

            This is why I say he hasn't done his homework. I don't know, nor have I heard, ONE person online describe "pizzagate" this way.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first time I heard this was from pedo protecting NYT. I immediately tweeted the author of the story asking for her source when she claimed 'we' believed this ring was being
            <em>

            . She ignored me. She offered NO sources for her description of pizzagate which she made up, and which rags like WaPost et al echoed ad infinitum.

            But now Michael is handing the responsibility for this fiction to US. He has obviously been in a bubble and not in these Voat forums, because no one believes that.

            So it makes the rest of his rant quite irrelevant, imo.

             what I gathered through this is that even though we know Comet is involved, we can't bring down the ring through Comet directly, because those involved have strategically positioned the argument against Comet as being deflated through plausible deniability. The smoking gun will definitely be in the emails, and the game is how we can force the emails out. Everyday we are gaining ground, but to put all out chips on Comet will not work.

              I think we definitely need to keep investigating Comet, but in terms of red pilling the public we also need other avenues, because the media has definitely set up the equation "comet Ping pong = Conspiracy theory". It obviously isn't, but the public has been set up to think so.

               Other avenues, like everything we cover here at Voat? I mean, who is his podcast directed toward? He's only substantiating the idea that pizzagate investigators are solely focused on the basement of Comet. Where did he get this idea? It makes no sense. No one is saying that. When you look at the topics covered here you will not find evidence that we focus on Comet. Epstein has nothing to do with Comet, but he's been almost as big a topic here. We've gone after anything that seems related and that has some substance to it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It doesn't make sense that he would jump in here and claim to have a video so hot it might get pulled any second, whilst mis-characterizing us, our beliefs, showing he either didn't do his homework.... or... ?

                He's pointing out that the main stream media is saying "investigators are solely focused on the basement of Comet", and people that choose not to dig deeper are believing that.

                 I'm not sure that's how people are going to hear it; maybe he can try again after thinking a bit more deeply about what he's trying to say. He shouldn't need to have this words explained, for instance. If that makes any sense...

            Wow, he doesn't sound very informed. Plus, he's using the MSM's definition of pizzagate (Comet basement, Hillary in charge, blabla). Strange that one would speak out on this without having put in hours and hours and hours of research first, and he is using InfoWars to back up his assertions, with a straight face.

            Michael, we're not expecting to get rid of pedophilia in the next few months, we are simply asking for an investigation, and like Ben Swann, asking WHY one hasn't been initiated.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Later edit: so far the only new info is the idea that we shouldn't be calling people pedos without solid proof, we might get sued. We can legally pose it as a question, however.

             and furthermore he's saying how the MSM's definition of pizzagate is used as a trap to defuse research. i.e. saying that it's a ring run from the basement of comet (podesta's recent lie) is being used to make fun of the theory.

              OK, we knew that already. I'll keep listening and weigh in later. Not impressed so far. I really don't think he's done a lot of deep research, to be honest. Some of us have read every single thing since the emails were released in early Nov. I don't think he is one of those people.

               so anyone that say Pizzagate is real is a shill? Don't get me wrong, I question Seaman's credibility too, but I think Trimm is legit from what I have looked into so far

                OK, that's fine. And that's why I support free speech, unlike some "progressives" in our midst. I agree that you have made some valid points, and I believe I have made valid points as well. I simply think that my interpretation of this guy is more accurate. Perhaps he even means well, but I think he is at least overstating, overtly and implicitly, his knowledge and original insight into this matter.

                 I hear you. I think the point of Trimm's post is that even though JA and Comet are involved, the media has positioned the public to believe that this is a dead end.

                 I think this above post has most leads right now. even there they list:

                <p>
                 "#pizzagate is not about what happens in a pizzeria basement that doesn’t exist. It’s a worldwide network of people with matching incentives, sharing in a religion that has illegal practices, the manipulation of politicians and the business of child sexual exploitation under the protection of people at all levels of power, right up to the former secretary of state and president of the United States."
                </p>
                <p>
                 FBIanon did say that the podesta brothers engaged at sexual activities at Comet, at least one time, but we need the god damn weiner/huma emails to blow this open, and putting Comet on the front page has been designed to detract from this. It's a tough situation because we all know that Comet is as dirty as it gets.

                  I see, so your job as a shill is to induce others to believe that the pedo criminal element in our govt is so huge beyond CPP that it is overwhelming, and therefore we should not focus on Podesta, Hillary, Alefantis, etc.

              I'm listening now. But he did use the MSM's definition of pizzagate attributing it to us by virtue of not explaining the NYT made it up. That bothers me. I also have heard from lawyers that what we have now on pizzagate IS ENOUGH to begin an investigation. There is no justifiable reason to ignore Comet pong pong.
