            (apologies if this subject has already been shared/ discussed i was told to share it on a McCann thread) I have just started watching a documentary on Madeleine McCann (haven't finished it yet) - one aspect of this documentary focuses on Clarence, Mitchell Madeleine's parents' Family Spokesman. The film states that at the time of Maddi's disappearance Mitchell was head of Tony Blairs Governments' powerful media machine, the media monitoring unit - inside the COI - Central office of information - on a salary in today's terms of over 100,000 pounds. Headed up a 40 strong media manipulation department costing British taxpayers several millions of pounds a year - after working for the McCann's for a year he boasted to a Portuguese newspaper L'esspresso that "My job was to control what comes out in the media" . Before becoming the McCann's spokesman he had worked for the BBC for many years (RED FLAG) on some of the top crime stories of the time (Murders by Fred and Rosemary West, Jessica and Holly murders, Jill Dandos murder (all cases to do with pedophilia Jill Dando was purportedly investigating pedophilia when assassinated) and many more ...The documentary asks why a civil servant of such prominence in the Government was put in charge (on the 6th May 2007- 3 days after disappearance ) of representing the McCann's case to the public ? Mitchell was allowed to leave a highly paid post as civil servant to work full time on the case? Mitchell manufactured or fed stories to the media about people of interest, suspects ect. Later Mitchell carried on working part-time for the McCann's BUT THEN immediately retained a job as a Reputation Manager at FREUD INTERNATIONAL. A company owned and run by Matthew Freud. The son-in-law of Media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The documentary establishes Mitchell's close relationship with the Murdoch empire. They also state that in 2009 David Cameron famously met Rupert Murdoch on Murdoch's yacht in the Mediterranean. HE was flown there in Matthew Freud's private jet. Weeks after that historic meeting Murdoch's newspapers (the SUN and the Times) were told to stop backing Labour and started backing Cameron's party the conservatives to win the 2010 general election. Mitchell was then appointed to help win that general election. NOw this is all stated in the documentary which I would recommend watching in full for more details on that which I have referred to here (19 mins in) and more on the Madeleine McCann case. Documentary - starting from 19 mins
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIjPcvmVzUo&amp;t=1205sYouTube">

            </a>
            What caught my eye in particular in relation to Pizzagate and Elite Pedophilia was that Matthew Freud is not only the son-in-law of Rupert Murdoch but he is also the son of Sir Clement Freud, Grandson of Sigmund Freud (interesting due to Sigmund's ideas on sexuality and particularly childhood sexuality and latent childhood sexuality) and brother of Lucian Freud. He has been a chef, food writer, television and radio personality and elected as a liberal member of parliament in 1973 till 1987 and also received a Knighthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            After his death however, it has recently been discovered perhaps a few years ago, that he was a pedophile and child predator, sexually abusing young girls for decades. I have read some stuff about him in these forums and in news articles which show he had been in touch with the McCann's after Madeleine's disappearance and they had become friends as he lived near from where she had gone missing in the resort of Praia da Luz resort in Portugal. He hosted the McCann's at his home. It has also been suggested that while he may have been away during Madeleine's disappearance the Podesta's could have possibly stayed in his home during that time (i'm not sure there is enough evidence at the moment to confirm or deny this) .
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            It is very strange that Mitchell, the McCann's spokesman now works for Clement Freud's son's company. Also Strange is that Clement's wife Jill Freud is said to have had an affair with a 16 year old the Artist Will Self's brother although he said the experience was positive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also recently watched a documentary called "the boy with the henna tattoo" -- which shows a gay couple and their child - they traveled the world handing their son over to other pedophiles to be abused. He was also abused by those he called his parents one of which was abused himself and was groomed into the manboy love ideology shifting from his role as boy to man later in life. The documentary makes me seriously consider whether Madeleine's parents we're involved in this kind of thing? Loaning their daughter out to pedophiles such as Clement Freud? or his elite friends? the man was very connected! Perhaps him and his son then hired Mitchell to protect their interests or those of their friends and then offered a lucrative job at the end of it all.

           </p>
           <p>
            Would love it if anyone could find more out about Clement Freud, his son, Mitchell and their circle of friends ( they seem to be similar in their status in Europe as the Podesta Brothers in America? I also think that we could look more into Sigmund Freud's ideas on childhood sexuality as people have done on Kinsey? Could Freud have been a pedophile or subjected his children to psychological experiments to determine if his theories had merit?? Sorry for such a long post i just wanted to get everything on here before i forget

            I'm not American, so I was watching from the side. I knew Trump would win, after Brexit it was clear.

            But it didn't take much to realise that he's just a typical politician, full of bullshit. Lies, lies, lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which is essentially good, because thr guy's agenda seems to be pretty good if you can analyse deeper (with exceptions, if course).

            Police in Suffolk have confirmed the now-known Pedaphile, Clement Freud, was out of the country when Madeleine was abducted. However, his home had been loaned to friends of his- John and Tony Podesta.

            How is the Orange Baboon going to help the case when he literally just two days ago said that he wasn't going to investigate this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides, even if he hadn't said that, whete would his interest be to dismantle that organisation? His interest would be to blackmail the organisation.

             He didn't say anything except he wasn't going to pursue Hillary email server indictment.

            <p>
             A. He isn't the one who will pursue
B. He didn't say he would stop a pursuit
C. This isn't about Hilary's illegal server

             Pizzagate is about the doorway that leads to clinton foundation pay to play arrangements which amount to treason...and child trafficking.  It looked like the Clintons were the center...they aren't. Hillary is a vile, self-centered woman who is evil at her core and seeks power, bill is an egomaniacal, sexual predator along for the party...while disgusting, they are not the power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rather than seeing someone like John Podesta as a Clinton operator, it looks more like the Clintons are the tools to be used by Podesta. Their base nature is an opportunity and the reason these nobodies made it so far.

              Yes, I have a tendency to provoke and speak strongly, but the guys here need a little exposure to other viewpoints.

              Bottom line: it is in the interest of #pizzagate to interest all interested people, regardless of their political views.

            Podestas were on a trip on May 4, the day after McCain was abducted (or sold), but no proof exists that Podestas were at the pedo's house (C. Freud), nor is there one even proving that they were in Portugal.

                 Yep. Didn't find the statement from the Suffolk Police Department. There's no proof for now. Until new information is released, this'll have to stay as it is.

             WRONG:
            </p>
            <p>
             Police in Suffolk have confirmed the now-known Pedaphile, Clement Freud, was out of the country when Madeleine was abducted. However, his home had been loaned to friends of his-  John and Tony Podesta.

              Look, you believe, I believe as well. Those sketches look way too similar to Podestas. But this is not an argument to convince serious people or mainstream media.

            This is why Globalism is evil, if not in intent, but by outcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evil people can hide behind multinational, trans-global organisations and companies, because it's the perfect vehicle for fraud, corruption and the worst evils man is capable of.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is because Nation States for all their flaws  are a FIREWALL against tyranny as the people can hold the elites to account via the ballot box and open and transparent systems of democracy like elections and enquiries.
           </p>
           <p>
            These paedo satanists can hide their crimes BECAUSE they are Globalists; taking advantage of highly corrupt and poor foreign nations, whose voiceless children can be disappeared with barely a murmur of protest and a brown envelope of dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Western media can easily cover up such crimes by concentrating on local interest distractions. Look at the non existent coverage of Venezuela where people are marching by the 100,000s, eating pets and zoo animals - yet our media ignores so as not to highlight the folly of socialism. So they won't talk about thousands of Haitian kids disappearing yearly.
           </p>
           <p>
            By moving money, people and crimes and splitting them across jurisdictions, investigations let alone Justice is completely SHORT CIRCUITED. Follow ups and suspicions are neutered by taking advantage of bureaucracy, language, legal and cultural differences as smokescreen.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no coincidence the people implicated - be they Hollywood puppets, MSM, Leftists of all stripes, establishment right (RINO / Corporatist types), or even the Catholic Church - are ALL supporters of divesting more and more sovereign powers to Global bodies, treaties and quangos. From the UN to FIFA to the Olympics to TPP / TTIP to the EU - all end up being mired by controversy, fraud, cover ups, corruption and self interest. By their opaque and undemocratc nature, the most corrupt and evil rose to the top and control such bodies, whatever the laudable motives for their inception.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nationalism, not Globalism, is the credo of anyone who expects to unravel the international satanic child trafficking paedo Elites.

             Corporations: they are not legally required to be answerable to the people, they can literally do whatever they want. 
The Banks: a group of corporations which use their financing power to ensure that no anti-corporate voice is ever heard.
Public Opinions: ironically constructed by the private corporations.

            The source of this information is an "anonymous insider." There is no concrete proof that Podesta was in Portugal and definitely no concrete proof that they were staying at Freud. This shouldn't be passed along as "fact."

             Potip: we don't have concrete proof of anything. ANY link related to pizza should be considered. The more avenues anons explore the more we could find and/or eliminate to start getting a cohesive story. Things that are shown to have no credible possibility are just as important as they reduce the noise over time. Post our alt sub again:

             <p>
              FACT: Literally no one, NO ONE but the feds, air traffic, air port personnel, know for certain if Podestas were in Portugal at that time

             <p>
              FACT: until someone leaks this information, the case will remain circumstantial.
             </p>
             <p>
              FACT: There is some concern that the McCanns may not have not been entirely in the clear re Podesta's taking Maddy...a little sleepy juice and plausible deniability...re possible "Gerry McCann" internet postings to the effect that little girl driving them nuts, and extramarital affairs/threesomes ** note this Gerry McCann as far as I know has not been 100% IDd as THE Gerry McCann.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a very strong circumstantial case, combined with the "we know but can't arrest or will cause intentional incident" article...very strong...but until someone leaks the data, we are literally stuck.

               Lets not forget all the different methods that can be used to place a person in a location. You're missing a lot on your list.  Which is why it hasn't been denied.

               Look at timestamp of the first wikileaks.. His communications strongly infer hes in that part of the world..

              <p>
               CLEM was out. 'Friends' were there. This was released by the Police and printed in MSM over there. Now they are gagged now. So no more hints apparently..

                I have no doubt where he was...but proving it without leaks is not possible. VERY strong circumstantial evidence to be sure..and Sir Clem's invite to have the McCanns for dinner (cause he rushed there once the media mess started) is just creepy. McCanns have been oddly silent since the Podesta match to the drawings has made news.

              Yes, yes and yes. Nobody's denying those. Also, Fact: C Freud lives five minutes by foot from where McCain was abducted (or sold).

              The non-fact is that we have a proof that Podestas were there.

              Nobody denied it, but yet most social media accounts related to comet pin pong are all going private or suppressed without any answer or so....
If I were under the scope of a worldwide pedophile investigation I would at least deny it and fight such allegations

                 Why did he deliete his emails the day after her appearance? The only time apparently he ever did delete emails?  -Its a very relevant question. In fact, if he was on the island, its gonna be considered destruction of evidence at the very least. (least of his worries).

                  I'm not arguing any of the confirmed observations regarding Podesta and Portugal. It is odd he deleted his emails and it is odd that an assistant was using his email at the time indicating he was either too busy or away.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The article claimed the Suffolk police state this but they don't link the source for the Suffolk police. You can't find any evidence for this besides this article sourcing FBI anon and Suffolk police. It's a very weak claim as its not substantiated anywhere but the article itself.

             this is why i've written "may have been found" in the title,
This insider stated that the intelligence community has the proof the Podesta brothers rented the house, but we don't have this supposed proof that is true.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still the ressemblance to the police sketches, plus the abnormal activity in Podesta's e-mails at the time of the event is being pretty clear

            This is bigger than Trump, but so far he's been doing good. Remember he wants Gen. Flynn which twitted about pizzagate some time ago
           </p>
           <p>
            Look the interview from Erik Prince at Breitbart
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">

           </p>
           <p>
            This is also bigger than the FBI or the NYPD if he is saying the truth, do you imagine that the FBI have ceased Weiner's personal computer under warrant with evidence of all of this coded talks, classified information (without  any clearences whatsoever), direct pedo connection (he was sending picture of his spaghetti to under age girls), 
but those institutions couldn't act yet because of the pressure they are getting from the top. Meaning VP or POTUS, there is not a lot of people above the FBI or NYPD
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Another possibility (tin foil power 2) would be that the establishment is blocking the investigation while some info is released to the public so we expose what could be used in the FBI case so that they can hide as much as possible and prepare some kind of plausible deniability and chop some heads in the doing. Like: Oh Mrs. Clinton you failed? let's punish you with you're campaign manager (even in this case i think they are losing control and will lose more than projected!)

            It's up to regular citizens. We have to hold their feet to the fire and demand action be taken.

            Have not seen this concrete yet but the Freuds invited the McCann family over for support after their child went missing. So seems like the McCanns can even be placed in that residence.

            Definitely off the Creepy Meter scale! I wonder if Google Earth has pictures of the houses? I am surprised this has not come out in the investigations from England. Although with the level of cover up this mess has, not necessarily that surprised. Excellent find. Thank you!

             Apparently, Freud originally owned the villa, but then sold it to a friend. Then continued using it whenever he wanted. The Landlord could confirm who was staying there. However the Landlord might be sus. Because Praia du Luz is a known pedo hangout. So why hang out there. Lets assume that everyone who stayed there was an "Intimate friend of Freuds" so how can we get the names.??

             Good work. Still need a paper trail of some kind. Hopefully something will turn up sooner rather than later.
