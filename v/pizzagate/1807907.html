<p>The Vatican says 3,420 credible accusations of sexual abuse by priests had been referred to the Vatican in the past 10 years and 824 clerics defrocked. That\'s about 1 CREDIBLE ACCUSATION EVERY DAY. <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/pope-meets-victims-of-sex-abuse-seeks-forgiveness/1952295.html">source</a></p>
<p>None of the bishops accused have spent a single day in jail. One very close to end up in trial was in Poland:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop Józef Wesołowski *</p>
<p>Polish. Resigned as papal nuncio to Dominican Republic August 2013 and was secretly recalled to Vatican, just days before DR news media exposed his alleged sex assaults of children on Santo Domingo waterfront. Church officials did not inform DR law enforcement. Prosecution sought by both DR and Poland. Vatican reportedly rebuffed extradition request by Poland January 2014. Laicization announced June 2014, four days after DR bishop tweeted about seeing Wesołowski strolling in Rome. Diplomatic immunity removed August 2014, day after NY Times exposé. Put under house arrest in Vatican City State September 2014. Found with 100,000+ child abuse images on his laptop and Vatican-owned computer. Released from house arrest after 60 days; free to move around Vatican City State beginning late November 2014. Hospitalized night before his July 2015 trial in VCS, causing trial to be indefinitely postponed. Released from hospital one week later, and freed to walk around Vatican City, according to BBC. Found dead in his Vatican apartment August 28, 2015. Trial never resumed. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/bishops/accused/global_list_of_accused_bishops.htm#WESOLOWSKI">source with links</a></p>

<p>Couple of interesting cases from the U.S.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Lawrence D. Soens</p>
<p>Resigned 1998, age 72. Accused publicly 2000s of ‘sadistic’ sexual abuse of 31 teen boys beginning late 1950s. Found guilty by 2008 review board. Not charged. Remains Sioux City IA bishop emeritus. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/bishops/accused/global_list_of_accused_bishops.htm#SOENS">source with links</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Archbishop John C. Nienstedt</p>
<p>Stepped aside December 2013 after allegation of inappropriately touching boy\'s buttocks in 2009. Called allegation &quot;entirely false.&quot; Resumed duties March 2014 after prosecutor announced no charges due to insufficient evidence. Internal investigation of alleged misconduct toward adults revealed July 2014. It reportedly found Nienstedt made &quot;sexual advances&quot; toward two priests. Nienstedt kept findings secret and, according to MPR report , authorized new investigation by second law firm. Resigned June 2015, per 401.2, soon after archdiocese was charged criminally for contributing to child sex abuse. Now Saint Paul and Minneapolis MN archbishop emeritus. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/bishops/accused/global_list_of_accused_bishops.htm#NIENSTEDT">source with links</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bishops seems to be backed up directly by Vatican, despite of their talk on &quot;zero tolerance&quot;. Some priests have been conducted, like Mr. Wehmeyer, 50, sentenced to five years in a Minnesota prison in 2013 for criminal sexual conduct and possession of child pornography. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2015/05_06/2015_06_05_Smith_CatholicArchdiocese.htm">source</a> but very few of those 824. </p>
<p>By their example, Catholic Church seems to show to the world that money can be used to stay out of jail (the Church has paid tens of millions of dollars in settlements to victims), child sex doesn\'t need to be followed by penalties but forgiveness, and even The Pope Francis has quietly reduced sanctions against a handful of pedophile priests <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/pope-trims-sanctions-for-some-pedophile-priets-seeking-mercy/3740329.html">source</a>. With the authority they have over societies, I\'d say they are promoting pedophilia by their current lack of actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And she questioned if the Vatican already had adequate means to judge negligent bishops, &quot;why then has no bishop been officially, transparently sanctioned or removed for this negligence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it is not lack of laws, then is it lack of will?&quot; she asked. <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/vatican-sex-abuse/3765083.html">source</a></p>

              Bishop Carlson of St Louis and others in the US are sending their pedophile priests to Vianney Renewal Center.  It is known as Club Ped.  Read it.  You will be shocked at what a resort atmosphere exists at this "punishment prison".I have done quite a bit of research of what goes on in St. Louis and the Archdiocese.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Great research and an upvoat for you.  Thanks.
