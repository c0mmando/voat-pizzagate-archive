<p>Karly Noel Franz is a victim of inter-generational MK Ultra Monarch Programming in the 1990s. She wants to get this information out into the open and says it is still going on today. .</p>
<p>Karly Noel Franz--- claims to be a victim of epsteins island, she says the chair in the bathroom was used for raping, torturing  murdering little girls after which they would &quot; yank the body (physically &amp; literally)  toss her on the floor  and put another girl in the chair and so on&quot;.
Slick Willy had the same proclivities as Jeffry...….The girl mentions the illuminati being present...The Illuminati, a secret Satanic organization, uses mind control techniques on the innocent, especially children, because of the pain it causes them, and women, for sexual purposes.
There were others present while rape and torture was going on......omg
She witnessed a lot of abuse and fears for her life</p>
<p>This  particular victim was a ghost writer for music, tv. advertisements, movies, products   (Song of Ice and Fire)    etc.</p>

            Thanks for posting this. Those of us who have been here 2 years and more k ow all too well that we have had women and men faking their story. Asking for Money is always s tip off. But many that were abused by priests have received compensation for the abuse they suffered. I hope this woman is on the level but as some are saying we will just have to wait it out. God I sure hope she’s got her ducks in a row and that she puts him and the rest of this hang away for the rest of their lives. I have known a Survivor over a year now and she is on the level. She has suffered real torture. Her rapist has denied his crime over and over but last year Pa. finally named him as her abusers. Thomas J Benestad. So yes there are true stories.

            I can shed light on this, WITH MY BIG RED FLAIR AND ALL.
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to sell those things. What he has in known as a "dental unit" and it includes a chair, a suction unit, and a pneumatic air system to power the drills.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Could it be used as a torture device? Of course it could. As much as I hate Jeffrey Epstein and everything he stands for, I find it more likely that it is a rich man's convenience.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That tiny island is not well stocked with dentists. It is very plausible that his rich ass was having dentists flown in to work on his teeth so that he didn't have to fly away from his paradise every time he needed a dentist.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I'm not taking up for the scumbag child rapist but since I was affiliated with the dental business for so many years, I don't find it odd that he has his own dental unit and flies a dentist in to work on his teeth.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            However, it would make a perfect torture device because getting the nerves in teeth drilled without anesthetic would be EXCRUCIATINGLY painful.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Who knows. It could be both?

             That tiny island is not well stocked with dentists. It is very plausible that his rich ass was having dentists flown in to work on his teeth so that he didn't have to fly away from his paradise every time he needed a dentist. ----------------not realistic. He was a man who got around.
            </p>
            <p>
             I find it extremely odd to have the chair in the bathroom. Why would he put it there instead of a room less intimate.....
            </p>

             this chair issue is driving me nuts. you watch in the end it will be something stupid !!  lol

            According to the police video of Epstein's Florida mansion, it was a dental CART on wheels parked next to a chair in the bathroom. It was just a regular chair. The dental cart in the bathroom was ODD and could have been used for nefarious purposes, but there was no proof. If they did a legit DNA check, that would be evidence. Hard to tell if this "victim" is legit.

             Yes. For some reason they want to keep bringing this up with inaccurate info.

             REPOSTED:
We have no proof of "torture" in a chair. IT WAS NOT A DENTAL CHAIR. "In one bathroom sits a chair. Next to it is a fully equipped dentist's cart, complete with what appear to be drills, a lamp and other instruments" This is based on the 2016 police raid on Epstein's FLORIDA mansion. Epstein does hold his mouth in an odd way. Maybe he actually uses it on himself. See actual photos and video from the raid.

             SEE IT FOR YOURSELF
Without hard evidence, we can only speculate. Maybe it's use will come out in his trial.
