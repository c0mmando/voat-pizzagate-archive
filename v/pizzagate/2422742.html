            How in the hell can a wife 1) stay married to a guy who rapes young girls and 2) further traumatize them in order to protect her cushy lifestyle and save herself the embarrassment of everyone knowing her husband is a child rapist?  She's just as evil as he is, as far as I'm concerned.  I love my husband deeply, but if I ever caught him doing something like this, it would be over.  Period.  If he was cheating on me with an adult woman it would be hard enough to get over that (I probably couldn't), but an underage girl -- just one, never mind a bunch of them -- is completely unforgivable.  What a heartless bitch.

            Look it's pretty simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            Men want to fuck women. That includes younger women. That includes decent men.
           </p>
           <p>
            Decent men stay away from temptation and resist. They are also grossed out by the idea of abusing someone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Undecent men don't.
           </p>
           <p>
            In conclusion : gender segregation in schools or at least don't allow males to have authority over an all female group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some kind of dress code so that the volleyball players aren't in what's equivalent to underwear would also be a good idea.

            Alright.  Why are all these schools ignoring what is going on?  Why is there no action taken on these perverts by the schools?  They know this stuff is going on.  Something Stinks.  CP or Rings, I don't know, maybe that's not it.  But Why?  Just Why.  Are they getting paid off by the rapists?  This is a headscratcher for me.   Have just been too many, and all across the country.

             Probably for the same reason the Catholic Church covered it up completely.  Not every Catholic leader was okay with pedophile priests, I'm sure -- but they went along with the cover-up because they worried about the effect on the church and they worried that people would suspect them, too.  I'm sure these schools are worried about their reputations.  They put PR above the children.   Plus, sometimes they just don't want to believe that their colleague -- whom they like and don't suspect at all -- could be like that and they wouldn't know.  I complained to my guidance counselor once about a high school teacher/coach who had girls sitting on his lap in his classroom after school.  I knew he was a creep because he went to high school with my dad and aunt.  In fact, he had a thing for my aunt and my dad caught him peeping into her window one night when they were all in high school.  Of course, they didn't believe me.  A few years after I graduated, he got a student pregnant.  They should have listened to me.  Maybe we just need to start listening to the kids.  Some manipulative kids might cry molestation falsely, but those are few and far between.  It is worth taking them seriously and investigating it just to be sure.

              Yes, we should listen to the children.  Children are born innocent and especially when small would never know about adult sexual acts, especially the really heinous ones.  We have had  many shills on here always trying to discount what children have said.  The Martin Preschool Case was one.  Those poor children.  They are adults now with very twisted lives.  It is bad enough when you are abused, but to not be believed is absolutely horrid.

            It really makes you wonder if "women's volleyball" was set up as an Olympic sport by the Pedocracy the same way kids' gameshows and the bratpack movies were set up by Pedowood -- to create a pipeline of nubile young flesh for them to feast on.

              I actually liked the Hunger Game books (the movies, not so much).  Yes, the tributes are peddled as prostitutes (as well as a reference to one of the "peacekeepers" in the District who preys on desperate young girls trading food for sex -- kind of like those UN peacekeepers ... hmm).
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the book itself has a very different message than the way the message was twisted for the movie.  But, that is just my take on it.  The movie glamorizes the violence while the book makes it clear that the punishment meted out by the gov't was designed to be the worst possible and to discourage any rebellion.  They didn't just come after you for attempting to rebel -- they targeted your children.

               The second is devoid of orginality, and fails where the first succeeds, very weak.

             I hate the Olympics really.  Have not watched them for years.  They never make money for the countries/cities that host them.  It is all for the investors and contractors.  I have an inkling there is so much pedophilia and abuse going on there it would Shock the Universe.  All a big set up for the Elites.

               Yeah, I can't even remember how long ago I stopped.  I really don't know why people watch them, what with all the drug disclosures.  Now after Nasser, I was hoping for a  huge drop off.  Not so much. People seem to be woke when you read comments, but when it comes time to show it, they cave.  Although I do admit I have not checked viewership this year.

                 I know.  I am hoping the numbers will continue to plunge, possibly being even lower next year.  It is too bad it can't be run honestly making it a great way for athletes to compete without the Horrid Games that benefit the Pedo Elite.

                   I know.  It has gotten to the point where I am questioning everything now. Whatever I see on the news, I am skeptical about.  Any charity doing things for kids or raising money even locally, well I just can't trust them.  Yes, it is quite sad.
