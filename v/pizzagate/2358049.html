<p>Most recent is a CNN news clip regarding the &quot;secret&quot; FISA memo where at the end of the clip, Congressman Adam Schiff mentions  the &quot;FULSOME attack on the FBI.&quot;  (The first part of the video is narrated, with the CNN video starting at 2:29).

<p>I am neither authenticating nor disparaging the document, but coupled with Hannigan\'s resignation and Schiff\'s slip-of-the-tongue or freebie, 2+2=4 appears to be quite reasonable.</p>

            This fake document is a hot mess.
           </p>
           <p>
            So is Nunes memo.  Nunes memo is evidence of nothing he wrote it.  And he refuses to show to the people who know the facts.   Only 8 people in Congress have seen the real Intel the FISA WARRANT was based on.  Nunes is one, so it the head of the Senate Intel Committee.  Nunes will not show his memo to this fellow Republican because he knows it will be exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is basically trying to claim the warrant was based only on the Steele Dossier and ignoring all the other Intel.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is gambling that they will not want release the other Intel.  Why?  Because it's classified and will expose sources and methods.  The DOJ has informed Speaker Ryan this stunt by Nunes is in violation of an agreement with Congress on sharing intel and might jeopardize future Congressional access to Intel.

              Yeah, I'm sure it does.
             </p>
             <p>
              Something tells me somebody doesn't understand how a FISA warrant is granted.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure that when applying for a FISA warrant, Obama-DOJ-FBI-Clinton decided to outline how they colluded.   And nobody at any other level saw this.  Not the Republican Chair of the Senate Intel Committee, not the Ranking Member, not the Speaker of the House or Senate Majority Leader, all who have access to the intelligence that this fake memo is based on.   Only Devin Nunes SUPER-SLEUTH could discern this.   Devin Nunes SUPER SLEUTH then wrote up a 4 page memo with his super sleuth conclusions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Devin Nunes is a tool who has been acting a fool for over a year now.   He has no credibility and that's why he doesn't want his colleagues or the FBI to see his fake memo.
