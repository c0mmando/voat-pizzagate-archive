<p>Original Comment:</p>
<p>&quot;Having a clean white cloth, often embroidered with Masonic symbols, placed under my ass was a preliminary first step to sodomy in all group settings I can remember. This was in the 1950\'s. It was kept as a fetish or prize by the groups leader after the event and contained evidence of the rape that had taken place.&quot;</p>
<p>The topic of what a &quot;map&quot; is has been debated extensively here. This definition by someone who experienced SRA first-hand. aligns exactly with both my comments here, as well as other independent research not shared on this forum.  If this were a courtroom, this specific &quot;evidence&quot; as provided by a &quot;witness&quot;, would be admissible as prima facie evidence in a trial.</p>
<p>So why am I posting it here? As proof of conviction. If you can accept the OP as legitimate, then the usage of a handkerchief, combined with the artwork from Ria Pratt/Kim Noble, should serve to prove that a &quot;pizza related map&quot; definitively means &quot;memento from raping a child&quot;.</p>
<p>The conviction is important. It should wipe away another layer of doubt as to what the secret code in the Podesta email meant. The more convinced you are of a crime, the easier it is to prosecute.</p>
<p>This post, rather the OP\'s courage and bravery, should serve as a reminder to other survivors who might be lurking - we are serious about helping you, even anonymously.  You\'re (collective) knowledge can help us fill in a lot of knowledge gaps, which may eventually be used to help with the conviction of these pedophiles.  Bear in mind, if/when the mass SHTF occurs, the court systems are going to be overflowing with well-funded pedo cases.  If nothing else, our research may serve to help provide convictions or additional evidence or expertise.</p>
<p>Lastly, the OP has been very helpful in providing a victim\'s viewpoint, which is extremely rare. PLEASE be respectful and civil should the OP decide to weigh in.</p>
<p>Relevance: The topic of a &quot;pizza-related map&quot; is central to decoding the meaning and intent behind the &quot;secret code words&quot; contained within the WL Podesta emails.</p>

            Great job writing. Very good read.
1. It is possible "pizza related map" was a typo, author may have intended "pizza related mark", "mag", who knows. Or it was correct.
2. If the cloth serves as  memento, there must be some crossed mason out there that has their own, or has knowledge
3. if the reason is to have prima facie evidence, does any existing court case have both a mason and cloth of this type documented already?

             Hello, not to dispute the possibility (until we have the Podesta DNA soaked handkerchief) that this particular email validates PG, but I hadn't considered it could have been a typo- "mag,"  meaning a pizza/cooking magazine, since JP is known to be an accomplished chief. 
I still think he could someone involved, could be a pedo, but having been on this forum for moths I have seen many theories and claims debunked after really comprehensive critical thinking researchers connected the dots, offered more context and ultimately disproved them, such as cuts on his fingers, the "Fatherhood" video and the 14/fish symbols on his hands (surgeries from debilitating disease and the environment/oceanic preservation work he is involved with). I still think he's an enabler (Dennis Hastert/Bill Clinton/Epstein) and that his brother is prob a pedo, and John P could very well be behind the death of Seth Rich or at least is complicit. and I think James A is def a pedo, prob a CIA asset tied to trafficking and the nepharious nature of the cabal that is Clinton Foundation.

            pathological sexual deviants almost always keep mementos. the survivors are the most important part of all of this - i pray for you guys every day and the thought of you fuels me to continue this fight. i know what it's like to be abused, and then have no one believe you and have everyone laugh in your face. i can't imagine what it must be like to have that x1000, and as a helpless child.

            I have zero knowledge on the matter other than I remember back from the early 80s the cure made a music video in a vacant house up for sale. So it seems those with connections can make it happen.

            I just read that sodomy is believed to open the third eye to "Luciferian illumination" in Masonic rituals and it's also used to create split personalities in children to make them mind controlled slaves. Nauseous now. How can anyone treat another human being like this?

             sodomy reverses the natural flow of energy in the "tree of life" format into the qlippoth "tree of death,"  it is a physical representation of getting "void" essence, the essence of non-existence and non-being, mixed in with "Mother" ("matter" = mater / mater-ix) essence, which creates death and sickness in manifestation....

             This is MK Ultra training exactly for those confused. Sodomy affects the nerve endings at base of spine. When this is done in trauma through force while simultaneously forcing victims to be flooded with lights &amp; images you can split the mind then program it. Nazi's institutionalized this and became masters then it was exported.

               Yes. It happens in the most well known Academic Institutions in the world especially the US &amp; UK. The children are selected "kidnapped" or bred for this purpose. They are nothing more than rabbits in an experiment. They discovered the best age to completely spilt and then lock-in alters is between 2-4 years of age. Many of these little children are placed in labs at birth where various isolation experiments are done to severe any possible experience of humans being caring. Then they are ready for sex trauma mind control. Severe discipline for anyone resisting. No love or support. They become trauma bonded with assailants and lose most if not all empathy. This is the Super Soldier program Max Spiers was exposing before being poisoned and killed last summer.

               These programs are on going as we speak in many underground bases and even well respected academia.

            Thank you for presenting this information in the way you chose. This has been spoken about before and connected directly to the Kim Noble painting in Podesta house where a group of adults encircle a child lying on a square white cloth with a man appearing to rape her/him. Many people on this forum are victims or witnesses. They are often attacked merciless as shills, etc because they provide information such as this in detail. If you are asking why would a child rapist email in code and not just throw the evidence away you are missing the OP truth. These are trophies, souvenirs, that are treasured to them. It is the sickest of all truths.
The courageous victims who are telling the story need full attention.

             how have you been here for this long and you think the Podestas have Kim Noble art in their house?? i've seen you spread incorrect information like this before. perhaps it's time to refresh your knowledge.

              Are you aware of the prominent artists displayed in Podesta house? None of these are art they are the renderings of traumatized victims. Hate to even post but we have to stop this.

               YES i am, and i was aware of Kim Noble long before pizzagate, and it's NOT HER ART IN HIS HOUSE. she is not a famous artist, and she did not make art to sell on the scene. she is an SRA survivor and made art to cope. please, refresh your knowledge and stop spreading incorrect information. you know why that's not helpful to our image.

                I know she is an SRA survivor. I am not new to this either and well aware of this before pizzagate. The point is that her coping skills were purchased and are displayed as "Art "by Tony &amp; at CPP and other places before the emergency paintings happened months ago. 
They are victimizing her again and trying to turn the horror of SRA into "Art"

                This was written by Washington Post in 2004 after Tony @ Heather Podesta had an open house to show off their work. The invitees were very disturbed. The paintings have been posted but many scrubbed. Hanging in CPP were at least two of Kim Nobles work with her name signed at the bottom. One was the child rape scene I described above with the handkerchief and was posted and one was a similar painting of a child appearing to dissocociate during a sexual assault.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kim Noble name is on the paintings. She was obviously used by these people. The very fact her trauma recovery had to do with Tavistock should send chills down everyone's spine.

                  Puget I really believe we are battling against the depths of deprvity now. I know you have personal experience and are trapped in PTSD. Believe me I now as well. 
 I am only trying to help. I have contacts within psychologist circles who are appalled at what is happening.,we have to challenge them which Senator Grassley is now starting to pink up.

                   i don't have personal experience with SRA although my family came close, i've just got experience with your everyday regular child abuse. i mean yeah it's appalling, i clicked the archive link you sent me in another comment and it isn't working. but really, i am almost positive it wasn't Kim Noble hanging in any Podesta's house. i obsessively followed pizzagate for months when it broke and i
                   <em>
                    never
                   </em>
                   saw what you're claiming. i DID witness a poster from CPP that was compared to Kim Noble's art that soon enough was being said to be literally hanging at Podesta's. i'm confused as to how you actually believe this. it almost makes me suspicious.

                 i was here in the beginning of pg. it is not her art. there was a band's show being advertised that had art similar to hers, and the comparison was made and well-circulated. but it's become like a bad game of "telephone" now, and along the way somehow people started believing that Kim Noble's art was literally displayed at those places. it wasn't. can you provide any proof that it was?

                   I think you may be thinking of the artist Biljana Djurdjevic that Tony Podesta has at his house. I don’t recall anyone mentioning him having anything from Kim Noble. There’s nothing about it on his Pizzagate wikis either

                    Keep checking. I have a list of Archived messages referring to Kim Noble as his favorite artists. Then posting of her work as "Art" that these monsters enjoy is nauseating.

                    I posted a seperate thread to Bijana's work which again is obvious renderings of child sexual abuse in torture. I have linked him to Kim Noble but only because he is still exploiting her by using her work. It is disgusting. Will have more to follow

                The out of body experience is represented by the dissociated figures rising above the child.  The essence of MKU programming is to break the psyche of the human spirit.  The backdoor to "us" was discovered and exploited.  it also represents the multiple personalities associated with dissociative identity disorder.

             And as I mentioned in my op, edit 1: Anyone that has a sizeable collection of anything, eventually refuses another such thing.  Specifically, a handkerchief (ritualistic as well as memento), may be of substandard interest to one's collection if it was "just" a black child, or the child had been pretty well used up and was about to be rendered.  Nothing special.  Not worth the 29 cents of postage to some.

              Did the person who survived this brutality mention if the "clean white cloth, often embroidered with Masonic symbols" was the true meaning behind the apron (that not all masons would be told about)?  It seems around the same size as a handkerchief.

               Yeah, and it could have been to blow their noses in.  The hanky code was what the gay community did when they were still in the closet 20 years ago.  Now they just advertise their kinky brand on websites. Or eVite.

                Interesting enough. I didn't know people even still used hankies. Except my 86 yr old grand father. Although the term "hanky panky" does spark an interest to me regarding all of this.

                Yes what most call evidence some call milestone. And as mentioned the "evidentiary" value can be held as blackmail with DNA. In fact it is a required part of initiation so the blackmail is held for as long as needed.

               Sounds legit. This rapist was known as the trophy rapist as he kept an item of the victims clothes as a trophy / prize to cherish.

            If it's a valued trophy why did he forget it then say it's not important enough to mail, let alone burn as a bloody semen soaked hanky (not your bf Hank, a cloth) is DNA evidence.

            You may be right, but it doesn't matter and certainly isn't "central" to the codewords.  Pegasus is the central codeword you fuck and that's why the mods deleted iit.

             since "the jews" tactic didn't work and no one here is fooled by a left/right paradigm, i guess it's now time to create divisiveness via gender and pick on women, who make up a huge part of this board and who have the deepest primal desire to protect children. if i was on the fence about your shill status before i certainly am not now....

                 Info taken! 
It's no longer your business when you decide to join a discussion board though.
I only say what I do because people wont grasp what info you have to input into this community. And I see you have insight for many topics. 
Lastly...I for one take a chance on what anyone has to say regardless if I agree or not. It's always good to be open to possibilities in which one could have possibly looked over otherwise.
I look forward to your post.

            so then the abuser keeps the map, as a memento? so presumably these high level pedos should have collections of these handkerchiefs which would also serve as evidence of them as abusers. Are the police looking for these when they search warrant someone?

             YES - They keep souvenirs, mementos, tokens, whatever.  Serial killers do the same.  (Understand your "regular" rapist may or may not be into it.  It is the "serial" component to it.)  Pedos are much, much more closely related to serial killers.  I would go so far to say that a sizeable amount of "serial rapists" are "serial killers" waiting to happen.  The other are already serial killers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I doubt these people would destroy their collections, the elite, that is.  They probably have them hidden in a safety deposit box.
