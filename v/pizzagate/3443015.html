<p>1: The chicken story.</p>
<p>Shia spoke of a time he got kicked out of a dinner he wasn\'t supposed to be at. This happens to be a Bilderberg dinner, where the host of Hot Ones, Sean Evans, indicates this is &quot;One of those meetings where the Illuminati discuss controlling the world.&quot; Shia agrees, and points out he was kicked out for grabbing a lot of chicken from the spread. Shia says there was billionaires there and namedrops the Koch brothers and George Soros. Pizzagate followers might find the references to chicken and the Bilderberg meeting interesting.</p>
<p>2: Shia\'s standup career</p>
<p>This is talked about briefly, as Chris asks Shia about his early standup career. Verbatim Chris asks: &quot;You described your style as a 50 year old mouth on a 10 year old boy.” Discussion about Shia\'s father as a biker gang member meant noone heckled him so he was never heckled on stage because his father and his biker friends would all laugh, and Shia says if a biker laughs, everybody laughs.</p>
<p>3: I look so sad right now</p>
<p>Shia makes constant stops to the show to stare at the camera, showing off tears and saying things like ”look how sad I look right now&quot;</p>
<p>4: Hot Dogs</p>
<p>Chris then mentions Shia\'s love of Hot dogs. He says that he knows of so many creative ways to have hot dogs. He asks Shia what are his favorite ways of having hot dogs. He mentions cutting them into circles, or corkscrewing them to make a braid. Hot dogs is yet another odd pizzagate reference: well worth reading into with things like Obama\'s white house hot dog order or Podesta\'s hot dog stand.</p>
<p>I\'m a big fan of hot ones, it\'s a good show to peel back a few layers off celebrities under duress but this one seemed oddly telegraphed. I doubt I\'ve covered all the oddity of this episode, so let me know if there is anything I\'ve missed. Just thought I\'d share my two cents as someone who found the wording, cadence, timing and guest very bizzare.</p>',

            </strong>

            <p>
             Stanislavski's system is a systematic approach to training actors that the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski developed in the first half of the Twentieth-century. His system cultivates what he calls the "
             <strong>
              art of experiencing
             </strong>
             " (with which he contrasts the " art of representation "). [2]

            Shia is one of many Sadistic Ritual Abuse (MKUltra) survivors whose programming failed. Most likely because it was not done early enough or they broke his mind beyond use before building him back up for compartmentalized manipulation. Like a manipulator who can pass a polygraph test with ease while lying. That is the goal of a super spy and the reason for MKUltra. Or Kings and Queens of Nations...
           </p>
           <p>
            I still think Keanu Reeves is one because he has the best PR folks money can by. Reeves is most likely the a valuable asset because he can keep control the longest from what I have heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also has Silicone Valley protection which is a red flag IMHO. Would love to know his real blood line, but spooks have all the best tech. Right Vindicator?
