<p>Another user had posted this link to an event held at BloomBar in which one of the guests was DuBeshter. <a href="https://parkviewdc.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bloomingball-final-2-1-2.pdf">https://parkviewdc.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/bloomingball-final-2-1-2.pdf</a>
When looking over the flyer I recognized another attendee at the event was, Joel Bergner aka Joel Artista. <a href="http://archive.is/QdGGK">http://archive.is/QdGGK</a>
who works for Artolution. This company goes all over the world to refugee camps, orphanages, schools, etc. and does artwork with young children. He and Max Frieder are co owners. <a href="http://archive.is/a25XS">http://archive.is/a25XS</a></p>
<p>Both of these guys go around the world to visit these young children to do large murals. <a href="http://archive.is/FcYSH">http://archive.is/FcYSH</a> Where I start to get really bothered, is the artwork selection by the founders of artolution, which is filled with lots of pedo swirls and double hearts. I really think we should look a little into Artolution and these artists who are spending lots of time with these handicapped children, refugees, orphans, etc. Here are plenty of examples of their artwork and pics with kids that I think needs to be further looked into.</p>

<p>There were a few more pics with children that were very odd that I can no longer find, but I think this is something we should look into considering these guys who go to places with vulnerable children, are connected to BloomBar and Dubeshter. These guys could just be really awesome artists who have a sincere passion for children and art, but I think this should still be looked into further.</p>',

              - This child says"bars are prejudice against children". This is a very unusual thought for a child to have. Who put this thought into his mind and in what context? I could imagine an adult trying to groom a child by saying society is evil because it is "prejudice against adult &amp; underage" you know what.

            The submissions regarding BloomBar are immensely valuable. The visual shock value alone will create new interest among

             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            lurkers, and that will be sent forth. Alone, these artworks and photos of kids are a clear cause for concern for any thinking person. (I'm still wondering WHY the BloomBar mural was painted over, from a child, to a child being threatened by a monstrous thing.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then linking BloomBar to Dubeshter to Pegasus to James Alefantis, there's no way that can be written off without explaining the plethora of documented obsession for sex and children, shown in the "art" that high-profile people and businesses collect, support, and praise. We prove relationships between small businesses to charities to low-level public officials to SUPER-powerful politicians in their documented approval, at some level of child abuse, depicted in art.

            No doubt, this website is vigilantlly documented by high-priced lawyers. And, by the greedy, perverted, sadistic, arrogant fucks who have been called out, and the ones who eventually will be. All of them busy destroying, deleting, burning, hiding, and medicating.
           </p>
           <p>
            MSM will never investigate anything  "art." So we have to. Unstoppable

            I searched for over an hour and didn't find anything worth reporting. Those murals don't sit well with me. Spirals are common, but how come these spirals always happen to be the same exact kind? People naturally doodle spirals (I know I do, and my children do as well) and none of them every come out looking the same, in the same direction, in the same length, like these do.

            I think more digging is needed but I have hit a dead end, nothing more I can think of to search.

             Well it was worth a shot. I know I had seen connections to UNICEF and UNESCO, which had come up in other pedo related threads. One of my pics I posted is at a UNICEF camp. Also, looks like on their website, Artolution is a partner with UNICEF and the United Nations. Hmm...I'll see if anything comes up. Thanks again for your help!

            Good find OP. I have some free time so I will look up some stuff right now and see if I can add anything to your research. I think those pictures of him with the kids do look bad, but if those kids are in poverty nations, then sadly cigarettes and beer is not uncommon at all. As bad as it is, they can't just make these kids stop, especially when the culture in the area supports it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can I just say, even if there is nothing going on: There is nothing more obnoxious than a bunch of well off westerners "spreading culture" or "spreading education" to poverty nations?
