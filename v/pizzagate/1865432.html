<p>Well I did some further research on Alex Gilkes, one of the co-founders of <a href="https://paddle8.com/">Paddle8</a> (note the butterflies on their home page)).  There are lots of pictures with his brother Charlie in society magazines but very little information on his parents (seems to be a general theme with Brits). 
This Daily Mail article describes the breakdown of his marriage after 4 years, with his ex-wife saying that she first thought he was gay when they first met:  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3819083/New-York-power-couple-splits-four-years-marriage-wild-ambition.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3819083/New-York-power-couple-splits-four-years-marriage-wild-ambition.html</a></p>
<p>The Gilkes seem to hang around with the younger generation of the Royal family: William, Harry, Beatrice, Eugenie et al.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/interiors-gardens/celebrity-homes/charlie-gilkes.html">In this article Charlie Gilkes</a> describes a New York bar <strong><a href="http://pdtnyc.com/">Please Don’t Tell</a></strong>  where you enter through a hotdog kiosk.   Well, that got my attention.  Then I went to their twitter account and saw their logo: <a href="https://twitter.com/PDTNYC/media">https://twitter.com/PDTNYC/media</a>. A modern take on the Ouroboros.  As I consider the Gilkes and their ilk, privileged airheads, I wondered if the logo was just a trendy occult accident for a vacuous crowd or something more considered.</p>
<p>Well at the Instagram account of the bar’s bartender Jeff Bell, I found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTuMCIIgAXI/?taken-by=jeffreymbell">this image of  John French’s book Art of Distillation, 1664</a>.  This is no ordinary book on distillation.  It’s roots lie in Alchemy and occultism.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_French_(physician)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_French_(physician)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John French</strong> is chiefly remembered for publishing in 1651 The Art of Distillation, a detailed handbook of knowledge and practice at the time, said to be possibly the earliest definitive book on distillation. However, it has been claimed[1] that much of it was a translation of an earlier (1500) German text by <strong>Hieronymus Brunschwig</strong>.</p>
<p>John French was also the translator of <strong>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</strong> in 1651 (original: De Occulta Philosophia libri tres by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, although he was only identified as J.F. in that work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, for example, is <a href="http://imgur.com/a/42QKH">an image from the book by  Hieronymus Brunschwig</a>  which ties in with the bar’s logo.  He was a surgeon, alchemist and botanist.  In those days, medical men also dabbled with alchemy and therefore magic.</p>
<p>And then I came across this article about the science of Endocrinology (hormones) and Sexual alchemy <a href="http://gnosticteachings.org/courses/book-of-revelation/177.html">http://gnosticteachings.org/courses/book-of-revelation/177.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sexual Magic is intensified sexual transmutation.  Through Sexual Alchemy, the alchemist absorbs, transmutes and sublimates the totality of the sexual energy-matter.  The rich and abundant sexual hormones inundate the circulatory system of the blood and reach the different glands of internal secretion, stimulating and inciting our endocrine system to work intensely.  Thus, with intensified sexual transmutation, the endocrine glands are super-stimulated, naturally producing a greater number of hormones that animate and modify the entire fluid nervous system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I’ve been recently researching and posting about the <strong>Child Mind Institute</strong> and their push to medicate children for ‘mental health issues’, I have come to understand that these antidepressants are also interfering with the natural sexual development (both physical and mental) of the young child and teenager. </p>
<p>The sexual drive is related to the creative impulse and survival instinct within the human.  Medications which interfere with these drives have a profound effect.  Some of these drugs can cause hypersexualtization which is just as damaging and also dangerous. One such drug is Wellbutrin and it is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant for teenagers with ADHD  <a href="http://jamesjcrist.com/adhdjjc.html">http://jamesjcrist.com/adhdjjc.html</a></p>

            Concerning antidepressants in children and teenagers, this article summarizes some research that the drug industry has been trying to suppress for decades: the link between fluorinated antidepressant drugs like prozac and spontaneous violence.

             Funny thing is, after finding that article on alchemy and endocrinology, I believe that the alchemists of the past would tell our modern scientists the same thing.  I'm understanding more and more that there is more than one path to knowledge.  Thanks for the article.

            I always like to read the posts where there is actual research being done and connections being found. Excellent post, thank you :)
