            FWIW I posted this yesterday and it got deleted for breakage of Rule 1 AND Rule 2.  But feel free to copy/paste and POST wherever you think prudent -- Twitter, Facebook, etc.   I was just so pissed when I read  that statement blaming pizzagate researchers and "muslim bigotry" for Awan's arrest that I composed the statement below;
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  July 27, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Rebuttal Statement to Imran Awan’s Lawyers
           </p>
           <p>
            As one of the online communities of citizens who have researched pedophilia rings for many months, we resent the implication that Mr. Imran Awan’s arrest is in any way a result of an alleged “alt-right-wing media” conspiracy or “anti-Muslim bigotry.”    For the record, we are not affiliated with any particular political party or media outlet; neither are we so dull-minded as to believe pedophiles are limited to any one ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, or political group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, the Pizzagate/Pedogate scandal first ignited “in the heart of our democracy” as an outcry for law enforcement investigation in the fall of 2016, when WikiLeaks released a batch of over 50,000 DNC emails, wherein some content revealed suspicious correspondences that appeared to be using FBI –publicized code that pedophiles use to communicate. A simple internet search would quickly reveal to discerning individuals why any decent human being would become alarmed.  However, law enforcement officials’ reluctance to investigate –particularly that of the Washington DC Police --coupled with the lack of journalistic investigation on the part of the mainstream media, (who have occasionally lapsed into allegedly “debunking” and/or mocking our concerns), led many of us to research further.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since that time, and because we are justifiably NOT confident in the integrity of the U.S. Justice system, countless hours of online research have ensued, leading to many nefarious associations that strongly implicate that some public officials and/or servants may be, or may have been -- either through their own volition or through blackmailing schemes -- engaged in pedophilia, child pornography, human trafficking, organ harvesting, money laundering, and/or cover-up activities of international and epic proportion.   A comprehensive search of the preceding terms, would reveal substantial evidence to support our supposedly “outlandish” claims, along with MANY examples of previous scandals similar to those we suggest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Frankly, given the plethora of evidence that suggest such shady dealings in the U.S. government, Mr. Awan appears as but one minor character in an A-list pandemonium cast.  To suggest that he has in some way been targeted by pizzagate researchers not only minimizes the nature of our plight, but insults the intelligence of the American public.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we have prevailed in our fight for the unbiased investigation into the aforementioned activities, we too, look forward to examining the very “ugly political and media dynamics that have driven this controversy from the beginning.” Yet as we now live in an Orwellian-like society wherein Thought Police are guised as Mainstream Media “journalists” --who no longer are free to investigate that which runs contrary to their employers’ and advertisers’ interests-- we are not confident that our plight for children, their innocence, and a return to basic human decency will be fought by our politicians or public servants.  We will thus continue our efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sincerely,
Citizens Against Child Abuse

             I must admit that I agree. I started really watching him often because of all the drama when his brother came on the scene. It was entertaining. Then I started seeing how real this was. George has even admitting to working with people within the CIA. I don't know for sure where they are going to lead next or what their final agenda is, but the things George Webb has been saying has been coming true.

             What tripped me out was when he said that things were getting too hot for McCaine and he wouldn't be surprised if within the next week, he either disappears or has a fake death. The next week, McCain is diagnosed with brain cancer. Did you see that?

            For what it's worth, Mark Stein is filling in for Limbaugh (heard him while out for a second), and he was talking about the Awan arrest and his connection to Wasserman, and that reporters are being told not to quiz Wasserman about it. And MSM is ignoring the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stein is hilarious and smart as a whip, love listening to him.

             I LOVE how you guys trust this shit. It's funny how this shit trickles down to FOX NEWS AND SEAN HANNITY and you idiots still gobble it up. Mark Stein, Rush Limbaugh? I'm sure it's real goy, I'm sure George Webb is a real investigator and not a mossad agent. The alternative media is just as bad as the MSM and you guys still trust both! Anyone with an IQ over room temperature is shaking their head and you basic bitch republicans.

              Don't be an idiot yourself. There are varying degrees of usefulness to every public figger. Even MSM. MSM is useful to grasp the main false narrative. Sailors make use of mainsail, secondary, and even behind-sails, to reach port. Critical thinking skills are necessary, the ability to discern, to chew the meat and spit the bones.

              Note how I started my statement "For what it's worth ... "
             </p>
             <p>
              Aside from "Jews own the world and we're all gonna die and all hope is gone," if you would kindly provide some concrete sources to your statements, you wouldn't, in my opinion, have to whine so much about arrows and slings in the way of downvotes.

              Gee, and you thought I wasn't redpilled on the JQ. I just have a different opinion than most on their "rise" and impending fall. I never could stand George Webb either thank you very much.

              I know who Limbaugh is, I have family that eat up his "illusion of choice divide and conquer" nonsense daily. Sheesh, your brush is broad and your assumptions, well, you know what assumptions do.

              Cut me a little slack jack. "Hey Stewardess, I speak Kabbalah." Please give us your answers, ideas, and solutions to ransom humanity from the clutches of the evil one.

              lol I don't think you have a good enough reputation here for anyone to give a damn about your opinion. All you do is post or comment stating everything is disinfo. Come up with something better and earn some credibility, because you're making a fool out of yourself.

               Who spawned Pizzagate and the Seth Rich conspiracy??? WIkileaks, a known intelligence front/honeypot. Thats why pizzagate is drenched in red-herrings and disinformation. It was a limited hangout since day 1. Kosher conspiracy theories trickle down the the mainstream media, not the truth. Julian Assange fanboys should go look up what he had said about 9/11, then get back to me.

                Then why are you in a Pizzagate forum? Just to go off on everyone, call people names and and provide nothing of any value? Are you a shill that just gets off on this or are you on Brock's payroll? Either way, the way you act means nothing to most people here because you have no credibility.

                I know of a couple of other profiles that are really the same person. Maybe there is a 3rd 🤔 All 3 of you have the same weird twisted theories and do nothing but say everything is disinfo.

            Elsagate is an ARG and the Awan thing is George Webb's work and he's a confirmed shill. Seth Rich was mossad and isn't dead he's laughing in Tel aviv at all you faggots who fell for the PSYOP. Oh, and I think they killed the real Swordfish69 and replaced him with a larping homosexual who posted that big disinfobomb a few days ago. He used to do good work and the whole "Warning" thing didn't really sound like him. Millenial falcon is a fag enabling Jew and all of Voat is compromised (or it was a honeypot since it's inception)

                Do you know what Ciccada 3301 is? That is an ARG, so was the whole HWNDU thing with Shia Labeouf. They create a giant labyrinth of disinformation for goyim to get confused in. Even if you are intelligent enough to play the puzzle, it doesn't matter, you're just a dumb ass goy who's attention has been diverted away from real conspiracy theories.

                   Lol, Pegasus guy lives down the road from me. Do you disbelieve he talked to Alefantis? You do know you can overthink things right? I have a wife to keep me straight, but she just calls me gullible :) I'll check out the link.

                    Even if he talked to Alefantis, it doesn't matter. Alefantis was complicit with the Psyop, we already know this after the false flag. Mr. Pizzagate T-shirt man is just another lying ass nigga trying to monetize on the autism. He literally made a video saying "it was fun poking at the elites, but im gunna stop now" then he said support Milo to blend in with alt-right fanboys

                     Really? I can't stand Milo. Ryan though I think was a liberal Bernie guy. Maybe he's changed. I'll ask him, I've been meaning to go talk to him. Ryan's a kid, he will go through many phases and changes as he gets older, we all do. Though what he's doing may be repugnant to some, I don't think he's being disingenuous or dissembling.

                     But to be clear, you're not agreeing w/ Cernovich that this whole discovery of the Podesta emails etc. was a psy op from the beginning do you? And you're not mixing Ryan up with Seaman right?

                      The pegasus video guy isn't a kid. He's a T-shirt swindler in his 30s. When did Cernovich say that this whole thing was a Psyop? and Ryan or whatever Pizzagate T-shirt guys name is he's a shill, and on par with Seaman.

                         Here's where you're overthinking, and you're gonna screw yourself up. He was not "tasked" w/ anything. He's a nobody. He works as a waiter or something similar. He has a girlfriend, he lives a normal life, he's twenty minutes from me. What do you think, he's a CIA asset? I'll go see him and get back w/ you. But it won't change your mind. You hate the guy for some other reason than his t-shirt hawking. It's like that w/ Trump, the hatred becomes visceral, and common sense goes out the window. I'm finished now, talk later.

               I've always been bothered by Assange and 911, not so much the cult thing, but haven't looked into it that much. What is your opinion on Wikileaks and the leaked Podesta emails? You're not going to say it was a psy op to get Trump elected are you? If so that's fine, just want to know your opinion.

                No. Trump being elected is just like a pressure release valve for the (((elites))) to kind of "tai chi" the energy and channel it from their left arm to the right. The pendulum switches from right-left every few years, that how you keep the illusion of democracy afloat. Even if democrats/CNN loathe Trump, it doesn't matter, he's still just another arm of the same ZOG machine. Are the upper echelons currently involved in a war among each other for power? Probably.

                I just want to say that I do firmly believe that Pizzagaters stumbled upon something big, whether it was intended or not. It was meant to discredit rightwingers and further polarize the left/right, thats why youtube algorithms let Pizzagate videos trend online, they wanted it to get out (probably so they could DBA "discredit by association" certain "fringe" elements). Trust me, these people have information dissemination down to a science. They know about every little group,  the factions within those groups, and how the react to certain news. This was truth mixed with fiction, just like the whole Sandy Hook debacle.

                 Thanks for your thoughts. I agree with some of what you're saying. The rabbit hole is so deep, esp info wise, like you say. I do know that the USA is vassal state of you know who. It's obvious if you just open your eyes and suspend biased judgement. etc.

                   Well, maybe not quite as much as donkey, you have a bit more tact. You guys have to understand that if you're gonna be on this forum, there are many people who aren't as aware of certain things. (Not telling you what to do.) You mention anything good about Hitler or David Duke to some people and they think you're insane. Then there are others here who know these things but are discreet about them. I am not being anti-semite but in my biz I refuse to work for a Jew, Pakistani, or a lawyer. It's not worth the trouble. You will get ripped off cause that's just the way they do business, a lot of them, it's in their DNA. But again, there are things that I am aware of but just don't mention them here. The old saying in business was "Don't let them Jew you down." (Now I'll get downvoted.) But I do know you are talking about things on a "grander scale," for lack of better term.
