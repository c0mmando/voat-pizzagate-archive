For those of you who do not know, I was invited into a Discord / Twitter chat by &quot;Elsagate researchers&quot; who seemed to actually be Greg Chism and some friends, who attempted to intimidate me by saying things like &quot;see you at the mill&quot; followed by sending me a link to the Pelzer, SC blogspot for The Finders. See the archive of some of that conversation which I posted to Twitter on November 8, before the channels disappeared about a week later. <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/928483081215934465">https://twitter.com/i/moments/928483081215934465</a></p>
<p>The twitter account that invited me in had a bunch of MK ultra crap on his page and later removed it but it included pictures of toilets with poop and a bunch of other blurry looking images that were more than likely put through some kind of weird filter. That account is <a href="https://voat.co/user/craigslistyugi">@craigslistyugi</a></p>
<p>I was told that they would be making their communications more secure in the future. A couple of days later, Chism took down his channels and all the Elsagate channels started coming down, around the same time that Google\'s CEO Eric Schmidt resigned.</p>
<p>I have yet to see any mainstream article mention Lisa Irwin although they referred to a missing child investigation. They don\'t give credit to any of my articles or any of you on Voat who also covered Toy Freaks in the past even though we all know that\'s where all the work for this investigation came from. I even saw one article online that mentioned a man who reported stuff on Toy Freaks to the police who wanted to stay anonymous, yet they failed to ever mention my name even though I gave it to several different agencies and law enforcement / CPS people. </p>
<p>I don\'t have time for a write up on the Wikipedia page at this moment, but if anyone feels like contributing to that page to make it more accurate, be my guest. Save your screenshots and archive your work so we can see how they edit it out if that does happen. </p>
