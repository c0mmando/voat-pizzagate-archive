His \'procurer\' had trafficked Fadil (known as Ruby) from the Middle East to Berlusconi. She was set to give evidence against Berlusconi.  Her testimony in the past had helped convict Berlusconi of \'child prostitution\'.  She has written a book and I think had found a publisher. These are some of her answers to questions in an interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This gentleman is part of a sect that invokes the devil. Yes, I know I’m saying something strong, but it is true. And many others know this.</p>
<p>They know what?   That continuous obscenities happened in that house. A sort of sect, made up of only women, dozens and dozens of complicit females.</p>

<p>She saw the girls in a sort of circle, with Berlusconi at the center as a pivot: A kind of adoration, with some nude, others half-naked, and others disguised, wandering through the underground living room.</p>

             Let's say I have many clues. In that room where Bunga Bunga was held there was a small room with clothes, all the same, like tunics, about twenty or thirty: what were they for? And then there was another small underground room with a pool, with another room next to it, totally dark, with no lights. An underground pool and a room without lights? Why?

            I think she was given the name Ruby Ruby Heart Stealer or something goofy like that. Another underage girl from the Middle East. Same as Zahia Dehar the girl trafficked young to Paris and sold as a sex salve to the elite and some famous football players. Celeb fashion photographer Ellen Von Unwerth took pics of her underage. Zahia is now older but still works undercover as an elite escort in France, also doing fashion and some French mainstream films. One can only image the shit she’s seen with French aristocrats.

            I have some  items on Berlusconi on my 971 blog on posts about Naomi Campbell.  The reason is she has a private islnd just  like he has and their stories mirror each other.

            Is this the same girl from the ME that was all over the news for being at his Big Birthday Bash?  There was much news about her age. The girl I am thinking about well, I also came across her when researching a hotel in LA that was being renovated. There was a post on this hotel in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            last year.

            </a>
            would know bThis girl also had connections to Roberto Cavalli the famous Italian designer who owns some clubs. Caballi has Berlusconi connections as well and he will open a venue in the LA hotel. We were researching Children being trafficked in the post. Just a thought. If anyone has info regarding this please post.

              I'm not reluctant to submit both parties are corrupt, but Trump is nowhere near this tier of sadism in my mind. Still a worthy mention, knowing who's connecting to who, and it check out they're both big tycoons.. Keep 'em coming.

               I think if there is anything to this search for dead bodies story (on his island) it will explode.

               But the articles are in Italian.  So help needed.

            I dined with one of Berlusconi's friends when I was in Pisa backThe 2000s . Now I wonder, did I break bread with one of these people? The opulence was staggering he owned an entire building on the Arno. He had Uncorked about 12 bottles of wine. A very lavish affair.

              This was back in 2003-4 I was on holiday in Italy. I met up with an environmental activist friend who was giving a lecture at a university in Pisa. As we were both Americans he invited my wife and I to attend . Then we were invited back to this guys house for a dinner. In fact let me email my friend right now to see if he remembers any more details.
             </p>
             <p>
              He owned vineyards and olive groves and hit on my wife the entire evening. He uncorked 12-14 bottles of wine and made a point telling us about how special each was multiple vintage from his own vineyards. He cooked a special fish in water- it was delicious. Then after we were ripped drunk we left and drove to the tower of Pisa. That's all I remember the large apartment was in the baroque style. Very flamboyant.

               Fantastic details, man. I'd probably be quite hazy too if I drank that much. Any small anecdote is great as I usually keep it in memory somewhere among the million stories, but you never know what comes out relevant later, of course 99% never are. Coming from a user directly, it is especially invaluable; not many people know media tycoons by even four degrees. Thanks for sharing!
