            A TARGETED killing of a man in Anna just happened. Yesterday, this was the quote about this killing in the press:
           </p>
           <p>
            The motive is unclear, but it's believed to be a targeted act, not random, Caponera said. Investigators identified Jenkins as a suspect after multiple interviews, police said. 
"Anytime somebody moves from another area, you always got to question what baggage they're going to bring with them," Caponera told KTVT-TV (Channel 11). "And clearly in this case there was some excess baggage brought with him, and we're left to deal with it."

Last night we went to Braums in Van Alstyne, Tx (the one we always go to)... As we were ordering our food there was a guy standing off to the side against the wall waiting for his food and kept staring. After we placed our order my 5 yr old daughter and I started to head to the drink fountain machine and I glanced up as we started to walk at the man against the wall and he had his phone pointing down at my daughter as if he was taking pictures or videos of her... We walked over to the machine and my husband came up right behind us after paying and I told him what was going on... The man grabbed his food and drink and hurried out of there before we could even say anything.. I was pissed last night about the whole thing and woke up at 3 in the morning thinking about it.. I keep playing it over and over in my head and it brings tears to my eyes thinking about what I should of said/ done, or what could of happened and even wondering what if he followed behind us when we left to see where we live.... This world is a crazy world and you can't trust anyone! I wish I would of snapped a picture of the creep and plastered it all over FB! I wish I would of said something/ made a scene but for some reason I kind of was in shock and froze.. I feel like such a bad mom! No matter how old/independent your kids are keep your eyes on them and everything around them and make sure you educate them on the things that go on in the world.. I ended up calling the VAPD today and a officer went to Braums and watched the footage and said something definitely looked odd, recorded the footage and got a picture of the man but said that it's not illegal to photograph anyone in public!! I then asked if I could get a copy of the picture or video and was told he wasn't able to do that because we would be liable for slander! Just a reminder to everyone, always be vigilant!
