<p>BOCA RATON, Fla. -  The Diocese of Palm Beach is reacting to that sweeping grand jury report accusing hundreds of priests of sexually abusing scores of children for decades in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>On Thursday, WPTV spoke with one of his alleged victims.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel validated, finally feel validated,&quot; said Judith Collins, who is now 66-years-old.</p>
<p>After decades of pain and agony, Collins said she finally feels like she\'s receiving justice. She still lives in Pennsylvania and claims she was sexually abused for years by MONSIGNOR THOMAS J.  BENESTAD,  who currently lives in Boca Raton. Collins claims the abuse started when she was nine-years-old and lasted for decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Myself, my former husband and my daughter will never step foot in a Catholic Church ever again,&quot; Collins said.</p>
<p>BENESTAD is one of some 300 priests named in the grand jury report.</p>
<p>For years, Collins said she blamed herself, but in 2005 she said she reported the alleged abuse to law enforcement. She said she filed a police report, reached out to abuse advocates and spoke with the Pennsylvania Attorney General\'s Office. </p>
<p>BENESTAD and his attorney have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Charles Manson probably said the same thing, I didn\'t expect him to say anything else,&quot; Collins said.</p>
<p>BENESTAD relocated to Boca Raton in 2007 after a medical leave and assisted at Ascension Catholic Church on Federal Highway in Boca for two years. On Thursday, the Diocese of Palm Beach said he passed background checks, and it wasn\'t until 2011 they received word of the allegations and he was ordered to refrain from all forms of Catholic ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The man belongs in prison, and I understand they are getting a lot of calls in Harrisburg of people just coming forward, it might happen,&quot; Collins said.</p>

            Joy for those victims whose painful stories of abuse have been vindicated. Sorrow, too, as we come to the realization that  we have fewer and fewer spiritual institutions to combat Islamic terrorism and the growing epidemic of Satanists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evil not only took over the Vatican and its priests and bishops, it celebrated with the serpentine/reptilian design of the Grand Audience Hall at the Vatican constructed in the 1970s. There are many videos  available describing this  evil monstrosity.  The only thing lacking in that building is a placard  proclaiming "Hail to Satan" .  Should you have Catholic friends or family that persist in defending the Church, show them a video and ask them to justify this House of Horror.

             Oh it is only the older ones and I will not disturb their thoughts.  They are late 80 &amp; 90.  There is no point to upset their last years.  It is the younger ones that worry me for I am in their corner on staying away from church, but not away from God.  They are doing both.  Very sad.  I hear talk from friends about their kids and they are upset.  They will win if we cast God aside.

            I just read through her other voat post. WOW. Blown away by the level of depravity and sickness these people have in their heads. Beyond sad but also infuriating and maddening. If only the world really truly knew about this we could all go into these places and these tunnels and bury them and destroy what these people have built out of their evil. Do I believe her testimony and account of what happened? Absolutely 110% I do. I’ve heard things from others along the same lines. These purps cannot be rehabilitated they are too far gone. I wish we could build centres for survivors for free counseling, help, guidance and give them a place to feel vindicated. Thank you

            Thanks for this, Carmencita. I hope Judith is doing alright. It must be devastating dredging this all up. I hope the path leads to Rome and Bergoglio.

             Knowing her now, as I do, I think it is more exhilarating than the other.  Although yes, it does dredge up very bad memories but that can happen at any moment.  This is Vindication and hopefully leads to Justice.  She is doing fine and thanks everyone for their prayers.  She says she will never will enter a Catholic Church again, but she has not abandoned God.  People should understand that.  I too have not donated or attended Church for many years but too continue to pray.

               Other than being ok, she is exhausted.  She needs many prayers right now so that she can keep pushing for her final path to Justice.  I told her that everyone is praying for her.

                  I see things are racheting up regarding the Grand Jury investigations in other states. New York will be HUGE, if it happens. I hear people calling for all the US Catholic bishops to resign. Wow. That's what happened in Chile. The whole bishops' conference resigned.

            Oh my ! What a vindication! Happy tears over here!  😊 I just made my family listen to this and told them how you took a personal interest in this woman and offered her great support and now she is finally vindicated ❤️ And how these past 2 years have been worth all the pain and tears to be able to help ( wether it’s just listening or otherwise ) ones like her . Hugs to you and Judith !

             I am tearing up.  Yes, I am so proud of her.  There is more to come I hope.  But he has been named on other sites and in the Report as well.  I want him taken down.  Thanks for Sharing with your Family.  The more SRA is shared the more we win in tearing down their propaganda against it.  He not only raped her as a child, but came back decades later and did it again, just to let her know who he is.  Did that stop her?  NO.  It only Emboldened Her.  She is My Inspiration.

             I dont understand why more Catholics are not demanding charges be made to Police
            </p>
            <p>
             when people put themselves above mans law, and religious leaders  interprets Gods law to suit themselves, how is it that people can even look up to them
            </p>
            <p>
             How many priests have been able to abuse more children after getting busted abusing before?
            </p>
            <p>
             and the amount of these Priests are quite alarming
            </p>
            <p>
             now the Vatican is trying to pull away from the responsibility of these priests
            </p>
            <p>
             Judith and others like her are hero's in my book
            </p>
            <p>
             to continually fight this injustice, so others do not suffer should be applauded
            </p>
            <p>
             and yet the good ones let them get away with it
            </p>
            <p>
             bad times are upon us, never realized just how bad the brainwashing has taken over everything
            </p>
            <p>
             cried yesterday and crying again today

            <p>
             Think its time Gods people rise up for God's laws

             had 3 yrs with the Bible has a class

              I too have cried.  Cried for sorrow and Cried for happiness for Judith.  I wrote in one of my comments that the day The Report was released God had tears rolling down his face.  Well, he also had Tears of Joy for Judith yesterday.  He was happy for her too.   As far as people not coming out to the police and pressing charges.  First of all they have to overcome the shame and then they have to know that the police many times protect the priests.  It comes from High Level Orders.  This news has been passed from one Victim to another.  There almost has to be a Class Action Lawsuit against the priest.  That is very hard to achieve.  The Church knows this.  But i believe that things are turning and will keep turning.  We have to keep posting and spreading this to our friends and relatives.  I have sent The Report and articles to many.  I only received one answer but I know the others will read it.  Remember how painful it will be for others to read it.  It's hard for us and we read it everyday.
             </p>

              Yes, Judith is A Hero.   She is My Inspiration.

                I agree.    I think Charles Manson and Benestad are cult leaders.  Benestad was abusing the children of cult families.  He was the alleged leader of all of them, ino.   See my DM.
