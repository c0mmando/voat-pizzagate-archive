            Last year two Australian gay men were arrested and charged with the rape of their adopted son since he was 6 weeks old to the age of 14. The child was born via surrogate in the 3rd world. so fucking sad.

            Surrogacy is a means for a pedo female or male to circumvent a willing father/mother to put their children into pedo rings. Most normal families will not allow a child to be sent to a pedo ring, even if one parent is a sick fuck.  Remove the "normal" parent and you got a backdoor to providing pedos.

             Very curious if you have a source for this other than the wikileaks email that was very strangely trying to get rid of beanie babies so his parents didn't find out. If there are other examples of that phrase referring to child sex slaves then it would really validate our concerns.

            I hate to even consider the possibility, but it is a valid one. I listen to and read Russ Dizdar (he works exclusively with satanic ritual abuse victims). He said that he has run across several cases where perps impregnate their victims to use the babies (both prior to and after the birth) for ritual sacrifices. Now that I think about it, Dizdar may be able to provide some great input to the investigation. I will work on trying to get in touch with him.

            I saw a true crime show on YT recently about an Eastern European surrogate mother of two boys who abducted them and returned to her home country. It was about the efforts of the two "fathers" to get them back. She said that one of the men was very sick mentally and she abducted the boys to protect them. The "sick man" was not even the bio father of the boy the surrogate bore for him. Neither of these men appeared to be married. The boys are extremely effeminate. It was obvious that she had acted as a surrogate for two gay men and then decided she had made a terrible mistake. But all the comments were from people celebrating the men getting their boys back. At the end, the "sick" one was shown showering his 4-year-old boy-toy with passionate kisses while the child tries in vain to swat him away. It was sickening, even more so the comments since not one person appeared to notice the obvious - that something horrible was going on here. I will try to find it if anyone wants to see it.

             I posted this under the video on YT so thought I'd include it here as well -
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspect both those men are child predators. Bob Pfeifer was investigated by the FBI. His former wife before Maria testified against him and admitted she was a long-time prostitute (beard!). His lawyer in that case had the last name of Hummel, by the way - first name not mentioned in the article I read. I tried to figure out what the trial was really about but it is highly obscured by the media reporting, obviously covering something up. Good guess it involves child trafficking and pederasty though. These things are protected at the very highest levels. Who was Pfeifer's former boss who accused him of drug abuse? That's what I'd like to know but the media doesn't say. The other Hummel, the one Maria claims is sick in the head, is shown showering unwanted affection on his boy-toy who isn't even his biological son (35:45). This woman acted as a surrogate for gay men desperate for their very own boys to play with and then realized she had made a terrible mistake. But of course, no one in this godforsaken country is on her side. I guess I'm the only one who can see that the relationships between these men and boys is obviously sick. It's perfectly obvious that Pfeifer and his "son" (if that's even his bio son) are lovers.
            </p>
            <p>
             2:07 "guess what? nope!" (you know what we do at night)
            </p>
            <p>
             22:40 child almost embraces him as a lover before realizing he's not supposed to do that in public - does that look like father/son or lovers to you?
            </p>
            <p>
             23:13 yuck
            </p>
            <p>
             23:17 lovers - he brushes his hair away and leans in to kiss the bared skin before realizing he's going to far in public (if that's even possible in this country anymore).
            </p>
            <p>
             I just skipped through it but there is are many more obvious clues.﻿

             If you watched the show then you know the way it's presented is that this Slovakian woman fell in love with these two men (first Robert Pfeifer and then Larry Hummel), bore them both a son, quickly thereafter fell out of love with and divorced both. Pfeifer was involved in the Pelicano wire tapping trial and was investigated by the FBI. His lawyer's name in that trial was Hummel (doesn't mention the first name) -

             </a>
             Have you ever heard of anyone named Hummel? I haven't. Maybe this lawyer Hummel set up this surrogate with both his boy-loving nebbishy brother Larry and his boy-loving client Pfeifer.

            Elio Di Rupo
           </p>
           <p>
            Elio Di Rupo French: [eljo di ʁupo]; born 18 July 1951) is a South Italian Freemason politician. He is the Prime Minister of Belgium, and leader of the Socialist Party (PS). He became Prime Minister on 6 December 2011 and heads the Di Rupo I Government. He is the only openly gay leader of a European Union country.
Background and early life
           </p>
           <p>
            Di Rupo is the son of two Italian immigrants. His father was born in San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore in the region of Abruzzo.
Pedophilia and Homosexuality
           </p>
           <p>
            In August 1989, Di Rupo had been pulled over by two cops in Bergen. He was accompanied by two boys of age 12 and 13 in his car, who had their trousers pulled down. In 1996, an official report concluded that the case must dropped, "considering the reputation of Mr. Di Rupo." [1]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1996, at the time of the Dutroux affair, Olivier Trusgnach, a male prostitute, accused Di Rupo of having sex with him while he was still a minor.[2] This accusation could have meant the end of his political career. Di Rupo denied the accusations and was judged innocent. However, it is unclear if he was truthfully innocent since he's arguably the most influent man in Belgium. From that moment he has never hidden his homosexuality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Laurent Louis, member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives and anti-pedophile activist, has said on Twitter that Di Rupo had been seen in Brussels night clubs accompanied by teenagers between 16 and 18 years old.[3]
           </p>

            Note that Kate Middleton has never been pregnant either. It goes back centuries that the Royal family have used surrogates.

             This is the first I've heard about Kate Middleton. I looked it up. People say she looked too good or that her stomach was still just as big after leaving the hospital. That's just opinion. Every woman is different and of course she will look her very best. What makes you believe that?

              I don't think so. My wife's had 3 babies and her stomach was still huge for a few months after birth.
