            Surely you understand that this is a Trump hot piece because they are desperate? Obama and Clinton used Cambridge Analytica but funnily enough NYT and Channel 4 are not linking them. Don't forget Channel4 are the same people that whitewashed the Muslim grooming gangs in Rotherham and Telford

            Didn't the NYTimes and LATimes both recently do stories about how we can't believe videos because "they" can put "anyone" in a sex tape fraudulently?
Now its "Trump is a purveyor of blackmail porn"?
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds more like folks are working on new angles to discredit videotapes they are afraid of.....
           </p>
           <p>
            New York Times.  Deep State Central.  And, like a piece of shit on the sidewalk, its also drawing all the NeverTrump flies.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook just banned Cambridge Analytica because they believe it used Facebook data to help the Trump campaign; mad because they only wanted to use Facebook data to be used to help the HRC campaign.....but Facebook has to worry about antitrust busters now....see what happened to their stock today?
            <br/>
            This is retaliation for the fact that Facebook has it's thumbs on the scale and is looking at real restraints being put on its monopolistic power.
This NYTimes story helps the deep state, pedo apologists (by attacking a potential source of expected revelations) and monopolists like FB and Google whothink they have the right to bend public opinion while censoring stories (like Pizzagate) they don't like.

            Pizzagate is about pedophilia and this has nothing to do with pedophilia.

             then you only have half an understanding of what Pizzagate is about. A primary MOTIVATION for the targeting of children is their utility for blackmail / coercion. This factor reinforces the Secrecy and the Loyalty of the pedo-mafia

              As the poster, its your job to make it relevant to pizzagate, you didn't do that. A post about sexual entrapment is not pizzagate. Its related, but not pizzagate or pedophilia. I understand how it relates, but this story is not directly about pizzagate and you didn't provide any information about how its relevant in your own words.

               The intent was to offer another smoking belch of tiresome NeverTrump "Trump is a pedo enabler" trolling.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cambridge Analytica was accused by Facebook of mining their data for electioneering....which Facebook wants to monopolize for Liberal Democrats.
              </p>
              <p>
               The charges are being discussed here because the folks offering them are hoping that readers, being ignorant of the facts regarding Trump's "connection to!!" Cambridge Analytica, will be influenced by NeverTrumpism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Except that Cambridge Analytica is Robert Mercer, the billionaire who supported Ted Cruz through virtually the entire primary, then switched to Trump in late Summer 2016....
              </p>
              <p>
               Yet nobody is accusing Cruz of being a pedo-blackmailer.  Just Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               And Facebook charged that Cambridge Analytica "misappropriated" their data between 2014 to 2016.....So....I guess Trump TAUGHT Mercer how to entrap pedos?  or....Trump learned the pedo-entrapping game from Mercer as the 2016 election commenced?
               <br/>
               The establishment has been indulging on a 2-years-long Two-Minutes-Hate against Trump.  Who in the hell is he blackmailing?
              </p>
              <p>
               Its too stupid to contemplate seriously.  Still, attacks on the leaders of the political movement that can bring Pizzagate actors to justice are ultimately designed to wound them politically....which reduces their ability to get after those pedos.  So defending Trump and the Trump coalition politically is necessary, every time I see it.

                  Yes, I've read it all. I don't like and agree with everything. What you say is nothing new.

                 <p>
                  Yes I knew of "TIES". Lots of "TIES". Not much more than that. But yes, I do know.

                  When Trump blocked the TPP and Paris Agreement, that is action against the NWO. Thats evidence. Thats not Hopium. Its what crazed Anti-Trumpers ignore. Why ignore when he blocks the NWO? I don't ignore your points, I knew about them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And who says im relying on anyone to save me? You make things up out of thin air, so why would I believe your crazed anti-trump stance?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I love working to better myself and control my own life. I bought 13 books last week to just that. I could've read the PDF version, but I love supporting authors and reading a physical book.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I run multiple business and have a great life. Thats why I like Trump, hes an alpha male that takes control and makes shit happen.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm so happy and blissed out because I control my own life. You should try it.

            Disappointed? I've known all along that Cambridge Analytica was the PR team for Trump. Hell, the CA shills are all over this forum, pushing their pro-conservative "Trump is gonna take down the deep state!!1" propaganda.
           </p>

            Hopefully this wakes some people the fuck up here, Trump is not going to "save the day" for us. We need to organize and do that ourselves.

              I still say that, if they had something on Trump, then they would be blackmailing him.  The CIA and FBI would not be at war with him.  Comey would not have been fired, either.

              I think they are pushing this narrative because of the HRC video that might drop.  They want to condition the public to believe it is fake or a dirty trick of Trump.

            Everybody cheats.  It's one thing to entrap an asshole with a whore.  It's another thing to BTK and then render children at an industrial level.

             You are aware though, Blacksmith, that adult women from Eastern Europe (and elsewhere) also get traffficked and are forced into prostitution? Also at an industrial level.

              True that. It's just never okay. If this is true it's very disgusting and disturbing.
