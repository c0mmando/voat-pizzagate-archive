<p>00:00 to 1:13 - I cover James Alefantis friendship and connections to Maccobys family who had important jobs on child orphanage from which child traffickers took children - Bill Clinton intervened to help human traffickers. And their lawyer was human trafficker himself ...</p>
<p>1:14 to 1:53 - I cover connection of James Alefantis specifically to Nora Maccoby and her friendship with victim of satanic ritual abuse ring, since 1991 ...</p>
<p>1:54 to 3:45 - I cover people who designed and built Comet Ping Pong, Scott Cummings, Joe Wills, James Alefantis and Justin Barrows. Their deviant social media posts, use of pedophile language, interest in pedo bands, their physical presence on adoption day event and interest of the whole crew in it, and even admiration for Clinton.</p>
<p>3:46 to 4:19 - I cover how Comet Ping Pong and other businesses close to it used symbology very similar to symbols used by pedophiles, and also there are some other strange coincidences on that street ... including Clintons presence and their partners who claim to combat child slavery on Haiti. Or bookstore that hides it in plain sight ... with very coincidental &quot;sale&quot; + &quot;children&quot; words written inside of it, with co-owner of bookstore mailing about child trafficking on Haiti in addition to all of that. James Alefantis asks John Podesta if he wants &quot;big or small dinner&quot;, he knows John will read at Politics and Prose.</p>
<p>4:20 to 4:43 - I show Bill and Hillary Clinton nefarious connections to Epstein. Including Epstein supposedly being co-founder of Clinton global initiative.</p>
<p>4:44 to 6:26 - I show John Podesta connection to Bill Clinton and on basis of that I dive into emails of John/Tony Podesta and show how they\'re connected privately to occultist Marina Abramovic with whom they plan blood rituals and then show how Marina Abramovic has herself connections and strange coincidences around topic of human trafficking and suspicious activities with children which includes: Marina Abramovic connection to Naomi Campbell ( Epstein\'s Black Book), John of God ( Brazilian baby trafficker ), Allison Mack ( before she is arrested for being in sex slave cult she outs Marina ), James Alefantis ( admires Marina publicly ), Ghislaine Maxwell ( arrested for child trafficking, present on lunch in honor of Abramovic, together with Abramovic )</p>
<p>6:27 to 7:00 - I show how Biljana Djurdjevic who creates art depicting victims of pedophiles admits she takes inspiration from seeing victims of pedophilia, back in 2007, and also how she was at list for fundraising event as listed in John Podesta emails, back in 2014. She also has access to private profile of James Alefantis on Instagram, and he is following her as well.</p>
