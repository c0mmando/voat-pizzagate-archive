            I have wondered this immensely myself.  One thing I think we should keep in mind,  is that those symbols  released by the FBI were in 2007. In the past 10 years I am sure much more has come to light, as they have investigated and prosecuted 1000s.  Would it be in their best interest to release all their known code words to the public?  Probably not.  The pedos would then change their lingo and make tracking more difficult.  I'm not sure why they released the symbols in the first place.

            I made this exact same post a while ago:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1508904">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1508904
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And then I made this post:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1511391">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1511391
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The conclusion was that there was no source for any of them being known pedophile code words, except cheese pizza.  Some people pointed to urbandictionary but none of those words are in there defined the way pizzagate defines them or even as terms to do with pedophilia.

             the word associations magically appeared on 4chan on nov 3 shortly after people became aware of there being a code.  People say the list was generated by reviewing the darkweb.  there is no dictionary you can buy on amazon for this.
            </p>
            <p>
             the replies you've got don't give anything definitive, but I didn't follow the links to all the channels that are dedicated to this.  not yet.  Given that this list is derived from diving in the dark web, I'm not sure how I'd know if I saw something definitive, or what that looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
             i think we can break out two issues.  one - is there a code begin used?  two - is that code the pedo code?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the probability is there is a code being used.  I say that because of the strange way they use the words.  sometimes it reads ok either way, but other times it's really difficult to read it without assuming there's a code.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for issue two, i point to comet ping pong's instagram,  Podesta associating (good friends) with convicted pedophile.  the plain non-code language used in some emails.  to me, these favour the pedophile code.  maybe the code isn't entirely accurate, but it seems to be in the right direction.
            </p>

             thanks for the links!

              I am totally willing to believe that those terms are pedophile code words. I just have never seen any evidence for them and I think it is irresponsible to state them as if they were fact with evidence for it backed up simply by a 4chan comment.

               But if there was, would it be any more trustworthy than anything else we've got?  The FBI symbols is something to work with since it seems to be in use.  And it's supposedly from the FBI.  But the code?  That's a tough thing.  It might be group specific, it's not like pedophiles are born knowing this code.  that's rhetorical.  Likely the code changes frequently.

               We do have a pictoral guide from Jimmy Comets instagram account.  I think we can assume that food items and words have taken on a sexual meaning, and a pedophilic one at that.

               Perhaps John Podesta will explain exactly what is meant by dominos on cheese and pasta?  I'm afraid it's been two months now and all he's had to say is that Russia did it.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point, I think we're entitled to fear the worst.

            Some may have it a bit mixed up, the code words have been floating around for quite some time on 4chan, usually /b/, but can be found elsewhere.
The FB has only released the logos.

            Podesta 29 and 30 dumps were filled with strangely worded emails with references to cheese, pizza, ice cream, and hot dog stands. 
Some Podesta emails seem really strange until one recognizes these code words common to child sex rings and pedophiles:

              As for the codes, I have never seen any mentions of sauce, walnuts, maps or ice cream. Probably worth noting that I'm not a dark web lurker, though.

             Would be nice to have some screenshots, so we can y'know, ground our investigation in evidence.  The only one I've been able to find is for "cheese pizza" meaning child porn.  And cheese on urbandictionary as meaning a female/sex.

              I have never been on the DW, but I have a close friend who is a consultant for elites who want access to dark data and encrypted devices.  He confirmed this coding based upon his experience.  Not 100% of these terms, more like 75%.

               Interesting. We need proof, though.  I know at least some of the sleuths on here know a thing or two about the dark web.  One of them got a screenshot of someone in a pedo forum acknowledging the trend of using pizza places as pedo fronts.

             That was my understanding too, until I tried to confirm it.  I have been unable to find an FBI or a wikileaks source for the code.  the symbols, yes, but not the code.

            This is just a best guess by whoever made that infographic that mentions these. Fact is, we don't know anything definitive about the code.
There is something to be found on gay scene handkerchief code, but we only got one handkerchief in the emails.

            Good question.  At least some of these (walnut, for example) were discovered to just be from someone doing guesswork on 4chan.  We have yet to find actual sources for any codeword other than "cheese pizza" meaning child porn.  "Cheese" is listed in urbandictionary as referring to women or sex, but that's all I've been able to find.  Any autists have links?
