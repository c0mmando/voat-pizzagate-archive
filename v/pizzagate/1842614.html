<p>Interesting from the article and something I had never heard before...</p>
<p>&quot;Did you know that Queen Elizabeth was actually convicted on February 28,  2013 in the disappearance of ten native children from the British Columbia Catholic Kamloops residential school on October 10, 1964? Pope Ratzinger resigned from office that same day on February 28, 2013. So, how does the Queen retain her title and stay out of prison? Pope Francis’, Pope Benedict’s and Queen Elizabeth’s use of a Vatican agreement called “Crimen Sollicitationas”  prevented release of information to legal authorities for prosecution of crimes against an estimated millions of priest child abuse victims. A Vatican source claimed to ITCCS’ Kevin Annett that Queen Elizabeth signed the document with Pope Benedict on September 16, 2010 at Holyrood Castle in Edinburgh. Evidence pertaining to the Feb. 2013 international court could be found in Annett’s “Hidden No Longer”  and at Child Abuse Recovery.&quot;</p>',

            More about Ratzinger. Credible sources in this post:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1836101">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1836101

           <p>
            Ratzinger was named by this survivor as being part of human hunting parties and ritual torture and murder of children:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1800676">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1800676
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He also avoided prosecution in a sex abuse case by claiming "diplomatic immunity" (because the Vatican is a country with it's own currency central Rothschild bank, intelligence services etc.):
            <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pope-seeks-immunity-over-sex-abuse-suit/2005/08/17/1123958097061.html">

            </a>
            NB: Pope Benedict XVI was the first pope to resign in over 500 years, and the first to resign voluntarily in over 700 years. We might well ask why.
           </p>

            The obligatory red shoes:

           </p>
           <p>
            The document Ratzinger was responsible for is called Crimen Sollicitationis (it's written in Latin). It effectively silences those reporting pederasty by clergy no matter who they are, as well as the victims themselves under pain of excommunication. Excommunication for a Catholic means eternity in hell. Even, nuns and priests who reported pedo clergy were not only defrocked but excommunicated. Source:
            <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crimen_Sollicitationis">
             http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crimen_Sollicitationis

           <p>
            Although articles, as on Wikipedia (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis))
            </a>
            )) say it is no longer in effect, the fact is by all accounts including their own in the same referenced article, it was simply replaced with another (secret) one in May of 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            This document came into the public consciousness due in part to media coverage of the pedo scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interviewed for a television program in 2006, canon lawyer Thomas Doyle described the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure [of investigating child rape, etc.] as "an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy, to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen". This is a quotation from a (an ironically) BBC documentary on clergy sexual abuse in Ireland. While periodically removed from vimeo and YouTube, here is one I found today:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIAYouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIAYouTube
            </a>
            This is important because the it is this show which made Crimen Sollicitationis known among the general public.
           </p>
           <p>
            This document has been used in American cases (which have been won to the tune of billions so far) against pedo priests.

             https://ozatheist.wordpress.com/category/crimen-sollicitationis/
            </a>
            This document came into the public consciousness due in part to media coverage and the priest pedo scandal.

            This makes so much sense to me about Princess Diana now.  How she seemed happy at first, then the downward spiral, helping child victims of landmines and then being offed when she tried to leave that family.  She knew what was going on and couldn't stand it.  I guess helping kids made her feel better.  They made such a big deal about her passing but I know believed they killed and in their classic psychopathic fashion they put her on a pedestal after her death to hide their dirty hands in the affair.

            , I am flairing this "Accuracy in Question" due to the fact that the "court" has no standing or authority, and Kevin Annett's methods have been repeatedly debunked here.

            This is Kevin Arnett's ITTCCS BS and should be avoided at all costs.

            Not sure if the ITTCCS has any legal or statutory authority. I don't believe they do albeit there is truth behind this story. Something happened in 2013 when the new Pope was placed in office after resignation  of Pope Ratzinger. For the first time a Jesuit Pope was placed as Pope this was first in history.
           </p>
           <p>
            This effectively allowed the royal family and all Jesuits which is most of the world leaders including the US to fall under papal law with Pope Francis being judge &amp; jury &amp; sentenced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very disturbing. Of course in the US they are bound by the constitution but if they are out of the country they might have some backing. Also curious is the fact the Knights of Malta a very secretive order that also has its own dipolomatic immunity, &amp; can issue passports, have a secret island resort, members are names such as Kissinger, Clinton, Bush got into a public spat with Pope Francis after Trump won.
           </p>
           <p>
            The public spat (fight) was over the use of condones which is ridiculous that they would make this public.(unless it was kabooki theater). The end result was the Pope took control of the Knights of Malta over some stupid condom issue after more than 100 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was done live on television as the Pope removed the headdress of the Knights leader &amp; took control as the US was in turmoil after the election and Podesta emails had spurred the pgate investigation. The Pope was busy calling us ( the researchers of Pgate shiteaters &amp; other pejoratives for  fake news) 
At the same time he was able to take control of the Knights of Malta.
           </p>
           <p>
            What was incredibly interesting was George Webb series was simutaneouly showing actual evidence, paper trails etc. of the Knights of Malta involvement in money laundering, trafficking, &amp; worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the Knights &amp; the Pope seemingly start some "Kabooki Theater" to place them under Papal law which gives power to be judge &amp; jury and protection.
Very interesting. Research Knights of Malta for more info.

              It can be abbreviated either way, (though paedo is normally the UK variant form), but both spellings mean the same thing, whereas Seville and Saville do not.

               I was referring to your mis-spelling of Savile (not our cultural differences of the spelling of paedo/pedo) Mr Spelling Policeman.  It's SAVILE as in Sa- VILE (a good mnemonic)
