<p><strong>I\'d like to make you aware of the tight crowd supporting it:</strong></p>
<p>It was founded in 2009 by Barbara Garber-Neidich, a jewelry heiress, and Dr. Harold Koplewicz.  He is formerly of NYU Child Study Center from which a dozen more fellows were subsequently poached, causing a public spat.  Random example seems fairly prominent:</p>

<p>“Aron Janssen, MD, is a <strong>child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in gender and sexual development...He has presented nationally and internationally on gender variance/non-conformity in childhood and adolescence</strong>...He is a Clinical Assistant Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the NYU Child Study Center and director of the NYU Gender and Sexuality Service.”</p>

<p>Craig Hatkoffs sister <strong>Susan Patricof</strong> is a CFR member and an &quot;overseer&quot; for the International Rescue Commission (which resettles “refugees” in the West).  She married <strong>Alan Patricof</strong>, founder of <strong>APAX Partners</strong>, one of the world\'s biggest private equity funds, who is a longtime Clinton friend even invited to Chelsea\'s wedding.  He was also appointed by Bush then Obama to head a federal foreign aid organization (i.e. his discretion determined countries’ eligibility).</p>
<p><strong>His kids:</strong></p>

<p>Jon Patricof (born 1973) is an American businessman and current president of New York City FC.[3][4] Before joining New York City FC, Patricof was President and Chief Operating Officer of Tribeca Enterprises which oversees the popular Tribeca Film Festival, Tribeca Film, and Tribeca Cinemas.[5]</p>

<p><strong>Jamie:</strong></p>

<p>Jamie Patricof is a co-founder of Electric City Entertainment, a production company based in Los Angeles.....He is married to former model Kelly Sawyer, who was born in London but raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

<p>Sports, Weinstein Company movies = kikebread and circus.</p>

<p><strong>Mark</strong>: entertainment lawyer/investor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There\'s a story that Mark Patricof likes to tell about the time he was in St. Barts with Nicole Richie and Jessica Alba — &quot;I swear this isn\'t name-dropping; I\'ve been friends with them a long time&quot; — and their husbands.

<p><em>(Nicole Richie is a PG cult baby, goddaughter of Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, raised by Lionel Richie -- notice the only black people implicated in PG are entertainers and activists, the very same few blacks who interact with prominent Jews, who of course demonstrably run the music industry. Nicky Hilton married a Rothschild too.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Duane Patricof</strong> also makes movies, i.e. is a worthless human being.</p>
<p><a href="https://wldimages.findlaw.com/images/1525297/2845066_1.jpg"><strong>Bruce Hatkoff</strong></a> is a blacksmith by trade.  LOL no he’s a debt-collection lawyer.  
</p>
<p>These proud Jews have a genealogy website; be warned that pursuing them on that basis will in fact make you a “racist” and detrimental to uncovering Pizzagate occultists.  LOL!</p>

            I looked into this place about 9 months ago and when you start down this rabbit hole looking at what is affiliated there were a bunch in CA that were for poor kids in LA, etc. Also one place for pregnant teens that they give free pagers to to notify them when they go into labor. Convenient, huh?  Twisted fucks.

             A second theme reflected in the everyday language and figures of speech of the homosexual collective is its absolute fixation on youth and its extensive lexicon connected to the seduction and molestation of young boys by adult male homosexuals. One example should suffice.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the heading chicken , defined by Rodgers as "ayoung recruit; any boy under the age of consent,” we find:
            </p>
            <p>
             • chicken freak— elderly man with huge appetite for young roosters. 40
            </p>
            <p>
             • chicken house— coffeehouse catering to young homosexuals too young for taverns. 41
            </p>
            <p>
             • chicken plucker— man who enjoys "deflowering" young boys. 42
            </p>
            <p>
             • chicken pox— urge to have sex with younger men, a mid 60's term. 43
            </p>
            <p>
             • chicken dinner— sex with a teenager. 44
            </p>
            <p>
             • butchered chicken — boy who recently lost his anal virginity. 45
            </p>
            <p>
             • gay chicken — a homosexual teenager. 46
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many other similar references I could cite, but videtur quod non/ 47
            </p>
            <p>
             Some readers may object to my inclusion of this reference to pederasty in a book on adult male homosexuality and judge the commingling of these issues to be prejudicial at worse, or an unnecessary and unwarranted distraction at best. I disagree.
            </p>
            <p>
             Adult homosexuality and pederasty are not mutually exclusive — either in terms of individual behaviors or the homosexual movement. 48

             Chicken as a Gay slang term was originally used when the Age of Concent was much higher. As high as 21 in some countries, so anyone under that age was chicken or jail bait. The use by Pedos is almost an expropriation / joke. Like when Alfantis refers to a very young boy as Chicken.
