<p>Horrible story. A sex ring in Telford England was allowed to operate with no interference. This even though authorities were well aware of what was taking place.

<h1>Britain\'s \'worst ever\' child grooming scandal exposed: Hundreds of young girls raped, beaten, sold for sex and some even KILLED</h1>
<p>Up to 1,000 children could have suffered in Britain’s worst known abuse scandal - where sex gangs targeted girls as young as 11.</p>
<p>The rape hell of vulnerable young girls in one town - Telford - went on for a shocking 40 years, the Sunday Mirror can reveal.</p>
<p>As many as 1,000 children could have suffered at the merciless hands of perverts and torturers in Telford since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Girls as young as 11 have been lured from their families to be drugged, beaten and raped in an epidemic that, say victims, is still ongoing.</p>
<h1>======</h1>
<p>Despite similar high-profile cases in Rochdale and Rotherham, authorities in Telford ­repeatedly failed to stamp out a network of abusers.</p>
<p>The Mirror’s 18-month investigation reveals abuse on unprecedented levels. We found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social workers knew of abuse in the 1990s but police took a decade to launch a probe</li>
<li>Council staff viewed abused and trafficked children as “prostitutes” instead of victims, according to previously unseen files</li>
<li>Authorities failed to keep details of abusers from Asian communities for fear of “racism”</li>
<li>Police failed to investigate one recent case five times until an MP intervened</li>
<li>One victim said cops tried to stop her finding out why her abusers had not been prosecuted because they feared she would talk to us</li>
</ul>
<h1>======</h1>
<p>One 14-year-old, groomed and abused after her phone number was sold to paedophiles, said: “I hated what was happening and my abusers made my skin crawl but I was told that if I said a word to anyone they’d come for my little sisters and tell my mum I was a prostitute.</p>
<p>“Night after night, I was forced to have sex with multiple men in disgusting takeaways and filthy houses.</p>
<p>&quot;I must have been getting the morning after pill from a local clinic at least twice a week but no one asked any questions.</p>
<p>“I fell pregnant twice and had two abortions. Hours after my second termination, I was taken by one of my abusers to be raped by more men.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst moment came just after my 16th birthday when I was drugged and gang raped by five men.</p>
<p>&quot;Days later, the ringleader turned up at my house and told me he’d burn it down if I breathed a word of what had happened.”</p>
<h1>=======</h1>
<p>Our probe – backed by documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act – found two predatory paedophiles began targeting girls from a local children’s home in 1981.</p>
<p>One of the abusers earned thousands a night for years trafficking girls around the country for sex with hundreds of men, according to one victim.</p>
<p>In another case, a 14-year-old was groomed by an 18-year-old Asian man in 1985.</p>
<p>After she had his baby he passed her to friends to have sex with and allegedly rape her.</p>
<h1>======</h1>
<h1>The girl, now 47, says she reported her abuse to the council and school but does not believe action was taken.</h1>
<h1>She says her doctor said she was mentally ill and should take medication.</h1>
<h1>========</h1>
<p>A mum and four girls have died in tragedies linked to the abuse.</p>
<p>Lucy Lowe, 16, was killed in 2000 along with her mother and sister after her 26-year-old abuser Azhar Ali Mehmood set fire to their house.</p>
<p>Cabbie Mehmood targeted Lucy in 1997 and she was just 14 when she gave birth to his daughter.</p>
<p>He was jailed for murdering Lucy, her mum Eileen and 17-year-old sister Sarah.</p>
<p>But he was never arrested nor charged in connection with any child sex crimes over his illegal relationship with the schoolgirl.</p>
<p>Lucy’s death was used as a warning to other girls, according to victims. One, drugged and gang raped by nine men two years later, said the threats drove her to attempt suicide.</p>
<p>She said: “I was scared my family would die like Lucy’s. I thought they’d only be safe if I killed myself.”</p>
<p>In 2002, 13-year-old Becky Watson died in a car accident that was reported at the time as a “prank”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go ... collusion and an active cover up where victims were blamed and shamed ... and put on medication because they were crazy. The question is why would the authorities allow this? The answer? Money and a bond in the form of a cabal. </p>
<p>This is worldwide, folks. We know this, but this is more information that can be used to red-pill non-believers. </p>
<p>This has to be rooted out.</p>',

            Operation Hydrant

           <p>
            Operation Hydrant was set up when it became apparent that Forces around the country were investigating a significant number of non-recent allegations of sexual abuse involving persons of public prominence or within institutions. There was a risk that investigators were looking at the same individuals and institutions and it was also clear that officers dealing with these complex cases required support and guidance.

            Political anonymity
           </p>
           <p>
            So as of December 2016,
 97 politicians are under investigation over allegations of child sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, in February 2016, MPs (all apart from one – John Mann) voted to change the rules so that now they are entitled to remain anonymous unless charged with a crime),
           </p>
           <p>
            then there should be special rules put in place to ensure that any MP being investigated must not be allowed to have any involvement in setting out recommendations when it comes to the law surrounding child sexual abuse and exploitation, and nor should they be allowed anywhere near schools, nurseries or children’s wards until such time as they are cleared of any wrongdoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If 211 suspects are in tv, radio, film and the music industry alone, what measures have institutions such as the terminally bewildered BBC put in place to protect children, particularly as many now have dedicated children’s channels?
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigations? What has happened?
           </p>
           <p>
            And where are the arrests?  Where is the action? 
 Yes, we get thrown the odd small-fry (albeit important that EVERYONE involved in such crimes are caught and punished), but it’s simply a case of placating the masses whilst still protecting the bigger fish.
           </p>
           <p>
            The figures above are abhorrent, and no doubt a vast underestimate of the true figures of those involved in paedophilia.
            <br/>
            There are probably many more who are still too frightened to come forward because the behaviour of a select few stokes their fear.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are in January 2017 and 3,469 people are currently being investigated over allegations of child sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            By December, when the next set of statistics are released, how many convictions will we have seen and how many of those will include the ‘prominent few’ who are seemingly still so untouchable?

           <p>
            They sure are investigating, but that's all they are doing
I can imagine the count for 2017 
we are just as bad
           </p>
           <p>
            Victims are coming out, their stories need to be told, and their abuser/s need to be locked up
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a big joke that makes me so sad

             Thanks for this. It's agonizingly sad.

            <p>
             But it is a wake up call for people to get active and demand police, politicians, and anyone else involved be fired. This is about not accepting this carrying out of an agenda anymore. Call, write, demonstrate, and vote out anyone that goes along with this status quo. What are the politicians doing about this? If the answer is nothing, then rally and lobby for them to act.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to get organized. The side we fight is organized, so we have to be also. There's no relying on someone else, we ourselves need to become the change we seek.

            Ah our wonderful Asian community doing what they do best. Political correctness and community 'cohesion' are to blame. Even where I live in England 30 years ago you'd see them hanging about the school gates in flash cars trying to lure girls in.

            I have to say good on the Mirror for reporting this, but its literally nowhere to be seen on other UK outlets. I knew England was a hotbed for this stuff just as much as the USA and this pretty much confirms it. What a shit hole i live in

             I'm so sorry, but your eyes are wide open and that's good. It's the catalyst for change.
            </p>
            <p>
             And other news outlets not covering this is another example of what I was talking about when I mentioned organization being our new frontier.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we were unified, we could all hammer the other outlets and ask why this story is not being covered. Shame the journalist for not covering this. Also follow up and hammer the police in terms of what penalties the police covering up this case will face. This way, we can't do that. We're splintered. Yes, we all care about this story, but we're not a cohesive force. The police involved in this cover up should be charged with criminal offenses, and again, if we were a unit, we could pressure the authorities to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a global problem. We have awful, disgusting, perverted monsters in power. They're driving this cart because they're all working towards their goal of a NWO where this will be the norm. If we don't want that kind of world, we have to use this glorious opportunity handed to us by the release of those emails. It's why I'll always feel indebted to Assange.

            Hi guys almost 1am here so will read and reply properly in the morning. I know Tommy Robinson is pushing this hard. And the whole Islamic agenda.

                EDL, Britain First etc were created by the MI5 Subversive Groups Division, to control and redivert emerging dissident groups. At best, they are Zionists.

               <p>
                Tommy Robinson even claims that Africans and eastern Europeans never commit crime in the UK, and only Muslims ever do anything wrong. What a joke. He's nothing close to actual British nationalism.

                Sorry man but foreigners needs to stop their pathetic attitude towards Brits. I can't single-handedly stop anything bad happening anywhere on earth. Not to mention Americans, Canadians etc doing f*ck all when their countries are totally Satanic from top to bottom. I'm not a magician or Jesus.

             <p>
              As the guardian of Britain’s border security, Blair chose as Lunior Immigration Minister a woman who seemed to retain an acute sense of her own Jewishness while having a great enthusiasm for eradicating White British identity.
Roche, a staunch enthusiast for all things LGBT, is the daughter of a Polish-Russian Ashkenazi father and Sephardic Spanish-Portugese mother.  She told The Independent “My being Jewish informs me totally, informs my politics. I understand the otherness of ethnic groups.”

             prior to this Jewish entertainment conglomerates like MTV debased Britain's youth, without which they would never have been in a position to be "groomed" and prostituted.

             Did you read the article? It says there were problems "outside of underage discos" -- a phrasing that indicates young girls going to drug and alcohol-fueled dance parties is accepted behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems this situation could have come about even without the elite pizzagate cult, which is not implicated anywhere in this thread yet.

            NB: 'Asian' in the article refers to men from Pakistan. Police and MSM (like the BBC), and even MPs have accused those  who tried to talk about the child trafficking gangs of being 'racist'.

            In Rotherham, those who tried to address the issue and worked for the local council were even forced to take part in 'Racism awareness trainings'.

             They use "Asian" instead of "Muslim" because they protect Muslims in this country and they also like to be careless with words to confuse the audience.  E.g. when the media say a young child was a "child prostitute" or the child was "sexually abused/seduced by" instead of raped.

             Corbyn also did his best to cover up the Islington Children's Homes Abuse scandal in the 90s which took place within his constituency (Islington North), denouncing fellow MP Geoffrey Dickens for attempting to expose the abuse taking place and has consistently refused to answer questions on the subject.  One of his staunchest supporters, Naz Shah (MP Bradford West) said that English girls (upwards of a million it is now estimated) who have been raped by Pakistani paedophile gangs should keep their mouths shut, "for the good of diversity".  To the best of my knowledge, Shah has not been expelled from the British Labour Party nor deselected, so Corbyn's credentials as a paedo protector/cover-up artist cannot be impugned at this point.

             Here is where getting organized and having a network would help.
            </p>
            <p>
             We simply have to get organized. It's the biggest problem we have. Look at how the alt-left has networking down to a science. They never say, "Soros paid for this demonstration or boycott or whatever." Instead they say, "Some random housewife who never did anything in her entire life got fed up and started this boycott that has now burgeoned into millions of followers without any help from globalists with deep pockets." Or they have a usual suspect PedoWood alumni chosen to start the movement.
            </p>
            <p>
             This mother would have been majorly aided if there'd been a network of activists ready to take to social media and hammer away at why nothing was being done. Organization is the next frontier.

              I agree.  The 9/11 "truth" movement was fractured to prevent a meaningful outcome.  There should be a "sanctity of childhood" party to develop a platform for protecting our most vulnerable from our most predatory.  Use a better story to defeat a corrupting story.

             Prof Kelly said: “

             Sheila Taylor, of the NWG Network, worked on the Rotherham Inquiry. She said the true scale of the Telford problem might never be known because many victims were unlikely to come forward.
            </p>

             She said: “There is probably a whole cohort of young people that are not identified.

            In and around Newcastle, another British town, there have been 700 victims who were raped and forced into prostitution by grooming gangs - and these are only the ones we know of.

            <p>
             Grooming gangs abused more than 700 women and girls around Newcastle with “arrogant persistence” after police appeared to punish victims while letting the perpetrators walk free, a case review has found.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report into the response by authorities to child sexual exploitation found that before a large-scale police operation was launched in 2014, officers’ actions were sending an “unhelpful” message to perpetrators.
            </p>
            <p>
             It warned that abusers are still preying on girls across the UK, and called for urgent action from the Government.

             Again, it really is a concerted effort that follows the same MO. People act randomly so when they all act in a coordinated fashion, it's because it is coordinated.

             Yes, about these being the ones we know about. We need to follow the same reasoning in dealing with rodents, and that is, if you see two rodents, there are hundreds more.

            Two words: Freemasonry and European Royalty.  Ok it's three words.  This is planned.  It is known as "The Kalergi Plan:
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1922 he founded the “Pan-European” movement in Vienna, which aimed to create a New World Order, based on a federation of nations led by the United States. European integration would be the first step in creating a world government. Among the first supporters, including Czech politicians Tomáš Masaryk and Edvard Beneš and the banker Max Warburg, who invested the first 60,000 marks. The Austrian Chancellor Ignaz Seipel and the next president of Austria, Karl Renner, took the responsibility for leading the “Pan-European” movement. Later, French politicians, such as Léon Bloum, Aristide Briand, Alcide De Gasperi, etc will offer their help.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was even written in book form:
In his book Praktischer Idealismus, Kalergi indicates that the residents of the future “United States of Europe” will not be the People of the Old Continent, but a kind of sub-humans, products of miscegenation. He clearly states that the peoples of Europe should interbreed with Asians and colored races, thus creating a multinational flock with no quality and easily controlled by the ruling elite.  (notice as a Royal he was aware of the United States of Europe in 1922).
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the 3rd City in England to have the identical horrific situation which has gone on for decades with the Police fully aware,  but afraid they might be called racist. Racist for stepping in to prevent the serial rape and multiple murders of innocent children?!  Yeah......right.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is deliberate and planned.  It gives another tiny glimpse of the horrific monstrosity that must be dismantled worldwide.  And it gives a purely clear view of the power structure that actually fosters and encourages all of this.
            <br/>
            It's just one more piece of the huge puzzle.  And it shows what they count on being the untouchable status of those promoting it with such callous disregard of being discovered.  The storm ahead is going to be a big one.

             I'm afraid it isn't the 3rd city, but the 30th something city. And I'm only talking about those we are aware of due to trials. Rochdale and Rotherham are those that stuck in memory, but there have been numerous other cities with the same issues.

             <strong>
              trafficking of girls 
there still continues.

               Rotherham Child Exploitation Scandal
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal has been described as the "biggest child protection scandal in UK history".[14] From the late 1980s until the 2010s, organised child sexual abuse continued almost unchallenged by legal authorities in the northern English town of Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was first documented in the early 1990s, when care-home managers investigated reports that children in their care were being picked up by taxi drivers.
             </p>
             <p>
              From at least 2001, multiple reports passed names of alleged perpetrators, several from one family, to the police and Rotherham Council.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first group conviction took place in 2010, when five British-Pakistani men were convicted of sexual offences against girls aged 12–16, but the ringleaders remained at large

              I accept that it is more than thirty.  I'm not in the UK,  and there have been three that have made a big enough splash in the media to make it onto my radar.  I would not be surprised at the # of 300 or even more as it is clearly pandemic, planned, and supported by the power structure there.

             The most important thing this has going for it is that it is documented. While the DNC emails are crucial lynchpins, there is wiggle room for conjecture as to what the purpose was of throwing children into water actually means. This article and story doesn't leave those types of openings.

             It's why Bannon is on the warpath and telling right-minded citizens to not let the name-calling stop them. As decent people, we don't like the flinging of abhorrent names in our direction, but these are schoolyard bullies we're dealing with. Schoolyard bullies grown up and so much worse.

Just a week prior Bryant was meeting with Dr Cunningham Dacks of the Australian Branch of Tavistock!!!!!

              They don't use "patsies." The NATO false flag method has been exposed. A group of about 30 perps from the police, court system, forensic teams, masonic "eye-witnesses," army photographers, and Reuters/AP journalists, work together to effectively make the entire "event" up. They also have carefully-placed business owners to provide "CCTV footage" of the so-called villain. See the website cluesforum for more detailed information on how they do this.

              It's not just the men, women must take responsibility too.  No, it's not easy.  But I remember a constable or police captain coming out and saying there are too many pedos and they can't lock them all up.  When you have the police coming out with statements like that then what are the people to think?  That the police are caught up in the cover up and many are guilty themselves.  This calls for serious measures.  Yes, here as well.   But when you have schools such as Eton and others of the same ilk with men taking it upon themselves to believe they have the right to continuously abuse boys just because it must stop.I just said yesterday, that Americans have become wimps.  We no longer have protests or get out into the streets. Please do not take the whole mess on your head alone.  It has been going on for decades and decades here as well.  We all own this.

              Trisha, I'm afraid that's BS. As long as you don't slander anyone, you wouldn't be arrested for handing leaflets out in the UK. You just can't make baseless claims. You need be careful with the wording for legal reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, considering the UK is "mind-bending" central (most of you guys don't even realise that murder stories are made up all the time in the UK, or the Manchester attack was a false flag etc), we still don't know the truth about this stuff. Not to mention, the idea that child predators are on every street corner in the UK is totally BULLSH*T and part of how this whole PSYOP works.

              Arrested for what?  No names should be exposed or mentioned.  This would just be a pamphlet stating obvious facts.  Percentages in increase regarding the rape and abuse of children.  Mentions of the chief that said there are too many to jail.  Mentions of arrests things like that.  No names unless they have been convicted.  I don't think they would have a leg to stand on if these things have been made public.  It calls for Smart Tactics.

               I have just been looking online to see if there is anything going on here regarding grooming protest etc., I can across this post, which I had not heard about or seen on the news, not that I watch the news much.  But looks like this group is trying to make people aware, but looks rather like s oros. antifa type are opposing! Other person who was trying hard to bring it to the fore was TommyRobinson

                The socialwarriors are there to make whoever they attack look like the insane crazies, not them.  They just have to grow numbers. but remember to not get violent and crazy.  They haveto put forward some really good programs, like  signs attacking right now the Charities.  Charities combined with abuse against children.  Imagine some really good Meme Signs within a march.  The events they have can have different subjects each time But always featuring the children.  As soon as they sound too crazy they will lose their power and antifa stargs looking like the same ones.

                We really should ping people when we see a shill.  An army of pings and every one must come.  Come and down voat them.  They quickly pull out when down voated.

                  Yeah, if they come.  I will never forget when I was attacked by about 4 or 5 Jew hater shills regarding a post and I pinged a bunch of people to help out and no one came.  Not one.  Really made me wonder what the true feelings of others on here really are.

                   Many great folk, but some are here for the sake of morbid curiosity. Very few can actually grasp the scale of monstrosity that is taking place as we speek. And I bet if I were to show the horrors of Podesta's dungeon through magic mirror, these trolls would be first to faint. I doubt that 95% of the PG crowd are fully aware of what is taking place. Just look at the mug of that JA creep, does he look human to you (allegorically speaking), now remember Jacke Tapper's Wive's favorite dining place? Or how about Megyn Kelly interview. It's a club! Every Media personality I see, every Congressman, FBI agent, Police Chief....I picture them in Hostel type scenario and see if they fit in. Paranoid?! Sure, but Podesta emails are real, and not a peep fron CNN or FOX. And what is Muller (possibly part of it!) doing? Bigger question is, what is Sessions doing?! Going after medical marijuana.

                    Paranoid?  Not imo.  Mueller is another hold off on progress and yes Sessions is another obvious procrastinator.  This is becoming as plain as the nose on your face, actually.  Everyday it screams louder and clearer.  Some just will never see it.  I am a former Hope-ium Believer so I have been there before.  Eyes Wide Shut must be Opened.

                     I will give Trump another year but if at the end of 2018 there is still silence on Podestas emails ... that is it. We'll know that only William Coopers prediction of Civil War 2 can change things. Things have gotten so corrupt that it is a cesspool! Completely out of hand! Hillary's Campaign Manager openly meets with a satanist Abramovic and shows off occult symbolism (fish &amp; 14) on his creepy bony palms Hillary voters are ok with this?!!!

               What would be needed are local support groups for survivors. People that would raise awareness and lobby the local councils to show that residents really care about these girls (and boys).
              </p>
              <p>
               I think too many people still play it down and think when a girl has worked as a prostitute, she must have volunteered to do it. They don't realize that girls are threatened and in a downward spiral of shame and feeling helpless.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also - many local men are johns, of course, and don't want these crimes to get exposed.

                Yes, and boys will be boys.  This must stop.  Also, even when not trafficked, some girls and women are so destitute or homeless or have to support children.  They are then exploited or really have such low esteem that it is the first way (because of others in their family) they think of to make money.  Homeless or Destitution is how they can be driven into prostitution.  But now yes, trafficking has become a huge business for the greedy criminals.  Cartels are also getting into this business.  Yes, the most important thing these girls need is support.  Support that is constant. Support that will take them through all the steps to recovery.  We have AA for Alcoholics why not an 12 Step Program for Survivors as well.

             Yes, they wait until a pedo is dead to expose his crimes. It's their form of bragging, but it seduces the masses into thinking the fake news are actually reporting and that the authorities are on alert and will take action the next time around. No, they won't.

            <p>
             There have been numerous stories about the British police being infiltrated and run by the Freemasons. It's the global cabal that needs to be weeded out. And prospective officers need to be asked and investigated for involvement in this cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's time to get real. This cannot go on. This is our chance. It's a miracle that this was given to us, so let's make the most and shine a bright light on these crimes.

              Just a few months ago there was a MAINSTREAM article in the Herald how the Freemasons were against policy changes in the UK police force!!!!! Yeah .... it's a conspiracy right? We have to create an Ostrich meme. Anybody who utters the phrase conspiracy theorist will be bombarded with Ostrich memes .... perhaps invent a nice name that rivals Pepe the frog??? It's cognitive dissonance run amok.

               Great idea.

              <p>
               It's good imagery and delivers the point. Simplicity is key. One of the best memes I've seen is one used in a Pedosta reply.

                I)  I love the ostrich meme with its head in the sand!  I say to my husband all the time you have 'ostrich syndrome' .... If you can''t see it it does not exist!  It is a very British thing....mind your own business type of thing', its in born..........I took my 2 year old grandson to the doctors last week.  He sat on my lap while the doctor used the stethoscope on his chest and back. He literally flung his head back and closed his eyes the whole time, I laughed with the doctor and said, oh no he takes after his grandad, he has Ostrich Syndrome!  ------  2)  I think now while this story has broken and the eyes are all on the royals etc, exposure of some high profile pedos would be the perfect time to red-pill the nation.  (Prince Andrew connections to Epstein was quickly hidden).  Honestly, people are too afraid to say anything, the politically correct thing is so rife here now, and you get attacked/ashamed verbally by the press etc., that people remain quiet.  But believe me all us ordinary people are sick of this and have the potential of rising up.  I thought it was going to happen once and for all when Operation Yewtree was implimented
                <strong>
                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yewtree
                </strong>
                but they take so long to dribble out information that people get lethargic and it buried once again.

            This confirms Pizzagate is real, doesn't it? Nobody who has read this article can claim that it is a mere conspiracy theory.

             Confirmation of the existence of pizzagate?
            </p>
            <p>
             No because of what is located within the start of this "investigation" has zero ties to this event. What it does show is that there are bad people and they are being brought to justice. Well what we consider justice, but personally I would rather they be brought to a firing squad and all of the shot until dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you list one time in which the civilian investigation has been publicly recognized by law enforcement or even the courts in prosecution? I mean there has to be at least one time where a cop admitted they got help from all of this work right?

             Absolutely. If it had been a sex ring operating under the radar without the authorities being fully apprised, it wouldn't be.
            </p>
            <p>
             But this article documents and demonstrates a willful cooperation and collusion with authorities that included the police covering up known crimes. Even the media was involved in not reporting the facts.
            </p>
            <p>
             And this is where the Royals come in. William enlists the aid of the astonishingly beautiful Kate Middleton to distract us from the evidence and keep up the facade of England being a jolly good place to visit. Now there's the beast Harry enlisted failing to do her job, and so we're paying attention to all the attacks, the unlawful imprisonment of Assange, the unlawful imprisonment of Pettibone, and these types of organized heinous crimes against children.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is something going on ... it's global and real. The sooner people wake up to this fact, the sooner we can deal with it.

              - your statement on voat about you is confusing -   “ I am a Hyper Violent Sinner. My Violent Lust. I Love Pleasure &amp; Pain. My Gemini Vampire Valkyries. ” -  why on earth would you have this sentence to represent you? Are you really on voat because of your concern for the children?

             By not using this type of terminology.
            </p>
            <p>
             Language is important and legitimacy is gained by not using such inciteful words. By suggesting violence is the way, you only worsen the problem and give these monstrous authorities the right to clamp down on everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             The real answer is networking and being organized. It's all these monsters have done. They're not smarter, braver, or stronger. They're only organized. Think bee colony. You attack one member, they all go after the intruder. The same with this. If a mother or father reports their daughter was raped and groomed, and the police fail to act, there should be a network that tweets, demands, demonstrates, and publicizes the cover up. Name names and turn a spotlight on the darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's the only thing they have over us. We're just not organized. We haven't sworn an oath to some heinous God that demand the blood of children. We're doing this because we're individually moved to try to help. But no calls for violence ... ever.

              After a long absence from Voat, I'm noticing more shills on here. Their technique are:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Inciting violence or rioting, or "taking your country back"
2) Blaming everything on Brits
3) Ignoring the relevance of NATO, UN, Vatican, freemasonry and pushing shills like Britain First

               You sound like the shill here. Heath was noted for being a cottager in the '60s, Private Eye and Scallywag printed numerous satirical pieces with regards to his fondness of young boys. Next you'll be saying Leon Brittain wasn't a paedophilic, old Jewish bastard.

               Yeah, there are. It's what we went through with Presidio Day Care and McMartin. That was the peek behind the curtain, but no one wants to believe this is really happening so it was easy to get the genie back in the bottle. With the advent of those emails, no more. We're awake and not going back to sleep.

               If a mother or father reports their daughter was raped and groomed, and the police fail to act, there should be a network that tweets, demands, demonstrates, and publicizes the cover up. Name names and turn a spotlight on the darkness.

              This networking is already happening on Twitter with pedo account reporting and banning of conservatives. I wonder if we could start something here with a specific name -- make a thread outlining the plan with the how-to that we can share, with links to the stats and evidence people can use to support their personal stories, resources on how to report, rules like no calls for violence to avoid falling into the hands of the manipulators. Voat is great for this, because TPTB have not managed to censor us effectively.

               You could even have twitter accounts post their accounts so people will know who to RT and network with. List other accounts of YouTubers who can interview and/or get the story out.

               Yes, that's a good idea. We'd have to find out whether there are already networks of parents in some towns (or nationwide - but then I haven't heard of any).
              </p>
              <p>
               I think providing a network for parents is essential. Although a certain proportion of the targeted victims have been living in child care homes. The question would be how to establish local help groups of residents.

              My Ma took in a woman and her kids who had a dad in prison. He got out and went straight for our house. The lady was trying to leave with the kids screaming in her car. He grabbed her hair and was trying to drag her out the window. Ma ran into my room and grabbed my bat. She hit him in head and dislocated his jaw. Problem solved, and she is 5' 2" tall. He was lucky my stepdad pawned all our guns. We don't normally wait for the police in Florida.

               Understood. But the game changer is the authorities. They are obeying the directive and will put the good people defending themselves in prison, and let the molesters and violent predators out.

                Oh, I understand that. The part I don't understand is why anyone would allow themselves as a society to be so helpless. I went to elementary School in Texas. Everyone was packing. Every truck that did not have full display in the gun rack had them behind the seat. You were allowed to drink a tall boy and drive with no insurance. People were still very respectful of others, and stealing only happened in the city. These people are being terrorized by their own government just like certain places in America. If someone was to take advantage of my child, there would be an unfortunate accident for someone, or more, even if I could not legally carry a firearm. Were I a cripple all I would have to do is tell a family member or a friend. It seems to me that they have successfully broken the family unit over there.

                 What do you think this whole agenda has been about? They've been actively and willfully producing snowflakes. And it's not just kids. II mean, what the hell adult stands there and screams at the sky. Think about it. What would it take for you to participate in that? These people are incapable of thought let alone handling a problem. It's why they're throwing conservatives out of coffee shops on the rationale, "This is my safe space. You have to leave."

                <p>
                 Oh, yeah, right! Suuuurrrreeee I'll leave! Because you can't handle or tolerate someone holding another opinion, I'm not supposed to use commercial space open to the public? If anyone wants to know if fascism combined with propaganda works, just look at this curent scenario. It's the clash of the walking wounded, little birds who BELIEVE their wing is broken but actually isn't, and able-bodied people who think that you can do anything if you try. The alt-left has CRIPPLED their followers. I mean, CRIPPLED. And there's nothing wrong with being physically crippled. If that's what you are, that's what you are. But these are people who are not physically crippled but need a crutch, and safe spaces, and screaming at the sky, and actually believe there are more than two genders! And they consider themselves smart!

                  I thought that is what I said. My only inference was that a timely interference says a lot right quick. We drop pallets of artillery in known terrorist countries every year since current Potus, and I have read that certain three letter groups have done so after, but that may be recent hearsay.  My point is, if you think you can narrow it down as such, is that there is no limit set to protect our children from harm. In my family it mostly means beating them severely, so they know what awaits them in the real world when they mess up.

                   I'm not sure what you're saying. Not a criticism, I just don't know.

                   If you're implying violence will work, no, it won't. This is a nation of laws. Laws are on the books protecting our children. We need to elect and make sure authorities in power respect those laws and are on board with keeping them safe. Where it breaks down is when those authorities are themselves corrupt. Like CPS is now. It means a complete overhaul.

                  <p>
                   If that's what you're saying, I agree. If you're saying that we should get violent, then I don't agree.

              This is the best way to explain I have read. I think the strongest is for the 'bees not just a single bee' to be exposed and there are good papers here that will report it.  Forget BBC they are our version of CNN.
