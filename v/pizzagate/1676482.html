<p>During the Holocaust, Josef Mengele, Hitler’s Angel of Death, conducted countless experiments on sets of Jewish twins. From the book, Children of the Flames: Doctor Josef Mengele and the Untold Story of the Twins of the Holocaust, we found this disturbing account:</p>
<p>&quot;Josef Mengele, aka Auschwitz’s ’Angel of Death,’ held a fascination with twins. As Auschwitz’s senior ’physician’ he conducted ’genetic experiments’ on nearly 1500 sets of twins between 1943 and 1944...</p>
<p>&quot;Of the 3000 twins who passed through Mengele’s labs, only 200 survived the war. Depending on the type of experiment endured by the twins, they were driven to various labs at Auschwitz or neighboring Birkenau camp. Most received routine blood and x-ray tests, often on a daily basis...</p>
<p><strong>Mengele’s experiments were both physical and psychological; experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia, transfusions of blood from one twin to another, isolation endurance, reaction to various stimuli, injections with lethal germs, sex change operations, the removal of organs and limbs, incestuous impregnations... Mengele injected chemicals into the eyes of children in an attempt to change their eye color...</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately a strict veil of secrecy over the experiments enabled Mengele to do his work more effectively, and ’twins who were subjected to the most gruesome procedures took his secrets to their graves.’ The full extent of his gruesome work will never be known because the records he sent to Dr. Von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute were shipped out ’in two truckloads’ and destroyed by the latter. Any remaining notes Mengele carried with him on his escape to South America and those were never found...</p>
<p>&quot;Mengele...also attempted to change the sex of some twins. Female twins were sterilized; males were castrated. What was the point of these ghoulish experiments? No one, either the child-victims, nor the adult witnesses, ever really knew.&quot; - 381:70</p>

<p><strong>SACRED MARRIAGE</strong></p>
<p>Mark Twain wrote,
&quot;Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t.&quot;</p>
<p>In the irrational world of the occult, the realities are indeed more bizarre than fiction. The driving force behind the pornography industry is the vast network of secret societies who conduct their lucrative operations legally through tax-funded intelligence organizations. These clandestine organizations sponsored the sexual revolution which, bankrolled by the CIA’s drug running syndicate, was designed to destroy moral standards and family values, foster anarchy and eventually to eliminate distinctions of gender, as well as good and evil. To comprehend this collective flight from reason, we must project ourselves into the subjective mindset of the occult underground, where right and wrong are what the Luciferian adepts pronounce them to be, where virginity has nothing at all to do with sexual purity, which in fact it rejects, and to comprehend, if at all possible, to what lengths the demonized race of Merovingians, having delusions of divinity, will go to produce a human vessel worthy of incarnation by their androgynous god, Lucifer. Truth — Veritas — is indeed stranger than Fiction.</p>
<p>Richard H. Allen wrote, in Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, that as the zodiac spread from Babylonia to Greece and Egypt, its symbolism changed. The Hindus knew the Gemini Twins, Castor and Pollux, as the Twin Deities or Dioscouri; in Egypt they became ’Two Sprouting Plants’ pictured as twins who symbolized the sun and moon.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the Jews ascribed [the Gemini Twins] to the tribe of Benjamin,... The Egyptians as Two Sprouting Plants; and Brown reproduces a Euphratean representation of a couple of small, naked, male child-figures, one standing upon its head and the other standing upon the former, feet to feet; the original twins being the sun and moon, when the one is up the other is generally down.&quot; (927:223-4)</p>
<p><strong>The French Connection</strong></p>
<p>The feast of Lupercalia, the Roman counterpart to Imbolc—the day on which Thomas and Irmine Plantard de Saint-Claire made their debut in the French press—was celebrated in honor of Romulus and Remus—the twin gods who founded Rome.

            Yes you are on to something here I also remember seeing somewhere in World Wide Web a user handle with 666 in his name predicting Beyoncés pregnancy. They are all luciferian/satanist trying to do some type of Rosemary's Baby type births. THis is why if your with Christ and or follow your own conscious of good within in you then they the secret Cabal of evil cannot win.

             Nazi angel of death Josef Mengele 'created twin town in Brazil
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Nazi doctor Josef Mengele is responsible for the astonishing number of twins in a small Brazilian town, an Argentine historian has claimed.
            <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnew...razil.html">
             http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnew...razil.html

           </p>
           <p>
            Candido Godoi - One in five pregnancies in the small Brazilian town have resulted in twins - most of them blond haired and blue eyed .
           </p>
           <p>
            In a new book, Mengele: the Angel of Death in South America, the Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa, a specialist in the post-war Nazi flight to South America, has painstakingly pieced together the Nazi doctor's mysterious later years.
           </p>
           <p>
            After speaking to the townspeople of Candido Godoi, he is convinced that Mengele continued his genetic experiments with twins – with startling results.
           </p>
           <p>
            He reveals how, after working with cattle farmers in Argentina to increase their stock, Mengele fled the country after fellow Nazi, Adolf Eichmann, was kidnapped by Israeli agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            He claims that Mengele found refuge in the German enclave of Colonias Unidas, Paraguay, and from there, in 1963, began to make regular trips to another predominantly German community just over the border in Brazil – the farming community of Candido Godoi.
           </p>
           <p>
            "There is testimony that he attended women, followed their pregnancies, treated them with new types of drugs and preparations, that he talked of artificial insemination in human beings, and that he continued working with animals, proclaiming that he was capable of getting cows to produce male twins."

             Romulus and Remus
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In Roman mythology, Romulus and Remus are twin brothers, whose story tells the events that led to the founding of the city of Rome and the Roman Kingdom by Romulus. The killing of Remus by his brother, and other tales from their story, have inspired artists throughout the ages. Since ancient times, the image of the twins being suckled by a she-wolf has been a symbol of the city of Rome and the Roman people. Although the tale takes place before the founding of Rome around 750 BC, the earliest known written account of the myth is from the late 3rd century BC. Whether the twins' myth was an original part of Roman myth or a later development is a subject of ongoing debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing them as a possible threat to his rule, King Amulius ordered them to be killed and they were abandoned on the bank of the Tiber River to die. They were saved by the god Tiberinus, Father of the River and survived with the care of others, at the site of what would eventually become Rome. In the most well-known episode, the twins were suckled by a she-wolf, in a cave now known as the Lupercal.[3] Eventually, they were adopted by Faustulus, a shepherd. They grew up tending flocks, unaware of their true identities. Over time, their natural-born leadership abilities attracted a company of supporters from the community.

            "Midwinter (early February) was the time of many ancient Pagan festivals, which have continued under Christian guises. The wild Lupercalia of ancient Rome was replaced by the austere Festival of the Purification of the Virgin, or Candlemas.... The Celtic Imbolc, or Brigid, is a time for purification and new beginnings... Imbolc anticipates spring, although the vernal equinox is seven weeks away. The word Imbolc refers to the pregnant condition of ewes at Midwinter. Their fertility was a good sign to the ancient Celts who depended on sheep for food and clothing... South and east of the British Isles ancient Romans celebrated the Lupercalia in honor of Lupa, the she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus who were considered Rome’s founding twins. Orgiastic rites were performed to honor her in the Grotto of the She-Wolf to insure fertility in the coming year. After these rites, naked youth traveled to neighboring towns to purify them according to Barbara Walker in The Woman’s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets." - 933
           </p>
           <p>
            The gods and goddesses of ancient and classical mythology were often twins as were the kings and queens they supposedly incarnated.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Often, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born simultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, Fauna-Faunus, Helen-Helenus or Artemis-Apollo, the ’moon and sun’ united in their Mother’s womb." (934)
           </p>
           <p>
            "The twins or brother gods in Sumeria [were] called Enki and Enlil. Enki, the infernal of the two, represents Set and Enlil represents Horus (although in this context Enlil would also be Osiris.)" (571).
