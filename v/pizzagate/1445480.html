<p>Text:</p>
<p>If Chuck E. Cheese were a hipster who smoked Crystal Meth, this would be the dining concept he would come up with. 
With an art deco style that can only be described as &quot;phony dilapidated&quot;, this place bore a strong resemblance to Freddy Krueger\'s boiler room, except with much more metal structures that served no purpose.
To put a fine point on the ambiance, there was a projector in the room playing extended video footage of a car tire on fire while spinning on a rope--so as to give that &quot;family Italian&quot; feel so commonly found in Pizza places.
I waited to be seated at around dinner time and the place was packed. It had more crying kids than a hospital maternity ward. Apparently they must have been saddened by the motif of this place as well.
When our server arrived, he appeared a bit nervous. An early twenties male wearing blue nail polish decided to take our order. Confronted with a list of microbrews that I had never heard of, I opted for a 16 oz can of pale ale that cost 6 dollars.
I ordered the meatball Pizza and it was decent. People raved about the food here, but it was brick oven pizza. It was ok.
One should not have to sacrifice an assault on all of the other senses in order to get a decent slice of pizza in this town. Also, If you go into a place to have Pizza, they should serve a beer that you have heard of other than Bud Light.
If you are into &quot;Epic Hipster Fail&quot; as a lifestyle, this is your place. If not, I would recommend a pass.</p>',

              </p>
              <p>
