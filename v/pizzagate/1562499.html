            Excellent info here, thanks OP. But I believe that like Webb's videos, these approaches focus too much on institutions, agencies, corporations etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to go after people. Bottom up. Shine the light on individuals. Go after personal reputations; for many wealthy and powerful that is all they really care about wrt the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a page from that asswipe Alinsky's playbook: go after people, they hurt faster and harder than institutions.

            I have some trubble with point 2. "2) This group was willing to become the new face of heroin trafficking."
           </p>
           <p>
            For one. Heroin is just a very small part of the poppy production. By far, it is for the medical/pharmaceutical business. There were reports pre afghan war about to short of supplie for the necessary medicine. I have it in my medicine (modafinil)

             wikipedia
            </a>
            Today, concentrate of poppy straw is a major source of many opiates and other alkaloids It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use)[4] and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin.[3]

           <p>
            The business is for most part in hands of the Dutch royals. That is where they (we as country) get their wealth from. And i do not think for one second they would give up that business. They just changed "brand" in pharmaceutical.
           </p>
           <p>
            Point 2: "As another slight tangent, with the Netherland's ban on cannabis coffee shops" Well, have been in a coffee shop today, so those are not banned.

            Snippet from the post

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Oh, and of course the OSCE has ties to Soros. This organization often partners with the "Open Society Foundation" to do things like cross-share information. There is a revolving door between the OSCE and the Foundation employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before anyone thinks the OSCE might be "one of the good guys," I'll share the following (in the book, The Natashas): "The level of psychological violence and psychological intimidation used to control these women is deliberate and extreme. It's meant to instill fear--to crush them, destroy their will, force them to comply. There are reports of women being mutilated and murdered for as punishment for refusing to engage in the sex trade. Women have been killed as examples to other women for daring to resist. ...in 2000, the bodies of two Moldovan women were found floating in a river near the Arizona market [a "free trade" zone on the Bosnia border, known for its black market in weapons and women/child prostitutes]. Their hands were tied behind their backs, their feet attached to concrete blocks and their mouth taped shut--all marks of execution-style killings. On the tape over their mouths, their killers had scrawled the words, "Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE].

            Snippet from the post
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            If you think I'm cherry-picking selective facts, read the articles yourself. Study Romania, study the trafficking history here, read the annual reports. Study the directors and the politicians. It's all there. I'm picking out the most relevant facts for easier digestion, and for the sake of brevity, not because I ignored all which didn't support my conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            So now I'll give the 18 main facts to support this narrative. Unless specifically noted, I've kept the time lines congruent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact: The Romanian Orphanage Trust (and other aid organizations) developed working partnerships in the same countries as the Mafia's. This occurred along an identical timeline and in identical cities. Trust activities: the Trust began a partnership between their UK cities for know-how, and between Moldova and Romania for a "partnership" in 1995 related to the children's homes in Moldova. Mafia activities: "Since the 1990s the Camataru clan had been building up an extensive prostitution operation. The clan's prostitutes, many from Moldavia, were packaged off in flats all over Bucharest." The article states that under the communist regime, these guys were only involved in petty theft.
            <a href="http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/longread/darfor-kommer-tiggarna/en/gudfadern-brottsimperiet-och-lejonen-i-tradgarden/">
             http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/longread/darfor-kommer-tiggarna/en/gudfadern-brottsimperiet-och-lejonen-i-tradgarden/
            </a>
            Analysis: Again, "flats all over Bucharest" can easily be disguised as the "decentralized group home"-plan promoted by the Trust.

           </p>
           <p>
            Fact: The Romanian Orphanage Trust expanded its employees' ties to Piemonte, Italy starting in the mid-90s... which is the same place (Turin) and timeframe (mid-90s) as the Romanian mafia's inception. Italian prosecutors describe the mafia's presence as unexpected and inorganic. Trust Activities: The Ecos-Ouverture programme consists of a network to assist the local, regional, and city authorities in the EU to establish contact and to develop co-operation with their counterparts in Central and Eastern Europe. Mafia Activities: (Italian prosecutor speaking regarding the Romanian mafia's unexpected presence in Piemonte) "Due to the language and cultural barriers, the local authorities are, at first, baffled by what is going on." Analysis: the Northern Italian mafia was okay with their presence and training them in crimes because, as this article says, "The Italian criminal organizations allowed these foreigners to do certain activities in which they have no further interest."

           <p>
            Fact: The Romanian Orphanage Trust expanded its employees' ties to Greece as well. This is the same time and place as the Romanian mafia's foray into trafficking Moldovans to Greece. Trust Activities: "A unique feature of this Trust's UK organization is the partnership with European NGOs and local authorities which supports our Specialist program.Under this arrangement, experienced mid-career professionals are given a leave of absence for up to a year to work as a Specialist in Romania. This program started in '93 with Strathclyde Regional Council and has been extended to the County Council of Devon, the region of Piedmonte in Italy, and the National Welfare Organization of Greece." (95-96 audit) Mafia Activities: Project echo Greece report states, "Areas of Action" (related to drugs and trafficking)--"Romanian: thefts and trafficking in human beings. Important to point out: Moldovans about human trafficking aimed to sexual exploitation." *Note: At this point in history circa 2000, the Romanian mafia nor the Trust had significant cross-partnerships anywhere else other than Italy and Greece. However, other foreign NGOs may have had them "collaborating" in countries like France and Spain.

            "When they [victims] first got there [at the site] they say, 'no I don't want to do this' and then they beat them. We've had girls that are electrocuted, put in bath tubs and electrocuted. We have girls that have been shot. They bury their faces for thirty seconds, then uncover them, then they ask, "are you going to run away again?" And then they'd do the process you know, again, 10 times. Or whatever it takes." (note: remember how the charities all stress the importance of "keeping kids off of the streets" which is nice, but takes a much darker turn in light of stories like these.)

            "Officers located hundreds of thousands of images and videos detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children, some of the worst they have ever viewed. Police allege Brian Way, 42, had been running an "exploitation movie, production and distribution company" called Azov Films since 2005, and has made more than $4 million from the business. Through his company, the man would allegedly contract people to create child porn videos involving kids, largely boys, between the ages of 5 and 12. Many of these videos were shot in Ukraine and Romania in apartments, saunas, and backyards."

            This person worked extremely hard to write this up for all.  Do not let it go to waste.  It was deleted and noone ever saw it.  It was deleted because the person posted 20 posts instead of consolidating it all into 1.  I have consolidated it into 1 post.  It will take you an hour to read but I promise you its worth it.  You will become very knowledgeable how things work.

            In short it basically explains the relationship between democracies, child trafficking, governments, and NGO's.  I don't want to say too much because I really want you all to read it and I don't want to explain it wrong.
