            He's been such a slippery eel about everything else, I'm not ready to give him a pass on anything he says. It's like he's talking lawyer talk, limiting his denial to the present only.

             The square footage is listed as double the ground floor area. It's the same height as the buildings beside it so the other floor is below. I don't really follow that this imply anything having a basement but there's one in Bucks two doors down.

            I posted about this the other day. Although I agree, we shouldn't lean too much on this theory because he has a basement at Buck's Fishing which is right by there. He could easily say that's what he meant

              Yeah I think he does have a basement at Comet. I'm just saying that he could deny that and without a warrant the police can't look. With him saying that's what he meant could make them turn the other cheek. I think they should have already served a warrant! Insiders told Alex Jones that they know.

               Probable cause is not suspicion.
               <br/>
               Him lying to journalists, if that is what happened, is not probable cause.
              </p>
              <p>
               People telling a radio show host something is not probable cause.
              </p>
              <p>
               You wouldn't want cops bursting into your house because your neighbor down the street is suspicious of something.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Before a judge or magistrate may issue a search warrant, there must be a finding of probable cause.
                <strong>
                 The level of evidence required to demonstrate probable cause is greater than "mere suspicion"
                </strong>
                but is less than the level required for a criminal conviction (beyond a reasonable doubt). The facts must demonstrate that a reasonable person would believe that the location which is the subject of the warrant contains evidence of a crime, the instrumentalities of a crime (e.g., safe-cracking equipment), contraband (e.g., illegal materials such as drugs), or the fruits of a crime (e.g., stolen property).

            Don't get caught in rat traps.
James does say basement but does he specifically say where that basement is? No. He says the basement, the basement he mentions could be at another location, just because he mentions the basement, doesn't mean its "the basement" at CPP.
Keep digging though lads. 
I think we need to focus on the building that surround CPP. 
There may be a basement at CPP but his statement is vague. He doesn't mention a CPP basement.

            I think the title of the caption is perhaps our biggest takeaway from this whole sordid affair.  Who or better yet is there anyone involved in law enforcement and/or military and/or government and/or financial services....well anywhere besides those of us on voat trying to do the right thing who still has a conscience?  The sad takeaway for me in all of this is threefold:
           </p>
           <p>
            First, we know the Clintons are dirty and no one really seems to care.  Despite mountains of evidence of pay to play corruption she still won half the popular vote.  It does appear that for the Clinton Foundation that crime does indeed pay.  Neither Bill nor Hillary will be investigated.  Forget pizzagate and Giustra and Besta and the resta.  All will walk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, we know Anthony Weiner "sexted" a teenager and that Tony Podesta displayed nude photos of teenagers in his suburban home long before Pizzagate.  As I write this both men are free.  There have to be dozens of violations for each of them for which they could be brought in on?  Pathetic?  Shameful in the Podesta case as I see it.  The story was in the Washington Post home of the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, when is the last time we saw the NYT, WAPO, NPR, FOX, and I guess next is Jon Stewart allow a guy who displayed pictures most decent people lose sleep over the use of their International media platforms to defend himself? If it was one or maybe even two sick pictures I might consider giving him a pass but this guy totally fails the "duck" test, i.e he waddles, quacks, swims and unfortunately flies like at the very least a shady perverted duck?  I guess going forward all sick perverts being accused of distributing kiddie porn and/or molestation will now reach out to the media before they talk to a lawyer, right?  If we are supposed to buy the bs they are peddling, i.e. Alefantis is indeed not a DC power player but rather just a poor joe schmoe pizza shop owner who the heck gives Pizza Homo Hannibal Lector Humbert Humbert an opportunity to defend himself prior to being charged?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the most telling thing about where we stand as a nation hit me yesterday afternoon as I read the posts of people (I applaud) who were trying to find the Alefantis pig farm.  Just for fun let's say I actually found the pig farm and that there actually were kids and bodies and evidence implicating all involved in this whole sordid disgusting hacked emails fallout.  Is there anyone out there who believes anyone in law enforcement would come to my assistance and do anything?  Think about that for a minute or two.  If you and me asked 10 of our friends and relatives I am betting a solid 7 would tell you to not do anything and walk away because the "authorities" wouldn't help you.  If there are folks from the FBI and any other "agency" reading this who are my age (sadly almost AARP) please note it was NOT like this when I was growing up.  Is this the shit we are leaving our kids and our Grandkid's?  Crazy.  If there are people in law enforcement who are trying to help God bless you guys and gals.  Come forward and we'll defend you.  For the others reading this my oath was to defend the constitution (we the people) from enemies foreign and domestic.  It was not: I solemnly vow to keep my mouth shut for 20 years then I will collect my pension and become a private contractor, i.e. go from protecting perv's to becoming one.  I guess this is the new normal.

             With reasonable suspicion - We need non corrupt law enforcement to ask to have a quick look around, and if they find anything suspected of cover up / illegal activity, will lead to probable cause / proper search warrant / full fucking investigation and trial!
