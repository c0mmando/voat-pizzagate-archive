            "networks of people with authority and power" is a much clearer statement which I think gives a better indicator of what's wanted by the rules.

             When defending yourself it's best to refrain from any insults to a persons character - it diverts attention from your original points and usually devolves into a pissfight about who can type the longest.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are a number of easily recognizable ways agencies can cause dissension and exhaustion in a forum they want to disappear, and unfortunately many of you contributions raise flags for this type of attack.
            </p>
            <p>
             One way through this, and to resolve the issue overall, is to address the
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2033103/10055953">
              comment
             </a>
             .
             <br/>
             A common tactic in fake news is to present a sensational headline but not actually support it in the article itself. CNN and MSNBC are well known for this, and it creates an environment of hyper attention on sensational headlines, but there is no substance to the claims.
             <br/>
             It's often possible for normal people to accidentally internalize this form of journalistic deception and to unknowingly repeat it in online forums, furthering the goals of "the man" to incite division and increase the difficulty people have in discovering real answers to difficult questions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something I want to see from you:
             <br/>
             No matter how far you're pushed, don't respond with personal attacks. Keep the high ground and argue your points.
             <br/>
             Attempt to see how there is a disconnect between the headline and the reported story and address that in your posts.
             <br/>
             This will help me (and the other mods) see that you're not attempting a forum slide or discredit campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             An in context with the comments, Rule 1 does need a change.

              Thank you for writing. I believe this crensch guy was abusive to me from the start and that my responses were both beyond warranted and very mild in comparison  to what he said to me, including the threats and private messages with bigotry.  I was abused my whole childhood and have spent my adult life fighting abusers. Every angle with which this crensch guy approached me was abusive -- he fits the domestic abuser profile to a T in terms of gas lighting, verbal and emotional abuse attempts. Its very creepy to me that this guy is in charge. I believe I have valuable and unique knowledge and experience to add to PG, but I will not tolerate abuse in order to both benefit from and share with others here. I'm disappointed not one person came to my defense here.  Looking at the trending posts everyday, crensch's points make zero sense to me. His approach is one of the main reasons this forum will not be as successful as it could be, which results in less perps getting caught and less kids being saved. I am a highly educated person who fights for justice everyday of my life, and I deserve to be appreciated. And yes, respect goes both ways, and I believe my comment and submission history speaks for itself.

            This is not the same link I got from a voater but is the same story It is Beyond Disgusting. Tells how US Soldiers raped adolescent girls in Columbia and made CP from it ON the BASE.  This is going on All Over at the Bases, imo.  The voat member told me he also has seen other articles about this This Will Make You Angry.

              This is a problem for many from what I am hearing.  I don't know what the problem is about your post.  I just sent a link to an article that shows the US soldiers are raping girls and filming to make CP.  There are other articles as well that I have seen.  This is IMO happening at many bases.  The person that originally sent me a similar article link said that this is a well known fact in Columbia.

             be? Users and mods seem to be having many disagreements about this lately. This is likely to get worse as more busts occur and more of the Clinton corruption is revealed. Can you chime in and give us a better understanding of the original intentions regarding scope of Rule 1 and definition of Pizzagate? This has come up regarding a number of posts removed recently and it is beginning to effect subverse morale. Frustration levels are getting pretty high.

              It's not only CP that can get a serviceman blackmailed, so in a way, the argument of them getting blackmailed into doing bad shit is a little off.  Even the local man behind Dominos can get blackmailed, and who knows if he's in charge of a power plant, or communications somewhere?

               This isn't child trafficking. NO TRAFFICKERS WERE CAUGHT. ZERO. This is not HUGE. This is solicitation. A bunch of lonely losers with IQ deficiencies were swept up. No pimps jailed. No children rescued. No evidence of wider systemic abuse. The headlines are misleading. The police are doing these sting operations to make it appear as if they are doing something about the actual problem with pimps and traffickers. They are not. They won't be going after guys like Epstein or any high powered Hollywood players who actually exploit and traffick children. They are grabbing the dumbass low-hanging fruit. Because the agencies themselves are corrupt. So. WOOO! NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE HAPPENED. Thanks.

              They rounded up NO TRAFFICKERS.  They just pretend to be 18 year old girls online to attract men, then "tee hee, i'm actually not 18, is that ok?" - boom, headlines.

              tell all your Shareblue faggot buddies that if they want to keep their usernames intact, they should probably not whine to the mods.  You can consider your username burned.

                  This user only has character attacks to defend itself with.  I recommend keeping a close eye on it for submissions that break the rules.  It clearly has no intention of learning the rules, why it broke the rules, and seems to have no intention of following them.

                Because doing so would just embarrass you further, and you know it.  You're incapable of defending yourself with anything but an emotional outrage that might work on rEddit.

            . Are busts of pedos in the military not part of Pizzagate? If they are hooking our military guys into this, doesn't it put them in a compromised position where influence can be had over them? Isn't that a matter of national security? Military is directly named in the PG definition:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The name pizzagate is simply an easy to remember convenience, referring to what has been called "Pedocracy" which is the suspected, likely informal, association of elite individuals that use pedophilia to organize, manage and discipline their efforts to dominate or disproportionately influence outcomes in matters of interest. That includes government as well as politics -- executive, legislative, judicial, lobbying, military, intelligence -- as well as media, business, finance, law, medicine, accounting, technology, academia, think tanks, philanthropy, endowments, etc.

             IMO, low-ranking servicemen/women per ses are not relevant, unless there is actual evidence they are being "hooked into" pedo stuff, as you put it, by high-ranking officers.  Pizzagate is about elites protecting, engaging in, and profiting from child sex.

            These guys get a few years in jail and supervised release, and the victims suffer horribly for the rest of their lives.  Those pictures are spread all over the internet all over the world, day in and day out, 24 hours a day year after year.  So sad and so unfair.

             .  I'm like you, always thinking of the long-term effects of these crimes on the victims, their parents, their friends, and the people who miss the victims after they're gone, literally or figuratively.  So damn sad.

              I was just looking up the Missing Children of St. Louis and found an article about Sean Hornbeck, who was kidnapped and held for 4 yrs. and found. Found with another boy that was missing too. The interview was a few years later and he seemed ok, stilled lived with parents, is holding a job and is at peace he says. They of course do not delve into the personal, but I was thinking it all looks ok, but this young man lost 4 yrs of his life and God knows what he was put through. I am glad he is doing well, but he should never have had to go through what he did. I am sure there are times his mind goes back and all I can think of is that it never should have happened. No matter how things turned out.

            There was a member that posted an article about raping of children at air force bases in Columbia.  He says that is where it is happening.  The article said they also filmed the horrible acts there as well.  This could be a message.
