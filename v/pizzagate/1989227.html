He is believed to have molested up to 200 deaf boys before the mid-1970s.[1] Local law enforcement agencies, including the Milwaukee Police Department, the St. Francis police, and the Milwaukee County District Attorney, were informed of the abuse in 1974 by adult graduates of the St. John School for the Deaf, but expressed doubts about the credibility of the allegations and the statute of limitations, and did nothing.[2] Then Milwaukee Archbishop William Edward Cousins gave Murphy a leave of absence in 1974 and allowed him to move to his mother\'s house in Boulder Junction, Wisconsin, which is in the Diocese of Superior. Cousins did not tell the Bishop of Superior the reason Murphy was not living in Milwaukee.[citation needed] In 1977, Rembert Weakland succeeded Cousins as Archbishop of Milwaukee. Weakland stated in a deposition,[3] that he was aware of the accusations against Murphy in 1977, and prohibited Murphy from saying Mass in Milwaukee, but otherwise did nothing, and gave no information about Murphy to the Diocese of Superior where Murphy was living. Weakland offered to transfer Murphy to the Diocese of Superior,[citation needed] but the offer was not accepted, and Murphy finally retired as a priest of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in January 1993. In December 1993, Weakland had Murphy evaluated by a psychotherapist. During the interview, Murphy admitted molesting boys at least up until 1974, including during the sacrament of penance, which is an offense under canon law. In July 1996, Weakland notified the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and asked how to proceed. Although the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the time did not have jurisdiction over most incidents involving sexual abuse by priests, it did have authority over cases involving solicitation by priests during the sacrament of penance. Weakland stated that &quot;[I] got an answer back saying yes. We could open the case&quot;, and the process against Murphy was begun in October 1996. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone instructed Wisconsin bishops to convene a canonical trial,[4] which could have resulted in a range of punishments, including laicization. A formal church trial was initiated but later dropped because Archbishop Weakland decided that a pastoral solution was more appropriate because Murphy was elderly and in poor health.[1][5] Murphy died several months after he requested that the Vatican halt a canonical trial against him because of his ill health.[1] The Vatican has responded to concerns by noting that they had not been informed of the allegations until 20 years after they were first raised; that Murphy died within two years of Vatican notification of the allegations; that police investigations into the allegations at the time did not result in any cases being heard; and that there was nothing in the Vatican\'s actions that would prevent civil cases from proceeding.[1] As of March 2010, there were four outstanding lawsuits against the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in the case.[4][6] 2003 report on sexual abuse[edit] Following public testimony by victims before a combined session of the Wisconsin State Senate and Assembly Judiciary Committee, a report on the sexual abuse of minors by clergy in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee was published in September 2003. The report revealed that allegations of sexual assault of minors had been made against 58 ordained men, who were under the direct supervision of the Archbishop of Milwaukee. [citation needed] In response, Archbishop Timothy Dolan held a meeting with victims, mental health professionals, law enforcement officers, and clergy. He opposed legislation that would have extended or eliminated the statute of limitations on the filing of clergy sexual abuse cases.[citation needed]</p>
<p>By early 2009, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee had spent approximately $26.5 million in attorney fees and settlements [citation needed] for sexual-abuse claims. Nevertheless, Dolan helped the archdiocese avoid bankruptcy resulting from the lawsuits, and closed a $3 million budget deficit in 2008.[7] He later called</p>
<p>the sexual abuse scandals the most challenging issue of his tenure in Milwaukee, saying &quot;Does it haunt me? Yes it does. And I\'m not afraid to admit that.&quot;[8] 2011 bankruptcy filing[edit] On January 4, 2011 the Archdiocese of Milwaukee announced that it would file for bankruptcy. The church was facing more than 23 lawsuits, and attempts to reach a mediated settlement with victims failed in Dec 2010.</p>

            Timothy Dolan was rewarded for his cover up of corruption and pedogate in the Catholic Church with a promotion to Archbishop, and many believe he is next in line to the first and only American Pope.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Catholic church is absolutely corrupt at all levels and deeply involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They are now bringing other religious groups into the fold by forming collective organizations like Racine Interfaith Coalition, United Way, Racine Coalition for Peace and Justice and other ways to control various churches and groups by starting with projects to "help the homeless", "support our veterans", "provide resources for women and children", and "Fight to End Exploitation".
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine and Wisconsin are at the root of the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We must identify the real enemy, which begins with the Council of 13 and Committee of 300. We must expose their model community of Racine, Wisconsin so that the world knows the true evil agenda and how they use communities like Racine to hide the truth.

            Dolan did such a great job in Missouri he got a promotion. He was a pro at hiding the sexual abuse and organ harvesting and CP  in  St. Louis and now he is doing it in Wisc.  and especially in Racine.  He is doing the dirty work for Bergoglio.
