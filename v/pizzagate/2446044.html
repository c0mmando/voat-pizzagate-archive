            This is a serious topic, unfortunately, the way its published, it looks like advertising for "MathEasySolutions". The body double angle is outrageous enough that rather than just "throwing it out there", it warrants your view on it, in the main text. If that's for humour, say so.

            Note that many people will be surprised by this "interest in science" from a US equivalent of Jimmy Savile, running a sexual compromise and control ring. Why target academics? First I will give my conclusion up front, then I will provide details below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Executive Summary - Why did Epstein target Academia for compromise and control?
           </p>
           <p>
            In context of the massive levels of fraud and propaganda in academia, particularly in "science", it is no surprise that top university academics are a target of Epstein's sexual compromise and control scheme. This is what is needed to get to the top in academia today. That is what makes a propagandist, truly reliable. Supporting details and links below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting details on the case:
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein compromised a large number of academic scientists. His science funding was for compromise and control. He flew many University academics on his Sex Jet to "Pedophile Island", and spent countless millions funding evolution and neuro science. Here's a Hawkins and academics story with photos :
            <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking/11340494/Stephen-Hawking-pictured-on-Jeffrey-Epsteins-Island-of-Sin.html">
             https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking/11340494/Stephen-Hawking-pictured-on-Jeffrey-Epsteins-Island-of-Sin.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            On the funding side, this article gives a taste of it (Many articles have been scrubbed). Tens of millions spent on Evolutionary and Neuro science and buying "scientists":
            <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/07/evolution-harvard-christina-galbraith/">
             https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/07/evolution-harvard-christina-galbraith/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a list of big names that he took on his sex jet shown in photo copies of his flight log that are no doubt still online, and a list of names in his phone book including billionaires, royalty, politicians and key university academics. Note that Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz were frequent flyers on the "Sex jet". Brilliant article by Nick Bryant:
            <a href="http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971">
             http://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-pedophile-billio-1681039971
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Alan Dershowitz, who stood to be prosecuted himself for using the Pedophile Jet, was a key defender of Epstein. When Epstein was let off with a slap on the wrist, it looked bad enough to the public, that a new case was taken up against the state on behalf of some of the young women used as slaves in this scandal. That seemed reasonable. But then added to that case was a new claim from "Jane Doe 3" that Alan Dershowitz had sex with her in many places. The court then found that to be "impossible". Was that new claim added so that later publicity dismissing that claim, could "exonerate" Alan Dershowitz in the eyes of the public?
            <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/alan-dershowitz-jeffrey-epstein-settlement-2016-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">
             https://www.businessinsider.com.au/alan-dershowitz-jeffrey-epstein-settlement-2016-4?r=US&amp;IR=T
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But why did Epstein fund these "scientists"?
           </p>
           <p>
            In my view Epstein's role was to further compromise paid academic propagandists. Academic scientists are paid to indoctrinate students with known lies, and manage public opinion. Managing such a system of lies can be done with peer pressure and the potential to end careers. But surely someone might grow a conscience, even if only near retirement. So at the highest most influential levels of "science", further compromise is extra insurance. After a filming session on "Pedophile Island", an academic can be trusted and his career in controversial areas can progress.

            Note that our state religion as taught in public schools and university is Evolutionism. To give you an idea of how carefully protected that religion is consider the following two articles just regarding evolution and global warming.

            The ban on comments in News Papers and "Science" journals to protect Global Warming propaganda and Evolutionism...

            Is it just science that's complete nonsense? Is it just science that is "compromised", with most papers being fraudulent or mistaken?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well... no. Harvard Business school was exposed in the very good Charles Ferguson documentary "Inside Job". It's brilliantly funny and absolutely nails the leadership of Harvard Business school and the Fed Reserve in very revealing interviews. For example, Harvard indoctrinated generations of students on the great economic benefits of banking de-regulation, while professors sat on the boards of companies set up by the very same Investment banks that stood to gain from shifting public opinion on the issue. That is not unusual. That is how everyday life in academia works. Just search for "Inside Job" on Amazon. A superb documentary.
           </p>
           <p>
            How much do academics lie? Surely they wouldn't lie about anything life threatening, like a drug trial or vaccination...
British Medical Journal: "Most scientific studies are wrong" - Published by "amateurs" to advance a career, or outright fraudulent. 60% wrong or fraudulent by well known estimates.

           </p>
           <p>
            But what about peer review? Surely that must ensure a high standard of honesty and accuracy?
           </p>
           <p>
            When a computer program was put online generating scientific papers using buzz words and phrases, at least 120 fake papers were published in peer reviewed journals, some very prestigious publications. How did so many bogus papers get published in prestigious peer reviewed Journals? Peer Review is merely to ensure political correctness. Its not for scientific accuracy. Had any of those papers been published with a title like "Anthropological Global Warming Questioned", it would not have been published:

             First of all, the body double is a claim that the real Hawking died and they replaced him with a look a like (which, face it, would be easier since he cannot move or speak with his own voice -- much easier to fake).
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, he was photographed with strippers.  No, not everyone likes strippers.  And unless you can say that you would be proud if your mother/sister/daughter/girlfriend/wife was a stripper, then you don't really like strippers, either.  You just like using them for your sexual fantasies but you don't actually respect them unless you think that it would be great for the women in your life to have that job.
            </p>

             However, this was on Epstein's pedo island, not some skanky strip club somewhere.  Sure, this photo got out (because it is amusing to people to see a crippled guy checking out strippers), but what else was going on that he witnessed and couldn't be shown in photos?  Were there underage strippers?  Child rape?  That is the issue here.  Epstein was already convicted of prostituting underage girls.  There is also some evidence that suggests that he has ties to Mossad and that his island was a way to provide underage girls/boys to VIPs with the intent of video taping it for blackmail purposes.  So, yeah, this is kind of big deal.  What did Hawking see that he failed to report to the authorities?

              I asked Why would there be a body double? What is the purpose of it?
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't see there has to be a requirement that my daughter is a stripper for me to enjoy their services? I didn't force the girl to become a stripper, she did it of her own accord, for her own reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can purchase that service if I want, she is free to leave at anytime.
             </p>
             <p>
              Different with forced prostitution though, they don't have a choice and I would not want to feed such an industry.

             I don't know if that particular photo was taken at pedo island, but his name did appear on the manifest for the Lolita express -- so he definitely went there.  Whether or not their were underage prostitutes when he went, I can't say -- but given his penchant for strippers and the incident mentioned in the article where he went to a swingers club and laid on a bed while two young women gyrated on him -- I'm guessing there was some kind of "entertainment" and Epstein was convicted for prostituting underage girls, so I'm guessing that was his niche in the sex/blackmail business.

            It's hard to believe he would have anything to do with pedophilia due his infirmity. However, it's definitely noteworthy about his beyond incredible life span with ALS. I hate to think it of someone I have so much respect for, but the blood of the young may offer an explanation. I'm not certain about the whole body doubles thing. I'd believe blood of the innocent over a body double. He wasn't always towing the Leftest Globalist Agenda even speaking out on multiple occasions against AI. Being a sufferer of chronic pain, fighting against my own body's intent to destroy itself, I looked to Hawking as a bastion of  triumph in the face of an ailing mortal shell. I will try to not let this news poison the good I've drawn from his story over the years but will certainly not dismiss the implications of these ideas either.
