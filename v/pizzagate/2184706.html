             Because this is what this video proves, that there is a shooter closer to the arena.

              Not strictly true. The lag time he described varies depending on the muzzle velocity. So, although I am not a rifle expert, I can make an educated guess that a different rifle or different caliber bullet could produce the shorter lag times.

               This video analysis has to do with frequency and how frequency transmission through the medium of air.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thats why this is compelling evidence of a second shooter much closer to the arena.

                Someone sent this video to me and there is not sufficient evidence, so I decided to find it on voat and discuss it.
               </p>
               <p>
                The analysis of his videos are on what he calls the "lag time" between the bullet striking and report. A faster bullet travels farther ahead of the firing sound wave than a slower bullet.
               </p>
               <p>
                His two times are .374, and .560, which is a 50% increase from low to high. We know that there was an ak also being used besides the ARs.
               </p>
               <p>
                So a heavy 150 grn factory ak round (given a standard length barrel) would be going about 2100fps. A standard AR would be about 3150. It just so happens that that is exactly 50% faster, which would lead to a "lag time" difference of about 50% shooting from the exact same position.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's clearly a different gun being fired from the same position. The only conclusive evidence would be audio of both guns being fired simultaneously, which was not provided or mentioned in the video.

                 It´s the high frequency sound that give a way the sound of the bullet hit the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And the low frequency sound proves that its sound of the fire from the gun/rifle.

                 The difference has to do with transmission of frequency in the medium of air.

                  I understand that you are steadfast in your confidence about what the video proves, however, take (another) moment to consider what was actually presented. He does mention that soldiers can guess at the proximity of a shooter by listening to the frequency of a shot, but he never measures the sound frequency as part of his analysis. He measures the lag time between two separate sounds. No matter if he wanted to address either or both sounds, there are two many unknowns for him to say anything about the attenuation of the sound and recorded frequency. You might be able to reliably say that it was fairly close or there may be another type of analysis I am not aware of, but, I repeat, that is not what he chose to analyze. Only as a way to describe the nature of the two sounds does he mention that the first noise (that he takes to be bullet impacts) is in the high frequency spectrum and the second noise (of the rifle report) is in the low frequency spectrum.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As other commenter have said, he may well being using NLP and other techniques to confuse people, so we may need to be careful about this guy until a better analysis can be done. He claims he whipped us this "forensic evidence" in three hours, but he was likely irresponsible by releasing a video like this since he acknowledges that many videos are being banned for being inaccurate and he thinks he knows enough to give law enforcement consultation. He claims to be a scientist, but there seem to be some errors in his approach. He tries to make it seem like he was exhaustive in eliminating error, e.g. he notes that echo wouldn't change his analysis. That isn't to say that you can't prove that either two rifles or two shooters were present, but we don't know that he isolates two distinct sound sources reliably (with an observable, cohesive pattern).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Do you understand that lag time is not a measure of the difference in sound frequency of two sounds but the delay (seconds passed) between two sounds? He did not measure the difference in frequency between the two sounds, and we don't know how that could be useful unless you want to come up with a new type of analysis. There may be some complex analysis out there, but we are only concerned with the analysis that he did. Please look up what he means by lag time. Muzzle velocity, air resistance, tumble, caliber, and trajectory all matter when you are interpreting lag time.

                    Fine, but everyone is telling you that you are missing something, and you need to be more careful because I've seen some valid points in response to your stance. Yes, one part of the difference formula involves the speed of sound. The other part involves the speed of the bullet. You don't get any distance just by knowing the speed of sound and when one sound, the rifle report, reaches you. This remains true even if you have a single measure of frequency (of the sound of the rifle report when it reaches you).

                     I agree that the speed of the bullet will have an impact on where the second shooter is. But the sounds are recorded from the same place (arena), so even if the caliber change the velocity would not change that much. Meaning the "lag time" and the calculation he did with a .223 showed a change in frequency to closer range at more then 200 yards closer to the arena.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So even if you change the caliber it still would not make sense that is was just one shooter.

                      First, we can't really trust his analysis until it's repeated by someone. So, although it's possible to isolate distinct sound sources of shooters, we don't know if it was done without error. Second, you are making assumptions. For example, caliber matters so much that if a second shooter was at 275 yards, he could have chosen to fire subsonic rounds. He could reliably hit the crowd and the sound would arrive before the impacts. Are you just going to assume that whatever rounds and rifles were used were just "pretty much standard"? We have to see how this guy eliminated such errors. So even if the data is showing an unmistakable pattern, we need to make sure there aren't alternative explanations that also fit. A more rigorous analysis could give us the proof we are looking for. For now, I'll just say that if this guy didn't completely (although he did partially) fudge the results, he might have found something in the data that can't be easily explained by a single shooter.

                       Just watched this video elsewhere and came here to comment, and I see your discussion with the enthusiastic, but less than informed OP.  This is clearly just the AK being fired at around 2100 fps as opposed to the AR at 3150. 50% increase in bullet speed means ~50% increase in "lag time" (although slightly less as the heavier ak rounds lose velocity less quickly).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The only conclusive evidence would be a recording showing the two rifles firing at the same time in such a way as the shooter could not possibly be switching between rifles. He did not provide this evidence.

            Couple things wrong with his analysis.  He's talking about 223/5.56 from a 16 inch barrel, the bump stock gun pictured has at least 18 if not 20 inch barrel(i.e. faster bullets).  Secondly he used more than 1 rifle and more than one caliber of bullet(.308 and 5.56 at least).  Another issue I have is the bullet impacts he's talking about are the bullets breaking the sound barrier not hitting dirt/people/pavement. Finally even in the same caliber ammo can have widely varying velocity depending on the weight of the projectile and other factors.

             This video analysis has to do with frequency and how frequency travel through the medium of air.

            <p>
             Thats why this is compelling evidence of a second shooter much closer to the arena.

              OK his calculations are flawed because his input is flawed.
             </p>
             <p>
              .223/5.56 can vary depending on the ammo between ~800-1200 meters per second depending on the weight of the projectiles.  The guy used 975MPS in his calculations. He didn't use a range of variables in his calculations. So his calculations and his conclusion is not correct. We are looking at a difference between .36 seconds to .59 seconds(~40% difference) depending on the type of ammo used for bullet travel time to 400 yards.
             </p>
             <p>
              308 win varies from about ~750-1100 MPS.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a large margin of error in his assumptions.  He even addresses that his calculations are based off a 55gr bullet out of a 16" barrel. So if the shooter had a different type of ammo or a longer or shorter barrel the calculations change.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the frequency, he used that to distinguish between bullet "impacts" and muzzle report. I'm not even going to get into his false assumption on the bullet impacts... Which are in reality the sound of the bullets breaking the sound barrier not pavement impacts in a grass field.

              You are right about that but, in order for math and physics to come to the correct conclusion the inputted dated must be correct. Not assumed.

               Maybe they used radio communication..

               I agree that the speed of the bullet will have an impact on where the second shooter is. But the sounds are recorded from the same place (arena), so even if the caliber change the velocity would not change that much. Meaning the "lag time" and the calculation he did with a .223 showed a change in frequency to closer range at more then 200 yards closer to the arena.
              </p>
              <p>
               So even if you change the caliber it still would not make sense that it was just one shooter.

                If you look at my estimation where I showed the travel time between 2 bullets you can see where he is wrong.  One at 1200mps traveled about 400 yards in .36 second the bullet at 800mps took .59 seconds.  Note he used almost those numbers to show absolute proof of a 2nd shooter.
               </p>
               <p>
                Basically, padcuck fired shots with one rifle at 800-900 mps, then fired shots from another rifle at 1100-1200mps or even the same rifle with different bullets and that's how he got his gandolf wizard powers of bullets that arrive faster. Then there is the issue of the muzzle report being stationary but, the crack of the sonic boom(bullet impacts according to him) is not a fixed location.  The guy was shooting at the crowd then at the fuel tanks. Never does he account for that. The camera is stationary but, point of aim over the camera head and 200 yards away from the camera will change the time of the sonic boom report in relation to that of the muzzle report.
               </p>
               <p>
                There may be more than 1 shooter but, I'm gonna need someone to show me a recording breakdown of rifle fire at a higher rate of fire than is possible for an ar15/10. Basically bullets fired almost at the same time.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll be honest, I was excited when I watched this video at first. I believed this was the proof we needed to catch our lying government in the act.  Sadly his case couldn't stand up to my scrutiny.

            My take on this is that the "forest" of what he's saying (the overall theory) is spot on.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the "trees" (the details) are off due to various unknowns.
           </p>
           <p>
            If that formula is built right, then it would just need a readjustment of killer 2's approximate range and therefore opens up new locations.

            I have no doubt in my mind that the LV shooting was a false flag and Cabal operation, however, I don't see a direct connection with CP or why this is in PG. How about PG Whatever? Otherwise, this is a distraction from chasing down pedos and our investigations into them.

             This post  is  about their being two shooters or not, but it involves Paddock since it is the LV Shooting.  He has been linked to an airplane that is linked to VA.  and to make a long story short, in the past this plane was used for the Franklin-Coverup and transporting of boys to DC.  Now we can argue about whether that is true or not, but that is the connection.  This whole thing is getting really twisted and intertwined just like everything else they operate.  Yikes, There are so many aspects to this caseI have had to write them down.

             Well this proves that FBI and MSM is lying about the official story.
            </p>
            <p>
             FBI must be exposed when they lie and FBI is implicit to covering up pedogate/pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have to think a DC pedoring could not be active if they didn't have influences in the FBI? Right..

               The Vegas shooting definitely happened, but, not the way he's suggesting... I mean really... teleportation/ I believe in some whacky shit, but, that's just counter-productive bullshit especially considering that he's trying to point out another shooter.

                This is math, and it is something you can´t easily dismiss. Thats why its so compelling evidence.

                 . His analysis is based on the assumption that a .223 round of a specific density/weight was used - failing to account for the other guns and possibility of different ammunition(s) being fired.

                 Well that's good to know, but, I don't believe he's done an appropriate analysis at all and indeed has not presented anything to compare his findings with - it would be lovely to know which footage he's using to determine that A: only .223 caliber ammunition was fired &amp; B: there was 2 or more shooters. There's also echo to take into account which WILL overlap with the sound-report from shots fired after the shot which produced the echo.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was a very open-air area; echos would travel incredibly far while remaining audible.

                   Like I said, some weapons afford better muzzle velocity compared to others which fire the same ammunition - even that aside, the travel/audio physics ABSOLUTELY change dramatically between different caliber ammunition... do you REALLY think a 7.62NATO sounds the same and travels the same speed as a .50BMG and likewise that a 5.56NATO behaves the same as the former 2?

                     The caliber of the ammunition(s) fired, does indeed matter - including the weapon(s) used to fire said ammunition(s). Not only does such information help to determine the presence and location of any shooters involved, but, it also helps us to understand where they got their equipment and perhaps how they managed to get everything setup undetected until it was go-time...

            there had to be another shooter if the woman with the Bellagio video claiming that the glass there was blown out. I don't know how a shooter at the Mandalay Bay could possibly hit the Bellagio's bar, it's in the opposite direction.

             His analysis rests on the shooting being real first of all. Where are all those dozens of shot up victims? You don't see them because they do not exist. All this talk of two shooters is to attempt to make the shooting itself appear to be real. It was not real. There are no victims. This is a red herring. The reason Trump said it was a "miracle" that more people were not killed is because he was making fun of the whole situation. He put "miracle" in quotes for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no second shooter because there was no victims. The whole thing is staged. You can believe that until you see all those dozens of victims talking about their recovery for the next few months IN THEIR OWN HOMEADE VIDS that do not exist and never will, unless its a few fakes from the cult.

              Believe me, I completely believe there were actors  involved.  There was someone I pretty much trust on here that said he knows someone that was shot.  I believe some were shot, but actors also took part in order to create a narrative.  They could not question the victims because they were  too shot up or may not say what they wanted.  I totally believe this was a type of false flag, but still included real victims.

               Yes, you both are probably right about staged actor and both real victims. (i don´t think the ones behind this would take a chance on the wrong narrative getting out)

               But this video analysis has to do with frequency and how frequency travel through the medium of air.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thats why this compelling evidence of a second shooter much closer to the arena.

               No mater the narrative, real shoots where fired.

                Well, I have to agree and  I really did not think this post was going to be as successful as it turned out.  I am glad that we can discuss for that is sometimes how we learn from others and also learn how to curb our anger and just listen, and can find others believe differently.  We may never agree, but we sure have either changed our minds or realized that we are really committed to our ideas.  And that is OK.

                <p>
                 And the low frequency sound proves that its sound of the fire from the gun/rifle.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The difference has to do with transmission of frequency in the medium of air.

               Out of hundreds of victims, as much as people love their selfies, you don't think there would be a hundred selfie victim videos from hospitals all over the internet? Dressage didn't say he knew somebody that got shot, he said he knew somebody that knew somebody that got shot, not the same as knowing somebody that got shot.

              Well, thank you.  I can't get it out of my mind about a Second Shooter.  Again, I will be honest in that I am not a Specialist on Marksmanship or Firearms.  But it just seems to point to common sense that one person could not have fired all those shots. Now those of you who would know, I think it might even be possible that while Paddock was in his room, two Sharp Shooters broke in and they were the ones that did the shooting.  Probably CIA or Special Ops.  Paddock may not even have been in that room at the time.  He may have already left.  Since we can't find anything tying him to that kind of experience or being a Sharp Shooter, how in the world did he do it.  I am sorry but that just keeps nagging at me.

             Have you watched this in full? It's utter horseshit.

              A:

             it was almost definitely a .30 cal - I recall seeing photos emerge of the LMG used, but will need to look for them to confirm.

              B:
             </strong>
             The video provides absolutely no audio samples to compare with what he's written on the whiteboard. Granted, the whiteboard has SOME factual info, but, it also just acts as a pointing reference and conversation piece for him.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              C:
             </strong>
             We already heard him at the start, "forensic acoustic analysis", why does he feel the need to constantly repeat this? (Neuro Linguistic Programming - repeat something enough times and the reader/listener will begin to accept it as fact)
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              D:
             </strong>
             He's making out as if he knows exactly what gun was used and exactly what grain(density/weight) the bullets were - any change of weapon(some guns afford better muzzle velocity than others which fire the same ammo) or bullet grain will throw his theory out the window.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              E:
             </strong>
             This dude looks like a jarhead/cia grunt.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              F:
             </strong>
             More NLP, he constantly demands that you agree with him as part of his collective "we", all the while trying to point you to his whiteboard because it's scribbles, math and graphs make it seem as though he's speaking from a place of authority on the subject.

              I think the analysis is useful but far from definitive for the reasons you point out. I don't think it's "absolute shit" and it's fairly straight forward to replicate the analysis. (I might try this if I have some more spare time). But if you follow what he's saying (which is correct), then you must acknowledge that he's basing this analysis off the idea that BOTH or ALL shooters used one and only one type of ammo. (.223 remington apparently) This isn't known, but we DO KNOW that the hotel room leaked photos show multiple guns and if they were modified semi-autos as purported, they would get hot and a gun swap would be a good idea. If the shooter swapped guns and ammo type one time, it would force a re-do of the analysis with correct values for the different ammo fires and make it more difficult to identify which ammo corresponded to which report (bang) heard on the audio clip.

              <strong>
               take away
              </strong>
              : The basic premise that the official story (one shooter) came out too soon and doesn't account for readily available video/audio and witness accounts is pretty solid though.

               I'm a little tired at the moment so wasn't too impressed with his presentation. He does use factual information to try to bolster his assertions, but, without making a comparison to any footage/audio, he's just assuming you know which shoots he was 'analyzing' in order to reach his conclusions...
              </p>
              <p>
               Plus the whole teleporting shooter theory... don't even wanna know how far he had to reach up his shit-chute, for that one.

                (.223 remington apparently) This isn't known, but we DO KNOW that the hotel room leaked photos show multiple guns and if they were modified semi-autos as purported, they would get hot and a gun swap would be a good idea.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I've seen nothing to back up the claims of modified semi-auto rifles, I did see a photo of the LMG and I think a pistol flashed by the screen too. The shots sound like a .30cal and from what I recall, the LMG did remind me of several .30 cal models I've looked at, though, many guns can be re-chambered to fire other ammo - but, my ears tell me (based on the footage available) that it was a .30cal lmg doing the brunt of the firing.

               <p>
                The basic premise that the official story (one shooter) came out too soon and doesn't account for readily available video/audio and witness accounts is pretty solid though.

               Also agreeable, keen to see things develop, just pretty damn sure the linked video is clickbait(as in, the makers of it know that they're talking shit)

               I'm not claiming to be an expert either, but, in my time (before now spending all my time here) spent researching guns so that I can make a well balanced first-person-shooter game, I spent countless hours(days/nights) studying weaponry and and bullet physics, etc.

              <p>
               He's using some factual information to spin his own little narrative on the shooting... hell, at one point he posits that the 2nd shooter fuckin teleported to the roof he is claimed to have been shooting from...

              I am hoping when all of this is hashed out and said and done that the only ones left Clueless will be LE and the Real Perpetrators.  I am asking that people look at the comments in my deleted post.  Maybe one of them is the reason it was deleted.
