            Nice work.  But according to the 'attending physician's'  'testimony',  he said he was 'physically' blocked from entering or administering aid...      If there were CPA's in there at the time,  then we Absolutely need to know who they were/are...          But it seems like Urgent Care was unattainable from this VIP patient.....

            Is this the one rabid is refering too? If so, the  we might have a person of interest. Fits my theory regarding means to pull it off.

            The clinical staff at my work are with this union.
           </p>
           <p>
            The union is garbage. They just take dues and do nothing to protect the workers. Non clinical staff have a different union and we have way more benefits than them. Shitty thing is you are forced to join and cannot get out of it. It has come to the point where I question if the agency isn't paying them to do a shit job representing at negotiations because they keep settling for no raises and less time off. Something is very wrong with this union.

            Question guys: How do I submit a picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just got sent a pic of a potentially damning /pol post (posted by a doctor who was there that night) by one of my confidants on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/thedonald">
             r/thedonald
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems only the attending doctor and a few nurses were with Seth Rich when the police arrived. Everyone else was kicked out of the ICU.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems to me the accomplice is one of those people.
           </p>
           <p>
            New names showed up too. Dr. Jack Sava via his relationship ties to Lisa M Kountoupes is connected to the Podestas (Tony and Heather Podesta).

             Darkknight111, to add a picture to a comment, first you have to upload to an image host. Voat has one, and there are more listed
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/TheDonald/1874578">
              here
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Once you've uploaded, just paste the url to image in your comment. If you describe what it is, you can then highlight the key words of the description, click the link button (#3, looks like a chain), and paste the url in the little field tht pops up and then your comment won't be cluttered with url gobbledegook.

            The Nurses Union is good.  SEIU is corrupt.  That is how she bought their endorsement.  Their HQ is on Dupont Circle right around CPP and the tunnels.

             Good point. I mentioned nurses because if my theory is true, then the most likely accomplice in terms of having the means, access, or training to pull this "finishing blow" off in a sufficiently subtle manner would have to be a nurse or some form of medical technician.

              My head is swimming .  I have been at this all day.  I read today that he died from too much loss of blood.  I don't know what to believe anymore.  But one thing I do feel for sure is that if they did not get him that night, they would be sure to finish the job at the hospital.  They are vermin.

            Which is why I suggested methods to burn down as much of the hay as possible. Its in a few steps.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Identify the time of death.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Identify the hospital Seth Rich died in.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Find a roster of employees at that hospital during the day Seth died.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Identify the 2 shift intervals that overlap with that time of death.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Identify employees scheduled to work in those shifts.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The accomplice was most likely a nurse or other medical technician. Therefore within the remaining people after step 5, narrow down that list to those who worked as those specific posistions.

            That is what I have bee thinking.  That is why they did not take him to the nearest hospital which was only about 3 blocks away.   They had a  definite reason why they wanted him at that hospital. Someone was waiting to make sure they finished the job.

            Be careful. This is sacred ground for the Dems for many reasons.
