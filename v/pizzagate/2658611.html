<p>A youth care worker for Southwest Key has been charged with 11 sex offenses after authorities accused him of molesting at least eight unaccompanied immigrant boys over nearly a year at one of the company’s shelters in Mesa, Arizona, federal court records show. The allegations against Levian D. Pacheco, who is HIV-positive, include that he performed oral sex on two of the teenagers and tried to force one of them to penetrate him anally. The other six teens — all between 15 and 17 — said Pacheco had groped them through their clothing. All of the incidents are alleged to have taken place between August 2016 and July 2017, according to a court filing last week that laid out the government’s case. The case, initially investigated by local police, is now proceeding through U.S. District Court in Phoenix. Pacheco had worked at Southwest Key’s Casa Kokopelli shelter, one of eight the company runs in Arizona, since May 2016.</p>
<p>Last week, ProPublica reported that police nationwide have responded to hundreds of calls reporting possible sex crimes at shelters that serve immigrant children. One of those calls resulted in the conviction of a Tucson shelter worker for molestation. Now further documents have emerged describing alleged incidents in Arizona involving Southwest Key, the largest operator of immigrant youth shelters nationwide. Southwest key knew of these claims well before they addressed Congress, but unsurprisingly omitted all of this. On Tuesday, an employee at a Southwest Key facility in Phoenix, Fernando Magaz Negrete, was arrested on allegations that he sexually abused a 14-year-old girl by kissing her and rubbing her breast and crotch, according to Phoenix news outlets. And The Nation reported Friday that a 6-year-old girl who had been separated from her mother was allegedly fondled by a boy at another Southwest Key facility in Glendale, Arizona in June.</p>
<p>At other Southwest Key facilities, police reports and call logs from the last five years detail inappropriate relationships with staff, dozens of runaways, sexual contact among kids at the shelters and other allegations of molestation by employees. In one case, ProPublica found, a 46-year-old youth care worker in Tucson was convicted of groping a 15-year-old boy who had just arrived in the United States five days earlier. When asked how the company could assure the public that children are safe in its facilities, Eller wrote: “We find the premise of your question dishonorable.”</p>',

            Southkey West is a massive part of the Welfare Industrial Complex, fuelled by Obama's DACA cash - which lures migrants over the southern border no questions asked to give them welfare enticements. They get paid more for 'unaccompanied minors' than they do for a child with their parents - so guess what?  That incentivises kidnapping
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm certain it recycles welfare $ back into the lobbying industry, which is why the Dems and Rino's will protect these assholes to the hilt

            Well , I have posted a similar post earlier.  This is the second arrest I know of .  Magaz Negrete,

            Levian Pacheco faces several charges stemming from incidents that allegedly took place between August and July 2017 at a Southwest Key.....
When asked how the company could assure the public that children are safe ..., Eller wrote: “We find the premise of your question dishonorable.”  I don’t care how they feel or what they think of the question.  It is what it is.  Considering there was an arrest the question is appropriate !
What I find dishonorable is who they employed and what happened.
