            Knowing those they operate and the morality they live by, there is a lot of dis-info in this. They excommunicate members for a reason, which is why the organization as a whole can't be held accountable for the actions of someone who was hiding what terrible thing they are doing. People wouldn't hold Donald Trump accountable if some stupid republican politician was abusing children and he didn't know about it at the time. Once he did he threw him from office. It's the same scenario. There isn't some leader covering up the actions of someone.

             In any organization or situation, the individual is
             <em>
              always
             </em>
             ultimately responsible for their own actions.  This is true.  However, you're making one big error.  You're assuming that everyone disfellowshipped has done something wrong that would make sense in a greater (beyond the JWs) morality.  You're also assuming, by extension, that the JWs disfellowship everyone who has done something morally wrong or illegal.  These are both easily disproven by former member testimony.  The JWs are fanatical about protecting themselves, and reporting criminal activity (like the abuse of children) is routinely forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the real issue is here is
             <em>
              how the organization itself
             </em>
             chooses to deal with members who have done something wrong.  That's the measure of a group, and in that, the JWs fail badly.

            This is laughable and full of blatant lies ! Have you ever researched what JWs believe and why they celebrate the memorial of Jesus Death? Or do you just ask someone that's not a JW what JWs believe and then believe it ?
