<blockquote>
<p>Yes another person with extremely close ties to Hillary Clinton has died a mysterious death, and after seeing what he was involved with it’s hard not to question if foul play was involved.</p>
<p>Houston, Texas trial lawyer and Democrat mega donor Steve Mostyn died on Thursday in what authorities are saying was a “suicide.” But it is worth noting that Mr. Mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past, according to his family, further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died.</p>
<p>He used his wealth to fund numerous Democrat and progressive causes, including the Super PAC “Ready for Hillary,” which he and his wife co-founded with Susie Tompkins Buell, a radical environmentalist and member of George Soros’s Democracy Alliance.</p>
<p>Mr. Mostyn’s wife, Amber, was also a member of the Democracy Alliance and a close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Mostyns were close to the Clintons in general, having held numerous high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary’s failed 2016 presidential run at their Houston home.</p>
<p>However, their relationship came under stress in 2015, when ethics watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a formal complaint against Hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, the Daily Caller reported.</p>
<p>FACT has asked other federal agencies to investigate the Clinton campaign’s dealings. The watchdog sent a letter to the IRS asking it to investigate a $350,000 payment that the Clinton Foundation made to Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign for an email list of potential donors.</p>
<p>The watchdog has also asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate whether Clinton’s campaign illegally obtained an email list of 4 million names from the pro-Clinton super PAC, Ready for Hillary. FACT asserts that the list swap should be considered an in-kind donation — which would constitute illegal coordination between the campaign and PAC.</p>
<p>FACT has also asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to look into an April 21 meeting in which Clinton campaign aides attended a weekly meeting of Senate Democrats. FACT asserts that the meeting violates rule</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton’s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>Just a short time later, Boeing’s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn’s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary’s planned presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The extent of Mr. Mostyn’s ties to the Clintons isn’t fully known. But he seems to have been a major player in their inner circle for years, and the timing of his death is especially concerning as Hillary Clinton has once again found herself at the center of scrutiny for alleged dirty dealings during her time as Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Whether or not Mr. Mostyn killed himself or was murdered, we may never know. However, he was undoubtedly close enough to the Clintons to know enough incriminating information to put them away for a long time, so that gives him quite a bit in common with others who’ve been “Arkancided.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, several months earlier Mostyn publicly announced that he intends to step away from the world of politics in order to spend more time with his family, however, he never mentioned nor declared any mental problems on his behalf.</p>
<p>Here is where things take an interesting turn. His relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was actually very strong up until 2015, when the ethics watch group known as Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust filed a formal complaint against the former presidential candidate accusing her of illegal coordination regarding the Ready for Hillary Super PAC.</p>

<p>This relates to pizzagate because it involves Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Foundation. The Clintons are suspected of having a big role when it comes to pizzagate and child trafficking. Also, the one who died was a big donor to children charities.</p>

            The following comment was made on 10/21 CDAN Blind:   Mostyn made his money suing insurance co on behalf of hurricane victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mostyn was the single biggest donor to the Texas Democratic Party recently-millions of dollars of checks a year. He heavily backed Rick Perry for Republican TX Governor. The dollar amounts described from the A-listers being blackmailed would match with what Mostyn donated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mostyn was based out of Houston, which is a hop, skip and a jump from Nawlins. Plus the Big Easy is well known as a spot where Texas big money types go to indulge peccadilloes they don’t want people back home to know about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mostyn’s death definitely looks like it could have been foul play (“suicide “ from a single gun shot wound) maybe payback or to keep him quiet?  Or if Harvey Pigstein was being blackmailed for his underage fun, and had hired Black Cube of ex-Mossad types to take revenge on his behalf, he'd have gone after the source of the videos. Of course then he'd expect loyalty from other Hollywood celebs who'd been blackmailed and had had to donate $$$ to keep the illicit stories out of the paps.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just speculating here. Other comments refer to the recent arrests and the helicopter crash involving Saudi Princes.

            I read somewhere yesterday that it was his wife who reported that he was suffering from mental problems, and that these mental problems had manifested suddenly within the last six months.  I believe it was reported in a local publication.

            We were told by one of the ANON's that we would see more and more people committing as the walls began closing in. I think it was MEGAanon but I can't be certain.

            I believe he is speaking of U1 guy.  I have heard two theories on this Mostyn.  One, he was one of the indictments and he knew he knew too much or did too much for HRC and she bumped him off. The other he knew too much again no indictment and he was bumped off. I don’t think he pulled the trigger himself, but his wife aka law partner said he had sudden a onset of a mental disorder. I call that knowing the Clintons too well!

             I was thinking maybe the sudden onset of a mental disorder is he knew he was fucked. Maybe he knew he would be going down so he killed himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe Hillary had him suicided because he knew too much.
            </p>
            <p>
             His wife was Hillary's friend. Maybe she went along with the mental disorder story. She might have been a greedy wench like Hillary and now gets his inheritance and at the same time saved herself.

            This article missed the mark if the connection between Boeing/Mostyn/Hillary was the Russia deal.  It was the SAUDI deal during the same year, 2010.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Podesta-Clinton-Saudi connection should be seen in light of the recent media exposes revealing the taudry pay-to-play nature of the Clinton Foundation. Top on the list of foreign donors to the foundation is Saudi Arabia, which contributed between $10 million and $25 million. What did the Saudis get for their largesse and access? Wikileaks revealed a 2009 cable by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying: “More needs to be done since Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Lashkar e-Tayyiba and other terrorist groups.” Instead of sanctioning the Saudis, Clinton did the opposite: She authorized enormous quantities of weapons to be sold to them. On Christmas Eve in 2011, Hillary Clinton and her closest aides celebrated a massive $29.4 billion sale to the Saudis of over 80 F-15 fighter jets, manufactured by Boeing, a company which coincidentally contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation. In a chain of enthusiastic emails, an aide exclaimed that it was “not a bad Christmas present.” I’m sure the Yemenis at the receiving end of the Saudi bombings would not be so enthusiastic.&gt;

            Also in 2010, Boeing made a $2m "donation" to the world's fair in China at Hillary's behest, donated $1m to the CF for a Haiti Childen's fund and wrangled some high speaking fees for Bill Clinton.  All pay for play.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boeing is the key here folks if anyone wants to do some digging.   I'm guessing its the Mostyn/Keating connection.

                Yes, it was suspicious, that the most absurd theories were allowed and even promoted, while any mentioning of the Saudis was ridiculed. But if we think about it, it is totally logical. Saudis = big money. And the deep blackmail state is working FOR, not against the big (money) powers.

                Make sure to read the current Playboy/Hefner topic which brings up excellent questions about the Saudis/Twitter/US-Tech/CIA.

                 Yes, but, not necessarily for the reason you stipulated...

                <p>
                 Oh wait, you said ridiculed... yes, ridiculed by shills, but, also by people who genuinely weren't able to believe it or who were otherwise being swayed by shills - yes, shilling for the worldfuckers/Saud. Something to also understand though, is that nobody was able to paint a picture as to the motive and means Saud might have; it's a sensitive topic and without all the pieces, easily prone to attack; as such, mods were doing the right thing by allowing other threads to stay up while removing Saud related threads in the early days...

                <p>
                 The work everyone has done over the last year, has built one hell of a case, that's for damn sure... it just so happens that it all ties right back to The House of Saud.

             This wasn’t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton’s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
Just a short time later, Boeing’s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn’s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary’s planned presidential campaign.&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            OK does anyone know how Boeing/Russia ties into Mostyn?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because I was literally just researching this $60 billion deal that Obama/Hillary made in 2010 with Boeing/Saudi Arabia - the biggest arms deal in US history at the time.
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to dig up some strange information I found about the Saudi's and Boeing but I can't remember the former Boeing employees name at the moment.  He came into my line of vision during the KSA purge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I can't find why Mostyn is associated with Boeing.  Anyone have info?

             Whoa.  That was the exact paragraph that jumped out at me too.  The joke is that they are so busy trying to pin Russia on just anybody right now, when it is staring them right in the face.  HRC.  Hillary and Russia.  Uranium and now Boeing.  Really.   They are trying to stuff it back in the box, but it is just too big.

               They were gangsters when he was Governor of Arkansas. When the sheriff saw all the evidence he needed on the intermountain airfield, he reported it to who he was supposed to. It got shut down, and he was told the orders were from the top. Good ex-sheriff, but I would not recommend showing up at his house unannounced, for obvious reasons. The new Mena sheriff was put in place by this gang and everyone is scared to talk. Even the remaining good cops are scared. I spent two years there asking questions.

              Yeah I'm convinced Boeing is the key here regarding the OP.  Tim Keating is too far in bed with both the Clintons and Boeing to have not drawn in Mostyn when they partnered up for the SuperPAC.

               I think they knew possibly they were going to start opening an investigation into HER dealings with Russia because of the Deep State's constant hammering of the Russians the Russians.  So they wanted him Out of the Way.  I believe there will be more of this to come.

                 I have a feeling there will be no place to hide for others involved in those deals.  If the news is that there are investigations coming, they will also be suicided.

              Even we here in the UK are getting on the band wagon of 'THE RUSSIANS DID IT!' Unbelieavable. Last week Theresa May made sure she got ahead of ANY of the photographic evidence coming out, by preparing Britain with the 'Russian Fake News' that Hillary Clinton is STILL harping on about even though it has been proven that Russia did nothing over there in the Trump case! DISGUSTING! I reckon that she knows all this photographic truth is going to be released and has planted the thought to the public of the UK that
              <br/>
              1. Its the Russians and 2. The proof will be photo shopped. 
So sadly she, in my opinion, has been compromised by the Clinton thing too and is trying hard to back them up.
              <br/>
              I almost shouted at the tv when I heard her say this, this week (watch video) 😢

                  To be honest I was surprised that she was so blatant, I didn't know she was so obviously 'with her' - I don't think it is that they are dumb so to speak, I think it is that they have no choice they know its up and are hoping that if they keep fighting, it might get covered back up somehow.  They are all delusional 😈🤡

                   They Talk Big AND Cary A Big Stick but they are Scared Stiff, imo.  She sounds rather blatant as you say, and that is evidence to me that she may be coming apart at the seems.  She has put on weight and look at her face.  The circles under the eyes.  Remember these are people that can have all the Plastic Surgery and Facials and Makeup available in the world.  She looks like She Is Going Down The Tubes.  And Losing It.

                    Lol you will find that with a lot of our ladies here, the whole plastic surgery is mostly women around 50 and younger. May is old school and they, I think are of the 'grow old gracefully' era lol - Brits are not as concerned about their looks, take our teeth for example.  🤔🙄

               as soon as I heard about "possible Russian photoshopping of politicians doing very naughty things"  I was CERTAIN it was a pre-emptive strike to be used as an excuse once photos start surfacing.  I'm thinking that whatever photographic evidence was held to blackmail people will start to be released.

               And I'm starting to think that the whole new "sexual assault" narrative is meant to break the public in for the worse things that are coming.

                I understand the thought but I have never bought the "we need to break in the delicate public" strategy. They don't care if the public is shocked by child trafficking. As a matter of fact they probably want the public to be shocked about it because it generates support for the prosecution of the perps. Conditioning the public is done daily by the perps for their evil purposes but for exposing criminals the whole idea of conditioning the delicate public before exposing criminals just does not seem like something that would even fit into the process.
               </p>
               <p>
                The "good guys" would have to be firmly in control and have already won in order to mish mash around with time frames just to soothe the delicate feelings of the public. Not buying it.

                 Good points... but it's not just the "good guys" who would see a benefit for conditioning the public.  Actually the greater benefit is to the bad guys, who can claim it's fake news, bandwaggoning, photoshopping, the Russians...

                  Absolutely. For some reason people are suddenly underestimating the perp's propensity for creating grand narratives and I'm not sure why people bought this. Actually i'm not so sure as many people are buying it as it seems.

                  We have a new fleet of E-Celeb people that came with it like Liz Crokin, Trazy Beanz, and a slew of others. Convincing people that "everbody else believes it" is a perp specialty game too.

                   You bring up a couple of people that very suddenly came into my line of vision as soon as Qanon appeared on the scene, I mean like immediately, I'd never heard of either of them.  Both are a bit on the edge IMO, I watched some podcasts and... I dunno.  Not the most level-headed voices TBH.  Imperator Rex and Thomas Wictor are two others, and although they creep into tinfoil territory a bit, their presentation is more grounded.

              She is 70, defeated and becoming more and more irrelevant. The dems don’t like her either. The Bernie people always hated her. The dems are bankrupt. She is nothing to be distracted over.

               She needs to be brought down to wake people up. The elites know it’s coming. It’s why Saudi control went from a faction controlled by Hillary to a faction controlled by the Rothschilds. They are dumping the Clintons. She was a presidential candidate and she received millions of votes. Exposing the corruption and evil associated with her will change the narrative and things will begin to crumble.

               A man who worked with her has killed himself or has been killed. That tells me this is not a distraction it's a real problem for HER.

               Of all people, I want that wench punished until the day she dies. I wouldn't care if she had a week to live. I would want her miserable. She's a sick evil monster.

                Yes, I agree.  If she had a week to live you can bet she would be made as comfortable as possible.  She deserves to suffer to pay for her sins and all the crimes she committed.

                 As much as I hate to admit it what you say is true. They can sacrifice Hillary's reputation endlessly as a distraction while business goes on as usual. And why would they not do it? I would if I was them.
