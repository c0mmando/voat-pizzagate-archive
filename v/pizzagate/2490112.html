            : I am going to remove the post, since both the title and the body of the post need to be edited, per Rules 2 and 3, and since you already said in your post that you didn't want to share more info (the post would need some pics to source your claims).
           </p>
           <p>
            You can repost to

             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , or you might want to post to

             I'd like to see an encouragement for the fence sitters to post here.  As mods, I think discretion should be used.  Shills, red herrings, etc. apply the rules.  I think the OP is sincere in his requests.  And we should be encouraging, just as we should be survivors, victims, family members, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no other place on the planet I can think of where you have a near real-time collective of SRA, CP, etc. subject matter experts that can answer your questions in real time.  No where else.  There are plenty of assholes here, but mostly those on the side of good.

             <p>
              But we agreed that posts will be removed when both the title and the body of the post need editing. OP can repost with a better title and a link, or repost to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">

              Edit: Otherwise other users will complain that we used discretion in this case, but apply the rules for other users.

               I understand the "zero tolerance" argument as well.  It's a fine line and I'm a big fan of free speech.  But this is a website and chaos will reign if rules aren't applied.  And then this sub becomes useless.

              : I would suggest to repost to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              , many

               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              users go there regularly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before you can repost to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , you would have to meet these edit requirements (please read rules in sidebar):
             </p>
             <p>
              1) The title needs to state what kind of symbology you are seeing (e.g. 'pedo spiral', 'pedo triangle'), and where you see them (e.g. on an Instagram account).
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Each post needs at least one link, like a pic or a linked article / link to an Instagram.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Since a spiral symbolism might be innocent, and we don't want to instigate witch hunts, usually we don't accept posts about shops or businesses that show only one 'pedo symbol'. Since this is a school, and there seem to be a variety of pedo symbols used, imo we'd accept it in this case. Further evidence how the school's activities could be linked to pedophilia would be welcomed though.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can repost the post as is to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              , it would be good to include at least one pic though or link to their Instagram, so that users will know what you are talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              The mods cannot repost, so please copypaste the text into a new submission sheet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you.
             </p>
             <p>
              P.S.: Since you talked about reporting it  (to the police?) I wouldn't do that, since they won't investigate it, just based on the spiral symbolism, and you would doxx yourself.

               I have since taken some pics and going to crop and upload. I DO want to have at least some anonomity with where I live, as it's a pretty small town. I will post pics, but I'm not going to post identifiers. The people here would be local.

                I think raising awareness is a big first step to stop these things. So many people have become aware during the past year. I realize it every time I read comment sections of newpapers.

               Whatever you post will be seen by the pedos.  I'm pretty sure they have a few cubicles at NCMEC staffed 24x7 logging everything on this sub.

               Run your images through an EXIF stripper then use a file hosting service.  I'm not sure what is and is not "secure", if anything, anymore.

                And no, don't report to police.  If it is part of the school logo, the pedo cops are in on it too.  That's in your face shit.

            Can you post the logo?  Is it on the schools's website?  I know what you mean.  They are flying under the radar but to eyes that are WOKE they are not.  We need to see it and we can find more and help you post them here.  Just post the School's Website.  We can go from there.

             Carmencita. They removed my post for it being vague. That was intentional though. You know why? I'm going to post the schools website, and then you are "going to take it from there". What would you do exactly? I'll give you proof - but I'm not letting anyone just start emailing the school or what have you.

             There was  reason I was obscure, and the internet getting involved in an irresposible way was just my reason.

              Usually we don't contact the school, much too dangerous.  We would just go into the website and view what you have seen and some of us may see new things.  The reason for us to post this is for people coming to this site to see that these situations Are Real.  Also in case some live near there, they are aware as well.  We would never email one of the places we have exposed for that might dox or expose us as well.  At this point you can decide what you want to do with your information.
