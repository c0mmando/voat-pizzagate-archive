            Thought Goaters might be interested in the following CDAN Blinds of the past all with about Singer:
Blind Items Revealed #3
November 6, 2017
This A list director is calling in every card possible and is having stories about his predatory ways killed in articles and other press accounts. His lawyers are working overtime at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Blind Items Revealed #2
December 2, 2017
Sexual harassment wouldn't get this A list director to stand down and honestly, it probably wouldn't get him fired. He would just be suspended. The underage sex he is trying to write checks for right now though would end his career. Although, cc: Woody Allen.
Bryan Singer (Guess the check wasn't big enough considering the lawsuit filed yesterday)

            HAHA - Somebody's got to make a GIF using that scene from Return of The King where Legolas is on the Aliphant bringing it down and fucking up all those dark soldiers. Paste the VOAT goat head on Legolas, and all the fucking pervo kiddie diddler faces on the dark soldiers. - lol Love it. - Better yet, why not redo the whole fucking movie. - All the members of the fellowship are goats, Gandalf can be 4Chan, and every other character in the movie that is bad can be represented by one of the now proven thousands of fucking pedos and rapists that have been uncovered. - Special guest appearances by all the old child stars coming forward Feldman, etc. - lol Yeah. Fucking BRING THEM DOWWWWWWNNNNN!!!!!!!!   -

             If you and your parents have the wants for a big lucrative Hollywood career then you will put up with a lot.  Parents should not let any underage child work in Hollywood or any of the associated agencies - ad agencies, modeling agencies etc.  Can't help an 18 year old who makes that choice, although parents can teach values of not wanting lots of money and stuff.  But parents can keep their kids from acting and being part of a scene that is thoroughly corrupt and dangerous if they themselves have values that put other things above money.  Some may be naive about Hollywood, but acting in Hollywood IS about making money and gaining fame and they must approve of that to let their kids do it.

             Bullshit.  In today's society even grown adults are conditioned to the level of regressed children give me a break.  Try and remember when you were 17 and how clueless you were about the world.  Yeah 17 is not a baby but guaranteed I'm sure you wouldn't want your child being forced to take the penis of a grown man who has had hundreds of partners.  Unreal,  the offense alone shows he wasn't old enough or strong enough to fight back,  leave or make a verbal decision right there and then.  Morons and their justifications.

              Perhaps Americans are particularly immature and need protecting into adulthood. Doesn't mean everyone else of a similar age is that pathetic or retarded. In my country you can get married, join the army or have gay sex at 16. We should be focusing here on children who can't defend themselves.

              <p>
               The level of programming here in America is preposterously complex. However I fail to see how those three things you mentioned in your comment are signs of maturity considering you are advocating them at an age where regardless of your culture you are locked in a mode of responsibility that only allows so much spiritual and intellectual growth, and once again only based on your education, level of education, local culture and religious beliefs, and finally, I am hard pressed to believe that regardless of wherever you are from there isn't a similar matrix of conditioning that you are subject to.

               There is a very valid point there, and, ultimately, therein lies the goal, recognition that for decades less fortunate children in care, adoption and institutionalized settings were used, abused, mentally, physically and sexually for ritual and blackmail purposes to transform government and fulfill ancient luciferian rites by those Jews that call themselves Jews but are not, satanic luciferian pagan druidic greek egyptian babylonian sumerian nephilim annunaki worshiping Enkianites.

                 What he's saying is true. These people aren't just sickos who like to do it with little kids. They have a far more sinister motive. Satanic Rituals and Adrenochrome are what truly drives them to do these things.

             And you are however right, the always ambient message X-MEN has promoted is that if you are different, ie, LGBTQP, then you are special but... hunted and hated by 'humanity', therefore, bring the fight to them first and fight hard.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you'll notice this kind of veracity, ferocity, look, aura and style are very similar to the monkeys that imitate that fake heroism in groups like ANTIFA.

             It's a bit more involved than that. His movies are a loose adaptation of the mk-ultra project and Hitler's Ubermensch. I'm very convinced that Singer is intimately aware of the connections between the Nazi party, the occult, occult cabalism/heretical Judaism/Zionism, and homosexuality and this entity is somehow part of his protection nexus.

            In the first X-Men film there were a lot of random kids playing the pupils of the school. You can imagine how many kids must've turned up hoping for a part in such a big film. Sick Singer must've been like a kid in a candy store.

            Gotta love that number of this kids age 17.

            17 is the 6th real prime number. (6)
           </p>
           <p>
            17 is the third two digit prime number 3 x 2 = (6)
           </p>
           <p>
            1 -7 = (6)

            Wish it was a criminal suit instead of a civil suit but we will take what we can get. Makes me wonder if the kid went to the police and got ignored. This suit will likely get settled for big money and not see a court room.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe it will embolden others who will file CRIMINAL charges and we can see Bryan Singer go to jail. I have a feeling his wallet is going to get a lot lighter in the coming year.

             Pretty sure they aren't raping 17 year olds because of the number 666. Satanists rape children for many reasons... but I have a hard time believing this mathemagic. lol

            Singer's pedophelia is well known in Hollywood.  I wonder how many of the bullshit "I never knew"s are going to come out of the Hollywood spin machine. Maybe Singer or Geffen are signing a big check right now, and this will disappear soon.

             I am sure that many clubs for kids or organizations are told there will be a party for them including eats and music.  Orphanages, boys and girls clubs, etc.  These people know exactly how to attract and stock their pedo parties.

            Yup, our indie journalists were correct in anticipating this coming down. They spoke about it a couple of day's ago.

            Absolutely believe this charge. But it's about time Singer went to jail for one of the crimes he committed!!!! Why hasn't he been charged? Why ONLY sued?!!!!

             Anyone can bring a civil suit.  A criminal suit is based on whether the prosecutor believes there is enough evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  In civil suits, the decision is based on the preponderance of the evidence.  They are two very different standards.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, DAs have prosecutorial discretion, which may have played a role in not bringing criminal charges against this disgusting jew fag.

             I'm always wondering that myself.  And the last round of sexual allegations came when his last x-men movie was released.  Not saying the charges aren't legitimate but...  the singer allegations always have a strange flavor to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing much ever comes from litigation either I've noticed and not many people are observing the serial nature of these offenses,  these in and of themselves suggest deeper more disturbing proclivities that are never breached by the MSM.  No motive is explored,  meaning both Singer,  Spacey and McKellan have a deep and morbid ties and fascinations with Nazis and from what it seems Spacey and Singer both share a avid interest in some sort of sadomasicism.

              Oh, man! You just reminded me of something! Mel Gibson was supposedly a memorabilia collector, but it's Sandra Bullock I'm focusing on. Remember all that shit with he ex-husband? Said she liked him to dress up as a Nazi and smear feces on her and call her names? I always felt it was true. There was supposed to be a video, but it never materialized. No doubt he was paid off or threatened. But knowing what we know now? She definitely is into that. So now I'm wondering what this Nazi crap is about?

               The charges need to be spelled out in the media.  Assault charges is not enough of an explanation.  The public needs to hear the gory details.  Shock them into a Wake Up State.

                Yes, but that goes in with normalization. They're lumping in someone asking a staffer to be a surrogate, groping, drugging a minor and raping them, asking someone out, walking around nude in your office, locking a colleague in your office and physically attacking them, and being a serial child predator. All these things are different and are being lumped together under "assault" in this #metoo crap. No! A pedo is NOT a sex offender! They are a PEDO!!!! A vile sick, twisted person that never stops abusing children!!!! It's ridiculous that the graphic details are not given because that's what separates crimes.

                Ever watch Dexter? He had a pretty nice boat that he often used to dump bodies into the ocean to make them disappear.

                In a yacht not only is there less chance of someone hearing or seeing something, but it is really easy to toss someone over and be done with them.

                International waters may be one answer, but I also think it makes the victims feel isolated, a feeling that they can't get away even if they had the chance.  It is also an elite thing to have yachts, something no one else has.  Instead of a home or in a hotel where people can be heard, why not a yacht way out away from shore.  Vile Vermin Is What They Are.
