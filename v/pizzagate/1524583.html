<p>Seriously, this &quot;operation&quot; has private adoption agencies, psychologist/psychiatrists, medical records companies, ties to Nicaragua that could be used for money laundering, software companies, connections to China, and access to vulnerable children. It’s the same set-up as the Finders operation. Look at the similarities: </p>

<p>Paris and China: “Under Varga\'s instructions, Pettie recruited a network of agents in Europe,
including Dr. Keith Arnold (recruited in Paris in 1958) who he accompanied to
Moscow in 1959 or 1960. Arnold, currently based in Hong Kong with the Roche
Foundation, has made over 40 trips to mainland China …”
Virginia: “In the early 60s Pettie allowed Ralph Borsodi and Mildred Loomis to use his Virginia property”
Set up a futuristic network: “In 1967 or 1968 Pettie established a \'futurist, network, assisting Edward S. Cornish in founding the World Future Society ...”
Psychologists/behavior modification: “Pettie infiltrated the \'human potential\' movement, setting up Ken Kesey (Living Love) as a prominent guru and working through Dr. Stephen Beltz (related to Judith Beltz, a behavior modification specialist more recently deployed to the Institute of Cultural Affairs and the Meta Network cult.” </p>

<p>Look, right now there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. Yes, there are parallels and suspicions, but we need evidence and to get evidence, we need to dig! This is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>',

            Yes, that whiny f*ck JA is in the middle of this. He can cry all he wants to, I don't feel one ounce of sympathy for him -- not after I see what he's written and posted. He's scum ... less than scum. If this new administration doesn't take this seriously, these people will go on ruining young lives. #draintheswamp

            Thanks. Yes, it was orchestrated. No doubt. Like any other well-oiled machine, it didn't form by itself. The thing that's getting to me is how hidden this is. I did searches for Patti Paule-Carres until they were coming out my ears and NOTHING about her owning an art gallery in Amsterdam. Then I take a flyer and do something ridiculous and KERPOW! There it is. It makes no sense. This is an art gallery we're talking about. Her family counseling services and art gallery should be the first things to pop up in a search, but she's not advertised anywhere even though these are her businesses and profession. How the hell are they suppressing this? It's probably why that damned business Gusifer isn't coming. There's probably something that'll trigger the info, but until then, it remains hidden.

            This is amazing.   Do we have another picture of patti to compare (linkedin or fb?), or have they all been scrubbed?   (Call me a moron/shill again, but if we can tie her to both websites visually, it'd be a slam dunk!)

             Glenn Noel Paule Carres has a facebook page ( i'm not a facebooker but maybe if you are, there might be pics there. I noted his bio to QK above, it looks like he went to Knox College with John Podesta and probably thats how he meet Patti. Also Carres is Patti's maiden name ( he added it).

              i still think that the 124 amherst property is what needs to be concentrated on.  the 'paulecarre' site isn't 'paulcarres', the gallery isn't 'paulcarres'.  i mean - keep looking at it if you want, but it just doesn't grab me the way it appears to grab you.
             </p>
             <p>
              i've found two more businesses associated with the 124 amherst property - bringing it to 16, and two more medical practitioner names.  I'm convinced that if something sketchy is going on, that property is the most likely way to find it.  shoot - the consistent violations should be enough of a smoking gun to kick off at least a state-based investigation.

              I wonder what came first, the family enterprise or the Podesta's political connections. I remember that JP worked for Eugene McCarthy so maybe these grew hand in hand? Have you dug up Glenn's family?
