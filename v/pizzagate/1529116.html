<p>Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused of trafficking underage females.... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgNCKBXNwaQYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgNCKBXNwaQYouTube</a>, shared the tail number of his Bell Long Ranger 206L3 helicopter (tail number N474AW) with a U.S. State Department OV-10D Bronco.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration database, Epstein\'s Bell helicopter and the Bronco owned by the U.S. State Department and contracted to the private military company Dyncorp for &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; and &quot;counter-narcotics&quot; operations in Larandia, Colombia used the same N474AW tail number.</p>
<p>Search &quot;Dyncorp&quot; - <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X20545&amp;ntsbno=MIA00GA083&amp;akey=1">http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20001212X20545&amp;ntsbno=MIA00GA083&amp;akey=1</a> / <a href="http://archive.is/IGqas">http://archive.is/IGqas</a></p>
<p>According to a flight manifest filed by Epstein\'s pilot David Rodgers on August 6, 2002, the Bell helicopter (N474AW) flew from Epstein\'s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico to the Double Eagle II airport outside of Albuquerque.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, is the fact that a Cessna Model P210N aircraft also uses tail number N474AW. That aircraft, according to FAA records, was registered with the tail number N474AW on August 1, 2014 and is owned by Centurion Aviation LLC, 677 Greentree Lane, Ada, Michigan.</p>
<p>The previous plane listed by the FAA as a &quot;Multiple Record&quot; N474AW assignee was the Bronco used by Dyncorp under contract to the owner: &quot;United States Department of State, 1038 S. Patrick Drive #985, Patrick Air Force Base, Brevard County, Florida 32925-3516.&quot; The Bronco was reported by the FAA to be registered on October 21, 1997 and de-registered on May 14, 2010. However, the Bronco registered as N474AW crashed while flying a drug eradication mission in Colombia on February 6, 2006. The name of the pilot, who survived but was badly injured after ejecting, was not released due to &quot;national security&quot; reasons.</p>
<p>Rodgers\'s manifest for August 6, 2002 lists the Bell helicopter flight from Epstein\'s Zorro Ranch to Double Eagle II as flying under the tail number of N474AW. It is also noteworthy that unlike other Epstein planes piloted by Rodgers and which included as passengers Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, model Naomi Campbell, Clinton economic adviser Ira Magaziner, actor Kevin Spacey, Sandy Berger, and Larry Summers, no passengers are listed on the Zorro to Double Eagle one-way helicopter flight.</p>

<p>FAA records and Epstein\'s pilot\'s flight manifest indicate that Epstein\'s Bell helicopter used the same tail number of N474AW. This was the same tail number used until 2006 by State Department contractor Dyncorp for counter-insurgency operations in Latin America.</p>
<p>The congruence of Epstein\'s Bell N474AW and Dyncorp\'s Bronco N474AW is noteworthy. In 2002, the year Epstein\'s aircraft fleet stands accused of flying underage teen girls, some between the ages of 12 and 15, coincides with Dyncorp\'s trafficking in underage females between the ages of 12 and 15 from Kosovo and Bosnia in the Balkans.</p>
<p>One Dyncorp whistleblower reported to The Washington Times\'s Insight magazine\'s Kelly O\'Meara in 2002 the following on one Dyncorp employee in Bosnia: &quot;[he] owned a girl who couldn\'t have been more than 14 years old. It\'s a sick sight anyway to see any grown man [having sex] with a child, but to see some 45-year-old man who weighs 400 pounds with a little girl, it just makes you sick.&quot;</p>

<p>Tail number N474AW has been shared between Epstein\'s Bell helicopter like the one in this photo - <a href="https://sli.mg/Da68qr.pngPNG">https://sli.mg/Da68qr.pngPNG</a> , Cessna - <a href="https://sli.mg/hOcqX6.pngPNG">https://sli.mg/hOcqX6.pngPNG</a> , and State Department Bronco <a href="https://sli.mg/TvJprb.pngPNG">https://sli.mg/TvJprb.pngPNG</a> / <a href="https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=131898">https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=131898</a> / <a href="http://archive.is/HTiPM">http://archive.is/HTiPM</a></p>
<p>The descriptions of sex between adult males and underage females by Dyncorp employees in Bosnia in the 2000-2002 time frame coincides with descriptions of sex between Epstein and his influential friends and similarly-aged young girls on Epstein\'s aircraft and residences in Palm Beach, Florida; New Mexico; and on the island of Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Among the &quot;Jane Does&quot; filing suit against the U.S. government for concluding a sweetheart Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) between Epstein, his co-conspirators, and the U.S. Justice Department are a number of females with Slavic-sounding first names like &quot;Tatianna&quot;and &quot;Natalya&quot; and Slavic last names like Metrovitch, Malyshov, and Mulinska. Such names are found in countries like Bosnia and Kosovo, where Dyncorp employees were also trafficking in teenage girls.</p>

<p>As with the Justice Department\'s and FBI\'s investigation of Epstein, the U.S. Army\'s Criminal Investigation Division (CID) largely buried the investigation of Dyncorp and underage female trafficking. The connection of N474AW to both Epstein and Dyncorp may be much more than mere coincidence. In the world of criminal investigations, this type of information is known as &quot;leads&quot; that often connect to hard evidence of criminal conspiracies.</p>

            This investigation needs more focus on the CF top donors, Gates and Rockefellers, who run the WHO, and Webb says it was the WHO which shipped arms to Syria in UN trucks. With Dyncorp you have a military contractor which traffics people, owns patents on viruses and does helicopter runs in areas its own patented virus shows up.  Arms, trafficking, disease.

            Sarin is useful for clearing area or taking over areas militarily.  So are diseases which can "break out" wherever anyone wants (and did that where the WHO, UN, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), ran their vaccine campaigns.  When MSF pushed WHO to declare a pandemic (which comes with military control) and WHO spokesman denied it was an epidemic, he died immediately after in MH17 crash over Ukraine.

            Centurion Aviation is Amway. It is their own private airline for executives and to bring in outsiders to the very secure Amway campus. Don't ask me how I know, but I will say that I live just a few minutes away from the Amway world headquarters in Ada. You can trace Centurion back to the VanAndel and Devos families.  Both families are extremely involved in shady politics.  ...and guess who was just appointed as education secretary?

            I'll said it again like I did in the first thread: It's a really strange coincidence that reg. no. N474AW doesn't appear in any major aviation photography database despite the fact that it's been used on at least three types in the last several years. Somebody really doesn't want it to get noticed.

            I have not had a chance to totally fact check but this month old reddit article pricked my ears up when they started talking about the same conflict and how Soros and Clinton were involved in the destabilization &amp; Dyncorp.

             U.S. State Department Tied To Child Trafficking Operation With Billionaire Epstein (Video)

            Interesting is  FAA records and Epstein’s pilot’s flight manifest indicate that Epstein’s Bell helicopter used the same tail number of N474AW. This was the same tail number used until 2006 by State Department contractor Dyncorp for counter-insurgency operations in Latin America.

            The day of reckoning is coming. The public is awakening. It takes different people different times for their "light bulb" moment to come, but it is happening. Every day you hear about someone saying that they thought PizzaGate was a joke until (fill in the blank) and now they are true believers. We are coming for you so you better get ready.

            A few additional, relevant facts:
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein's house butler Alfredo Rodriguez identified several people who either participated or had knowledge of the inner workings of Epstein's child sex trafficking ring.
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#Additional_Material_Witnesses_or_Participants">
             http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#Additional_Material_Witnesses_or_Participants
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Among them were NM governor Bruce King
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Bruce_King">
             http://pizzagate.wiki/Bruce_King
            </a>
            , who Epstein bought the Zorro Ranch from, and Bill Richardson, NM governor from 2003 to 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Zorro Ranch is also the largest private dwelling in NM and has 10,000 surrounding acres. It is known for being secluded.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also incorporate Jean Luc Brunel into the above facts of this post.
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#MC2_Modeling_Agency.2C_Jean_Luc_Brunel.2C_and_Accusations_of_Sex_Trafficking">
             http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#MC2_Modeling_Agency.2C_Jean_Luc_Brunel.2C_and_Accusations_of_Sex_Trafficking
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Brunel is a well known participant in Epstein's international trafficking ring. Brunel and Epstein used Brunel's modeling agency, MC2, to bring underage girls from Eastern Europe to various countries for sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Citations are on the Pizzagate.Wiki page of Jeffrey Epstein
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">
             http://pizzagate.wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein
            </a>
            , which goes in depth, though even that page didn't have this new info.

            Of course all of this starts with CIA, MIKULTRA -- assassinations, torture, sexual abuse.
But also too much going on not to be connected to, run by/protected by the highest military power - Pentagon
And, as I recall all of it -- Operations Mockingbird, Paperclip, Gladio (and who knows how many hundreds of other programs for secret destruction of US?) -- high ranking Nazis were also visiting Pentagon two years before end of WWII.

               was not deleted, only their post was. I think what confused you was Voat's unintuitive phrasing (
               <em>
                submitted 11 hours ago by [deleted]
               </em>
               ) that seems to suggest the OP has been deleted, while in reality it only means the post itself has been deleted.

             wow...  you know what I'm thinking?   I think that some of these deep and well referenced posts are coming from whistle blowers...   furthermore, this and many other very revealing and meaty posts were deleted today by a mole moderator who was exposed by milleniumfalcon ( see other thread )

              I think everyone who is either leaking from the inside or outsiders smart enough to gather evidence are putting enough out now so that even if something... big... happened before the 20th, there would still be nationwide call for investigation. Timing is always important.

             Something about Dyncorp hit a nerve.  A mod with an almost 2 year old account went rogue and started deleting threads.  I assume OP was caught up in that.
