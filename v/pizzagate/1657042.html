I posted about Jamie T’s involvement in this whole JA/CP thing a few weeks ago and called out Petworth as a major place of interest. It was where Jamie T moved and seemed to be on the Majestic Apes target list for infestation and cannibalization. It was disturbingly near Pegasus Museum. Here’s the link to the old post:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1566940">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1566940</a> In it, I describe how the minions of the Cannibal Queen takeover a neighborhood. </p>
<p>As for Petworth, I found this blog post: <a href="http://archive.is/0ol5d">http://archive.is/0ol5d</a> In it, it describes the infiltration of Latin American brothels in Petworth. One of the thing it points out is that they use coded messages. One of the messages mentioned is a pair of wings. Seems a pair of wings means:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“they will deliver a prostitute to the customer.” ~~~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>So there you go. Is this why Pegasus was chosen to represent this “museum”? Was it a “delivery service”? The &quot;orders&quot; could have come through that encrypted area of CP, and the &quot;takeout&quot; delivered by Pegasus Museum. (There were numerous emails/instagram pics of vans.) These are the types of clues we’re missing because we’re not well-versed in the jargon. And I’d like to remind everyone, that we were going by the date of sale of the Pegasus Museum. In the above link, I pointed out pictures were being taken of it in 2007 and speculated that the property was important to them long before we thought. This turned out to be true. The graffiti (“KIDS”) outside Pegasus Museum was thought not to be affiliated with this crowd because of the dates, but it, in fact, fits in perfectly with when they took possession. </p>
<p>As long as I’m posting, I wanted to give some other links that show human trafficking a major problem in the DC/Petworth area. There’s this heat map showing high volume trafficking spots. Cali and DC/Maryland/Virginia are the winners for doing absolutely nothing to prevent this despite all the blustering and posturing about being such women’s rights and child advocates. Link: <a href="http://archive.is/QCnvk">http://archive.is/QCnvk</a> </p>
<p>I also wanted to post another blog by this Prinz of Petworth. <a href="http://archive.is/LePa8">http://archive.is/LePa8</a> It’s about a prostitution bust, but I’m posting for another reason: the comments. Look how the cannibal elite get the narrative/lie they want spread by effective use of social media. The narrative is that the “victims” of the sex trade should not be charged with a criminal offense and propagate that it’s this reason that human trafficking is spreading. No! That’s not the reason. We need criminal enforcement to separate the victim from the pimp. The biggest reason for the proliferation is: OPEN BORDERS coupled with our leaders/law makers. When the people in positions are getting a cut of the pie, they’re not going to want the goose that lays the golden egg touched. But this bombarding social media sites with this message translates into mindless zombies repeating this message without knowing what damage they’re doing. </p>
<p>As always, keep the faith that the truth will prevail and dig, dig, dig!!!</p>

            It read, 640 BMS and it obviously wasn't a random tag. Could be an address, like a pick up place. I  never did figure it out though..

            Just went to give up vote and saw its another gem from quantokitty (love the name).  I hope soon in the future the amazing folks on voat/Reddit/4chan get recognition awards for their amazing contribution to taking down the global pedo ring, as long as Trump stays safe we can achieve this.  Don't forget Neon Nettle mass prayer/meditation on 25/2.
Q. how many UK based folks on here?

              That's a gift to be able to see and correlate symbols like that. Good work. I do believe you're on to something. What innocent person would correlate angel wings with such a thing. That makes the use of the symbol able to fly under the radar yet at the same time project the message.

             Yeah, it makes sense to have the orders go through that central point. It wouldn't attract any attention because they did take orders. And think about it also being perfect for money laundering. All that cash that comes in would have been counted as profits from the sale of pizza. Who knows how they worded things. "Unannounced specials?" "Slices that are perfect for sharing?" No one would know what they meant except those the messages were intended for. I mean, I would have never known what wings meant until I read that blog.

            The Pegasus website is down, but it's on archive.org still. Is there a possible connection between Project Pegasus and the Pegasus museum, or am I reaching too far here?

            Lots of symbols related to flying... Might be reaching but "somewhere over the rainbow" comes to mind. As is widely known, it's associated with mkultra. Flying seems to be a metaphor for drug and/or trauma induced dissociation, which would also explain the butterfly symbol.

             The butterfly symbol comes from the Monarch butterfly and Project Monarch (the current name of MK-ULTRA) is named after it specifically. It was the first living thing that was discovered to pass on location information genetically - Monarch butterflies return to their places of birth. The idea is that if you condition children at an early enough age, they will always return to do your bidding.

             Not reaching. Notice in the Demi Moore video where she's kissing the fifteen-year-old, the singer suddenly begins singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow while this is going on.

              Yeah, Demi just snaps to attention when it starts. I just wonder if it's part of the same metaphor, and if it's only a reference to dissociation, or something more.

               Have no idea, but, yes, she does react which is weird in itself. The fact she's sucking this kid's face off when it happens is just plain bizarre.
