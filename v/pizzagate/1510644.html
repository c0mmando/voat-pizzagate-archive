            I don't think anyone accused her of doing this in her performance art but it is playing with real occult beliefs like the writings of Aleister Crowley. Spirit cooking has been around alot longer than ambramovic. I think it definitely leads ppl down the path to thelema or like minded rituals intentionally

            I am an artist and I can tell you that from my experiences in Los Angeles and New York, there is among some, a very dark satanic element reflected in their art. I declined invitations to their gatherings but people in the art world know about this. Please, don't be so naive. If it looks like smells like it and has blood dripping off of it....

            I have a question: 
1. What exactly are you suggesting with your links about spirit cooking? What truth are you trying to prove? 
2. Are you trying to disprove something with the links you provjded, if so exactly what? 
I find myself confused about your theory you are proposing or debunking.

             I'm trying to show that Spirit Cooking is much broader than most people realize. It has many recipes, and most of them have nothing to do with Satanism. Up to this point, people have been posting misleading information by cherry-picking one recipe and then saying that recipe defines what Spirit Cooking is. They then say that Spirit Cooking is about Satanism, but if that were true, wouldn't all of the recipes be about Satanism?

              Pizzagate has moved on from abromavich go back to hanging out with your friends valued at 10 mil, or more. This investigation is about saving children from torture! You are more worried about that over privelidged disgusting untalented witch who uses the label of art to get away with things that would have anyone else locked up  in an insane asylum. The things the rich get away with shock me! if You seem to  care more about that low class old woman's reputation and justifying her arti than rescuing children? Because that is how you sound. Set your priorities, abromovich is a non issue and she only has herself to blame if her reputation is damaged.

               I suggest you read the other comments in this thread if you think everybody has moved on from her. My priorities include removing false leads from the equation. Don't you try to do remove false leads? If not, don't you care about rescuing children?

                Nothing is false yet, it is still in discovery stage there is not even a search warrant or an official investigation. When did you investigate and make a complete determination. You are trying to sway public opinion with weak arguments that lack reasoning or coherence. The investigation has only begun, nowhere near concluded and only then when a full accounting of the evidence is analyzed can a judge or a jury say innocent or guilty. In fact abromavich is not even afforded the presumption of innocence until she is charged. In the eyes of the public she is a low class trashy woman who plays with bodily fluids who is put on a pedestal by pedofiles and cannabils that eat baby penises. She seems very very guilty and very very involved. When the investigation is formalized she will be afforded the right to an attorney and a presumption of innocence. You are out of your league here.

                 "False lead" means something that does not fit with a hypothesis, which is a part of a hypothesis investigation. I also think it's disingenuous to say this investigation has only just begun. Thousands and thousands of people have been investigating for months. Possibly hundreds of thousands. Much of it is data collection from what people had been putting out there for years. Some agencies have been involved as well, and we're seeing pedophile rings fall at a rate I've never seen in my lifetime, with many of the tip-offs coming from the USA. Keep puffing up your chest, because you don't know what you are talking about.

                  What is the hypothesis? A false lead? Abromavich is a false lead though she was in fact the gate that revealed the canabilism pedofilia organ harvesting trafficking corruption blackmail. I don't call that a false lead I call that a major connection. You might wish it was false because that would mean she would not have to stand before a grand jury and testify but the pizzagate will come to light whether you like it or not everything in darkness will come to light....amen those children will be avenged.they are crying for justice.

                The lead is not false it was abromovichs invitation to podesta for her spirit cooking event. In fact based on your defense and shilling for abromavich it is clear that she needs to be further investigated. You are clearly as disgusting and low class as she is. Abromavich is filthy and belongs in the insane asylum. In addition why does she associate with so many pedofiles and sexual degenerates? She was the gateway to pizzagate. As for you thank you CTR for showing us exactly where to dig. Thank you for confirming that this scum witch needs to further investigated. Go back and hang out with your poor 10 million dollar worth friends. Go find a forum of like minded people. You don't belong in pizzagate. No one agrees with you and everyone sees through your tactics. Abromavich should have been more particular of the company she keeps. There is an old saying tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are.  Be careful and selective of the company you keep: one day this might come back to haunt you too.

            Okay, so you don't actually think she's doing anything wrong, she's just an occult artist that hangs around rich Democrats. Do we really even disagree then? I'm basically saying that Spirit Cooking has more recipes than most people talk/know about, and that there isn't much evidence of her being directly involved. It seems that we agree.

            I personally seen a photo of the Crowley devotee witch holding a +_ 7 month old naked baby girl and pointing to the baby's private parts. For obvious reasons I was not able to save and share the image.  This is not OK with me or the majority of people on here.  Everything about her shrieks occult/canabilism.  I don't know why atheist4thecorse is trying so hard to defend her, perhaps you have been appointed her PR and realise you've backed a loser.

             I'm defending her because I think that the evidence points more towards her not being involved than being involved at this point (unless new evidence comes forward). If I was on her PR team then I'd actually get paid. :p

            Source please. Someone else posted her actual words if you want to look through it and it wasn't this. She was basically explaining when something is art and not art (a true dichotomy). She wasn't necessarily explaining when something was literally satanic or not satanic. And it's not surprising that her dichotomy was about art, since after all, her expertise is as an artist.

            Yeah, that twitter account where she uses 666 (must be an accident she picked those numbers), carving the pentagram into herself, the pic with the goats head, her own spirit cooking recipe (with blood, semen, breast milk), Alefantis speaking at Tony Podesta's house with an image of Ambramovic playing behind him mean absolutely nothing. Its all rainbows and unicorns.   Also who is the "they" you are talking about?

             Okay, so prove the covert side. There's no much actual evidence to prove that connection from what I've seen. Basically, she said art is only art with proper context, people jumped to a conclusion on what that meant, and then there was an email of her going to a private supper.

             Okay, so a lot of that stuff has absolutely nothing to do with Satanism, and it's the same stuff repeated over and over and over to make it look like there is more information than there really is. So a lot of those pictures where she is beat up actually has to do with a performance she did. She laid out a bunch of items and told people they could do whatever they wanted to her with the items. One of the items was a loaded gun btw, to give you an idea of how extreme her body art can be. In another performance, she almost died. These kinds of extreme body art that many, MANY artists do, does not prove that she's a satanic religious leader of the elites. Sure, there's some imagery in there which can be viewed as satanic, and that can count for something, but I don't see how that's enough to make the leap people are making because there are alternate explanations. But much of what is on this site is not Satanic at all, and I don't see the pedophilia thing you were talking about.

             I think this is key. She's talking about what defines art or not. So she's saying that if you do the same performance at an art exhibit and then in a private house, it's art in the art exhibit and not in the private house. That does not necessarily mean, however, that Spirit Cooking in a private home (most recipes which have nothing to do with blood, semen, breast milk, or anything like that btw), is necessarily done for literal human sacrifice or anything like that. For instance, you could file it under entertainment. You could file it under spirituality as she mentioned. You could file it under education. It depends on who is doing it and why.
            </p>
            <p>
             And still, you have not dealt with any of the evidence I have presented. Spirit Cooking is not just the one recipe that you saw the Youtube video of. Are you ever going to attempt to deal with that?

               Yes, if you have the proper evidence that this was the recipe they were using and had evidence of the context on why they were doing it. You don't have that evidence, though. And quit trying to distract from the actual information by talking about my "tone".

                  her contribution to pizzagate was she was mentioned in the wiki leaks of john podesta. She was a minor player but once the investigation uncovered spirit cooking (canabilism) a barrage of questions came forward. Why are the political elite supporting a controversial artist that offends so many of the constituents? Why is john podesta fascinated with canibalism? One thing led to another and the whole pizzagate has been unfolding....If not for abromavich we would never have known about pizzagate. On a side note where there is smoke there is fire and she descends from a geneology of witches pedofiles and blood drinkers. 
She is wealthy and is valued by the political elite.  I will add the link in a sec.
Also remember the pic of alefantis and podesta at their birthday of a baby penis. 
I will dig that one up too if you have not seen it...it ties back to cooking and eating humans, in other words spirit cooking. Let's all thank abrimavich for helping to expose the pizzagate cover up!

                   It's not true to say that if not for Abramovic we wouldn't have known about #PizzaGate. #PizzaGate started because of the Podesta emails that included different foods that looked like a pedophile code. It didn't originally have anything to do with Satanism.

                    Why are you trying to limit the scope of pizzagate first to pedofilia  and then say that spirit cooking is not part of the scope of  pizzagate? This is a tactic used by defense attorney and media to steer public opinion. Pizzagate is an evolving and growing investigation. No one has defined pizzagate to pedofilia. Please provide a source that say pizzagate is only specifically about pedofilia code words. In fact I would say that is what fake news does and that is how hey say they debunk it. You remind me of Megan Kelly. But you will not be allowed to spew your garbage and false fallacies here. I have gone to the trouble to include the original email of spirit cooking and yes it started with abromavich and code words, and alefantis and ping pong and now it is known to be a global ring of political leaders . We see through your word games and nonsense, people here are awake to those tactics that have worked in the past to unsuspecting people. Go back in your lair and report back to your coven that you failed you are unconvincing and full of lies. Abromavich will be continued to be investigated. Ask her for mercy you will get no mercy here shame on you.

                      you don't know any other tricks do you? Your word games are weak. I am still waiting for the proof that pizzagate is limited to code words. Let me know when you can supply that. That was your premise wasn't it?Your lie: that pizzagate is not limited to code words, therefore spirit cooking is not pizzagate. You start with a false statement to prove a false statement. I call a spade a spade. A lie is a lie, nothing will make it true whether you state it knowingly or not. The mental gymnastics that you evil people play in order to avoid a sense of responsibility for your actions shame on you. Right and wrong are simple and clear cut you can make all the excuses and false fallacies to try to avoid responsibility and moral shame but it is what it is. 
Pizzagate includes spirit cooking and it includes canabilism and pedofilia and blackmail and trafficking. And organ harvesting. And you dare say the investigation has made conclusions and finished connecting dots? You have given everyone here an understanding of the loops these evil perpetrators jump through to justify themselves publicly. I have often wondered how they can live with them selves doing what they do, but you have shown us how it is done. Simply by compartmentalizjng it and lieing so many times eventually you start believeing it. I have a question Did you help Megan Kelly prepare for her interview of alefantis? 
Stop with the damage control shit and join some pedo file forum or go join some filthy semen and blood drinking baby penis eating group go back to huff post or better yet CNN would love you. No one believes you here. Knowing or unknowing stating a lie is a lie even if you call it by any other name. Lie is a lie and as long as you try to mislead investigators and play smoke and mirrors: it remains a lie misleading people and creating doubt for no other purpose but to let the guilty avoid justice, well we can see your true colors and where your priorities lie.

                       I didn't say #PizzaGate is limited to code words. I said that's where it all started. You have convinced yourself that I'm anti-#PizzaGate investigation just because I'm sometimes critical. That could not be further from the truth. I am a part of the #PizzaGate investigation, which sometimes includes debunking misinformation, or exposing information that is being interpreted wrongly by my estimation. I've also gathered #PizzaGate investigators, caught them up to speed, and let them spread their wings in their own ways. I've been a part of this for months, so it gets a little tiresome when people like you try to talk to people like me as if we are anti-#PizzaGate. You keep saying I'm lying, but I have not lied once, and you cannot give me of one example of when I lied. And if you're going to try to insult me by asking if I helped "Megan Kelly" prepare, at least spell Megyn Kelly's name correctly. You know, any investigation should be able to stand up to criticism. Many here have no problem with criticism, but you clearly do. That tells me you are a nobody, and you have no value here.

You are arguing with a nobody and you cannot convince even a nobody that abromavich the poor woman only valued 10 mil is not part of pizzagate. You have debunked nothing to even a nobody. Your insults make my day. You must be a somebody....oh wow impressive. A real mover and shaker in the pizzagate world.

            Most of it would seem benign or at most edgelordish to me, if it weren't for the part where she splatters real or symbolic (paint) blood on a child effigy in the corner.

           <p>
            So this is spirit cooking to her, and again it includes heavily splattering real or fake blood onto the child effigy in the corner.

            <em>

            think Spirit Cooking is, but she spells it out pretty clearly that, for her, it's a recipe of semen, breast milk, etc, self-mutilation instructions and for some reason involves the symbolic element of a child being splattered in blood.

             Look at the recipes in my link. Many of them don't even include blood. That was basically one performance of one recipe, but that actually isn't what Spirit Cooking is more broadly. It's a snapshot of one recipe, and people ignore this. If Spirit Cooking is about Satanism, why do so many of the recipes having nothing to do with Satanism?

             Ah, so it's clear, you really didn't even click the links. Why are you even bothering to respond when you didn't even read what my post was about? What you are explaining Spirit Cooking to be is exactly what I was thinking you thought it was. In fact, you are wrong. That is one recipe. There are many more that have nothing to do with blood, semen, or any of that. For instance:

             We actually have no evidence that this is the specific ritual they got together for, but of course, you don't know that because you refuse to even bother clicking the link before responding to see the other recipes. And if she's hiding all these secrets, why is she not worth more than $10M? That's about the worth I would expect a top artist to have.

             We're talking about Marina, not the Podestas. If you create a flimsy foundation and then make a connection to others and say she's guilty by association then you end up with something very flimsy. If there was something that was a strong connection okay, but you haven't explained anything that is any sort of strong connection.

             So to be clear, you might dismiss her connection if it wasn't for one aspect (blood splattered on a child effigy) of one performance of one cherry-picked recipe that completely ignores all of the other very innocent recipes. Just think about that.

              you are being silly. If a serial killer also flips burgers does that make them not a serial killer? YOU are the one cherry picking. Look at the context of abramovic, her work, her own writings and interviews, she is a satanist or occult obsessed. You cannot cherry pick a couple of obscure poems that "aren't obviously satanist" and throw out the balance of the evidence. You aren't fooling anyone.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know I have read she says she was inspired by the book of thelema (satanist) when she came up with spirit cooking. It's pretty obvious she is talking about this Cake of Light part of it:

             <p>
              And I did look at the book pages you linked, but they don't make a case for you. Your claim is that, ""Spirit Cooking" isn't what you think it is" presumably referring to all of us at once.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are you getting extra sassy with me because I engaged you in a respectful and thoughtful debate, with video evidence? Hmm?

              It

             <ol>

               <p>
                Apples are a type of fruit.

              <li>
               <p>
                Peaches are a type of fruit.

              <li>
               <p>

               I'm not getting "sassy" with you at all. I'm asking you to deal with the information, or at least look at it, which you clearly did not. If you had, you wouldn't have parroted the information of the one recipe without even attempting to address the other recipes. Also, your analogy is so ridiculous I'm not even going to bother with it.

                You're not going to bother with it, because you're being illogical and got backed into a corner. Is it so hard to just gracefully concede on a debate when that happens?

                Your stance was that spirit cooking isn't what we think it is, specifically referring to what I described.
               </p>
               <p>
                Your evidence was other examples of what she calls spirit cooking.
               </p>
               <p>
                That doesn't show that spirit cooking isn't what we think it is. It just shows that she has some pages in a book of other things that she also calls spirit cooking, in addition to what we have focused on primarily (as shown in the video).

                My analogy is very fitting.

                 Yes, because it's much broader. People think that the one recipe is Spirit Cooking, when that's really just an individual recipe, and it's not what Spirit Cooking is more broadly. It's like pointing to a room and saying it's a house. Well, the room is a part of the house, but it's not the house.

           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, there is a personal relationship between Marina AbramoviÄ‡, lobbyist Tony Podesta (his bizarre artwork collection
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/pdAVd">
             http://imgur.com/a/pdAVd)

            ) and his brother former White House Chief of Staff and chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, John Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it disturbing that AbramoviÄ‡ would casually invite Tony and John to a Spirit Cooking dinner.

            Everything about her reeks of Aleister Crowley Luciferianism, exactly the shit that D.C. and Hollywood have been claimed to have been tied to for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her, now deleted, original Twitter name was AbramovicM666.

             1) I know her Twitter name had 666 in it, but that's not a very strong connection.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Did you even look at my links? In one, it clearly shows many Spirit Cooking recipes which have nothing to do with Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Lots of people have connections to Tony Podesta. She's a top artist and he's a rich, powerful art buyer. It's not that surprising.

            Instead of falsely accusing me of being a shill, why don't you do any research at all. If you had you'd realize I'm not a shill. I'm interested in getting down to the truth. False leads don't get to the truth, and misrepresenting Spirit Cooking doesn't help. When you read the other recipes you quickly realize it's not about Satanism at all, even though that's the narrative. In your eyes is everybody a shill that attempts to debunk what they perceive as a false lead, and doing so with evidence? I noticed that you didn't even attempt to refute any evidence I brought up. I find it worrisome how many people are just writing off my post with no counter-arguments in a movement that is supposed to be about investigating fairly. A fair investigation is why I'm here, why are you here?

            How much money would you need to pay all your bills for the rest of your life so you could dedicate yourself to your art? It's probably less that 10 million dollars.

             Had to upvoat this . I was thinking the same thing. OP: you must be so wealthy that you don't realize most people subsist on an income under 50,000. 10 mil is considered wealthy by common every day Americans.

            In her own Reddit AMA she claimed that Spirit Cooking was real when done in private, but art when done in public.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is pictured eating off a woman's body and had herself photographed in a pedophilliac image where she covered the face of a shirtless young boy with her hand while holding him close to her body.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was also featured on James Alefantis Instagram.

                It was a real person. She ate off her. In fact, there was a little hubbub in the art world that condemned her for using people in such a fashion at a big dinner she had. I think it was the one where she arranged for Debbie Harry to mock cannibalize herself.

                  Pizzagate is not limited to pedofilia it is murder, trafficking, pedofilia, canabilism, occult ritual, blackmail. The list is huge, and yes the filth abromavich is part of that and is held in high esteem by the principal players. This is still in discovery stages. Investigators leave no stone unturned, keep an open mind, and do make premature conclusions. Every day we learn more and more try to keep an open mind about your little hero that you are defending. I bet the pizzagate investigators have only begun to scratch the surface.

Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not.

               Yeah, she's talking about when something is considered art or not after someone asked her about it. Also, the questioner probably is a fan of hers and believes black magick actually exists, so it would make sense for Marina not to say that black magick doesn't exist.

                I am not personally invested in whether or not Marina Abramovic is a real witch or just fancies herself one. But the point is that she ascribes occult power to her rituals.

            Bullshit. ..and btw money is only a means to an end. It isn't needed when you have other means to that same end ie demons doing your bidding....and 10 million is still too much for one person

             Sorry, but two images of a cannibalism art performance is not evidence that she's the leader of the Satanic occult many within #PizzaGate have hypothesized. You have not dealt with any of the points I brought up. Most of the Spirit Cooking recipes have nothing to do with Satanism.
