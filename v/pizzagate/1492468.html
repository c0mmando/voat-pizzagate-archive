           <p>
            Found on FB, and I agree that this is a possibility:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Did Megan Kelly let us down? Maybe. Maybe not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s look at what she did and what she not did:
           </p>
           <p>
            She did not ask hard questions, she did not tear him apart. And guess what? She would have never been allowed to do that. This kind of interview would have never aired. Else she would have lost her job (or worse). We all know whom we are fighting against here.
           </p>
           <p>
            She postponed the interview with Alefantis twice. Why? She could have just aired the interview if she already had it on tape, or she could have just interviewed him live on the announced date. By postponing it twice, she created questions about her reasons and thus AWARENESS in the public about the topic. She gave us two whole days to comment on Twitter and elsewhere, thus raising even more awareness. She allowed people to post the hard questions so that other people will know about them – questions she is not being allowed to ask right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            When she referred to the shooting at Comet, she said that nobody was shot, and while saying these few words, she directly looked into the camera – at us - so she emphasized that nobody was shot (because the shooter had never wanted to injure someone; he had a different agenda). Get the point?
           </p>
           <p>
            She showed the photo of the little girl whose hands are taped to a table. If she wanted to protect Alefantis, she would have shown no photo at all. The photo was on air quite a long time so that everybody can let it sink in. Even though Alefantis said that it was only fun etc., anybody with just a bit of common sense can see the man standing behind the girl, with legs spread apart, a typical position when … you know what I mean. Also, Alefantis is angry about this and other pictures being spread widely, but Kelly does just the same ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Her hands are literally tied – just like the hands of the little girl by the way (another hint for us?) - and this is all she can do at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’m not saying she is on our side. But think about it, and there is a real possibility that she actually is. If you wanted to protect Alefantis, how would you have conducted the interview? Like this?"

            We must remind everyone what the fake news really has been. NYT's Judith Miller and Robert Novak (yellow cake in Niger, WMD in Iraq), Brian Williams and the lying Lara Logan. NBC, CBS and the rest. What about that fake news?  No one brings this up.
