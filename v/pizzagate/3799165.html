               Its active ingredient is DEET

             <p>
              Zika was a virus spread by mosquitoes that was probably another bio weapon. SC Johnson certainly owns the labs for the bug spray. I don't know if they own the labs to produce the Zika virus itself but having an excuse to keep mosquito cultures would theoretically give decent cover for the manufacture of a virus. SC Johnson and company obviously benefited in numerous ways, from selling bugspray to selling screens and tents, to setting up tent hospitals.

              The Red Fez is the hat the Shriners wear. I'm not sure why it was deleted, is it because Point Place has an economy based on slaughterhouses and Wind Point is an actual real life slaughter house? I am not sure why Paul Ryan resigned. Recently you dropped a comment saying that he shut down the House Page Program before resigning. The Page Program is responsible for ruining the careers of Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley.

               They needed to take the spotlight off Racine in many ways. Many of the programs and Deals that were ramping up to the Agenda were scaled back, changed players, changed names, postponed or cancelled events, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are the reason why Paul Ryan and so many others all resigned. They could not do it all at once, but over a few months and years so many positions and players changed roles. The Agenda continued to move forward and the 8th Wonder has been developed with few paying any attention. This was Trump’s biggest deal, yet no one on either side will touch it. We are the reason why Q was created. We can pray that Q will expose The Truth, but remain skeptical and those worship Q instead of Jesus Christ.
              </p>
              <p>
               They must control veterans and enforcement at all levels and buy them off with everything from titles to “tiny houses” in Racine.
              </p>
              <p>
               They cannot let the world know about The Truth and the Root of Racine. They had to bring in the Masons to speed up the Agenda and cover up loose ends in rigged elections where everyone violated the Hatch Act and the DAs, judges and AGs are all involved. Who are Linda and Craig and other Masons involved? How are they connected to Eugenics? Who else supported the campaign? Who supported the young Russian? How did they also support the Fight to End Exploitation and Racine County Anti-Trafficking coalition?
              </p>
              <p>
               Scott Walker did not lose the election, he threw the election. The DAs and AGs were shifted. Top level federal agencies were directly involved including Loretta Lynch personally. It goes all they way beyond the top.
              </p>
              <p>
               The weak link and the connection from Racine to New York is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons. The Truth has been shared Since The Beginning. This is why Voat cannot allow it any longer. The Agenda has arrived. The Mark is next.

            Hi MB2. I'm trying to follow this and am totally confused. What's the significance of Pence not wearing a mask? Also, I read several of your links, but couldn't find the support for this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dr. Charles H. Mayo, one of the founders of the famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, was a Mason. His son Charles W., who also was a Mason, became governor of the Clinic, which began in the Masonic Temple building in Rochester.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The link you gave for "Mayo clinic...also has strong roots in Masonry" was 404'd with no archive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ping me when you've clarified this and I will remove the 24 Hour Grace flair.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mayo Clinic is definitely messed up. They've got a gold Moloch Owl on their building. A good friend of mine who grew up in Minnesota lost his hemophiliac dad to AIDS, which he contracted from a tainted blood transfusion at the Mayo Clinic back in the 1980s.

              Weird that didn't work for me before. This one did. Here's an archive I just made:
              <a href="https://archive.vn/LYmTF">
               https://archive.vn/LYmTF
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that this link is working, I'm fine with this post staying here on the main board, as long as you add a sentence at the beginning making it clear it's a raw dig that needs further development, rather than a fully developed submission. :-)

              I think there is some great research in here -- and if the Mayo Clinic is a Masonic operation, we definitely need a post exploring that and how it may be tied to pizzagate (Globalist child sacrifice, anyone?). I get the sense that this is more of a data dump at this point, though. It's up to you if you want to edit it and tighten it up, edit it to add an "Excuse the Mess: Under Construction" statement requesting help researching the Mayo Clinic, or leave as is and move to pgwhatever for further development. Any of those three work for me, now that the masonic roots of the Mayo link is working. :-)

                 And here is where I'll address your moronic attitude.  It's possible for people to make mistakes.  That's why all broadcasting companies had editors.  I've added the correction to the post as you pointed out my error. Am I going to thank you as I normally would, absolutely not.  Your dickhead attitude is what makes the international community look on in horror at what is happening to the United States.  You're an asshole. Pure and simple.  And now I'm going to mute you. Bye Felicia.. that's urban slang for FUCK OFF.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Child Focus (or the European Center for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children) is a Belgian foundation that supports prevention and investigation of missing children, abducted children, runaway children, and sexually abused and exploited children, along with psychological and legal support to the victims. They also follow their cases and sometimes ensure they are treated with due care by the persons in charge.
            </p>
            <p>
             Child Focus was created on Jean-Denis Lejeune's initiative in June 1996, one year after the abduction of his daughter Julie and her friend Melissa by Marc Dutroux.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lejeune had learned about the existence of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington, D.C. and went to visit it in order to study its structure. During the White March in Brussels on October 20, 1996, he asked Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene for help in creating a similar organization in Belgium. Its honorary president is her Majesty Queen Paola.
            </p>
            <p>
             On March 31, 1998, Child Focus was fully operational, and in July 1997, Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer became the first Chairman of the organization.
