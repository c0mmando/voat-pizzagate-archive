             It says:  "multiple" children being adopted by American families have allegedly been victims of sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's a pretty awkward way of saying the American families found out they'd been sexually abused, but you're the moderator.

              It's crystal clear that the article is saying they were abused at the orphanage prior to be adopted.  The abuse was discovered when the children tested positive when taken to the doctor by their adoptive parents.

            from the article .....

            to close an orphanage where "multiple" children being adopted by American families have allegedly been victims of sexual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Orphanage Director Eveline Louis-Jacques said Friday that several children in her care had tested positive for chlamydia
           </p>
           <p>
            Louis-Jacques said the children could have contracted the infection at birth from their mothers, but the report said the parents of only one of the children also tested positive.

             It says it right there ... ADOPTED BY AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE ALLEGEDLY BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE.

            <p>
             Either it's an awkward way of saying that the adopted families found out they were abused or they were abused.

            <p>
             Reminds of Presidio. They said the same thing ... that the children contracted venereal diseases from their parents.
