            Late to the show here but for sure, the Weinstein thing is a smokescreen.  His scandal is the most publicly digestible on they can dole out there at the moment.  Most people are not ready to digest the scandals surrounding people like Bryan Singer and Dan Schneider, so they could perhaps be burning Weinstein at the stake to satisfy the masses and cover for even more depraved predators.  The way I see it, Weinstein is the least of our

            The victims could be forced into occultism as well. These people have had so much power that even without MKUltra to explain some of their behaviour it is still not that impossible for them to be so easily manipulated. Their lives and careers would be destroyed in the blink of an eye if they wheren't.

             Because he was an easy target due to having harassed and abused so many women. With the pizzagate movement picking up traction they needed a distraction from pedophilia so they threw Harvey to the masses

              Correct. Harvey was such a fat ugly bastard it was easy to expose him and ruin him but he knows a lot of deep dark secrets if he wants to he could cut a deal and go into witness protection but first they have to arrest him then tighten the screws on him to see who he can give up with regard to the Hollywood pedo network if he does that he'll avoid hard time in prison.

            yes you are correct. there are multiple people set up as a fallman, both men and women (gay or straight). most of the people we see as a fallman are highly ranked, but lesser known. they essentially cover the press , connections, and social media storm so you are flooded with 
"facts". many of these "facts" are disgustingly true, but the sources are not actually "factual".  then the television media reports on it, based off of how the press articles did on social media. if something is believed to be widely true on social media, with or without "facts", they will give negative attention to someone, like weinstein. however , if someone gets associated with "pizzagate" right away on social media, the television media will dismiss it, as per gag-order, and undercover media agents (they have authentic looking social media profiles) go on to social media, and flood pizzagate threads about "aliens", "flat earth, and will always throw out the name alex jones and call julian assange a russian agent, every single time, without fail, in an effort to make people look crazy.they will even inject their own "truthers".  their job is to call you pizzagate crazies and remind you how a man stormed a pizzashop ,armed, so he could solve pizzagate. see the problem with that logic is, the dnc and news media in russiagate have created conspiracy after conspiracy about trump and russia, something very dangerous could happen, say, like a breakout of war between countries. so if edgar welch is held responsible for investigating pizzagate , then that means the dnc, the media, and ALL THOSE celebrities and musicians are technically responsible should anything happen, since they are basically making up a conspiracy theory with no basis in reality which threatens the entire world with nuclear weapons.   this is why the fallmen are important. they trick you into thinking "it's happening" finally, it's not, not yet anyways. the fallmen are there by design to bide time, and it's the higher ranked ones for a reason. the higher ranks usually don't get their lives destroyed and usually have ample amounts of currency to get them anywhere in the world. but see, the problem with have high ranks to be set up as a fallman is, the lower ranks get looked over, because the lower ranks generate the most income and APPEAR to be high ranking. they invert their ranking system and hierarchy by design so you won't catch on.

            An obvious psyop that was pushed by the mods here in an attempt to say sexual deviant revelations is somehow tied as proof that Trump is fighting the Satanic DC CIA pedo opperations. Epic fail. Vindicator even stickied some of the threads.

            I think both is true: Weinstein behaved like a pig and harassed women, and at some point, he pissed off some powerful people behind the scenes who decided to axe him.

            That some of his alleged victims have an occult connection is not surprising, as we have established that the majority is into this shit in Hollyweird.

            Joe Rogan did a piece on Harvey and he said exactly what my sister (She's a DJ who is in the curcles) said - 'how many women actually came onto him in hope to get the part? Will these women (in the 100's or 1000's step forward please and tell the audience how you stole parts from your fellow (more talanted) sisters!!! No one mentioned that factor except Joe! (Again, I am not defendinf Harvey one iota, masturbating in a potted plant in front of a clothed woman is not something I can defend)

             It's said that Gwyneth Paltrow stole the script of Shakespeare In Love from her best friend Winona Ryder and went to get the part behind her back
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also said Paltrow was caught in a comprising position with Harvey that caused the break up of her and Pitt
            </p>
            <p>
             Harvey was an easy target cause he's a pig
            </p>
            <p>
             Easy targets work wonders for cover ups
            </p>
            <p>
             I personally question some of the women that came out
            </p>
            <p>
             It was about time the casting couch came out, and we know Harvey isn't the only one that does it
            </p>
            <p>
             Glad it came out, but why was it Harvey?
            </p>
            <p>
             How many more do these women know about and had to deal with, but only came out to accuse Harvey ?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where are the gay men stories of the casting couch?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where has this story gone?
            </p>
            <p>
             Heard some women are getting together to do something, but haven't heard anything since
            </p>
            <p>
             It popped and now looks like it's fading, except for Rose
            </p>
            <p>

               Wow.....hundreds of celebrities, mostly women tweeted #timesup yesterday.  Many of them are known for supporting the abusers.  Only ONE celebrity used both hashtags #timesup and #metoo, Bryce Dallas Howard:
               <a href="https://twitter.com/BryceDHoward/status/947968079337734144">

              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously she wasn't told of the plan to squash the #metoo movement.

             That's a completely separate issue. As usual deflection deflection. The guys a prolific sex beast, raping and molesting, terrorising women to indulge his own pathetic ego. Why are people so terrified to confront these issues? You stop pandering.

            But it gets more intriguing - in 2016 Harvey and DeNiro were denied airing their film VAXXED (anti vaccine movie) at Sundance Festival 2016 - and in 2017 Harvey decided to launch his owm independent marketing - and that was it! Now we know why he became the target. And of course he took attention of Keanu Reeve's story about Adrenochrome!!!!

             Interesting.
I doubt that Keanu Reeve's interview is real, same with Jim Carrey's "hollywood eats babies" interview.
For me that sounds more like damage control by shills. You take a serious subject, you create a fake interview which feels real, people think its real until its proven fake. The next time you mention that subject.. "oh that never happened, it was fake..move on to another subject"

              Yup, add to that, Macauly Culkin's revalation about a Hollywood mogul telling him that he was wearing boots made of human leather (Heather O'Rourke) - find it very hard to believe.

              I just google "adrenochrome reeve" and saw a bunch of stuff including earlier voat posts.  Here is one link
              <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2017/11/hollywood-elites-use-blood-of-babies-to-get-high-keanu-reeves-video-3574287.html">

              </a>
              However beforeitsnews may not be the most reliable website.  So do your own research if you are interested.  I believe that several people have had submissions about adrenochrome deleted.

               What exactly IS adrenochrome? In scientific terms, it is a chemical that is produced in the human body when adrenaline [also known as epinephrine] oxidizes. How is the chemical extracted? A potential victim is terrorized, thus increasing the amount of adrenaline that is flowing through their body. They are then killed and the adrenochrome is collected with a needle and syringe from the base of the back of their neck and spinal column. Once collected, the chemical can be sold on the black market at exorbitant prices.

              If babies and children are being sacrificed as well as sexually abused to garner this "drug" it seems that submissions on adrenecrome are relevant and should not be deleted

             Vaxxed was not a Harvey or DeNiro film. It was a Del Bigtree and Andrew Wakefield documentary that was not allowed to be shown at the Sundance Festival.

            Typically those are called "limited hangouts".

           <p>
            They did it specifically to try to "frontrun" the actual scandal, and to sling some mud at Trump. Didn't work though. None of their tricks work anymore. Must be very frustrating to be a satan worshiper these days.

             Get over yourself.  Nobody's coming here openminded then turned off the whole theory because of what a poster says and no MSM is coming here to see what The PG Community espouses.  Everyone thinks it's "debunked" or merely ridiculous.  Best evidence for them would be legit leads.  In fact this OP is precisely the best intro evidence (EARNING A RARE UPVOAT FROM THE KING HIMSELF).
