            There was another posting about Madonna kidnapping or illegally snatching the last two twin children.  In the article or below it there was a bit about how her sister Lourdes said she will take care of them in the even of Madonna's death.  Does she know something we don't know?  Maybe she suspects because of her lifestyle or that she will be suicided.  MK Ultras are sometimes taken at the time of or around their owners. In any event I think she is going to look like the Rothschilds.  We shall see JA also taking on the gargoyle look.

            Cant stand this googoo person.
All I know is that when someone becomes "famous" out of the blue be completely suspect.  I feel for all the parents who are totally asleep and who are supporting their children in going to her "concerts", and purchasing her crap music and it is crap.  Total utter garbage.

            the UK Sun printed this story :  The website alleges that Lady Gaga hoped to work as a backing dancer for rising star Lina Morgana.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also claim that in a bitter act of jealousy, the global megastar pushed Lina off a building in order to steal her fame.
           </p>
           <p>
            The forum states: “2 weeks later, Lady Gaga starts her meteoric rise.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Nearly all the styles Lady Gaga uses today stem from Lina’s own style”.

              johnnydepp is another one : Back in 1993 Johnny Depp opened “The Viper Room” with biz partner Anthony Fox. Anthony started suspecting Johnny of secretly diverting money from the club in 1999. Then in 2003 a judge found that Johnny had “breached his fiduciary duties” and scheduled  Anthony Fox to testify against Johnny, but went missing just before he was to appear in court. Anthony has never been found

               Yeah, sacrifices for fame take on a whole new meaning. Can you imagine having fame dangled in front of you, and being told you can have it all if...you just kill someone close to you? Such grand illusion and overwhelming emotion must be concocted. I read about Lina Morgana today and how she was flung from the top of a building to her death. And Gaga's career launched 2 weeks later. I listened to one of Lina's songs and just felt so sad and wanted to cry.

             Yes, they are all sickening, all of them.  But I do know that they will age and become just as irrelevent as anyone else.  madonna clings on to her fan base and has them all brainwashed into thinking that she too, is talented.  No, none of them are.  They need spectacular tours and props to sell themselves because their music is so pathetic.

            I think Gaga just does this stuff to seem edgy and interesting. She comes across as such a try hard that it all looks for show. Its the people who are connected to this stuff who try to present a normal image that concern me.

            Take your pick on what Lady Gaga does to garner the uncomfortable feeling. Just watch her videos. She sold out. I used to appreciate her. But I used to feel that way about a lot of artists until they became pawns and mouthpieces for the agenda. Check out Vigilant Citizen.
