<p>The late Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist agreed. He wrote a letter to the Congress saying the sentencing provisions would do &quot;serious harm to the basic structure of the sentencing guideline system&quot; used by federal judges &quot;and would seriously impair the ability of courts to impose just and reasonable sentences.&quot;
Lennon said Sanders &quot;wants to have it both ways&quot; on restricting sentences. He noted that Sanders says on his Web site that he supports mandatory minimum sentences for repeat sex offenders.
Sanders\' camp said there is no inconsistency. Congress often passes mandatory minimum sentences for various crimes, but Sanders believed the sentencing provisions in the Amber Alert bill restricted sentencing in a much broader way, Weaver said.</p>
