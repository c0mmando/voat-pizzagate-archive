            This relates to pizzagate as it is about Elites and children mind control symbolism related to Satanism or Monarch.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article is well written. I checked all the references and they are not taken out of context. This content fits the bill for clothing specifically made for children who are part of the Monarch movement it seems.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been discussing with my spouse the lives of Céline and her late husband going back 40 years. We are all aware that Céline was taken under René's wings at barely 12. It seems odd but he was truly a powerhouse of the music industry, he wasn't some n00b. She and I are the same age so I have always followed her career. She sang for the Pope in 1984. I am currently racking my brain trying to find any "illuminati shit" in their past but coming up empty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Céline is an extremely nice person. I know MANY people who have worked for her in many capacities and they all report astonishment at the quality of the Dion-Angélil family. When René died, everything changed overnight. She distanced herself from the Angélil side of the family. She fired people from her crew. Her manager quit his job. This all happened so fast. She's been gallivanting around the world taking on a more sexy approach to her art. I support her but it's atypical for her. It's sort of like when Christina Aguilera did the sex thing and everybody was all like: WTF? It was atypical and unexpected. We are not official family members but close-ish relations.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I am just dumbfounded. I cannot tell you where this comes from. It is inexplicable!
           </p>
           <p>
            I am specifically concerned with the fact that they hit all the child mind control symbolism. When I look at this I think about Sara Ruth Ashcraft's testimonies about her childhood. The striped and Zebra thing comes to mind.

            The stripes wind up being what upsets me the most...

            and I were discussing this just last night.  She has joined the rest of the normalizing ninnies.    Celin-ninny.
