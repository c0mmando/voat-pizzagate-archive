             Eh I'm just in bad mood. My initial point was meant to be positive on as well. In the fact that even if people and leaders try to screw us over now we'll still win.
            </p>
            <p>
             And anybody's more than welcome to add me on social media. I know there's doxxing stigma but I'm not about that life. Will keep trying my best until I perish lol

            Trump is now siding with the Deep State and talking abour reprisials against Syria for the obvious CIA/Mossad fals flag event. Yes, the Syrians just used weapons of mass destruction right when peace talks were resuming. Give me a break with this brainless nonsense. Now, Trump is talking tough and ligitimizing it. We are screwed.

            Thank you for reposting this, D2M.  I was sorry to see your prior submission deleted.

            I have said many times that you don't get to be a billionaire in Jew York if you're not playing ball. Trump is a Tribe of Dan crypto Jew. We all heard the "open mic" Freemason admission. He has more royal blood than Hitlery -- his cousin -- (hence he "won" the [s]election).
           </p>
           <p>
            Another angle is Roy Cohn, who was Trump's "mentor." They were very close friends for many years. Cohn was a Jewish faggot lawyer for the mob. He also just happens to have been bubbled the "CIA Pedophile Ringleader."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is illustrative but doesn't contain the quote, also biased (Jew York TImes).

            ^^ These two together describe the relationship pretty well. Also the Roger Stone connection to Trump via Cohn. That makes AJ even dirtier via extension IMO.

            No matter how you slice it, Trump comes up dirty.

            , nobody wants to hear your bullshit. That's why you have to make new accounts. Like the luciferian clique is going to get cucked by the Jews. Are you really this ignorant of just shillin?

            I've said from the beginning that trump wouldn't do anything about pizzagate but no one would hear it. It was all "arrests inc" and "shill". Honestly there are so many trump fanboys on voat you'll never convince them he is anything less than a 14D chess-master who is anti-establishment (LOL) and a friend of the working man. As if some real estate billionaire reality tv star gives a shit about anything other than himself. He's in this for the power and to install his family in our govt. for life.

            Yeah, Trump's not going to do anything.  I hope I'm proved wrong.  Unfortunately, he appears to be part of the 'club' and is just as controlled as the rest of them.

            Don't sit on your hands and wait for anyone to investigate. Raise every bit of awareness at every avenue you can muster until this does get addressed. Neither we, nor the kids, can afford less.
