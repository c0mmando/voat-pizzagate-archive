<p>The Daily Beast notes that “Weinstein is accused of three sexual assaults at Cipriani properties, and is charged with a fourth assault against a woman he met at Cipriani Upstairs in Manhattan.”</p>
<p>Lauren Sivan, a former journalist who accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her in 2007, says Cipriani’s global empire of venues served as Weinstein’s “hunting ground.” A friend of Sivan’s told the Daily Beast that on the night Sivan was allegedly assaulted, they had been dining with Weinstein and Cipriani at Cipriani’s former West Village lounge, Socalista. When Weinstein and Sivan disappeared together, the friend says she asked Cipriani if she should go find Sivan, to which he allegedly replied, “If it was my friend I would,” implying that he had knowledge of Weinstein’s predatory behavior.</p>

            This is where their doctrine of “do what thou whilst” really breaks down.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have no wish to reign in their desires or appetites. They pursue their ambitions no matter what the cost. The have no respect for any benevolent authority, much less God. Why should they respect their false gods and priestesses, like Weinstein and HRC?
           </p>
           <p>
            They believe they can do whatever they want regardless of consequence. So sit back, pop some popcorn and watch them eat each other and burn their decadent, wicked empire to the ground.
           </p>

            Bravo to those who share the truth. Thanks God. Much love and support to victims. I pray everyday for justice and peace, and for more to awaken and join us.

             Yep " no matter what the cost " and there's the YOLO movement ( you only live once ) that was embedded into the millennials . So sad that most have no hope and they just completely give up their lives to the temporary things of this world . It's all about living for the moment and being carefree .

             Not relevant other than the definition of bigot, and the owner of the online publication. Vox The company owns and operates its offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Austin, and San Francisco. The network now features over 300 sites with over 400 paid writers. Interestingly the video game website called polygon has a logo that is color coded to fold into a pentagram like origami. the triangles equal 6. When folded together by color pattern make a four sided pyramid. That  goes back to Solomon "Sol" LeWitt who comes from a nice Jewish family from Russia named the Bolshevics. Entered the Art schools because he never did want to work, this is getting old with the same patterns. Hey, get you some of that cubist modern art though. I hear tell it is flying off the shelves. Limited supply.

            Weinstein has also been accused of raping an actress at Mr. C., a Beverly Hills hotel also owned by Cipriani, where Weinstein — reportedly an early investor in the hotel — allegedly had “free rein,” including gratis use of a $2,700-a-night rooftop suite that he used as a “sex pad.” The Italian actress told the Los Angeles Times that she was staying at the hotel in 2013 when Weinstein “dragged [her] to the bathroom and forcibly raped [her].” A spokesperson for Cipriani acknowledged to the Daily Beast that Weinstein had been a guest at Mr. C. “on several occasions,” but denied knowledge of any assault or other wrongdoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            WOW.  He was an investor in this hotel.  So he had "free rein"?  Another WOW.  Sex Pad?  Triple WOW.  Ah, this pretty much spells it out.  Also there were hotels all over the world.  Was he allowed "free rein" in those too?  I bet he was.  He was an investor after all.

             It just never ends . I bet we have all , at one time or another stayed in one of their " places " without even knowing what goes on there . It makes me cringe thinking about the things that go on in these hotels, restaurants, etc . Unbeknownst to the public .

                My guess is that they did have a kill room. The things that were done to Angelica by her father are unspeakable.  I do believe her to be a Witch as we have read on here.  She certainly is powerful enough to arrange for something like that.  I would not be surprised if Jack N. was in attendance.  Yes, let us know if you remember.

                 Common for bars to kick out manly types with the bouncers so the pervs can invite them upstairs to the VIP rooms. Happened to me many a time in my youth. I would always cause trouble, and then the cops would come just as I drove away.

             What in the hell are you even doing here if this is what you think of women that are victims of this dude? I get that the metoo thing has put a back burner theory on PG but it doesnt minimize the victims involved. I think it was a possible attempt at covering up the kid stuff but I am hoping its more like a very many layered onion...All layers stink and each one slowly peels away exposing yet another stinky layer. I hope that we get to the kids soon and have somewhat. But I think if it had come out at say the PG time then it would have been minimized and discredited as it was attempted to be already. Time takes time and I know we are all like ready yesterday but perhaps this metoo thing is preparing the "normies" to see just how dirty the dregs of society get. This is low hanging fruit but it does get worse we all know this if you have been into the PG thing for any time like we all mostly have. Try to see these ladies as VICTIMS and possibly the beginning or pre cursor if you will of a very ugly next course of victims to come. It was an attempt to put the kid thing off but I am hoping that theory will backfire on them and be the very thing that brings legitimacy to the horrors the kids have been facing. If the normies are believing this then what choice will they have when the kids plights come out? The will have to listen and believe. Calling someone a whore isnt doing this movement or any other ANY GOOD.

              Maybe we should just ignore comments like the one above. Responses serve to validate, and who ever made this comment likely is getting paid for it. I say this because it is not a comment made by a being with a soul. Let the dead bury the dead.

              metoo isn’t going to be fair or perfect. But it’s necessary. We need to support it, or at the very least accept it.
             </h1>
             <p>
              Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              Because most of our victims get disposed of. If any are to come forward, they need to be listened to. Let the courts and the professionals sort out whose lying or not in #metoo.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for us, how can we show that we support pizzagate victims? We need to take a stand and show our best intentions and support for #metoo. WE ALL KNOW that Hollywood is a septic tank. If anyone is profiting from it, and they lose unfairl because of #metoo, Well too bad. We know that these ‘stars’ are rolling their dice, yet meanwhile, pizzagate victims are being tortured under the same table.

              Besides, This post hints at the hunting of humans. That’s on the pizza related map.

               Thanks for your well spoken contribution and I couldn't have explained it better than you did . You hit it on the nose when you said PG survivors may be waiting to tell their stories etc . Thank you! 🙂
