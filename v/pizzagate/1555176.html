<p>While researching pizzagate I have noticed connections with pedos and pandas, including Alefantis having posts dealing with pandas. If you haven\'t seen, here are a couple of examples:
<a href="http://archive.is/jExBG">http://archive.is/jExBG</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/DLPTd">http://archive.is/DLPTd</a></p>
<p>I thought I\'d look into the artist Sheila Harrington who posted the Panda and the Besta Pizza box to see if it would lead anywhere. If you click on the artist from the Panda eating the besta pizza box, it takes you to her site: <a href="http://archive.is/Zilgc">http://archive.is/Zilgc</a>, Voat user: Large Pepperoni Pizza had discovered that If you click on her cards section, at the bottom, there is an address of 3428 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008, which is a business called Transcendence, Perfection, and Bliss.http://archive.is/XJaYe. This store seems to sell gifts, including childrens gifts and have a few pedo pics on their site:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/ZWYNf">http://archive.is/ZWYNf</a> (spiral) and <a href="http://archive.is/d614Y">http://archive.is/d614Y</a> (pics says &quot;Who loves baby?&quot; and has a panda next to it)</p>
<p>So I started thinking. Maybe I should look into other nearby shops to see if there are any other pedo signs, cuz we have already seen them with comet pizza, besta, and others. So I first looked at &quot;Wake up little Suzie&quot;, a shop right in front of transcendental not far at all from comet pizza and if you look at their home page, it screams BOY LOVER cuz they have the boy lover spiral all over the page! <a href="http://archive.is/8krno">http://archive.is/8krno</a> If you click on store info at the bottom right hand they mention they got recognition from some magazine. If you click on the link it takes you to a 404 error page that says &quot;Page Does Not Exist, But Here Are 404 Pandas For Your Enjoyment&quot; and then has a bunch of pandas all over. <a href="https://archive.is/FgoRB">https://archive.is/FgoRB</a></p>
<p>Then I looked into Chocolate Mousse and found a couple gems: <a href="http://archive.is/rd4N9">http://archive.is/rd4N9</a> (cheese and pasta reference) , <a href="http://archive.is/cTMfH">http://archive.is/cTMfH</a> (Panda with pasta on his head) <a href="http://archive.is/GJwaV">http://archive.is/GJwaV</a> (Toy with boy lover spiral)</p>
<p>I looked into Barstons Toy shop and they have lots of pedo symbolized toys there: <a href="http://archive.is/cIaxn">http://archive.is/cIaxn</a> (Boy lover spiral) <a href="http://archive.is/3jOpD">http://archive.is/3jOpD</a> (Toy with both double heart and spirals) <a href="http://archive.is/90ZlM">http://archive.is/90ZlM</a> (pandas) There are plenty more if you do your looking into it.</p>
<p>There were other toy stores as well that had double hearts, spirals, and pandas on their sites. Periwinkle Gifts has a pic of a baby and a spiral under it. <a href="http://archive.is/2p2d4">http://archive.is/2p2d4</a></p>
<p>Kinder Toy Haus has hanging pandas <a href="http://archive.is/dTjlH">http://archive.is/dTjlH</a> but what is really creepy is one of their pics on their fb page of four kids on a sidewalk, one dressed as a panda and another boy wearing a panda shirt, and the painting in back of the children is a large creepy panda watching over the kids. <a href="http://archive.is/8PuZB">http://archive.is/8PuZB</a> <a href="http://archive.is/rT8gr">http://archive.is/rT8gr</a></p>
<p>Could these places be involved? I wanted to get this info out, so we can all start looking more into this to see if it leads to any new info. I posted the panda and the besta pizza pic yesterday and once another poster linked it to the artist and the Trancendental place, it got deleted due to no sources. I\'m new to VOAT, but I would think that this post here has plenty of sources that prove pedo symbolism and one of the places was linked because of the besta pizza box and the panda pic. So I really hope this post does not get flagged this time.</p>',

            Amazing how often the victim is assaulted under guise of providing care.

           <p>
            Isn't Autism also listed as a psychiatric disease?
            <a href="https://itsnotmental.blogspot.com/2007/12/autism-is-not-mental-illness.html">

            And/or Big Pharma tries to push idea that it is genetic which is ridiculous because was rare in US then cases exploded.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, very interesting article in NewYorker this April or March "It runs in the family" re Schizophrenia --
Runs in the Family
            <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia">
             http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia

           </p>
           <p>
            Ignore the family story which contributes nothing --
but notice the parallel between Autism and Schizophrenia re pruning of the synopses -- 
in one case it is over pruning of the synapses and in the other case under pruning.
            <br/>
            (don't recall which is which at the moment as it's been a while since I looked at this)
I'd send you my summary of the article, but too lengthy.
That's another reason why we have to challenge the vaccines and the effect they have long
had on the immune system.  In fact, even COLIC and PROJECTIVE VOMITING are now identified
as part of the symptoms -- as SID syndrome has also been.  Another case of a rare event having
greatly increased.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, finally, notice that they do not immediately set to work trying to find out what is causing
this over pruning and under pruning to take place.  That is ignored completely.
And they see the next step as creating yet one more drug.
           </p>
           <p>
            Agree re the strange deaths of doctors who have been working on reversing Autism in patients.
And cancer, of course.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             there is no diagnosis code for child victims of sexual abuse to get therapy covered by insurance...
they have to be assigned a mental disorder within them, for coverage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also --
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Also recall Sigmund Freud's handiwork in protecting pedophiles in the Oedipus Complex where he makes the 
outrageous suggestion that infants, toddlers and young children are the sexual aggressors against 
adult males -- fathers, grandfathers, uncles, cousins -- and male friends of the family.
This was all related to Freud by his young patients -- both male and female -- and was an absolute
betrayal of them.
Turned out, as well, that one of his descendants - Clement Freud -- was identified as a very active pedophile
and possibly involved in the McCann case --

            Pandas are probably big because of that song Kanye put out Panda by the bootleg fake Future.  It was really big beggining of last year and 2015 i think

            Yes, of course, I know it's a real illness.  But many sexually abused children are abused and infected and suffering 
tortures which make them ill for entirely different reasons than a doctor might otherwise surmise.
And, yes, I think the pedophile community might have picked up the use of PANDA "as a sick joke.":  :(

            Btw, as an old fan of Braggs ACV, it's great to keep a sore throat from moving into strep.

            I don't see anything suspicious here.  You do have plenty of examples, but none of them strike me as the pedo symbols.  Sometimes a panda is just a panda.

            The Mirtilo store LOGO is definitely the heart within a heart LOGO which FBI reveals as code.
But hearts are very common in jewelry -- I had a beautiful heart/within heart locket which I lost and still miss.
Did notice some that were a triangle within a triangle which is a pedo symbol, but imagine could also be a common design in jewelry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check the store LOGO, I think that gives you the most definite and obvious link as show in FBI codes.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you also have to work out what role you think these toy stores may be playing if they are connected to pedo rings.

            The spiral is also "The Spiral of Life" which can be done in a number of different ways which I didn't know.
I always thought it imitated the seashell or the human embryo curled up in the womb -- the simple spiral.

            Pandas for one are black and white which seems to suggest sadism/youth in pedophile code.
Also there's this which I don't even like thinking about, but the write up for strep goes so far beyond that it's strange.

              I'm still going to assume innocent until proven guilty, but it sure is strange how this one card illustrator is linking to places that all use a spiral or double heart.  I've found this on The Phoenix:

               I found this article on Sheikh Zayed.
               <a href="http://archive.is/PygQw">
                http://archive.is/PygQw
               </a>
               He donated 150 million dollars to the Childrens National Hospital in DC.
              </p>
              <p>
               We can also confirm based on the previous article from daily mail that he was one of the largest donors to the Clinton Foundation. Whats also odd is that if you google "Sheikh Zayed Sex" it seems as though there is a street in Dubai called Sheikh Zayed Road, and the google search shows girls who seem to be selling sex. Lots of connections with this guy and the sale of sex. Haven't found anything on children yet. But this is very suspicious.

                Good find. I've been digging these links a lot today and I've come to the conclusion that half of the links are fine and not linked to anything bad. The rest are suspect or offer too little information to really make any conclusion. I am finishing up the report and hope to get my findings posted tonight or tomorrow.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the mean time, while I believe Pheoix is innocent, I think you may have found something with Zayed. If anyone is donating that much money to the Clinton Foundation, you know they can't be up to any good. Keep on digging.

                 Yeah, I pretty much came to the same conclusion. Some of these places seem innocent, and a couple others, while they may seem odd or even creepy, do not have enough to make a solid claim. Atleast it lead us to another possible lead though. Will keep on searching.

               I just saw this comment about the phoenix and noticed they too are promoting the organization Care for Kids. Care for kids has a double heart on their logo.
               <a href="http://archive.is/t1UQD">
                http://archive.is/t1UQD
               </a>
               . So I think that's about 3 different places we've seen possible pedo images promoting this care for kids program. Nothing wrong with a business promoting another organization, especially one that helps children.
              </p>
              <p>
               But did more digging anyway and looked up Care for Kids and the website shows "Children's National" right next to their name. So i searched Childrens National in DC and saw a pic outside of the hospital and it says "The Sheikh Zayed Campus".

              <p>
               I did a quick google on Sheikh Zayed and found an interesting article from Daily Mail that listed the top Clinton Foundation Donors and Sheikh Zayed's name popped up and stated:
              </p>
              <p>
               " Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (former president of the United Arab Emirates; his family set up center that became a haven for terrorist sympathizers, and Holocaust deniers) $1million to $5million".

               I came accross the same Care for Kids organization with the double heart yesterday. Found it from Anglo Dutch Pools and Toy shop and thought it could be pedo related. Made me even more curious that the organization is about caring for kids, which is worrisome given the topic we are researching. I haven't done much research into the organization at this point, but definitely worth looking into.

               I am starting to be a little bothered by Barstons Child Play. I don't know why but I decided to go back and look for any other clues and came across a toy they sell called pizza party. They describe their toy and at the very end they put "pizza makes slicing sounds when cut"....ummm why in the heck would that be in the desctiption? That is just bizarre!

                The toys themselves are not bad and are from established toy brands (I would know because my children have/had some of those toys). Play food, especially pizza, is very popular among kids, and toys that make accurate sounds is normal too. Children love to have toy items that appear and sound "real". ( Hopefully that will help put you at ease a bit :-)

                <em>
                 However
                </em>
                , that doesn't mean a creepy pedo toy shop couldn't curate certain toys to convey a message. Not saying that is what Barston's is doing, just trying to point out that creepy pedo could use real and innocent things in an inappropriate way, just like how James and his buddies would take innocent photos and turn them into a perverted inside "jokes".
               </p>
               <p>
                You've done good work researching and archiving. I don't know about you, but I am about to pass out from lack of sleep. I agree that Barstons and Anglo Dutch should be further investigated, but I'm going to have to take a rain check. Keep up the awesome work, but don't work yourself too hard. Remember to take some breaks and get some sleep! Good night.

           </p>
           <p>
            Then I noticed that a few people that I consider fishy are claiming that this thread is irrelevant. Makes sense. A few others seem slightly mad that Pedogate is once again expanding, and there's also something a bit strange with the upvotes/downvotes currently.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, yeah, there are certainly several interesting new leads in this thread.

            One of the shop owners is part of a known cult and even changed her name and shop name for it. Looks like OP might be on to something.

            It could also be nothing, and we SHOULD remember that everyone is innocent until proven otherwise. But that is the point of this board, investigating. No one is claiming anything yet, just pointing out some stuff that is worth checking out.

            Found something on the owner of "Transcendence, Perfection, and Bliss". She is a disciple of an old perverted cult leader, she is so into this cult that she legally changed her name AND changed her shop name.

            Edit: Again though, doesn't mean anything other than she's some hyper religious follower. Haven't found anything suggesting she's more than a victim of a cultist scam.

             Yeah I had read that Sri Chinmoy was forcing his followers to have sex with him. (

            <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Be+with+Me+Playseum/@38.9792288,-77.0932075,350m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c979f615936b:0x1823ffe0dc461f83!8m2!3d38.9792267!4d-77.0921131">
             Be with Me Playseum
            </a>
            and looky what they have on their website:
            <a href="http://archive.is/6PwQ9">
             http://archive.is/6PwQ9
            </a>
            The bees and the spiral utensils down the page look suspicious. From there you can hop around links to other kid friendly places all over the DC area. Found
            <a href="http://thepopups.com/">
             these performers
            </a>
            , it's archived from 2 years ago but I didn't re-archive it, but also found this youtube video
            <a href="https://youtu.be/nwQ1AwNIIiU?t=2m54s">
             of theirs
            </a>
            which I timestamped, sprials. On their website patches are what look to be
            <a href="http://archive.is/Qg4VP">
             changeling mouths
            </a>
            and another on the
            <a href="http://archive.is/VbEUW">
             chalkboard.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It could be confirmation bias as others have pointed out, but I think it's at least worth checking out.

             I did a google search for  "playseum dc" to start my research and this is what showed up on google
            </p>
            <p>
             Welcome to the Playseum!
playseum.com/
The PLAYSEUM is a place to build good family memories that engage all five ... make homemade pasta (DC location only), toothpaste, whip up a strawberry ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Um...make homeade pasta (D.C. Only)...wth? Prolly nothing but there is something strange going on with Pasta and Pedos. Why the D.C. location only? Sounds weird.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll check out the other info you provided after I dig some on the playseum. Thanks for your contribution!

            This may be nothing, so please don't assume anything, but I did find that the owner of "Wake Up Little Suzie" is a co-founder of the Cleveland Park Business Association. Again, could be nothing, still haven't found anything to suggest she is in PG, so far just seems like a person who really loves her community. Will keep digging.

             I'll look into that too. I also found out the owner of Barstons in Steven Aarons. Trying to find info on him as well. Saw this article about him discussing his toy store and not to my surprise is a pic of him holding a stuffed panda.

              Again, him holding a panda and owning a toy store that sells toys with pedo images on them could still all be coincidental. But still worth researching IMO.

               Yeah, he could just really love pandas, and we all know people who have obsessions can be a bit eccentric and seem weird. Still worth digging just to be sure.

            I appreciate the feedback. I probably should have researched further before posting, but figured others could contribute or maybe have connections and wanted to have this put out sooner than later. But yes, I will do more research and see if anything else comes up.

            Also, I notice the spiral a lot everywhere but I think it may be an occult thing that is similar to a vortex or a number 6. I know the occult types love their spirals and call it sacred geometry but not sure why. One rumor I heard is that it symbolizes a portal they think they open when they do child rape and murder. I believe the thought is they will access power from Satan if they do the ritual consumption of innocent life force through rape torture and cannibalism or drinking blood. That being said I'm not sure every store that carries one of those symbols knows the connection to pedos and Satanists.

            First thing that came to mind with the red / pink tire filled with pandas is the King of Tyre or Satan. Nimrod I believe was the prince of Tyre and Satan is the King of Tyre. I am thinking that the panda might be a reference to little kids with black eyes as seen here:

            I could be off on this but that is what my interpretation is.

              It would be interesting as a gauge/experiment to see if you were to focus on another area, say in Los Angeles or something, and see if you can find anywhere else with the same amount of coincidences, pedo imagry/symbols etc. Just so you can judge how much of this is confirmation bias. Just a thought.

           <p>
            Wake Up Little Susie
The Everly Brothers
Lyrics
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
We've both been sound asleep, wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie's over, it's four o'clock, and we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say â??ooh-la-laâ??
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
I told your mama that you'd be in by ten
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, we gotta go home
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked, our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, well
Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say â??ooh-la-laâ??
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie

               Ah ok. I had seen that before. Definitely disturbing with all this other panda stuff and symbols we see. I thought this was in reference to another comment I had made. But thank you regardless!

                to me the link explains all you need to know... panda = a kid they just beat up, cum panda = getting off on child abuse, or perhaps s&amp;m, or actual cum shots on a beaten child's face

            Yeah, I thought it was odd too that they stress the whole "Unless there is a new baby". But it does look like the Panda she is referring to, actually was part of the zoo,. So that part checks out...but what I found odd was the company name she used for her sketch. "Besta Pizza". Very odd given what we know now. And this pic was from 2010.

            Lmao. Stupid. These symbols are not exclusive to pedophiles. Lots of people use these symbols in art, business logos, etc. You're forcing connections that otherwise wouldn't exist. Too many cucks on voat are focusing on symbols because they're not intelligent enough to do actual research.

             This investigation has serious implications and children are at stake. Didn't think looking for symbols used amongst pedos from local kid stores in an area where there are possible pedos, would be considered "Not Intelligent", especially given whats at stake. I feel at this point, nothing should be left off the table. I respect your opinion though.

              Keep on it. If it is a dead end, some relief. Why would someone shoot down a possible lead? You are not providing proof but something that might merit a bit more attention.

              Your evidence is flimsy and has no backbone. Your "proof" of pedophile symbolism resembles nothing the FBI has released. Its plain garbage to say the least.

            If these guys have control of all these areas. Then is it possible the Smithsonian National Zoo on the same street as comet could have anything to do with it. I went to their site full pandas, but mind you...it is a zoo, so im sure coincidental. But if you go to the very bottom and click on the Panda to "Become a Member"...there is one thing that stands out. Again this could be nothing, but regarding how children are at stake, I think any lead is worth looking into.
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like you can pay your way to be a council member of the smithsonian zoo. You can pay either $2500, $5,000, or $10,000 to be a council member, but what strikes me as odd is that for the low end and middle package it states "The Panda House is not available for the Director Tour" itrs also not available for the $5000 package. You only get "The Giant Panda House" for their top package of $10,000. I'm not from DC, so not sure what this Giant Panda House is. Perhaps this is all legit and no connection, and if so I apologize. Again, since Kids are at stake, I think any leads are worth atleast paying a little attention to.

             The pandas are the most valued of the 'collection' and they have had a LOT of trouble breeding them in past years.  So they want to minimize disturbance and exposure to the pandas and make a lot of money. This is normal.  And it's a zoo.  We'll do animal trafficking next year. :0)

             This is a very interesting reply. Perhaps this needs some more attention. I mean, this sounds like a good place to hide or do whatever you want.

             I remember seeing in another discussion about the Podestas or someone, can't think of where it was but it had a link to the Smithsonian Museum or something like that about it being a bit odd, it was definitely Smithsonian something...If they had pandas in there wouldn't the main priority be to get the place done so they can live there or be happy there? bit odd to always be under construction

             I go to the DC zoo all the time. Pandas were my favorite animal growing up. The Giant Panda House (or area) has always been under construction or closed. It has different hours then the other exibits (not sure if this is listed on the website but there is a daily sign that has them at the actual zoo). I wrote it off as they were just weird about the panadas (I've only ever seen one there, haven't even gotten to see a baby even tho I try).
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the zoo has a ton of coverage, the whole zoo it like that but the panda part, for as much as one would think they would "capitalize" on it, is very hard to find and cannot really be seen from any other pathways due to the heavy foliage.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldn't normally consider all this suspect, except I had a fleeting feeling/thought when I initially saw the panda stuff but didn't think there was enough to give it credit.

               If I had the time I would love too. I have little ones so a trip to cpp is out of the question (even tho I've been wanting to, that's just not some where I would take children). The zoo seems more plausible, will make a post if I'm able to go in the future. I think it's worth looking into, the 10k is throwing me off even for a "posh" zoo.

                I can't blame you for not wanting to bring the kids. Honestly, I feel dirty for just looking at Washington DC via Google Maps, let alone going to a place like Comet Ping Pong.

              I had seen on their site under the members section, where if you pay $10,000, you can be an executive member with access to the "Giant Panda House". Which none of the other memberships include. I just can't imagine why the zoos website would still offer $10k for a section that seems to be always under construction or closed, as you mentioned. But if they do have something going on here that is remotely related to this whole scam, then perhaps that explains why it is has always been under construction or closed to the public. Might be worth looking more into.

            Another user said spirals and hearts are common and we are just seeing confirmation bias. This could be true, which is why we are investigating. If they are innocent it will be easy enough to find out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now, "Wake Up Little Suzie" seems the most suspect to me. Not only because of the spirals, but what she sells is strange. In 2011, this is what her "what we sell" web page looked like. She has since removed these photos from the site:

            That is some odd stuff to sell to a child. I certainly wouldn't give that creepy looking man to a child or a mother-to-be. It could very well be nothing. Definitely dig around and see what you can find.

            So I've been mainly digging in "Wake Up Little Suzie" shop and I don't know if there is enough evidence either way. Lots of dead ends. I found the owner's name and how much her shop makes. The most scandalous thing I found was that she was involved in a Civil II lawsuit back in 2002. All I know is it involved some breach of contract and it was later dismissed. I don't know how to read court jargon. Will keep digging, but so far there isn't enough evidence to suggest she is involved in PG.

            This may be nothing, so please don't assume anything, but I did find that the owner of "Wake Up Little Suzie" is a co-founder of the Cleveland Park Business Association. Again, could be nothing, still haven't found anything to suggest she is in PG, so far just seems like a person who really loves her community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reached a dead end on "Wake Up Little Suzie" and decided to look into another shop. Found something on the owner of "Transcendence, Perfection, and Bliss". She is a disciple of an old perverted cult leader, she was so into this cult that she legally changed her name AND changed her shop name.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            source of her changing her first name and shop name:
            <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/americas-least-likely-ultramarathoner-is-also-one-of-its-best">
             http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/americas-least-likely-ultramarathoner-is-also-one-of-its-best
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Again though, this doesn't mean she into PG. I haven't found anything suggesting she's more than a victim of a cultist scam.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think I'm done digging for now, I've reached a dead end on both of these shop owners.

             Compare what i find in the tiny village McCann disappeared in, which was a pop of 3500 but around 20k in british high tourism season. There have been rumors of pedo rings there specifically and Portugal in general. Freud chose to live whereas the westernmost tip of Europe is nearby among other desirable locales that have more amenities.

             Yep this seems like an attempt to shift focus to an innocent party to discredit us, yes the alefantis panda pictures are weird but that doesn't mean that they all of a sudden aren't a really popular animal.  Also i agree that the spiral is not the boy lover logo it has to be a triangle spiral, this is a 'mistake' ive noticed a few people (shills i mean) make.  For future reference the best indicator of involvement in this mess isnt some doodles on a webpage, its when you find out the person that runs the site has bondage pictures of children on their instagram.

             Sorry about that. Its actually 1220 N Fillmore St, Arlington, VA 22201. But its actually right near D.C. not far at all from where the others are, but not as close as the other stores I mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look up Anglo Dutch Pools and Toys as well. They are at 5460 Westbard Ave, Bethesda, MD 20816. An 8 minute drive from comet, has pedo links also. I commented on that store before I saw your post.

               Ledo Pizza is also suspect. Its logo looks too much like Pedo Pizza, and the building on Georgia Avenue looks too much like a temple (Edit: It's actually a converted Pizza Hut). Casbah Café is almost assuredly owned by the same person. The Yelp reviews of the Georgia Avenue location seem to betray certain things about it:
              </p>
              <p>
               "Avoid at all cost!  Although the first appearance of Ledo's is generally thought to be warm and inviting. It may not be long until you can be assured that the real problems will surface.
              </p>
              <p>
               This Restruant is just short of a disaster.
              </p>
              <p>
               The owner is rude, unprofessional and extremely subordinate in her skills as a business owner. She gets involved in just enough community events to garner support from the neighborhood to stay afloat and keep the business open."

            I think that area from Arlington to Chevy Chase is to pedos what San Francisco was to homosexuals. It's their Mecca and they migrate there.  And when the spiral triangle became too obvious, I could see where they might want to round it out a little bit but the pedophile would still understand the wink.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also true that some business might not know that and they might use a spiral in their advertising just coincidentally  or they might hire someone to do their advertising who puts that stuff in there because they are in the know about pedo-Mecca.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you find the symbols with law firms, travel agencies or realtors, it becomes more interesting and lets us look into what exactly they are selling.

            This looks like confirmation bias, IMO.  Hearts and spirals are common symbols.  Look through enough items, and you are bound to find a few.

             Then offer more than your personal estimation of how frequent they should be. Some kind of statistical analysis is possible. Someone here must be familiar with marketing and graphic design. Kung fu panda films may account for a kid in a panda costume but to me spirals seem a little overwhelming and uncommon in logos and toys.
            </p>
            <p>
             The poster above you is almost certainly closest to the truth in that its a pedo mecca and its entirely possible they include toy stores in their operation and the toys they market serve to both advertise they're friendly and make the symbols appear ubiquitous and benign.

              Those spirals are an outdated style of design popular about 20 years ago.  They are, to me, different from the pedo symbol spirals.  I am not at all alarmed by the collection, including the now removed (no doubt because they were sold) Day of the Dead doll art that is considered Mexican Folk Art and also beloved by Emos, also outdated.  Please leave this lady alone, there is literally nothing to see here and she will be disappointed if all her site hits don't lead to sales.  If I'm wrong you can publicly shame me.

             China is where the pandas live in the wild and someone involved with China would be using it innocently. It's probably their national animal symbol like bald eagle here.

             Is there a way to check if the 404 pandas-site contains a hidden link? It seems like some kind of: click on the third pandas nose in the 2nd row to enter or stuff like that. I'm a technical n00b and mousing over didn't give a result.

              You could always look at the source html and javascript on that page. It depends on your browser as for how to view it. In Chrome you goto the top right and click the three vertical dots-&gt;More Tools-&gt;Developer Tools.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then you can look for links, anything with a http or https or .com,.org,.co etc etc.

               Well I tried but there are about 149 embedded links if I search for https. Also sites like that (

            Stop with spirals !! FBI symbols have triangle shapes. Not every spirals are evil ! I love drawing spirals, am I a pedo ? NO. I dont think that Besta Pizza has something to do with it, they explained on their google information that they didn't know at all for the drawing, and immediately when they found out, they removed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            JA has relationships with Podesta, Clintons, puts a lot of weird pictures, Heavy Breathing and all that shit. But except for the drawing, Besta   is not implicated, or we dont' have anything on them. Well, maye later, we will have evidence that they are, but for the moment, we should stop invading the forums with all spirals we can find in the world.

             Besta Pizza "didn't know at all for the drawing".........I'd like to talk to you about a potentially lucrative Real Estate deal you might be interested in. Well it's not real estate per se rather it's a bridge that connects Manhattan with Brooklyn. It's a license to print money. Would you be interested in hearing more about it?

                Good pun but its not that we don't possess your faculties or consider spirals rare.  The spiral was given as an evolution/alternative to the embedded triangle was it not?  Sifting through and databasing mountains of potentially false leads is part of investigation.

                Ok, just have a look at my other posts, and you will see that I am not a naive, or a shill, or anything you're thinking. Wow look at this : super pedo stuff :

                Well, I stop here, cause i don't want to troll. But I don't think I said something stupid. I'm not the only one on this forum saying that we should stop with spirals. FBI are triangles and hearts. Even the "young boy" is a roundy-triangle.And it's blue.

                 "roundy-triangle".....Those icons are just used for reference. For example the original Besta Pizza logo was like the "Boy Lover" icon but it was red and embedded in a piece of pizza. By your logic you'd dismiss the Besta Pizza logo because it wasn't EXACTLY like the symbol in the FBI doc.

                 "stop with spirals"....But that's the problem. One of the symbols in the FBI document IS A SPIRAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look for the symbol on the bottom of page 1 titled “Little Boy Lover”. It's a spiral

             There are the words We Can at the top of one of the links. Was that not part of some code they were trying to figure?  Some of it was Arabic and it was like wqcn or similar. Could this be linked to that. I think there was also GEw as well if that rings a bell. Maybe someone knows?

               Yes that is it!  They said wvqn means we can. At the top of one of the pages you linked it said We Can like it was their logo or name. Maybe it means something?

                I personally think that it points to an instagram account (
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/wvqn">
                 @wvqn
                </a>
                ). Pasting from another post my thoughts:
               </p>
               <p>
                Another possible meaning for wcqn is that they are using this person (
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/wcqn">
                 @wcqn
                </a>
                ) on instagram as the go-between using direct messaging. That profile is very odd (private now):
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wcqn/">
                 https://www.instagram.com/wcqn/
                </a>
                . It has a huge number of followers and following but only 9 posts. I, with input from another on this forum yesterday, have theorized that this particular account is used for direct messaging (DM) between those who are involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here is what shows as the top result when you google
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/wcqn">

                   We are evidently causing some discomfort.  Well they deserve it.  It is hard to think of all the discomfort they have caused to their victims.  Yes.  They have created victims and they are the criminals.

              Some of this stuff is far fetched, like the spiral symbol being on the clock symbolizing time. However the 404 pandas on the error page are definitely too random and suggestive (like Alefantis' photo of the hundreds of pandas thrown inside the red tire). Also the website being flooded with a shit ton of spirals, also very suggestive. Great digging! Thanks.

               I agree. I did do some hard looking to see if I could find anything. It could lead somewhere, it could not. I'd rather take that risk and someone else find something, rather than omit it and possible lose a piece of info that could have helped lead to something. But of all their thousands of toys they have...and only the few pics on their site...just kinda odd that they choose an item that has a symbol we have been seeing all over the place. In any event, I am simply trying to help out and give out as much info as I can. Not trying to put out bad info by any means.

                It was a general remark, I haven't read OP's post, I merely skimmed it for rule violations. Sorry for implying otherwise. I felt like encouraging OP as, for all I know, the post followed submission guidelines properly, which is a rarity. I don't have time to personally read and fact-check every submission, I do trust the community to point out issues in the logic or the quality of the sources. I only check for the presence of those sources, as well as a couple of other things, and in terms of that, this submission is fine.

                quality from a submission requirements point of view, not necessarily in terms of content.

                 Only measure to take is agreeing upon significance of symbols as was done with eg alefantis name.  For example triangles OK intersecting triangles worse embedded triangles suspect.  This conforms to thr ones ive seen. Otherwise all flagging is arbitrary.
