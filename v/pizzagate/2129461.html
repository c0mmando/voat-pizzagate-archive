<p>This is going to be an unconventional post. I simply ask you to read the cliff notes of my life and see if you can pull meaning from them I feel that me and my fiances families are part of the elites,cabal, whatever you want to call them. </p>
<p>My ancestry is completely unknown to me. I was born to the daughter of an adopted man who committed suicide when my mother was only 9 and my mom died when I was in elementary school</p>
<p>The couple that raised my grandfather also raised his children and his children\'s children ( me and my siblings included). I know next to nothing about the people that raised the past few generations of my family. </p>
<p>What I do know is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They changed their names to a generic last name, originally it was Morse, they are direct descendants of the inventor of morse code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Military past</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Associations with currently living millionaires in the Rock and Roll hall of fame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>live in lower-middle class conditions despite their frequent visits to the estates of their famous friend (talking net worth &gt;100 million)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Famous friends financed my placement into an expensive private religious school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have family that runs multiple churches and owns civil war era property </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My consistent top 5% scores on standardized tests and placement exams ( College reading level in 5th grade )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this private school, I connected with a girl (both in 6th grade) who would continue to be a part of my life for over a decade. Odd circumstances led to us being reunited multiple times.</p>
<p>Her</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mental Disorders resembling MKULTRA ( multiple day - week blackouts with no memory and complete loss of prior personality for duration)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attended 5 hours of school 2 hours of post schooling at separate location and an additional 3 hours of stuff involving electronic devices being placed on the sides of her head ( specific oddities she recalls are the same song being repeated well over 100 times to her through headphones and not being able to remember anything else, this sounds to me like the song was some sort of trigger )    Song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dec9Jb_Ac4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dec9Jb_Ac4</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She attended this 10 hours of schooling every school day for 4 years !!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family holds direct connections and long standing friendships with the founding family of the most ornate Catholic Church in the entire United States ( value over 60 million) and she attended private schooling here (100k a year for elementary school !!!!)  I dont have to tell you guys the Catholic Church is top to bottom an organization that rapes children daily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recalls obvious pedophilic activity at this school such as teachers and coaches making students their computer/phone backgrounds, obvious looks of desire towards students, social media messages which clearly show attempts to go from student - coach relationship to something more. Uncomfortable &quot;sex-ed&quot; style discussions being common place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family founded a large neighborhood of Multi-Million dollar Mansions. She remembers visiting the crown mansion of the private neighborhood (again family built the place) This place is known as THE HUNT CLUB </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She attended multiple Masquerade balls at this mansion from ages 5 - 13 of which she only remembers the owner of the mansion serenading her with Piano and giving her massages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her cousin who lived in the Crown Mansion ( aged 60 - 75)  is currently married to her sister (aged 19 - 21) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She knows of family members convicted of Child Pornography / Molestation  that were still welcomed to family gatherings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple family members with TV shows, big-time accountants, high level religous officials. It seems all of her family is in the high millions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Both of our families have connections to high-level millionaires and famous people, despite this we both were raised in conditions well below what our families were capable of providing for us and for themselves. </p>
<p>Both of our families have connections to high-level religious officials. I believe these could be people in the same organization, cabal as the rapists depicted in the Netflix Documentary &quot;The Keepers&quot;</p>
<p>Her familys extreme wealth and obvious pedophilic and incestual tendencies</p>
<p>I just dont know where to go or what to do with all this, I cant talk about it, I cant do anything  about it, my research has taken me nowhere
so I come to you the best researchers I know of who wouldnt think of me as crazy.</p>
<p>I guess I just would like all your opinions is this real?</p>',

            This is very interesting itmustend.  I would not try counseling or releasing any more information publically at the moment or anything like that if the family has the reach into society like you say.  Personally I would private message

Don't risk your life by posting publically unless she/their advice say.  Hope this helps :)  Keep strong. By Mr.Gunk - THIS is why I believe PizzaGate is real! TRUE STORY! -

            Thank you for being courageous enough to post. If it feels safe and interesting to you, certainly dig, but of course be mindful of your friend's well being if she doesn't care to dig with you. Naturally, be careful. I'm in a similar situation, but on a far smaller scale (no organization or conspiracy, just weird memories and scraps of evidence). I've needed to move slowly, but it doesn't hurt or scare me anymore. Please post what you learn if you are so inclined!

            Do you feel comfortable dropping more specific leads? Maybe someone here can do some digging and find new clues. One thing I would be curious in knowing more about, if possible, would be the 100k a year school. Can you give the name of the school?

            The song video you linked to was posted by Church for Life in Santa Maria, California.

            includes a review of the church by former parishioners who call it a "cult" and have particularly harsh words for a guy named Rob Litzinger:

           <p>
            Litzinger and his wife were pastors of the church.  They have six children, a mix of adopted, foster and natural.  They were forced to leave the church job after some undisclosed "revelations" came to light last year:

            Litzinger also was a comissioner for the Santa Maria Parks and Recreation Dept.:

            Are you crazy? in many cases what is crazy is a sane mind compensating for a difficult situation. so it is very probably that you are crazy. but for the right reasons and you can make decisions to not let your childhood which you could not control dictate how you are going to move forward in the future. As an adult you can make your own decisions and it would be possibly unhelpful to stay crazy even though it may have worked for you as a kid.

            First and foremost, look after yourselves -- your mental health, your emotional wellbeing, your psychological state of mind.  Are you able to get some kind of counselling that will enable you to explore this safely, in a way that preserves your wellness? Perhaps you can dig into the recesses of your mind in a trusting environment.  Get some help with someone you trust.

             I was in Therapy for emotional issues and the Therapist became concerned because I had no memories or only vague fragments of all but the most recent 3 years this was when I was 14.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no recollection of any molestation but I notice certain habits and attractions that generally arise in abuse victims. In addition to pretty graphic sexual experimentation at an age where I should have had no knowledge of such things.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I'd say 95% chance I was but I would need some type of memory regression therapy to confirm this which I could not afford.

               My thoughts entirely.  My sister went through 2 years of psychiatric therapy and had 'memories' that were implied by him. She wrote to me during this time and said, quote: 'sometimes I think this therapist is nuttier than me to be honest!'  Years later it came out he was a fraud and had done the same with many other women too.  - (just a side note, have you noticed 'therapist' is = 'the-rapist' at least they are out in the open about it lol).   Years later my sister said that she believes she was not abused and prostituted out as a child by my parents.  My mom was more protective of us children than anything, she would have died for us if she had too. Sadly my sister was never the same and lived with mental illness until she died at age 55, postmortem said natural causes and we were told she went to sleep and just never woke up!

              You can try hypnosis.  If you were acting out sexually as a young child, you may have been molested. I'm so sorry. Be kind to yourself...you are not to blame.

            Why don't you decide to do a documentary on your and her weird families. See what happens when you start asking questions while taping them. They should be okay with it unless they want to hide something. See if they are willing to do ancestry dna like in the ads on tv.

              It doesn't seem reasonable that a family would kill their kid just for wanting to know more about his background. It sounds like an interesting family and could be a cool story. I would think that they would want to support him. If there is nothing weird going on why would they object?

                I expected that the OP would figure out that if the family responded hostilely to him presenting an innocent project, that he should get the fuck out of there and never go back. It was a suggestion where he could test the waters and ask questions without seeming suspicious.

               Don't be so sure about that. People will go to great lengths to protect the "family image".
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a story in my family of how my great grandfather killed one of his sons for being gay and covered it up by saying it was a "farming accident". Learned about this tidbit of dark family history from a conversation I overheard between my Dad and one of his brothers. They were reminiscing about their father's life growing up on the family farm.
              </p>
              <p>
               This story traumatized me as a then 19 yo closeted gay man. My father went to his grave not knowing the truth about my sexual orientation. I still have family members who don't know I'm gay.

               It's certainly not reasonable, but if these are pizzagaters, they're not reasonable. They brainwash and rape their own children, their number one concern in life is keeping the secret. Obviously there's no problem if nothing weird is going on, but it's incredibly dangerous if there is.
