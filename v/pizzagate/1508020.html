            Welcome to the matrix my friend. You have one foot in the rabbit hole and nothing from this point on will ever be the same. There is more truth in fictional movies than there is in our daily lives. If you keep digging not only pizzagate but other conspiracies you will realize just about all of what you were taught in your entire life was a complete lie.

            This is how i felt when i first started looking inside the rabbit hole. Especially when i started to see super poor covering up of certain false flag events.  The media has been against us for alot long than we thought. Just dont stress out too much. Make sure you spend sometime in the machine enjoying life in between disconnecting and learning more about how it all works.

            To me it feels like Westworld. We are the hosts and we are slowly waking up and starting to remember - soon they will not be able to control us and the secrets will be coming out.

            I know exactly how you mean, it's all quite surreal watching the NWO move pawns as if this were a game of chess infront of our very eyes. From the FakeNews agenda to the False Flag gunman. It's quite surreal being "awake" if you were to see this all pan out, like the Megyn interview it was just so obvious that they were lying. Since ive been red pilled i cant take any of these journalists, politicians etc seriously, I look at them too and think they are all in on it. Being awake feels very enlightened, walking around knowing everything is not as we see and how blissfully unaware the mass are in their own little bubble. We are living in a real world matrix and its fucking crazy

             Might be kinda fruitless, but it would probably make a lot of sense to investigate the known actors of Sandy hook and their backgrounds. Perhaps the types of media they are involved with. Now that we know all this folklore is real life, I'm not opposed to actually looking at the places these people intend to influence.

            Part of that "feeling" you're getting may be due to disassociation and anomie... and if so, then realize that the COVERAGE, and the ADVERTISING, and the MEDIA are all designed to give you  - that exact feeling.
           </p>
           <p>
            As WELL as to be "background support" for the paedos we're investigating here. And then, it all becomes clear. So yeah,
            <strong>
             if you're feeling that way, you're getting it.

            Funny you should mention The Truman Show. Anonymous5 over on 4chan's /pol/ has been saying we need to investigate the "Truman Show" aspects of many of the people in hollywood, who were raised from birth to be in the public view.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anon5 also mentioned that we should be looking into all the child stars that come out of Disney.

            This is so true and exactly how I feel. I am terrified this viral investigation will lose steam. I am holding out hope every day that someone will find actual tangible evidence and set something in motion.

             It's called gaslighting, and it's a very powerful effect. I think most people are feeling this way. It's going to be such a sigh of relief and weight lifted off the shoulders when this stuff goes mainstream.
