<p><em>Friends of the Orphans</em>, the orphanage that gave children to child-trafficker Laura Silsby, had allegedly under-reported a minimum of 100 children after the earthquake. Coincidentally the number matched Laura Silsby\'s documented plan to collect 100 children, further raising suspicions. The manager of the orphanage, Gena Heraty, who would be the first to notice such a discrepancy, received an award from Bill Clinton in 2012. Further, Bill Clinton launched a $10 million fundraiser for Gena, in order to fund a &quot;giant kitchen&quot;. It is important to note that Bill Clinton had connections with this orphanage prior to the earthquake, and that this orphanage was ignored by the police and media covering the Laura Silsby scandal. </p>

<h2>THE $10,000,000 KITCHEN ONLY COSTS $120,000</h2>
<p>According to the plans produced by NPH, the Kenscoff Kitchen project\'s fundraising goal was <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/2sozgt.PNG">originally $120,000</a>. However, Bill Clinton announced Haiti Week in Dublin, allegedly to raise $10 million for the same kitchen. Further, the fundraiser\'s page online reveals only $65,000 raised for a $100,000 goal. The kitchen was <a href="https://archive.fo/wruBy">completed in September 2015</a>, and was funded while reaching only half of the original goal of $120,000. It\'s as clear as day to anyone with a brain that this isn\'t a $10 million kitchen, demonstrating an over-funding $9,880,000 for the same kitchen. Assuming that $10 million was successfully raised, being sponsored by the former president and all, <strong>where did the rest go?</strong></p>

<h2>WHERE DID THE REST GO?</h2>
<p>Of course, there\'s no evidence that $10 million was raised at all. But do we have a reason to suspect? Yes. This is the orphanage that handed children to a <em>known</em> child-trafficker, and what good is a child-trafficking operation without money involved? It\'s within reason to suspect a potential payment channel to be through a fundraiser. Maybe it was paid in cash, or maybe it was <a href="https://archive.fo/nmk2n#selection-1757.0-1757.194">paid directly to her bank account</a>. Were they paid in extra, due to the dirt they have regarding the arrest of Laura Silsby? There are lots of questions to ask.</p>
<p>One point to consider is that Gena was a <a href="https://archive.fo/pL48v#selection-5001.0-5001.280">target of burglars after the fundraiser,</a> showing that the Haitian citizens thought of her as a target loaded with cash. They were unsatisfied with a mere $400 up-front payment in cash, implying they expected her to have more. In fact, <a href="https://archive.fo/pL48v#selection-5009.119-5009.195">the cop said the exact same thing</a>. What could possibly prompt them to think that? </p>
<p>Interestingly, one of them was allegedly an orphan at this orphanage, meaning they just raised a killer. </p>
