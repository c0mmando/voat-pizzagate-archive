            Not promoting false abilities/promises here but if this continues to happen please pm me and I'll help as I can from a digital perspective. Sadly I've dealt with some similar stuff on behalf of or w/others (I think that makes sense? lol).

            Thank you for your courage. You did the right thing by reporting what you saw. Unfortunately, NCMEC seems to be compromised. Wouldn't be surprised if thats how they got your info (through NCMEC employees or their database).

            Im getting strong bad vibes as though were being coerced to fight eachother as humans on the front lines. A flare gun is never illegal. As far as mace, I think it's a felony to mace someone if the cops felt like it, but flare guns are just incidental. Dpuble check that but a girl who's husband was killed in Afghanistan and was working in special forces told me that. She's on a motorcycle trip to heal and and she past by my town. She was also special forces. I have a purple belt in Tao kwon do, but I hate fighting. The goal is stay peaceful, such a challenge, part of that, used to be having access to Twitter and Facebook to shout out, like when this guy was tweeting he has squat team at his door, it was Twitter that saved his life, all his ppl came out on the street  to that cordoned off block and watched and tweeted as well,. But we don't have that we have this. So power up dream force, believe we can and I will see you there. Also, I came up with a good intro :
           </p>
           <p>
            1.)WE  HAVE NOTICED THE MISSING KIDS AND NOW we are busily on our mission to help children, children who are and haVe been suffering, been being cannibalised, raped and portioned up for organ sales, we are on our way, we hear your plaintive cry, we are rushing now to your side. 
2. NOBODY AND NOTHING  SHALL  STOP THIS EFFORT. We don't care who you are what you are saying we are not listening to you anymore. We are not interested in your political agenda your rank your status your money and wealth and power mean nothing to us. It feels and taste and smells like saw dust to us. We dont care what ethnicity you are or your gender, your words fall on our deaf ears. We have no time to talk. Talk to the hand, it records everything you say as well. 
3.WE SHALL OVERTAKE THE CHILD NAPPERS,  We shall overwhelm them with our COLORS, with OUR RAW POWER, think only of freedom and think only of survival and use our minds as a SHARP TOOL. 
Lastly. let this be NOW. thank you I feel you.

             As a petite woman, I like the idea of a flare gun. Is it illegal to carry a flare gun if you are drinking I wouldn't ever carry a firearm while intoxicated.

            Have someone you trust watch him! 
Always let someone in ur inner circle know where U R at all times. Take his pic send it to everyone u know! Setup a draft on ur phone with his pic and any info you have and have it ready to be sent to local police.

             Definitely take his picture if you get the chance, but don't risk your safety over it. Local police should be able to do more with a photograph of the man than sending the photo to any letter agency.

            I got them trying to make fake dating profiles for me RIGHT NOW as in the last hour. On kiwifarms they threatened to go to my mothers house and kill all inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            More info on the kiwifarms pedos:

           <p>
            That's what you can expect from pedo lovers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the email I just sent to the admins of the 3 dating sites they tried to make fake profiles for just today.
These faggot pedos tried to sub me to another dating site to make a fake dating profile to accuse me of paedophilia or something.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm an IT engineer and I have a spamssasssin server ready to go that can report you guys to every email blocklist there is (spamcop,razor,pyzor,dcc etc etc).

            I been busy investigating paedophile cults today not joining your dating site or any other for that matter. Are the pedophiles trying to make a fake dating profile for me I never used like the deep state did for assange to put on MSNBC news?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do me a favor. Please dump all the IP address related information / metadata entered by the cunts pretending to me - or using my email address and send that to me please. One SQL query only takes a few seconds for you guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the IP address of previous emails we traced to a subnet of 2048 addresses in the gay district of Paddington NSW Australia I find out who it is and link it to the pedophilia normalization stalker Garry Richard Burns who gets judges in case law to rule those who rape infants must be respected. This actually happened - they came after my family and found my dad guilty of the crime of not loving sex with babies. Here his radio interview here on it:
