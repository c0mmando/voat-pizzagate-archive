<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqb59n69Z80">This</a> YouTube video will sufficiently illustrate how ridiculous these baseless, old claims propagated by Anonymous truly are.  This interview is with the prosecuting attorney, Bradley Edwards, leading the case after the arrest and prior to Epstein &quot;killing himself&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question from reporter: Our current President has had relationships with Epstein in the past and there are those, Katy Johnson and maybe other victims who’ve accused Trump of being involved in things like this.</p>
<p>In my experience, Trump supporters will not listen to anything along those lines.  Obviously we’re not in the court of law here right now, but are those claims, although that case was dropped, it was dropped before it went to court.  In your opinion as a lawyer, in your experience is there anything you can say as to the validity of those claims and whether there will be anything more about that?</p>
<p>Edwards: Nothing at all.  The only thing that I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who, in 2009 when I served a lot of subpoenas on a lot of people, or at least gave notice to some pretty connected people, that I want to talk to them, is the only person who picked up the phone and said, let’s just talk.  I’ll give you as much time as you want.  I’ll tell you what you need to know, and was very helpful, in the information that he gave, and gave no indication whatsoever that he was involved in anything untoward whatsoever, but had good information.  That checked out and that helped us and we didn’t have to take a deposition of him in 2009.</p>
<p>Reporter:  Do you have any information on James Patterson’s claims that Trump had Epstein kicked out of Mar-a-logo?</p>
<p>Edwards: I definitely have heard that. I definitely have heard that and I don’t know if it was Trump himself as opposed to a manager...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real affiliates of Epstein are the Clintons, how many times did Bill have extended stays at his estates?  It is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Needless to say a parent showing affection for their children is within social norms, and the pictures of Trump and Ivanka commonly shared recently are not incest, propagating that conspiracy theory is clearly baseless slander and defamation.</p>

            I have never seen a man touching his daughter like Trump did with Ivanka. No decent man would do that, and no decent man would say 'sex' when asked what he and his daughter had in common.

            I don't know whether Trump has abused Ivanka, but the way he touches her and talks about her is not normal - it's a transgression.

           <p>
            It's disgusting that you are defending him.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            NB that he never mentioned the story when he was asked about his friendship with Epstein after he had fired Acosta. And we all know how he loves to brag, don't we. If he had done it, he would have mentioned it. He just said that they had fallen apart at some point.
           </p>
           <p>
            And somehow you missed that Edwards asked Trump directly whether he did that, when he was writing his new book.
           </p>
           <p>
            So did he say 'Yes! Of course, I did!' No. Edwards writes that Trump 'paused', and then he said 'well, sort of'.
           </p>
           <p>
            'Well, sort of' is not really an emphatic confirmation, don't you think.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real reason they fell apart seems to have been a real estate deal - both intended to buy the same property in Palm Beach, and Trump got it in the end.
           </p>
           <p>
            He only cooperated with LE after Epstein was arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            NB that there were photos of nude female children in Epstein's hallway in Palm Beach, where Trump would go to visit Epstein. He knew years before they fell apart what Epstein did, and never said anything.

             As far as I can tell Epstein was only arrested once, July 2019, all the other times he swindled his way out of actually being arrested.
             <br/>
             How do you mistake LE's words in the interview?  If anyone was well informed about the various cases against Epstein, it was him. Clearly saying Trump's information checked out and was helpful.  Your allegations are littered with baseless presuppositions, he did say something, he actually helped the attorney (aka The Police) with their investigations in the mid 2000's.  The information "checked out and that helped".  Mind you his arrest in 2019 was for his actions in the early 2000's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you point to any other 'famous' or connected people whom in the mid 2000's helped LE?
            </p>
            <p>
             Probably not, as LE said Trump “is the only person” who assisted in 09’.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clearly in the OP has the transcription of the portion in the interview you somehow neglect, it reads;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Edwards: Nothing at all. The only thing that I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who, in 2009 when I served a lot of subpoenas on a lot of people, or at least gave notice to some pretty connected people, that I want to talk to them, is the only person who picked up the phone and said, let’s just talk. I’ll give you as much time as you want. I’ll tell you what you need to know, and was very helpful, in the information that he gave, and gave no indication whatsoever that he was involved in anything untoward whatsoever, but had good information. That checked out and that helped us and we didn’t have to take a deposition of him in 2009.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             FYI: its deadly to speak up, Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself.

              My point is that Trump knew way before Epstein was charged the first time what Epstein did. He was his friend nevertheless.

               What evidence is there to project they were friends or were they just acquaintances?  Compare Bill Clinton's time spent with Epstein to Trumps? How many times did BC fly on Lolita Express?   Is there anything to indicate that Trump was ever with Epstein in a group of less than 5? less than 10?  They are both very rich people in Florida, they would have to have known each other, seen at the same parties.  That doesn't mean they went to each others parties, which they didn’t.  It is most likely Trump bought out that property because he didn't want a pedo moving in next door? Given the sale was in 2004 he must have know prior to that, I can’t find a picture with the two of them that after 2000, and really there are only a few times they interacted.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you could buy the 'house across the block' to prevent the pedo Epstein from moving in next door would you?
               <br/>
               You are right he, and many others knew he was a creepy guy.   Trump made clear actions against Epstein in 2004 and “helped” in the prosecution in 2008.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe one of the lamestream journalists will ask Trump and he will lay it out for us? Maybe all the evidence will be unsealed someday and a more substantive resolve may be had.

                LOL. Trump threw a party for Prince Andrew which Epstein and Maxwell visited. There are photos. And Trupmp denies he ever met Prince Andrew, which shows he is clearly lying about his pedo connections.

                Epstein is on video attending another of party Trump gave, where they are discussing the women on the dance floor.

                Epstein didn't want to move in himself, and the house wasn't 'next door' to Trump's properties.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Is there anything to indicate that Trump was ever with Epstein in a group of less than 5? less than 10?
                </p>

               <p>
                Of course there is. Steve Hoffenberg, who ran a PAC for Trump in 2016, spending 15 million bucks of his own money, said in a video interview that he and Epstein used to hang out with Trump constantly when they - he and Epstein - had rented a whole floor of Trump Towers.
               </p>
               <p>
                And one of the Epstein victims saw him late in the evening at Epstein's office in NYC.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Trump made clear actions against Epstein in 2004
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The cp in Epstein's hallway was already there in 1995. Trump and Epstein socialized from the late 1980s.
               </p>

                 Compare Bill Clinton's time spent with Epstein to Trumps?

               <p>
                Whataboutism. We don't talk about Bill Clinton here.
