This is why the advertising around picframes is so creepy. Because they can build picture frames around s moving video displayed with LED hence also, all the LED ads are suspicious, type in xxx photo and you get LED tube ads takes a minute to figure it out, I pointed out in the first post about the LED trapeze being just completely strange to me and that something is wrong, ccoming from an advertising perspective here. </p>

            alibaba is a place for people to source manufacturers and suppliers for wholesale purchases.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'd probably have a better time narrowing your search to actual sellers/suppliers/whatever you'd like to call them than the website as a whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to say it's impossible that alibaba is involved, but it'd be the equivalent of saying YouTube is responsible for ElsaGate

             I was just pointing this stuff out cause I know about Google cleaning it's search engine up and then I saw the Amazon bust for cp I didn't read much on it just went back to the Alibaba site bc it was already bothering me. There's no better time, if you  wanna try to buy something from these I'm basically showing you where that's done, but no way am I even going reaching out to them. Have you looked at the images I posted, can you offer an explanation other than that what's for sale is child porn in regard the descriptive text on every image I posted not to mention those discriptions had to do with children. (?) Ie sexy children girl photo.

              I have bought things off these websites, there's plenty of regular sellers that appear to be legit for all intents and purposes. I'm not about to reach out to one selling an xxx picture frame though, that's for sure lol. I understand what you're saying, it truly looks like there's nefarious happenings going on right under our noses through alibaba.com... I absolutely believe that to most likely be true.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm saying is focus on the individual sellers with these bogus listings, not "alibaba.com" as a whole. Alibaba.com is similar to Amazon and eBay in the fact that anyone can sign up to be a seller and be listed on that site.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you're completely on to something but I don't want you to waste all of your time trying to crack some alibaba code when if you focus on the individual sellers you're bound to build a solid case and be able to expand off of it.

               Yeah, kinda freaked yesterday, haven't really seen the aftermath probably  just a bunch  deleted posting attempts. I found something bizarre.  I tried over and over to post got turned down. Couldn't figure why so I tried to post it to the top voat peice in comments...deleted. That was shocking. "Sensitive Content"  finally realized we arent ( I think this is it (?)) Supposed to utter the words E##a#ate, or It gets deleted. I even dreamed about, bc I couldn't post it to conspiracy either. 
Here's what I found - A whole gibberish language in the Google search engine just like E gate  messages people were finding. I don't know if you know people found e gate  to have coded messages. I did a big post on this. I thought E gate had got shut down off youtube. I geuss i was wrong. I had seen that within an E gate pic a person found a string of letters he put it into quipquip, and it said WHO FINDS WHAT THE FINDERS HIDE? on a black and whit pic of a man  with a baby. So when i read about them finding the gibberish in E gate comments as well, I looked into Google search engine and eventually with quipquip, I made a phrase!!! It's out there shit.  I have screen shots of all of it. Can't post it, don't get it.
              </p>
              <p>
               About the Alibaba thing, I wish i had a better computer to make fake buys or something like that, I'd love to set up a sting operation, but I don't have that together. My brother talked about getting me a laptop soon oh yeah.
